Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited First Quarter
2014 earnings call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening
remarks and introductions I would like to turn the conference to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice
President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.

Beth Farrell

{BIO 19732216 <GO>}

Thank you, Augusta. Good morning. Welcome to Everest Re Group's 2014 earnings
conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the Company's President
and Chief Executive Officer, John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer and Craig
Howie, our Chief Financial Officer.
Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include
extensive disclosures and with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I
note that statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature, such
as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to
various risks.

As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations.
Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection
with those statements. Now let me turn the call over to Dom.

FINAL

Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Thanks, Beth. Good morning to all. We are pleased to report another excellent quarter,
which continues to improve on the trends from last year. The attritional combined ratio for
First Quarter improved to 80.4% from 81% for the full year of 2013.
Premium volume continues to grow, rising 7% over last year. Despite softening in the
property cat market, there is still sufficient opportunities for profitable growth for Everest,
given our scale and financial strength. John will get into further details in his report but, as
evidenced by the improving combined ratio, the growth has come with improving
margins, which is partly the result of new products, particularly in the credit and specialty
lines space.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the property reinsurance lines, where there have been rate reductions, we continue to
modify our portfolio to achieve the best risk-adjusted return. For example, in Canada,
where rates were going up for property catastrophe exposed lines, we committed more
capacity.
Likewise, in other territories we reduced or moved to different layers or moved to pro
rata from excess. Or we wrote different types of product. Of course, we did renew
accounts at reduced rates but only when they met our return hurdles. And in most regions
there is still business at attractive rates. I must emphasize that the ability to diversify and
remain flexible is the key to improving margins.
An additional tool that has enabled us to improve our net position is our capital market
platform, Mt. Logan. This has enabled us to increase our share across many programs and
bring new products to market while at the same time earn fees and profit share on the
business sourced.
A key value of our global franchise is being able to marry the risk appetite of the capital
markets with a global, well-diversified source of business, constructed by best in class
underwriting and analytical skills. There are not many that can duplicate this value
proposition.
You also, no doubt, saw that we recently came to market for a cat bond placement. This is
another capital market vehicle allowing us to leverage our underwriting ability and
marketing reach across a larger capital base. This transformation of our business, at least
for now, is about capital management.
Capital is now available in many forms, and while this can cause us to reshape our capital
structure, one thing is constant, developing business, underwriting that business,
producing contracts, and paying claims. These additional forms of capital provide more

FINAL

options for managing our equity base and funding growth. We are flexible and adaptive to
change that can add value to customers and shareholders.
You have also heard us speak about our insurance operation as another source of
business that can be a diversifying risk. For these reasons we have continued to increase
our emphasis in building this business out further while remaining focused on improving
results. In the First Quarter results, we are clearly seeing the early signs of progress with a
98.2% combined ratio.
At the same time we have already expanded into new products and territories and,
excluding crop insurance, which was down in the quarter, our insurance book grew 10% in
the First Quarter. Craig will explain the adjustment in crop premiums for the First Quarter.
Our crop business remains an important part of our strategy, but will face some
downward pressure on the premium side in part because of the decline in commodity
prices from last year.
Nevertheless, the plan is to grow our footprint, as diversification is key to developing and
managing a profitable book in this sector. As we move forward, the significance of
emphasizing underwriting profitability in all segments takes on even greater importance
as investment income continues to come under pressure.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the low rate environment, and in a business where asset allocation is closely followed
by rating agencies, there are limited options. We were an early adopter of different asset
allocation strategies, which has kept our returns amongst the best in the sector. However,
given constraints we are not expecting dramatic changes from here.
Nevertheless, we will continue to be active but prudent in terms of allocation. Despite
these head winds, whether it is a tough rate environment, third party capital or declining
investment income, we had another terrific quarter with net income of almost $300
million and return on capital of 17%, and would expect this to continue through the
remainder of the year absent any significant events.
With these results and our focus on managing capital, we were pleased to be able to
return to shareholders $285 million in the First Quarter through share repurchase and
dividends. This is a record for us in any one quarter.
We are committed to returning capital consistent with the needs of the business. Thank
you. And now to Craig for the financial highlights.

Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Thank you, Dom. Good morning, everyone. We are a pleased to report that Everest had
another strong quarter of earnings, with after tax operating income of $281 million or
$5.93 per diluted common share for the First Quarter of 2014.

Page 3 of 25



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2014-04-24

This compares to operating income of $301 million or $5.88 per share for the First Quarter
of 2013. Net income for the First Quarter was $294 million or $6.21 per diluted share
compared to $384 million or $7.50 per share in 2013.

FINAL

Net income includes realized capital gains and represents an annualized return on equity
of over 17%. These results were driven by a solid underwriting result, offset by lower net
investment income compared to the First Quarter of 2013.
The results reflect the continued improvement in the overall current year attritional
combined ratio of 80.4%, down from 80.7% at the First Quarter of 2013, and down from
81.0% at year end 2013. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, reinstatement
premiums and prior period loss development.
The total reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 77.3% compared to 76.8% in the prior
year First Quarter. The slight increase in this ratio for the reinsurance portfolio was
anticipated after the January 1 renewals and with the additional pro rata business written.

Bloomberg Transcript

The insurance segment attritional combined ratio was 97.2% compared to 98.5% in the
prior year. However, eliminating the effects of the primary crop book, this ratio would have
been 92.8% compared to 95.9% in the prior year.
All segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter. Neither this year nor last year
included any catastrophe losses in the First Quarter. Total reinsurance reported an
underwriting gain of $215 million for the quarter compared to a $210 million underwriting
gain last year.
The insurance segment reported an underwriting gain of $4 million for the quarter
compared to an underwriting gain of $193,000 last year. Each year reflected an
underwriting loss for crop insurance in the First Quarter due to the seasonality of crop
premium.
Earned premium for crop insurance declined $17 million in the First Quarter of 2014
compared to last year. The estimated premium was adjusted to reflect the lower than
expected premium for the winter crop season due to the reunderwriting of the book and
commodity price reductions year over year.
Based on current prices we expect the crop premium to decline for the full year of 2014
as well compared to 2013. Mount Logan Re's financial position and operating results were
consolidated into Everest beginning July 1, 2013. These results were included in a
separate segment and reflected a $10 million underwriting gain in the First Quarter of
2014.
Everest retained $2 million of income and $8 million was attributable to the non-controlling
interests of this entity. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $228 million for the
quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $210 million in the same period last year.

Page 4 of 25



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td

Date: 2014-04-24

Our reported combined ratio was 80.0% for the quarter compared to 80.7% in 2013. Our
low expense ratio of 4.4% continues to be a major competitive advantage.

FINAL

On reserves, our overall quarterly internal reserving metrics remain favorable. For
investments pre-tax investment income was $123 million for the quarter on our $16.8 billion
investment portfolio. Investment income declined $23 million from one year ago.
This decrease was primarily driven by the decline in the limited partnership result for the
quarter, although low reinvestment rates and capital used to redeem stock and debt also
contributed. Limited partnership investments resulted in a loss of $2 million for the quarter
compared to a $17 million gain in the First Quarter of 2013.
Our existing limited partnership portfolio is fairly mature and we're starting to see a
decline in current gains coming from these investments. Despite the declining rates our
investment portfolio continues to perform well.

Bloomberg Transcript

The pre tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.1% with a duration of just over three years.
The quarter reflected $13 million of net after tax realized capital gains compared to $83
million last year. These gains are mainly attributable to fair value adjustments on the
equity portfolio. There were $2 million of derivative losses during the First Quarter
compared to $15 million of derivative gains last year.
This is related to our equity put options and is a function of the change in interest rates
during the First Quarter. On income taxes, the 13.8% effective tax rate on operating
income, is in line with our expected tax rate for the year. Stable cash flow continues with
operating cash flows of $367 million for the quarter compared to $259 million in 2013.
This is despite the high level of catastrophe loss payments over the past few years.
Shareholders equity for the group was $7 billion at the end of the First Quarter, up $69
million from year end 2013. This is after taking into account capital returned through the
$250 million share buy backs and the $35 million dividends paid in the First Quarter of
2014.
Book value per share increased 4% to $152.80 from $146.57 at year end 2013. Our strong
capital position leaves us with capacity to maximize our business opportunities as well as
continue share repurchases. Thank you. And now John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting
Officer, will provide the operations review.

John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Thank you, Craig. Good morning. As Dom highlighted we had a strong start to the 2014
year. Our group First Quarter 2014 gross written premium was $1.3 billion, up $90 million
from Q1 of last year, with growth coming predominantly from US reinsurance and
international reinsurance.

Page 5 of 25



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2014-04-24

For our reinsurance segments, total reinsurance gross written premium, including Logan,
was $1.04 billion for the quarter, up 12% from Q1 last year.

FINAL

As mentioned on the last earnings call, we continue to benefit from a flight to quality,
rolling out new products, expanding our relationships with some larger clients and writing
US property exposures domestically as we leverage the competitive advantage of our
high ratings and significant capacity.
We have continued to make progress in our multi line initiative in the USA, developing new
relationships and broadening existing relationships with multi line clients, as underwriters'
relationships with those clients go back for many years, sometimes decades.
In Q1 we also deployed capacity on several short tail quota share treaties at terms we
found attractive, expanded our Purple writings, and continued to deploy capacity this
quarter in credit-related opportunities. Total reinsurance, including Logan, bottom line we
had a very solid quarter with underwriting profits of $225 million, up 7% compared to last
year Q1 underwriting profits.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now some color on April 1 insurance renewals. For our overall reinsurance book we grew
our global property gross written premium and continued to see dollar margin expansion
in the overall book at 4/1 compared to last year with the combined ratio and the expected
risk adjusted returns remaining flat from the prior period.
This demonstrates the strength and the diversification of our business. That said,
specifically for Japan, our premium dollars in Japan were down from last year due to the
following reasons: the continued consolidation trend among our long-standing clients,
resulting in merged reinsurance treaties and, in some cases, less pro rata premium;
Japanese exchange rates caused a decrease in gross written premium in US dollars; and
rate decreases on Japanese excess of loss treaties of 10% to 15%.
Turning to our overall casualty reinsurance book globally, while primary rates remain
attractive, ceding commissions on casualty quota share treaties are still under pressure.
Therefore, we remain cautious of deploying capacity on risks which appear to have heavy
competition. Nonetheless, we continue to find new insurance and reinsurance products
and new deals where we can and will deploy our capacity at attractive risk-adjusted rates.
Through the First Quarter and at 4/1, we continue to roll out and utilize Mt. Logan Re and
saw these benefits at each renewal, as it allowed us to deploy larger lines on attractively
priced treaties and provide more capacity to targeted clients while containing our PMLs.
We are pleased to report that with additional capital raised at 4/1, Logan is now in excess
of $400 million in AUM. And, again, 100% of the Logan capacity is fully deployed.
This success continues to highlight the significant value proposition we bring to our capital
market investor partners in Logan while being completely seamless to our clients, who
Page 6 of 25



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2014-04-24

continue to deal with the same core reinsurance trading partner, Everest, as they have for
many years.

FINAL

This smooth, flexible deployment of capacity to our clients has helped us secure better
signings on many non-cat exposed classes, as more of our clients look to have broader
and deeper relationships with fewer, high quality reinsurers. In addition to Logan, we have
initiated other PMLs and capital management strategies.
As Dom mentioned we recently obtained $450 million of fully collateralized catastrophe
reinsurance coverage funded in the cat bond markets. This coverage was purchased
through Kilimanjaro Re across two layers.
One layer is in an occurrence based deal providing tail protection for southeastern USA
wind risk, and another layer is an aggregate cover providing tail protection for all natural
perils in the US and Puerto Rico as well as British Columbia earthquake risk in Canada.
The combination of Logan, cat bonds and other reinsurance and retrocessional protection
from both traditional and alternative markets allows us to match our portfolio of risks to
the best capital structure. This, in turn, allows us to broaden our product offerings and our
value proposition both to our clients and to our shareholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

With this flexibility on how and where we deploy our underwriting capacity, combined with
flexibility of the form of our capital structure to manage those same risks, we believe we
can and will continue to improve our risk adjusted returns and improve our cost of capital.
In the end we are pleased with our Q1 reinsurance results and continue to nimbly identify,
execute and deploy capital to profitable opportunities across the global reinsurance
market.
Turning to our insurance operations, our premium was $230 million in Q1 down from last
year's Q1 gross written premium of $250 million.
However, this decrease is primarily driven by premium adjustments for Heartland's crop
book for the reasons which Craig mentioned. Stripping out Heartland premium, our
insurance operations GWP is up 10% year-over-year for Q1 with most other insurance
segments showing growth, reflecting the impact of the initiatives we have put in place
over the last couple of years.
We continue to see profitable growth opportunities in many areas, and we have been
successful growing in those areas that we have targeted, including non-program workers
comp, casualty, specialty lines, property E&S and DIC, non-standard auto, and accident
and health.
We continue to see primary rate improvements in almost all insurance segments.
However, we have seen some weakening in some of the professional insurance lines
where we remain cautious in our deployment of capacity.

FINAL

Our California workers comp book saw an average of 8% rate increases in the First
Quarter, continuing the significant rate increases for the last several years, providing a
compound rate increase in excess of 60% over the last five years.
We continue to see profitable growth and positive rate increases in our property E&S and
DIC books and see that footprint expanding throughout the rest of 2014, as primary rates
have been holding across this book. Bottom line, our reported insurance results were
positive with a 98% combined ratio for the First Quarter.
And after eliminating the effects of Heartland, the combined ratio was 94%, down two
points when viewing Q1 2013 on a comparable basis. We are pleased with the underlying
trends in our insurance book as we begin to see the positive results of our initiatives over
the last several years, with noted improvements in both loss ratios and expense ratios.
In summary, around the globe we are viewed not only as a lead re-insurer in all P&C lines
of business but also as a creative problem solver, and we continue to be given the
opportunity, with our broker partners, to structure new deals, new products, and
alternative solutions for many of our corporate and insurance clients.
Thus, we remain very bullish on our future. Thank you. And now back to Beth for Q and A.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator
Instructions] Our first question will come from Jay Gelb of Barclays.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thank you. The insurance segment, with the 94 combined ratio in the First Quarter, would
you anticipate -- is that the right run rate we should anticipate for the rest of the year,
barring any unusual items?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Jay, this is Dom. That certainly would be a reasonable assumption. It could improve from
there, due to continued improvement in California comp -- but that's a reasonable
assumption.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Including the crop book? Would it be a couple of points higher all in?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

FINAL

The crop book, actually for the year, we're still anticipating, at this point, mid 90's
combined. So it's a low 90's combined, depending on the outcome of winter wheat. But,
generally, we're expecting the overall number to gravitate towards the mid 90's on an
accident year basis.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

The next issue is on partnership income. Craig, I think you mentioned that we're -- part of
the decline was reflecting in the book seasoning. So just trying to get a perspective on the
remaining quarters, maybe what we should be penciling in terms of partnership returns.

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Well, as I said, we're starting to see a slight decline because they're becoming fairly
mature. But as you noticed even over the last several quarters it has started to come
down. This quarter we happen to have one partnership that threw off a loss of over $5
million, which is what was driving the $2 million loss in the quarter. But it has been coming
down over the last several quarters.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Right, so in the back half of last year when it was running in that $5 million --

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

$5 million per quarter. I think that's probably a better estimate, Jay.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. Then Dom, do you have any thoughts or commentary on the recent
movement we see in Bermuda between Endurance and Aspen? Does that change your
view at all on M&A in Bermuda or are you anticipating any increase in consolidation
beyond that transaction?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, I didn't expect that question right out of the gate but I think -- first of all let me just
say it certainly would be inappropriate for me to comment on the transaction per se. And I
know that's not what you're asking about.
But, clearly, I think that as we've been discussing in some of our opening comments, we
have benefited , for example, by our scale and our strength in the marketplace and our
capital position. And I think, in part, this transaction or transactions like this are, in fact, an
attempt to achieve a different level of scale in the marketplace.
So it doesn't surprise me, not particularly this transaction, but that we would see
transactions like this bubble up in the marketplace for that reason. I really -- the other
reasons I really wouldn't be in a position to comment on but I do think that's, in part,
what's driving this particular idea, and perhaps ideas like this in the future.

FINAL

Our next question will come from Vinay Misquith of Evercore.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. So first just a numbers question. Curious how much was the crop
insurance negative adjustment. I believe you mentioned $17 million. So was that for the
[inaudible] premiums? So was the adjustment $17 million or was the premiums down $17
million?

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

The earned premium was down $17 million. The net premium that was written is down $30
million for the quarter.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

I'm sorry. And what was the impact of just the adjustment? Was that the entire $30
million? Sorry.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Down $15 million.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. So down $15 million. Okay, fine. Second is we've seen that Citizens has up sized its
cat bonds significantly. What do you think is going to happen on the renewals for Florida?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, certainly, there's downward pressure in the overall property cat space, depending
on the territory. And given the -- how well that market is still priced we certainly would
expect that pressure to carry over into Florida. In terms of a prediction as to how much,
well, we'll just have to wait and see. We're not prognosticating at this point.
But for us, we write, on at XOL basis, about $130 million in Florida, and then the remainder
of our exposure is on a pro rata basis.
As we said, again, in our opening comments, if rates are down but still meet our return
hurdles, yes, we may do some -- continue in XOL but it'd more likely be that perhaps we
would shift some of our capacity to quota share. And, again, it depends on what the
market is willing to give us come this June.

Q - Vinay Misquith

Okay, that's helpful. Just one last numbers question. I believe that [technical difficulty] tax
rate is 13.8%? Did I hear that correctly? That you expect -- and I believe you mentioned
that you expect that for the entire year. Historically I thought it was between 12% and 13%.
Curious why you expect a higher tax rate for this year. Thanks.

FINAL

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

13.8% is an effective tax rate that we would expect for the year. That rate could go even
go up from there, as we've talked about in the past, specifically on the last quarter call,
that if there are no catastrophes for the year, that rate could go up. That's with an
expected amount of catastrophes for the year.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Our next question --

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Keep in mind. Keep -- excuse me, one other point. Keep in mind that, in your
assumptions, that rate does have to move with cat losses. You can't take the rate up
without taking cat -- expected cat losses down.

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Correct.

Operator
Thank you. We'll go next to Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thanks. Would it just -- I know we -- it sounds like we got some pieces for a crop. But
would it be possible just to get 1 Q premium for crop and then the combined ratio for
crop for the First Quarter?

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

1Q premium for crop was minus 15 million for gross written premium.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

And -- I'm sorry, your second question was?

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

The earned -- the earned premium or -- the earned premium that rolled into revenues.

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

FINAL

The earned premium that you would see in the First Quarter for crop is only about $2
million.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay, got it. Great. Thanks. And then a question about the California comp book. Can you
talk about the -- so the rate you took in -- remind us what the rate you took in 2013, and
where the loss trend was there and where you're booking comp today on an action year,
on initial type basis?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

I'll let Craig give you the last year information. But right now for California comp, on an
accident year basis, we're in the mid 90's.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

On accident year combined?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. Got it. Great.

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

I don't know if Craig is looking for some of the information.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then if I could just ask one more. So in Bermuda is it possible to know,
and I realize it's a blended book and probably there's some -- there's some composition
change to it but is it possible to get an idea of what the year-over-year change in pricing a
rate was in that book?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

You're talking about --

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Roughly.

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

What, property cat?

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

FINAL

Well, just a --

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Bermuda is a mixture of property and casualty so it's a little tough to answer that
question.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Let me get to the basis of my question then. So the part that I'm trying to understand is
the attritional loss ratio was flat-ish year over year, and it's been down on a year-over-year
basis over the last few quarters.
I'm just trying to understand just given, generally, that there's been some pressure on
reinsurance pricing, how does that factor in? Because if it were just typical primary
insurance or something very simple, you have reductions in pricing that would cause your
combined ratio to rise.

Bloomberg Transcript

But it seems like we've absorbed, as a market, some declines in pricing but that attritional
ratio has been flat. I'm guessing there's some mix change in there or something. I'm just
trying to reconcile that.

It's exactly that. It's mix change. We They can move in and out of retro business.
Depending on what we do out of London and some of those transactions, it's essentially
mix change which is driving it.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

So is it fair to assume, then, if all else is equal, if you have this environment and you have
mix change, which allows you to keep your attritional flat, does that mean that you're
taking more risk per unit of premium that you're collecting?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, keep in mind that on a gross written basis Bermuda was down year over year.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Yes.

FINAL

And I think it's a reflection of, when you say a mix change, what we said in our opening
comments we'd like to emphasize over and over that we have the capacity, the
willingness and the ability to actually change our mix, and move from one class of
business to another, one layer to another, always trying to achieve the best risk adjusted
return.
So that's really what we're striving to do. And at times you will see a segment, like
Bermuda, for example, perhaps slip in premium because we're backing away from certain
classes of business that aren't giving us the right return.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

If we're in an environment where -- if there continues to be -- if there continues to be
challenges in the reinsurance part of it, is it possible to just keep that attritional loss ratio
flat even with pressure? Just -- or are there some limitations of mix that will cause, at
some point, that attritional loss ratio to start to rise?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

There's always those, those -- that potential. And it all depends on how fast and how far
rate decreases are, and what we back away from in terms of business that doesn't meet
our return hurdle. So, yes, if you want to continue to write the same book of business year
in and year out, yes, attritionals will -- will rise.
On the other hand if you move into different -- new products, different geographies,
change attachment point, use the capital markets, potentially -- there are lots of ways in
which we can maintain our profitability throughout a difficult -- what you're describing as a
difficult market.

We'll go next to Amit Kumar of Macquarie.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. Just a few quick follow-up questions. First of all going back to the
Florida piece, you mentioned that your XOL premium is $130 million. Is the remainder $17
million or so or did I -- am I thinking of the total Florida book wrong?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Our Florida pro rata premium is -- it would be --

A - John Doucette

It would be another couple hundred million dollars.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Okay.

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

FINAL

Or in total -- sorry, in total it would be about $280 million, roughly. That's XOL and pro
rata.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. That's helpful. The follow up to that point is I think last year you had talked about
getting preferential signings, you had talked about private layers, the [inaudible] deals.
Are you seeing that phenomenon for Everest this year, too, or is it much different?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

I'll let John answer that.

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Yes. This is John, Amit. Yes, we are. We're seeing that opportunity. In some cases private
layers. In some cases, clearly, at 1/1 and 4/1 preferential signings.

Bloomberg Transcript

But also new products. There are new layers, new products with -- with existing clients and
new clients. And that answers the prior question about attritional losses as well.
It's our job to figure out how to make money no matter what market we face. And, yes,
we are seeing the opportunities where we're one of the biggest broker markets in the
world. And we are getting better and better signings from brokers and clients working
with the brokers.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

And then when you mention new clients, are these the smaller new take-out entities?
Who exactly are these new clients?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

We're not talking just Florida here. We're talking across our entire portfolio globally. So it's
new clients globally. It's an expansion of existing clients across the world.

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Specifically in Florida, Amit, we have relationships with almost 40 companies, and we see
every deal that comes into the market, and we have been trading with many of those
clients for many, many years. And we do have relationships that are not broadly marketed.

Got it. That's quite helpful. Another question that is I think is a follow up to Mike's question
on California comp. Did you see any changes in loss cost trends over the past quarter?

FINAL

There has been, obviously, a lot of debate, a lot of reports that have come out on the
impact of SB 863. And it seems that that impact varies from the companies present in the
marketplace. Did you see any changes in your book or has it been a steady state from
2013?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

We have not yet seen any changes. I'm not saying they're not out there, but we've
maintained -- and actually we didn't answer Mike's question earlier about loss cost trend.
We build loss cost trend into our reserve projections.
And that's typically, depending on classes, in the mid to high-single digit range. So that's
built into our reserve assumptions. And so far that has been sufficient, clearly, in the most
recent accident years. The reserve development we saw in the Fourth Quarter of last year
was primarily older years.

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

And the answer to Mike's question was the rate increase for 2013 was 13%. And we were
running in the 96% range last year on an accident-year basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. Final question --

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

So just to follow up on that, you can see that the, well, the ratio -- the combined ratio has
not improved to the level of rate increases, which means that we're taking some of that,
obviously, into loss cost trend. Probably more than is necessary at this point but
conservative.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

That's good. The final question. Probably a follow up to Jay's initial question. As you look
at your growth prospects, you have Purple, you have Mt. Logan, you've talked about
different new products. And I'm curious, as you look out how do you look at organic
growth versus outside opportunities to add to the portfolio?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

What's the distinction that you're making between organic growth and outside
opportunities?

Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td

What I'm trying to ask is, based on all the changes that we have seen recently, is it fair to
say that, probably, you don't need to look at other entities at this juncture?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

FINAL

Ah. Okay. I'm sorry. For right now we do not need to do that. And, in fact, a growth
strategy, at least for us, would never be built on an acquisition.
It doesn't mean that we don't look at many things because, as you can well imagine,
everyone calls us when there is a potential deal out there. But we do not build our growth
strategy off of an acquisition.
We prefer, frankly, to build from within. So we don't have to deal with legacy issues,
integration issues and, nine times out of ten, there's limited strategic value to many of the
opportunities that we see.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. That did answer my question. Thanks. Thanks for the answers, and good luck for
the future.

Our next question will come from Meyer Shields of KBW.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. Dom, you talked earlier about the tendency of ceding commissions to go up now.
Is that trend varying by the size of the cedents? Was that different now than it was five or
ten years ago?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

That was John that spoke to that. And I don't know that [inaudible] seeing anything
differently by size of the customer.
But, certainly, it can be influenced by the size of the transaction, given that there might be
some that are hungrier for premium. That would be the only comment I would make
about that.

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}
Page 17 of 25



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2014-04-24

And, obviously, this is John, it, obviously, is also reflective of the client's individual
experience. So a lot of cases that are -- whatever class of business they're in, if there's
been bad results we see ceding commissions going down.

FINAL

If there's been catastrophes [inaudible], including pro rata deals, ceding commissions go
down. So, really, it's both the macro and the micro situations that drives these.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And very briefly, is there a good proxy we can use for
limited partnerships?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, in the past we have guided people to just the general equity markets, and I think we
probably still would say that that is as good a proxy as you can get. And I think it points to
what Craig mentioned earlier in response to another question, that limited partnerships
were quite strong last year. But that's kind of in line with the general equity markets were
strong last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

And, conversely, the equity markets in the First Quarter of this year were not quite as
strong, they were flat-ish. And I think that's consistent with our limited partnership
experience except for the one -- in our particular case, there was one LP which was
distorting, I think, what we would otherwise normally have expected for the quarter.
And that -- we would not expect that going forward. So I would say that the best proxy
you can use is the general equity market -- public equity market.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Fantastic. Thank you, very much.

Our next question will come from Brian Meredith of UBS.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes, a couple of quick questions. The first one, and my apologies that I missed it, but in
the insurance segment, operating expenses were down about 13% year-over-year. Was
there something unusual that happened there?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Just good stewards on the incentive package. No, in part it's premium growth. And,
frankly that's most of it. And maybe some internal allocations but nothing dramatic other
than premium growth.

Page 18 of 25



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2014-04-24

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

[inaudible] but the actual expenses were down 13%year-over-year. The allocation.

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

FINAL

That would be driven by allocation. Are you including commissions in that?

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

No.

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

That would just be allocations, then.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. And then, Dom and John, I wonder if you can just update -- or not update
but remind us what your thoughts are on Watford Re and then there are a bunch of other
companies that are looking into these potential type of facilities.
What interest level would Everest have in potentially doing something like that, and what
do you think the potential impact is on the casualty and return markets?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, yes, to answer one of your questions, is that we are looking at that, as I think
probably most of our peer [inaudible] are doing. We haven't yet determined where we're
going with -- we have not yet concluded on that analysis yet.
And generally it'd certainly cause one to think that it could soften the casualty reinsurance
market further from where it is now. On the other hand, the types of transactions that are
likely to go into these types and into these facilities are not generally -- they're generally
already tend to be lower margin type business, lower volatility associated with the class of
business that fit these structures.
And so it may not have as dramatic an impact as has been prognosticated by many on the
overall [casualty] markets. That remains to be seen. I'm not sure that any of us really know
for sure where that all ends up, but it is something we're looking at.
And, in fact, it can create interesting opportunities for ceding companies, frankly, that -- to
help [inaudible] their cost to capital on a transaction. And may, in fact, create [ph]
opportunities into the reinsurance market space that don't exist today. Where the casualty
space [inaudible] a lot of companies are holding on, are ceding less business, increasing
nets.
Some of these ideas can, in fact, create transactions that can help their PML or balance
sheets, and perhaps a reinsurer can add value and then see premium go up in this space.
Page 19 of 25

There's a lot of -- there's a lot of possibilities that can come out of these structures. But

We'll go next to Ian Gutterman of BAM.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. A few different questions on different parts of your cat book. Just to
follow up on the Florida question from earlier. Obviously, we see rate pressure on XOL,
which was mentioned.
You talked about your quota share book. Can you talk -- I assume that the upward
pressure on ceding commissions is quota share, too. Is that fair? Can you give us sense of
how you think about that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Again, there are many, many, many moving parts to it. There's the current [summit],
ceding commissions. To the extent -- we saw this phenomenon last year -- to the extent
that there was -- to the extent that the reinsurance buy was down from some of our
clients resulted in more attractive combined ratios, including ceding commissions to the
reinsurers.
So we -- as we talked about on the last couple of call, we wrote more pro rata business
last June. We also wrote more pro rata business at 1/1. We wrote another $50 million, $55
million of property pro rata at 1/1 . And, again, the -- across our book, the combined ratio,
globally, improved.

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

And I wouldn't expect that the same dynamics that are effecting the XOL market from the
introduction of third party capital to have as dramatic an impact on the pro rata market.
That, I think, is what you're getting at.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Yes, exactly. Okay. Great. And then as a follow up to that on the XOL side. Given the talk
on how much rates will fall this year, do you feel like we're approaching the bottom? Are
we near people's walk away price? Or if there is another no-loss year and there is still
abundant capacity next year, can Florida rates go down another double digits or are we
getting close to the walk away point?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}
Page 20 of 25



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2014-04-24

I don't know the answer to that question. Certainly, if it were to go down to your question,
again this year and again next year it certainly would be getting very, very close to our
walk away point.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay.

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

[inaudible] But, again, remember that it doesn't mean that we don't participate in that
market through our platform. If capital markets are willing to come down to those levels
then we have the capacity that we can deploy in that fashion, move, again, to more pro
rata.
And so we could still stay very, very active in the marketplace and move to other products,
move to different attachment points. Perhaps write the business and use the capital
markets as a reinsurer. So there are many ways in which this can play out to our benefit,
frankly, going forward.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Got it. That actually leads into the next question on the cat bond -- I was just confused and
maybe this was just nomenclature or something that I don't quite follow. But your PML for
U.S. wind is at, I think, $1.2 billion at the one in one hundred.
The cat bond on the index referenced had a $1.4 billion to a $2.1 billion index loss that
equated to a one in forty five to a one in close to one hundred. So on the occurrence is
what I'm, obviously, talking so that it could be comparable.
I was curious why in an index loss at the one in one hundred is $2.1 billion when your PML
one in one hundred is $1.2 billion. Are they not comparable for some reason?

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Yes. This is John. Basically, that's -- the Kilimanjaro cat bond, the mechanics of that really
reflects -- it's basically is taking for the occurrence one is southeast states, and it basically
is taking industry loss events because it's a PCS trigger, it's taking industry loss events and
then there's, effectively, market shares buy each of those states.
And so it's taking a very big loss and then scaling it down -- or a range of big losses and
then scaling it down for the market share. So those are -- the short answer is those are
two different things. Our PMLs and how the mechanics of the bond responds.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Okay. That's [inaudible]. That's what I was trying to get at. And then --

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

I think, I think -- Ian, the bottom line is the -- that purchase of that bond did reduce our
PMLs at one in one hundred --

FINAL

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

That [inaudible]. Basically the $2.1 billion equates to your $1.2 billion, is that the right way to
think about it?

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

It's not -- the $1.2 billion is one point on the curve.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Okay.

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

The reinsurance repurchased through the special purpose vehicle, Kilimanjaro, that then
issues the cat bond is not one point on the curve. It's across the distribution.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, got it. Okay. And then just real quick on Mt. Logan, I was -- the $36 million of gross
premium, just knowing the capital deployed is a little over a 10% [rate] [inaudible]. My
math is correct? Is that right? $36 million over $300 something?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

But remember the $400 million -- be careful, though. The $400 million that we cited as
now assets under management, that's a recent number.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Right. I was using, I think, it was $320 million earlier in the year maybe?

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

There's also an accounting recognition of the premium. Over 2014 we would expect it to
be higher and more ceded premium in each of the quarters, going forward, against that
capital base.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Okay. What I was getting at is I thought normally for [inaudible] collateralized you need
closer to a 20% rate aligned to make the math work. Is that generally accurate?

I think we're trying to build the most [inaudible] that is maybe different and better than
what is out there, and I think the fact that we've been able to go from zero to $400
million in a relatively short amount of time highlights that we may have a better mouse
trap than others who are out there.

FINAL

A - Dom Addesso

low.

We'll go next to Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, thank you for taking my call. And I have two questions. One is on the
capital structure. Another one on reserves.
On the capital structure you have one of -- the least, lowest debt to capital ratio at 7%.
And now you have a third party capital, Mt. Logan, and the cat bonds. What do you think
about your [inaudible] base of [inaudible]. Could you buy back more than you earned like
you did this quarter that actually [inaudible] reducing your shareholder base?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, we tend to want to think about share repurchases within the context of earnings.
That's generally been our approach. And what we're trying to do with our capital and Mt.
Logan and use of cat bonds and other types of third party capital structures, is grow the
business.
This is a growth strategy not one in which we're trying to shrink the business. As we've
mentioned earlier we think that our size capital position, rating, global franchise and the
ability to grow is what perpetuates the good earnings we've been able to produce and
[inaudible] is able to produce.
So in all of that context it really means that it's to our advantage in the marketplace, to the
extent that opportunities present themselves, to grow our capital base. And when I say
grow our capital base that means in all the vehicles that we've mentioned, meaning our
own equity capital, Mt. Logan, use of cat bond structures and other vehicles.
But in the context of our equity capital it is important to us to be the size that we're at. So
we think about share repurchases in the context of earnings.

Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

So with 100% earnings ratio a -- the assumption?

FINAL

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well that depends on the price of our stock. It depends on what opportunities present
themselves. It depends on a lot of things. And we don't give prognostications about what
level of shares we're going to be repurchasing. But I just saw we did, obviously, have $250
million this quarter was a pretty good number for us.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. My -- turning to my second question on reserves. And your reserve development
has been minimal throughout the past few years and each quarter, actually.
But if you'll look underneath you have some -- these large reserve charges and the
insurance operation while you have larger reserve releases on your -- from your
reinsurance operation. They tend to coincide in the Fourth Quarter. I just wonder are those
just coincidental that you do big reserves, like a study [ph] at year end?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then, following on that and that going forward, as you see the past reserve issues in
your insurance book gradually -- well, hopefully, were diminishing, you said, Dom, since
you joined Everest you've been focusing on the -- on the reserve side studying [ph]
probably more prudent with -- setting more cushions in your reserve. Is that possible we
will see these efforts actually playing out in favor of the development in the future?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Yes. I -- hopefully the reserve practices that we've been adopting over the last couple of
years, I think, will hold us in good stead, but I will point out that our reserves even prior to
me getting here, in many years, developed favorably.
We do our reserve studies mainly around the year end. We do some of the smaller
classes of business throughout the year, but the larger, more material lines we focus on
that in the Fourth Quarter.
Certainly if we see anything coming out of the smaller lines of business during the year
we will take some action, certainly like we did here in the First Quarter with the insurance
on the medical mal side.
But insurance has been more of an issue than reinsurance because many of the lines of
business we were in were run off lines of business, and those typically many in the
business tend to be more problematic than in an ongoing book. And also our insurance
lines of business tend to be -- on an overall basis -- tend to be in the longer tail areas than
in the reinsurance side.

Page 24 of 25

Well, thank you very much, and thanks for your questions. We would like to just say, in
summary, that, clearly, we think we had a great quarter in what some would describe as a
challenging environment.
We happen to think that the challenges create opportunities for a company like Everest,
