MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the SCOR Group Quarter Three 2017
Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. There will be an opportunity to
ask questions after the presentation. In order to give all participants a chance to ask
questions, we kindly ask you to limit the number of questions to two.
At this time, I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Ian Kelly, Head of Investor
Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Ian Kelly

{BIO 19976646 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to the SCOR Group third quarter 2017 results
call. May I please ask you to consider the disclaimer on page 2 of the presentation, which

indicates that the financial results for the third quarter 2017 included within this
presentation are unaudited.

FINAL

With this, I would like to give the floor to Mr. Denis Kessler, Chairman and CEO of SCOR,
who is joined on the call by the COMEX team. Denis?

Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thank you, Ian, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, which, as you know,
marked by a high frequency of large natural catastrophes, SCOR clearly demonstrates its
resilience and shock-absorbing capacity. Indeed, it is a policy of the group to anticipate
these risks and to absorb them within the framework of the group's risk appetite.

Bloomberg Transcript

We do these through different means. First, through clearly defining our risk tolerances
and regularly checking our exposure against them. Second, through maintaining a strict
underwriting discipline under a controlled risk appetite. Third, through maintaining a high
diversification of risks across both business lines and geographies and, on this point, as
you know, we have the best diversification in this industry. And fourth, through maintaining
a robust capital shield, and in this quarter, we're seeing clearly the strength and
effectiveness of our retro program come into play.
Therefore, SCOR's core principles are instrumental to the group's shock-absorbing
capacity and is a protection of the group's solvency. So, it is no surprise to us that the
group successfully absorbs a series of major shocks, and it is no surprise to us that
subsequently, our solvency at the end of the quarter is in the upper half of the optimal
range.
Major catastrophes have punctuated history. We still have in mind the destructive
hurricanes in North and Central America in 2005, we have in mind the major earthquake
which hit Chile in 2010, and of course, the Japan Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, as well
as the flood in Thailand, which occurred in 2011.
Here, on this graph, we have the history of these shocks into our balance sheet in the last
11 years, including financial and sovereign debt crisis, political uncertainties, and of course,
natural catastrophes. As human beings, we can only deplore these shocks, of course. But
as reinsurers, our duty is to anticipate and to absorb these events. As this graph
demonstrates, the group has not only successfully anticipated and absorbed these
shocks, but it has also grown through them by more than tripling its shareholders' equity
and successfully taking its credit rating to best-in-class across this period.
Let's move to slide 5. In anticipation of large events such as the natural catastrophes
which we faced recently, we have done our job by maintaining a strictly controlled risk
appetite on the one hand, and a robust and effective capital shield on the other hand. As
you know, SCOR maintains an upper mid-level risk appetite, our U.S. P&C book is growing
but it's still underweight, and we are less exposed and are pleased (04:06) to extreme
U.S. cats.

FINAL

We maintain a biometric risk focus on the Life portfolio and we are conservative asset
management policy. Overall, this brings an optimized risk composition with superior
divested cash and benefits. Regarding the capital shield, no surprises either. At SCOR,
we've been a strategic retro buyer for the last 15 years, and we always have a business
continuity with all our retrocessionaires. Being well protected in case of shocks is an
integral part of our capital shield strategy. And surprisingly, retrocession program is worth
exactly as we expected it to.
Furthermore, the capital shield remains in place and effective for the remainder of the
year. We have not breached the upper limits, we have not even used reinstatements. In
fact, we still have ample unused capacity, which would fully protect the group in case of
further material events in the fourth quarter. The ILS Atlas (05:11) instruments have not
been triggered by these events, and the probability of a €300 million Contingent Capital
facility to be triggered in 2017 is extremely remote.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's move to slide 6. We see on this slide that we did a job correctly. What does it mean?
First, you know that to anticipate shocks, we have a system of limits in place against which
we continuously check risk exposures to ensure we remain consistent with the risk
appetite. As you can see from the numbers, the actual losses of the 2017 hurricane events
are still considerably below those associated with a 1-in-200-year scenario for a North
Atlantic hurricane. But had they been of such an extreme magnitude, our solvency ratio
would still have been within the optimal solvency range.
Second, as a consequence to SCOR's core principles in terms underwriting discipline,
controlled risk appetite and robust capital shield, and as a testimony to the group's shockabsorbing capacity, SCOR's solvency position remains very strong despite the Q3 nat cat
shocks. It stands at 213% at the end of Q3 2017, in the upper half of the 185%-220%
optimal solvency range as we said it would. So for us, everything has worked as it should.
Let's go now to the following slide. In the light of the estimated industry losses – insured
industry loss from the Q3 nat cat events, we believe with a strong conviction that
conditions are set for a significant price correction beyond the U.S. market alone and
beyond the cat plan of business alone. We are, at SCOR, structurally well-positioned to
benefit from a change in the P&C environment. We are well positioned, we think, for a
change in the industry dynamic for several reasons.
First, we're an excellent franchise with expertise globally, but in particular in the U.S., being
underweight in this country with a potential to grow faster than the market. Second, in
addition to being underweight, clients and potential clients have less reinsurance
recoverables with us and we bring a very strong credit ratings to the table. As you know,
we were graded less than two months ago by AM Best just before Monte Carlo, and this
rating is key for the U.S. market. SCOR's teams will ensure a smooth and swift claims
payment. We started to do so while continuing to stay alongside cost (08:06) clients to
face future challenges and to find the right solutions in this new market environment.
Let's go to page 8. I describe the anticipation and absorption of the Q3 events and the
effectiveness of maintaining a controlled risk appetite and a robust and efficient capital

FINAL

shield. I describe how as a result the group has maintained in the upper half of the optimal
solvency range and is now structurally well-placed to capture profitable growth in a
changing P&C environments.
Consequently, as everything has been working as it should, do not expect major changes
going forward. SCOR confirms the consistency of its strategy and the strength of its
technical underwriting fundamentals as it is paramount that we continue to run the group
in a manner that secures our Tier 1 credit rating.
The group will, therefore, continue to execute its strategic plan, Vision in Action, with no
change in risk appetite, no change in underwriting policy, no change in capital shield policy.
All the same, all the components of our capital management policy remains unchanged.
We continue to manage the solvency of the group in the upper half of the optimal range.
Our dividend policy remains unchanged. The €200 million share buyback program is
maintained. And as we stated in the last Investor Day in September, the share purchase
has restarted with the program running until mid-2019.
And finally, the merger of the three SE legal entities is absolutely on track. We expect it to
be completed by early 2019 with a potential solvency benefit of up to €200 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

SCOR continues with the successful execution of Vision in Action as planned. Both
profitability target and our solvency target are unchanged. All the same, the P&C and Life
technical assumptions remain unchanged, so does the assumption of the return on
invested assets.
All the teams at SCOR remain mobilized to deliver the ambitious development plan set in
Vision in Action. And let me now hand over to Mark for the financial details. Mark, the floor
is yours.

Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Thank you, Denis, and good morning, everyone. So, let's begin on slide 10, and I will walk
you through the financial highlights of the Q3 results. SCOR wrote more than €11.1 billion of
gross written premiums in 2017, representing a 9.3% increase over 2016 at constant
exchange rates or 8.9% at current exchange rates.
This top line growth was fueled by the strong contribution of both business engines:
SCOR Global P&C, with a 10% growth at constant exchange rates; and SCOR Global Life,
with an 8.7% rise at constant exchange rates. The P&C net combined ratio for the first
nine months of the year stands at 107.5%, with a 16.8% nat cat ratio. The normalized net
combined ratio, however, stands at 95%, indicating that the attritional loss ratio was in line
with the assumption made for the Vision in Action plan.
The Life technical margin reached 7.1%, slightly above the Vision in Action assumption. And
finally, SCOR Global Investments delivered a good return on invested assets of 2.6%.
François will confirm later on that we are in line with the 2.7% to 3.2% range indicated for
the full-year 2017.

FINAL

As previously communicated during the quarter, our set of results has been impacted by
an exceptional series of large losses from natural catastrophes. SCOR's net income for
Q3 2017 year-to-date stands at €25 million. And I will come back later on to the net
income and return on equity to give you some color.
Let's move to page 11 and I'd like to walk you through that normalization of our net income
and return on equity. As of Q3 year-to-date, you'll have noticed that the group had a
reported return on equity of 0.5%. Excluding exceptional items, such as the Ogden rate
change, the Q1 reserve release and the Q3 severe nat cat losses and reflecting a 6%
budgeted cat loss ratio, the annualized return on equity would stand at 8.3% in the first
nine months of 2017 or 765 basis points above the risk-free rate, indicating we were on
track to reach our target return on equity this year.
Moving to page 13. Shareholders' equity decreased over the first nine months to €6
billion. The reduction comes primarily from the €447 million currency translation
adjustment reduction, which is due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar in the first nine
months of the year, and from the €308 million dividend payment in the second quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net income, of course, has been affected by the nat cat events and this translates into a
book value per share of just under €32 at the end of September. As a consequence of
the reduced equity, our financial leverage stands at 26.3%, temporarily above our Vision in
Action assumption of up to 25%. And we fully expect this to come back within our range
as net income is earned in future quarters.
So, let's move on to page 14. We're in line with our expectations, and SCOR generated
strong operating cash flows of €671 million, slightly above the €200 million per quarter run
rate that we had always indicated. The SCOR Global Life cash flow has shown some
catch-ups since Q1 2017 and is starting to normalize as expected.
On SCOR Global P&C side, cash flows continue to be strong and in line with expectations.
As a reminder, in Q3 2016, SCOR Global P&C benefited from an approximately €300
million one-time funds withheld receipt, thus explaining the variance versus the previous
year. The total liquidity of the group stood at €1.6 billion at September 30 with the
rebalancing of the investment assets having started during the third quarter, in line with
the Vision in Action plan.
Let me now hand over to Victor, who will give you more details on the P&C results.

Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Thank you, Mark, and good morning. This quarter has been marked by the recent nat cat
activity. This isn't the first time we've been confronted with the occurrence of devastative
nat cat events. Each time it happens, the industry's response and our own response
creates mixed feelings. There is, on one side, satisfaction and pride in terms of
contributing to the mitigation, the repairs and the recovery, but there is also frustration
and regret regarding the difficulties involved in overcoming the challenges of the
protection gap.

FINAL

These exceptional series of events is no exception when it comes to the frustration and
the regret, but we are all fully committed and working very hard to ensure that once
again, the reinsurance industry proves itself and its added value.
We've already communicated on the impact of these nat cats on the quarter on a year-todate basis for the insurance and reinsurance markets and for us. Whilst these series of
losses, which occurred in Q3 and to which the wildfires in California must be added as a
Q4 event, remains within the shock-absorbing capabilities of the reinsurance market, our
view is that its impact on the annual earnings of insurers, U.S. principally, and reinsurers
can't be without consequences.
In addition, most probably all the participants in the chain, whether they'd be insurers,
reinsurers, retrocessionaires or composites, have now done as-if scenarios and realized
and analyzed how much worse the situation could have been if Irma had continued to go
east and if the insured losses from Irma alone had reached, say, $125 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

Conclusions from this analysis have already been drawn by some players and more are
due to come, both from them and from others. As far as we are concerned, this event
have not led us to change our view of the nat cat risk we carry.
For us, taking out this impact, the results of this quarter show a growth rate and an
attritional plus commission ratio that are totally in line with our assumptions and latest
indications, namely, of an annual growth in the upper part of the 7% to 8% range and a
normalized net combined ratio at or slightly below 95%. The growth remains largely
driven by the expansion of our footprint in the U.S. market as indicated in Vision in Action
and during our last Investor Day on September 6.
Whilst the information about these events continues to flow in at a slow pace from the
affected (17:33) and large corporations, the estimate show a consensus around a total
initial loss that matches the $95 billion, on which we've partly based our estimates and on
which we have already communicated. Similarly, the market reactions are now trending
towards the point of view that we have developed since Monte Carlo, i.e. a general
acknowledgment that these events have been a catalyst and that they are leading to a
wide reassessment of the business and of the growth and net risk by all the actors in the
risk transfer chain covering most geographies and line of business.
It's quite significant that the discussions in the U.S. market have not stayed confined within
the boundaries of property cat and property lines of business, but have quickly spread
into casualty and financial lines. And it's also a general acknowledgment that such a
reassessment cannot not drive changes in underwriting and pricing up to six consecutive
years of gradual deterioration in the terms and conditions of insurance and reinsurance
and the erosion of margins.
The next phase following these reassessments will be seen through the 2018 renewals
likely through expanded vertical and lateral reinsurance protections being purchased and
through tightened reinsurance terms and conditions being quoted. Our expectations are

FINAL

that the offer will be there but at revised prices and with more differentiation between the
buyers being applied by the providers and that demand will increase.
The main takeaway from these events can be summarized in the following points. From a
market perspective, assuming that about 60% of the total insured losses from Harvey,
Irma and Maria will be bound (19:20) by reinsurers and capital market capacities, primary
leasehold collateralized reinsurance, the total reinsured loss represent about threequarters of the $80 billion annual reinsurance premium generated by the U.S. market
insurers all line combined.
It represents about twice the $30 billion annual U.S. cat and non-cat property ceded
premium, and nearly five times the $13 billion cat ceded premium. Considering that the
U.S. market generate half of the all reinsurance premium worldwide and that reinsurance
is a global business, these exceptional series of events puts a heavy load on the
combined ratios of the industry, but that load will not be evenly distributed.
For SCOR, based on our estimate of the total insured and reinsured market losses, our
gross loss of $1.18 billion is in line with our current U.S. market share of about 2%. And our
net of retrocession loss of €598 million pre-tax is in line with our risk appetite.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our retrocession program has responded as expected and offloaded about 40% of the
gross loss from our P&L. By the way, if we head out (20:40) to face the same series of
events with Irma being a $125 billion insurance industry event, there would only have been
a marginal difference on the total net loss of the group.
For the rest of the year, our underwriting capabilities are unaffected and we continue to
be adequately protected by our retrocession program without having had to go to the
market to buy replacement or additional covers. For next year and the remaining period
of Vision in Action, there is no change in our plan. We are progressing normally in the
renewal of our retrocession program, and have it started the process very early as we
usually do, we are already well advanced. We are confident in our ability to satisfactorily
complete the renewal of the renewable parts of the program.
As we highlighted it in our Investor Day, which took place on the 6th of September, We
believe that we are very well-positioned to benefit from the new market environment,
and the effect of the series of exceptional events should be beneficial to us, and is likely
to enable us to accelerate the deployment of our planned business development,
particularly in the U.S. While our claims teams are actively engaged in supporting our
clients, our underwriting and pricing teams are ready to provide lead quotes, and are
already busy working on the renewals that are brought early to the market.
I will now hand over to Paolo for the presentation of the Life division results.

Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Thank you, Victor. SCOR Global Life continues to deliver a robust performance in the first
nine months of 2017, both in terms of growth and profitability. Overall, we have recorded
Page 7 of 29

Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2017-10-26

FINAL

gross written premiums of €6.5 billion, representing an increase of 8.7% at both current
and constant exchange rate. The strong growth is driven in particular by the continued
development of our Life and Health franchise in Asia Pacific, where we have grown
premiums by over 30%, with both protection and financial solutions showing a strong
pipeline of opportunities. This is combined with a continued healthy pipeline of new
business coming from EMEA and the Americas, and spread across all product lines.
For the full year, we expect the growth of 6.5% to 7.5% at constant FX compared to 2016,
and slightly ahead of the Vision in Action growth assumptions. The technical performance
for the first nine months of the year remained strong with a technical margin of 7.1%,
slightly above the Vision in Action assumption. The profitability of new business continues
to meet the group ROE target. I want to note that the U.S. mortality claim experience has
been higher than expected. The overall technical result of the division is not impacted, as
it continues to benefit from an active in-force management and the strong reserve
position set up at the acquisition of the Transamerica Re and Generali U.S. portfolios.
Overall, we confirm the Vision in Action assumption of 6.8% to 7%.
I will now hand over to François for more details in our investment strategy.

François de Varenne

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Pablo. SCOR's total investment portfolio reached €26.6 billion at the end of
September, with an invested asset portfolio of €18.4 billion compared to €19.2 billion at
the end of 2016. This evolution reflects primarily the weakening of the U.S. dollar against
the euro since the beginning of the year.
In the third quarter of 2017, SCOR Global Investments resumed the rebalancing of the
investment portfolio toward Vision in Action asset allocation after a pause in Q2. In that
context, our liquidity continues to be progressively reduced at 8% compared to 9% at the
end of the second quarter.
Our exposure to corporate bonds increases by 3 points to reach 43% of the invested
assets, very close to the level achieved at the end of March 2017. This rebalancing was
achieved by reducing exposure to government bonds, which represents only 22% of the
investment portfolio today.
Our fixed income portfolio remains of very high quality with an average rating of A+. Its
duration increases slightly to 4.6 years compared to 4.5 years at the end of the previous
quarter. At the end of September, expected financial cash flows from the fixed income
portfolio over the next 24 months stand at €5.6 billion.
SCOR Global Investments delivered a 2.6% return on invested assets in the first nine
months of 2017. Restated from natural catastrophes impacting our ILS portfolio in the third
quarter, the normalized return on invested assets in the first nine months of 2017 would
reach 2.7%.

Page 8 of 29

We benefit from a good reinvestment rate of 2.6% at the end of September which enable
the dynamic management of our reinvest policy. At market condition permits, the
rebalancing of the investment portfolio towards Vision in Action asset allocation will be
continued during the next quarter. We confirm a 2.7% to 3.2% estimated range for the fullyear of 2017 for the return on invested assets according to current market condition.

With this, I will hand it over to Ian Kelly for the conclusion of the presentation.

Thank you, François. On page 18, you will find the next scheduled events starting in early
February with the SCOR Global P&C January renewals. The precise date will be confirmed
shortly. This will be followed by the full-year 2017 results on the 22nd of February. You will
find as well the conferences which we are planning to attend for the remainder of 2017
and early 2018.
So with this, we can start the Q&A session and a quick reminder to keep to two questions
each. Thank you.

Thank you. And we will now take our first question from Guilhem Horvath of BNP Paribas.
Please go ahead.
(27:25-27:43)
Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open. And we'll now take our next question from
Nadine van der Meulen. Please go ahead.

Q - Nadine van der Meulen

{BIO 15200446 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. On the portfolio rebalancing, you
resumed that. What do you expect the impact would be set at a full-year – sort of a full
year between 2.7% and 3.2% return on invested assets and where in that range do you
expect to be? And also, on the cash, do you still expect to bring that down towards a full
5% as you guided previously? And the realized gains were quite a bit lower this quarter,
can you talk about the drivers and what your expectation there is going forward?

A - François de Varenne
Thank you very much for your question. So, I confirm that we have good market condition
today. So, we will pursue the rebalancing of the portfolio between now and the end of the
year according to the Vision in Action asset allocation, so which means as a consequence,
a reduction of the cash.

FINAL

For the expected return on invested assets for the full year, I think we will be in the upper
part or at the top of the range. This will be supported by the ongoing rebalancing of the
portfolio. Just an illustration, we've invested €500 million during Q3 on corporate loans
and we were able to lock a book yield of 3.2% on this portfolio, so which is well above the
income yield of the portfolio. So, we should see this benefit in Q4.
In terms of realized gain, that's something I mentioned in July, reiterated during the
Investor Day. We are in the process of selling immature (29:45) and large real estate
assets in Paris and I hope this should be done by the end of the year.

Q - Nadine van der Meulen

{BIO 15200446 <GO>}

Thank you. Just one follow-up question on the life reinsurance side. You experienced
higher claims for U.S. mortality. Should we expect more negative impact from U.S.
mortality going forward? That's it from my side. Thank you very much.

A - Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

I think it's difficult to say. We believe a large amount of what we're seeing right now is
volatility. So, we'll update you as we go. We believe we have a very strong reserve
position and we have a very active in-force management program to be able to offset
additional volatility coming our way.

Thank you. We will now take our next question from Guilhem Horvath of BNP Paribas.
Please go ahead.

Hello. Can you hear me?

Yes.

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 18460437 <GO>}

Okay. So, the first one is just coming back on the U.S. mortality, so it's a question for Paolo.
I'd like to understand, so because you say on the slide that it is an underlying U.S. mortality
kind of experience. So, you implied that the word the underlying. And now, you say it's
volatility. So, I'd like to understand what's underlying and what's short-term volatility in this
trend?
And also you speak about a large reserve and also in-force management. Can you
elaborate a little bit more on how long can this reserve be there to sustain IFRS

profitability going forward. Thank you.
And the second would be for Victor and you spoke about the renewal of your
retrocession program and how confident you are. Still even if you didn't see the (31:56) of
this program, you had a little bit of contribution from retrocession there. So, how do you
expect the prices to evolve into renewals in this program and what would be the
conditions for you not to renew the entire retro strategy going forward as it is today?
Thank you.

A - Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Yeah, this is Paolo. I really meant underlying in the sense that if we would've never told
you, you wouldn't have seen it coming through the technical result. So, maybe I used the
wrong word there but I used underlying, meaning as the numbers rollout, there was
underlying movements on U.S. mortality.
In terms of how long we'll have the reserves there, I think we're very well-reserved given
the very good purchase price that we had upfront in those acquisitions. So, I don't see
that going away too quickly.

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 18460437 <GO>}

Victor?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, Guilhem, as you know, our retro policy has been extremely stable for years. And
people who are participating to our retro program have gone through for most of them;
Katrina, Harvey, (33:11) and Irma they went through 2011. They see the behavior of the
company in its buying of reinsurance year-after-year. So, as I said, we start very early. We
are among the very, very first ones in the market every year.
I mean, generally in Monte Carlo, we already are into the negotiation of our retro
program, and this year was no different. So, this is why I said we are well-advanced. Well,
we are having sensible discussions. I mean, don't forget that our retro is largely
proportional and our proportional are very diversified, so that's another element, so yeah.
When I say I'm confident, I'm confident because we are already well into it. We've got our
lead quotes. We are carrying on. I would expect that to be completed as every year –
early November, so...
Then, as far as the pricing is going to be concerned, yes, there will be some increase in
certain parts of the program, but at the end of the day, we retain 90% of our overall
premium, so – while any increase in the retrocession is on 10%. And as we said also, we
are going through a market reassessment that goes well beyond the nat cat.
So again, I'm not worried that this – whatever at the end of the day, is the price of our
retro will be totally compatible with what we believe we can negotiate on the assumed
risks.

be the pricing evolution for the reinsurance business going forward across the globe,
what would be this number today?

FINAL

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

I would not put any. Well, I would not publicly put any. I have my own ideas, but that's it. But
we are entering into the discussions. We have some programs that are there to be
quoted, some are already in the market. Well, I think what's going to be the fact this year
and this – is that, well, every client will basically be dealt with on its own merit, and then
there will be, in my opinion, more differentiation. But I don't think it would be proper to
indicate, well, kind of a general – we know exactly for each client where we are in terms of
actual pricing compared to technical pricing. The thing is that depending on the starting
point and depending whether that client has been affected by the losses or not, but there
will be a negotiation to get to technical prices or as close to it as possible, or if it's
required.

Thank you. We will now take our next question from Frank Kopfinger of Deutsche Bank.
Please go ahead.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, everybody. I have two questions. My first question is also on the
renewals outlook. Victor, I think you made very strong comments that you even expect
improvements, I would say, in non-loss affected lines, also other geographies, other lines
of business. But my key question is why should really clients accept price increases in
these non-loss affected lines, what's the rationale behind this?
And then secondly, probably more on, for François, so it's in the Life business. Within the
Life division, the regular investment income, or as you call it, investment revenues, they
have been very low, the €27 million, 20% decline quarter-on-quarter. What is the driver
behind this?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

I think the answer to the first question is the essence of our business. Our business is a
global business of mutualization of risk. We are – no client would have today in the
condition it has without being part of a pool – a pool of risk. That pool of risk today is
affected by major losses. The consequences of those major losses have got to be
redistributed. If there is no redistribution, there is no insurance and reinsurance system.

On your question on the investment income in the Life division, you have the detail on
slide 24, 25 in the appendix. As a reminder, my mandate is to manage the global
portfolio. Of course, we're feeling constraint for the Life and the Non-Life division. And the
driver of the evolution in the Life division this quarter is less of realized capital gain
compared to previous quarter. Consider that it's not a policy, it just happened this quarter
and no specific trend to be mentioned for this one-off event.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

But my point was not so much on the realized gains. It was on the €27 million investment
revenues. This really came down significantly. Was there any trouble behind this? So, is this
going to catch up as you're going to derisk?

A - François de Varenne
I don't know. No, I think that should be mostly a dollar effect.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi, there. Two questions. One is, could you just clarify what the Solvency II impact of U.S.
mortality was in the quarter? I'm assuming I should think of that as a kind of one-off catchup rather than a recurring item.
Second question, Victor, you're not changing your corporate (39:11) risk appetite or you
business plan, I think that's what you said. How do I square that with your degree of
positivity about the environment going forward? I mean, isn't this the perfect environment
to particularly increase your risk appetite and/or your business planning assumptions now
look on the conservative side. Thanks.

A - Operator
(39:35) Maybe, I'll answer the first question.

A - Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

So, the impact of the U.S. mortality experience is in the range of 2 points to 3 points of
solvency ratio decline. I guess there's an element of catch-up in this. So, this is not only
purely Q3. So, there are reporting lags which have also accumulated in Q3 to some
extent.

A - Victor Peignet

FINAL

Paolo?

A - Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Yeah. What we're seeing is adverse mortality rising from (40:21) reinsurance and
permanent policy, so universal life policy issued somewhere between 2006 and 2009
timeframe. This is really focused on a few specific lines in these years. The prior to 2004
is largely due to a write in our fee gap. So, those are eras that, yeah, performed much
worse than were originally priced that we – as we bought the books from 2011 on, we
were aware already a lot of those issues and those are captured already in the value of
the – in the purchase price effect yield of the business. So, what we're seeing here is
more recent years.

To the question of your changing risk appetite...

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, I think we are not going to change the risk appetite, that's for sure. We could
certainly write more if that justifies. I think we'll adjust as we walk into the renewals and,
well we'll have better clarity, in say, three or four weeks. And what I can say is that, we
have the flexibility to adapt the deployment of capital through the renewals, and that's
with the 1/1, but through the 1/1 and, well, the May-June of next year, which is more – going
to be more of a date for the U.S. than 1/1 where there's a limited amount of business of
the U.S. business that renews. So, I think we'll...

Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning, all. I have two questions for Victor. The first one on the P&C side
mostly. I'll be interested to hear your view on the element, non-traditional capacity. I mean,
we entered Q3 with a record high capacity at record low spreads, to what extent could
this put the cap on price increase? And we are seeing some banks already collecting
money for 2018.
And the second one, then on the loss estimate. I think you mentioned the numbers is
based on the market loss of $95 billion, so could you explain to what extent the €430
million or based on a top-down view and how much visibility you have from the (43:09)
side by now?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

I think Denis wanted to make a comment about the previous question. So, maybe we
could start with that.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

You're too kind with me, Victor.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Thank you. Yes. Vested interest.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

We – yeah. Sure. There's three important ways of distinction but as far as if we can write
more, taking to the same risk appetite. So, the answer is of course if conditions are met,
and we're quite optimistic about the fact that the market dynamics today is in favor of
reinsurance (43:43). I have seen no one talking about price decreases, it's the first time.
Usually, you have always wanted to (43:52) us to hear about it, you know, it's not the case.
Anyone talks about the rate increases and (43:58) relations to be strengthened, (44:00)
Now, the size of it, we have to wait but of course it could be on a client-by-client basis,
market-by-market, business-by-business, so we're quite optimistic.
Now, we don't change the risk appetite, whether we're going to expose the capital to
lines or shares of businesses if we consider, I'm kind of speaking to the well-defined risk
appetite framework. But of course, we can write more within this risk appetite framework.
And if conditions are met, we will write more. There's no question about it and we'll
inform you as soon as we see where the market is heading through.

FINAL

Let's say, we have – as I said, we are quite optimistic about the market dynamics right
now. So, the losses of our competitors will certainly are more and more now disclosed,
paves the way for – no one escapes the fate of those events. So, everyone is concerned.
So, more than others and by the way, all seems to be less concerned than others when
you compare that to our net equity or to income or to earnings. But having said that, all
players are concerned.
So, this is a worldwide global effect affecting the entire industry. And that's why we expect
the reaction to be worldwide and global in all business lines. Even marginal players or let's
say, second-tier players in Asia with business in the U.S. and they are concerned in that
there's so much financial capacity, so that's why we believe that no one is going to be
safe (45:35-45:41) as soon as we have some, let's say, quantitative signs of this upturn of
the market which is, to my point of view, absolutely obvious.
Can we go back to the first question?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

The question – the first one – yeah.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Do you want to answer, Victor?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well or maybe you want to deal with the first one, Denis?

A - Operator
Maybe, Daniel, if you could just repeat your questions, that would help.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Of course. So, the first one was on the non-traditional capacity, where we had obviously
the record issuance outstanding and also quite low spreads into Q2 and Q3. I was
wondering to what extent this could be or put a cap on price increases?

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Victor?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, I think, as you know, I mean those events are affecting primarily traditional players
and collateralize reinsurance players with less cat bonds. For me, it's quite simple. I mean
once you face those events but it is quite probable that, yes, there will be reloading, the
question is what sort of expectations or returns, I mean, are having the investors? So, I
think, everyone is going to reassess the expectations of return in view of what has just
happened. Well, again, I mean, it's probably early days and we are not even having a
Page 16 of 29



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2017-10-26

FINAL

clarity about how much the fact that the collateral are being locked up is going to impact.
So, I think it's – we need to wait a few more weeks to see exactly where we are. In
addition, any buyer would like to keep probably a balance between traditional and less
traditional.
Regarding the loss estimate that $95 billion – but there are certain risks that are fit for
being modeled, there are other risk that are less fit for being modeled which why our
estimates are not purely based on model. They are based on model for the risk where
we can rely on model and they are based on really, while assessment of contracts by the
underwriters and our claims people based on their own knowledge of the contract for risk
that are, well, much less, not as well captured by model. So – and then you rebuilt this
blended approach. You rebuild it and that's where the market loss figure that we are
communicating on comes from.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Hereto, I would like to add something. Victor said everyone today taking into account what
has happened, absolutely true. But we also take into account what could have happened
if Irma went East instead of going West. And it's certainly a key element. I think in those
worst-case scenario, it happened but could have happened. And in that case, those
market dynamics would be even different from the one we have here. So, for investors in
cat bond funds, something we have in mind with this scenario – alternative scenario where
suddenly Irma would have destroyed the East Coast of Florida then going up North, so –
and that's a lot of anxiety because it would have been, maybe here, a historical event.

Thank you. We will take the next question from Jonny Urwin of UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi, good day. Good morning. Just two questions from me. So firstly, if we add up all of the
losses announced by listed companies globally, so far, both primary and reinsurance, we
only get to about $35 billion, that's actually your announced initial estimates with – not
many yet to report now. So, if we believe the modeling agencies of industry losses around
sort of $95 billion, $100 billion, which you guys seemed to do, then where do you think
these unaccounted losses are? It seems like an awfully high number to be (50:14) on the
private markets or collateralized players. So, any color there would be great.
And secondly, I suspect you won't, but can you give us an update on pricing moves that
you've seen on early renewals coming to market? Anything anecdotal would be

Well, I think we have done – we have done a, I believe, pretty realistic work to get to the
figures that we are building our reserve on. So, I listen to what you say. Well, I see what we
have in our books. So, at least on our side, I'm confident that, well, what we are talking
about is realistic.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

We think it was a market share. Many criteria have been taken into account, many
parameters to estimate. It seems that the $95 billion is, let's say, the center of the
ballpark, maybe the (51:36) was the ballpark. But still that's what we put into accounts are
estimated on the basis of a $95 million series of events. Let's see what it's going to
disclose and let's see what's going to happen in the weeks to come. I said this morning
and I repeat, we don't expect to have to revise reports as the estimates we have, that's

anything more.

Thank you. We will now take our next question from Vinit Malhotra of Mediobanca. Please
go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So, several things have been addressed. I'll just try to
clarify one or two. I'm quite curious to know how the retrocession you think of – Victor, I
guess. On your slide, I can't mention number, but you have a number which states $630
million protection not yet triggered, and from the – I mean, the stated reported numbers
today, there's obviously €500 million, €600 million that went to retrocession. How should
we look at – I mean, this is quite a lot of retrocession given that your nat cat budget is
much smaller, obviously, net basis of €300 million to €400 million. But if you could just
help us understand when you said 90%, you retain 10% as retroceded. How should we put
in context of this very large retrocession cover?
And the second question is just you obviously talked about ILS investors reassessing. I was
just curious that given that SCOR investment partners also has €650 million AUM which
you manage, and some of that is cat bond, what's the feedback you're getting from
investors? So, in other words, from cat bond investors? Is your expectation that they will
reassess returns based on some feedback from your business experience of SCOR
investment partners, or is it your expectation from what you would normally get? Thank
you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Maybe we stop by François.

A - François de Varenne
So, on the ILS, so we manage a little bit more than that. When you said we are above $1.2
billion today in terms of capacity of funds. Our main flagship, the Atropos Fund, in which
SCOR is coinvested, has suffer from a negative performance in September of minus 7%,
which is in line with what our investors were expected. And even compared to peer, we
are a little bit less exposed.
The first reaction that we observed from our investor, I remind you that we have no
retailing of our client base, so we only speak to professional clients in Europe, mostly
insurance companies, banks, asset manager and pension funds. The first observation is

Page 19 of 29



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2017-10-26

that our investor are waiting, asking question. We have no redemption on any of the three
funds we manage today.

FINAL

We signed a large mandate for UK pension fund over the last three weeks, so just after
the event. And, I think people are waiting for potentially increasing their investment
capacity early next year if they see a positive trend in the pricing.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

And isn't that going to bother the theory that ILS will come in but not really have price
effect? I mean if there's a mandate coming in now and more expected from just your
experience?

A - François de Varenne

Bloomberg Transcript

It's a new mandate that's been decided. As you know, some of the funds of ILS would be
blocked early 2018. So, that recently dried up a little bit the capacities, that's what we
believe. And people are hesitating, they wait to see us proceeding to go to see whether
or not they contribute again or not. So, it's still of the open question to know what would
this contribution upside is to the 2018 market, I mean so...
My view is that it would be less buoyant than to be expect, because as I said, people will
start and agree to (57:18) try about the alternative scenarios. In one of the scenarios that
could have happened, they would have lost a lot so – and that maybe (57:27) today, so we
have to wait for the disclosure of the value of future ILS at cat bonds that will be in the
weeks to come to see how they are impacted which is not yet retransferred, and so it
seems like in the move – it's moving right now.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

All right. Thank you.

A - François de Varenne
Maybe on retro, Victor?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, on retro first of all, I mean cat business for us will present about what 15% of the
total premium. So, we are not essentially a cat writer; we write all lines of business. When I
say that we retain 90%, it means we retain 90% of the overall premium. And then what
we buy as writable program is basically a cat program and a high excess per risk on our
large corporate business, that's what we buy as writable, so...
And as far as our cat rate is always concern, well, a significant part of it is proportional. So,
that explains basically what I was saying. The non-proportional part of our cat rate has
been very little affected by the losses; only some of the aggregate colors have been
partially affected.

Page 20 of 29



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2017-10-26

A - François de Varenne
And all those protections are still in place in case we would have additional events by the
end of the year so, that's why we didn't – we are in a good position in case something
would have (58:55) so...

FINAL

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Our proportional stays in place. Our vertical non-proportional is unaffected and some of
our lateral protections have been triggered, but not all of them.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay. Can I just crosscheck my understanding? So, this means that you're not very worried
about retro pricing because the non-proportional layers are still not hit. Is that a
reasonable summary of what you just said?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, we are not worried, first of all because we believe that we have the relationship that
guarantees that there is continuity and there is a spirit of continuity and consistency in the
pricing. So, I think that's the first main point, probably. And then, yes, a lot of our retro is
totally unaffected. That's the fact.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. We will now take our next question from Thomas Fossard, HSBC. Please go
ahead.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Good morning, all. I've got two questions. First one would be for Victor. Victor, as we
understand, you're pointing that you've got compliance risk appetite and you are not a cat
writer. But still, if I'm taking the €600 million of Q3 losses and look at what this is
representing in terms of the shareholders' equity of the group at the end of June. If my
math is right, I'm reaching something which is around 9.3%, 9.4%. Compared to many
(1:00:37) losses disclosed this morning, I'm reaching a number which is 9%. So, are these
actually SCOR will have, I would say, a similar risk exposure or market position which is a
bit counterintuitive compared to what you've said in the past on SCOR being
underweight, possibly also being underweight at Texas and Florida. So, maybe if you
could answer this?
And the second question will be on the dividend policy. You're saying that obviously there
is no change in the dividend policy, I fully understand. Now, if we are to take a normalized
Q4 results and apply in 35% payout ratio, clearly, this would mean a cut to the €1.65

Page 21 of 29



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2017-10-26

dividend per share paid last year. So, any clarification on what would be the intention of
the group despite the significant losses incurred in Q3? Thank you.

A - François de Varenne

FINAL

Victor, first.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, first, just a slight correction. If you want to talk about ratio on equity, you should not
take the €600 million, but the €430 million post-tax, but that's the detail which has its
importance. But I think we – you need to compare on three – in my opinion, three different
parameters; the equity of the premium and the annual earnings. And if you do those, if
you take those three, and you put that in perspective, yes, you will see that we are
relatively less affected. That's to me, there is no rocket science in that. But I think you
need to look at the three parameters to get a view that is not just through one angle, but
through the three that are relevant.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

All those table exist. So, they are circulating everywhere right now. And you have to take
the earnings. You have to take the equity. You have to take the premiums, whatever. And
when you look and you find out that we are in the good part of the curve – of the
quadrant today. When I say good part, relatively well as exposed, but that's clear.
There are some competitors that are heavily exposed. You know them because you had
the rating agency's reaction almost immediately. So, easy to identify, but we have to wait
still for full disclosure before drawing anything, but we have the conviction and we have
the demonstrations that we're less affected. Everything being equal than our peers. It's a
very important statement as always, so...
Now, on the dividend policy, I will ask Mark to do a precise answer.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Denis. Just one clarification of the mathematics, Thomas, on your first
point. So, we had roughly €6.4 billion of shareholders' equity at the end of June 30. So,
with the €430 million nat cat loss, you're looking at a figure just above 6%, not the 9% you
referenced. But as Denis mentioned, I think you'll see all of these relative comparisons
come out soon enough in the marketplace since it's all public information.
With respect to the dividend policy, I would draw your attention back to the IR day slides.
We've been very clear about the methodology that we apply in setting the dividend.
You're right that there's only one constraint, which is the 35%. However, we do have a
four-step methodology, and it starts by securing the solvency position of the group,
making sure that it's in the optimal range, that it's where we want it to support the
operating plan of the group and making sure that we're able to take advantage of the
opportunities that we have forthcoming in 2018.

Page 22 of 29

FINAL

And then we see how much of the dividend potential is sustainable going forward. So,
these three steps have not changed, and will not change as we head into the next four
months when we start making these types of decisions.
So, I would guide you to, I think, it's slide 46 of the IR deck And separately, just in terms of
net income and so forth, we have – there have been some – there is public information, I
think, about things that will probably benefit various companies in the industries; SCOR is
one of them. You've certainly heard potential for positive reserve developments on
Ogden, for example.
Recently here in France, there was some very material decision by the French
Constitutional Court with respect to the withholding tax that we've spoken about
frequently and every May, when we end up making these payments and that's a favorable
ruling for companies like SCOR that have to make these dividend payments.
And certainly, I would point you to the guidance that we've provided on the return on
investments as another area to look at. So, I think, our net income possibilities for the
future are good.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Mark, just a quick follow-up on the withholding tax. This was something also I had in mind.
Would you expect this to come as a one-off, cumulative one-off impact as soon as Q4
now that the decision has been given by the court and the state will have to comply to this
judgment or I mean, a bit more...

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Yeah. The decision came about two weeks ago, actually. I think about two Fridays ago. So I
expect it to be a Q4 event for the industry. I think there's a great deal of certainty in this
decision. The state has, to my knowledge, really only delaying tactics in terms of any kind
of recourse but there's no way to appeal it, really. So, I expect it to occur in Q4 and I
expect it to be beneficial to the group.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

How much you would say in terms of one-off...

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Well, it's a 3% tax that's been applied to our dividend for the past four years, I believe. So,
I think, you can calculate them, the impact, for us which is roughly €300 million a year of
dividends.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

So, should you then pay it out externally, yeah?

It's something that SCOR pays, the company, not the dividend recipient.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

So, that withholding tax is 3% of the gross dividend payout annually.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

And we say it's north of €40 million or we cannot say it?

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

I think if someone was to add up all the public information on our dividend payments, that
would be a very safe statement.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Mark. Oops, sorry I shouldn't have.

Next question, I guess.

A - Ian Kelly

{BIO 19976646 <GO>}

So, can we take our next question?

Operator
So, we take the next question now from Kamran Hossain of RBC. Your line is now open.
Please go ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi, everyone. Two questions from me. First of all, just coming back to the really helpful
kind of industry overview of losses (01:08:39) during the presentation. Do you have an
idea of how much of the loss will fall to ILS, I guess, just coming back to the earlier
questions around how we get to that €100 billion, but how much falls to ILS?
And the second question, clearly, some reference to competitors impacted or kind of
having negative comments by rating agencies. I guess, in relation to that, your Lloyd's
syndicate, the channel syndicate, looking at the coming into line that's going to occur
shortly, is there any capital that actually needs to go into the Lloyd's syndicate? Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Victor?

FINAL

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

I think on the second part was the capital that is going to go into channel, well, will be a
function of the approved SBF that is currently being discussed with Lloyd's, but we have
no particular worry about that. I mean, it's part of the normal operation. So, no particular
concern. I mean, we are in discussion with Lloyd's about our SBF and what we hope is to
get to a safe landing on that and from there, and the capital requirement will be activated.
Regarding how much the ILS is going to pick up from the loss, I think, unfortunately, in a
market or unfortunately – well it's not fortunate or unfortunate, it's a fact. The market is
very, very fragmented today. And as we said from the beginning, we know how much it's
going to cost us. What we don't know is who are going to be the ultimate payers. I mean,
this will take some time before it emerges.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks very much.

Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. We will now take our new question from Michael Haid of Commerzbank.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good morning. First question. I'm still trying to understand a little bit
more your retro protection, the gap between €108 million and the €600 million. To my
understanding, it's fair to assume that most of this gap is covered by proportional retro
and what you said is that the XL covers have – the attachment points have hardly been hit.
And for that reason, you also don't need to reinstate that much, that would be also
consistent with your statement that any higher gross loss would not have a huge impact
on the net loss. So, is it fair to assume that if we now see higher losses in the fourth
quarter from U.S. (01:11:16) that this immediately hit your full account or any aggregate
covers? That is my first question.
And the second question, I noticed that in Q3, there must have been a significant amount
of other nat cat losses aside of these U.S. hurricanes and the Mexican earthquake losses.
Can you talk a little bit about how much these were and where they came from?

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

So, your summary of the retro protection of the group is right. Now, the impact of
Californian fires, Victor, can you say a word about it?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

FINAL

I think during the quarter, we have very little in addition to the major losses before the fire
(01:12:02) actually. We have a bit on the Typhoon Hato (01:12:09), a bit of floods here and
there but overall, this represents a – well, we're exactly in the right fare is (01:12:16) €13
million, 1-3, on top of the €598 million that is coming from the fire. So, there's very little
other activity of cat in the quarter.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

And any other manmade losses or anything like that because I was wondering that...

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

No.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

...the combined ratio you showed was quite high.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

No. If you normalize the combined ratio, you takeout Ogden and the reserve release and
you take out the – you bring the cat at 6%, which is the budget, you get to 95%, 94-pointsomething but very close to 95%. So, we are in a quarter where – and you look at our
attritional ratio, our attritional ratio, again, you need to normalize it from Ogden. So, you
need to remove about 2.9% of the 58%. So, again, you are in an attritional, which is 55something, very, very consistent. But we are very pleased with the way the underlying
portfolio operates. I mean, we continue to operate at a combined ratio, as I was saying,
which is around 95%, exactly as per plan, as per the assumption of the plan.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

But Ogden is not a Q3 event, right? It occurred in the first quarter.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Yeah, yeah. You know, I'm talking of year-to-date combined ratio.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Okay. I was talking about the Q3 combined ratio...

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

On a quarterly basis, you can have a bit of – what is our normalized (01:13:43) Q3?

A - Ian Kelly

{BIO 19976646 <GO>}

So we can refer to slide 34.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

95.4%.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Okay.

FINAL

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

So, for normalized on Q3 only. So, I mean, we are not a business that is a quarter
business, but 0.4% what I mean is just within the margin. So, for me – but year-to-date,
which is a bit more relevant, we are just below 95%, so we continue to basically sail
exactly in line with the assumptions of the plan, which is very satisfactory to me without
any reserve release from (01:14:24) the nat cat. I mean, our nat cat, we've taken them with
no reserve release at all. So, the only reserve release were the ones we did in Q1 to
soften the Ogden rate change.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Yes. Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. We will now take our next question from Roland Pfänder of ODDO BHF. Your
line is now open. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Roland Pf änder
Yes. Good morning, everybody. Two questions, if I may. I would be interested in your
short-term business opportunities post the hurricanes in U.S. You're actively selling backup
covers as they are high demand. Can you indicate any pricing there? That's the first
question.
The second question, Life reinsurance. Could you talk me through your in-force
management actions? Do you see there maybe a threat that those actions might lead to
negative IFRS impact going forward? Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Backup cover, Victor.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

We have not been actively seeking backup covers. I mean, we have looked at a few
backup covers from clients that are clients of ours, and we have tried to respond to their
needs but this is really a handful of backup covers that we signed. So, to me, not
significant at all.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

There was some demand, yes, for sure, but we need follow-up. Paolo?

A - Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}
Page 27 of 29



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2017-10-26

Yeah. When you look at what we call the active in-force management, there are really two
areas we've been working on over the years. One is working with our retro partners to
optimize the retrocession structures. And the second is really working with our clients on
treaties, which are not performing as expected.

FINAL

Now, on neither of these two areas, at this point, we have any plan to activate any actions
that would have a negative IFRS impact.

Q - Roland Pf änder
Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. We will now take our next question from Guilhem Horvath of BNP Paribas.
Please go ahead.

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 18460437 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Thank you. Just two quick follow-up questions. The first one – and tell me if I'm
wrong, but what I hear is – I interpret that as your cat budget shouldn't go higher than 6
points of combined ratio next year. Am I correct? And the second question is on the €200
million potential capital release from the merger of legal entities in France. Let's assume
that in early 2011, you still have a 213% Solvency II ratio. Would you return this capital freed
up to shareholders or would you keep that in order to rebuild flexibility? Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

On your second question, Mark, please (01:17:21) but we never said that we will only do
share buyback in case we're above the optimal Solvency range, we said we want to
change the Solvency and if we are in the upper part of the Solvency range, we can
proceed to those capital management actions. So, it has been said, I repeat it, it's not
mechanical, we just need to have the Solvency I to reach in the upper part of the solvency
range, and be able to support the development of the group and pick up opportunities,
there's also opportunities happen as it seems to be the case. Mark did I interpret the
policy rightfully?

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Excellent interpretation. It's really consistent with what we said at the IR Day that we're
comfortable being in the upper half of the – or the upper part of the optimal range of the
solvency ratio, that would not dissuade us from yielding with the €200 million benefit, and
we would still use the same decision tree that I mentioned before in referenced from the
IR Day dividend policy question.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Victor, the other question.
