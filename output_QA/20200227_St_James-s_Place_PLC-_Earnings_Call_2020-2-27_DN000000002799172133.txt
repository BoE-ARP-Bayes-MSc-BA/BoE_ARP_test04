{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Good morning everyone. It's half ten, so we should get starting. So, it's nice to see so
many familiar faces here today and thank you for coming. Our first results presentation of
the new decade will follow that familiar format. In a moment, I will hand over to Craig to
run through the financials, after which I will update you on other key matters of note. I
have a number of my executive and the board colleagues here today and they are very
welcome.
Now, last year was a challenging year for the UK wealth management sector, with investor
sentiment being impacted by the uncertain macroeconomic indicators, the US, China
trade dispute and domestic political environment. Against this backdrop, our new
business flows announced in January were lower than the previous year, albeit, we
reported a solid outcome given the difficult trading environment. Once again
demonstrating the strength and resilience of our business.
Craig will provide a reminder of last month's announcement, but I can't help myself, I have
to share with you my favorite slide, consistent net inflows every quarter for the last
decade. The full year net inflow of some GBP9 billion was equivalent to 9% of opening
funds under management. So, yes, a tough year but still an impressive outcome
particularly relative to the sector. Over the longer term this outcome results in compound

FINAL

growth of 15% per annum. You'll note, we experienced an improving performance in the
final quarter as investor sentiment improved after the election result, a topic, I will return
to later.
Lastly, on uncertain external environment provided for difficult backdrop for new business,
the investment markets had a good year with all major indices seeing strong growth.
These returns together with those net flows resulted in funds under management at the
end of 2019 of GBP117 billion, growth over the year of 22% and compound growth over 10
years of 19% and that's an increase of more than GBP21 billion over the year. It took us 18
years to reach GBP21 billion and now 10 years later we added the same amount in just 12
months. Such is the size of the business today.
Over time, increasing funds under management will generate increased returns, but in
the short term our profit has been impacted by the more modest gross flows relative to
the planned higher cost of investment in our business to underpin future growth.
And that's a perfect place to hand over to Craig to run through the reported results and
the creation of shareholder value.

{BIO 20095126 <GO>}

Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and welcome again from me. In presenting
the results this morning, I'm going to follow the order in which shareholder value is
created. Firstly, I'll recap on adviser numbers, which as we reported last month have
grown. And there are key lead indicator for future growth. Second, I'll comment on our
growth in funds under management, which now stand at GBP117 billion as at December 31.
Third, I'll give a commentary on our cash results, including the way in which the gestation
balance has developed. Then I'll look briefly at the EEV results and our capital position and
then I'll finish on the final dividend, which we announced this morning.
Our adviser numbers now stand at 4,271 and that's up 8% for the year, representing a net
addition of 317 qualified advisers to the Partnership. This is at the top end of our growth
objective and this is the result of sustained investment. Our Academy continues to make a
significant contribution to adviser growth numbers, with 172 advisers graduating during the
year. Andrew will talk more about the Academy and give further insight into its scale and
reach shortly.
Our funds under management now standard at a record GBP117 billion and that's growth
of some 22% since the start of the year. This growth came from a combination of net
inflows of GBP9 billion, continued strong retention of 96% and market performance that
was much improved on the experience of 2018.
If we look at the way gross flows have developed during the year, you can see a very
modest improvement during quarters two and quarter three. Followed by quarter four
where we saw a return to growth of 1%. We saw further growth in January, and we're
pleased to say that the good start to 2020 has continued through February. It's worth
remembering that January and February are two of the smaller months and the March

FINAL

usually represents 40% of the quarter but nonetheless, we are very pleased with the shift
in momentum.
Turning to the cash result, our net income from funds under management was GBP424.9
million, which represents growth of 9%. You will recall that at the half year we gave you
improved net income guidance based on the margin on mature funds under
management. The margin for the year was within that range of guidance and we
anticipate a similar margin holding for 2020 now that the small positive impact that we
expected from a reduction in corporation tax will no longer happen.
I'll now turn to gestation funds under management, which stood at the total of GBP40.2
billion at December 31. This is a critical aspect of our business model and here we show a
reconciled illustration of how the balance might flow into the cash result in future reporting
periods using some simple modeling assumption set out on the slide. What this next
illustration shows is that once all gestation fund under management matures there'll be an
additional GBP350 million of profit flowing into the cash result and that's free of any
additional cost. This is an enormous store of value and another way of looking at it is that
based on the same modeling we're going to see underlying cash of over GBP1 billion
emerge over the next six years from the current balance of GBP40 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

Following our new guidance on the net income from FUM line, we saw a much tighter sell
side Group estimates this year-end. And we plan to the publish consensus forecast on our
websites with the aim of having this in place ahead of the interim results for 2020. And I
hope this will be seen as a positive and hopeful development. The margin arising on new
business was GBP127.5 million, which is directly linked to the gross flows during the year.
The margin in the second half was similar to that seen in the first half, which is to be
expected, given that there was no material difference in activity level. Within the expense
figure on this slide establishment expenses were up 9% to GBP186.1 million and this is
below the 12% guidance that I gave this time last year. And the lower amount comes from
a very strong focus on discretionary expenditure balanced though with a strong
commitment to continue investing in future growth. I expect establishment expenses to
increase in 2020 by 9% again, as we continue to invest in this growth.
Operational developments at GBP22.3 million, largely reflects continuing investments in
technology and that's over and above our Bluedoor program, which is now complete.
We'll continue to invest in technology in order to seek benefits for clients experience and
for the running of the business and I expect this cost in 2020 will be somewhere in the
region of GBP26 million. Academy costs were 30% higher as planned and we'll continue
to grow the Academy in 2020. I expect this additional investment to be in the range of 5%
to 10%.
The FSCS charge of GBP23.4 million included an unexpected charge for the second half,
amounting to somewhere in the region of GBP7 million. This will be as unwelcome to
shareholders as it was to us. We are naturally supportive of any scheme that serves to
protect consumers in our sector for the cost of doing so show no signs of moderating.

FINAL

Part of the year-on-year increase was, of course, attributable to a one-off change in the
billing year, which was anticipated.
We have no control over FSCS budgets but early indications are that the charge for 2020
could be some 15% to 20% higher. Within the shareholder interest and tax relief column
shown you will note the tax relief from capital losses of GBP10.3 million returned to the
lower end of the GBP10 million to GBP12 million per year range. And we expect the
remaining store of value of GBP44.6 million to flow into future cash results at around
GBP8 million to GBP10 million a year in the future.

Bloomberg Transcript

Miscellaneous was GBP14.3 million for the year. As I said at the half year this net charge
includes a number of different cash flows, including GBP6 million of matched Charitable
Foundation funding that are not covered elsewhere in the cash result. The overall net
charge in the second half of the year was half as in the first and the overall charge is a
figure we are committed to reducing over time. It's a difficult line to model with absolute
precision. But you may wish to assume that the annual charge for 2020 will be some
GBP10 million to GBP12 million. The actual outcome will of course be subject to modest
fluctuations.
Our net investments in Asia was some GBP3 million higher than we guided for the year.
And this is largely attributable to the very difficult conditions faced by our business in Hong
Kong. These conditions resulted in a net embedded value cost in 2019 instead of the
small surplus that we forecast. Funds under management grew by 49% to GBP934 million.
The conditions in the region have become even more challenging in the past few weeks
and we are focusing very heavily on supporting our teams, managing our cost base, but
continuing to ensure that we invest for the future. Taking the current challenges into
account, I expect the cash results in 2020 to be around the same level as we saw in 2018.
The result for DFM is in line with guidance and although the income was below our
forecast, strong cost control protected the net result. Rowan Dartington now has funds
under management of GBP2.8 billion and that represents a pleasing 24% growth for the
year. I expect the result for DFM in 2020 to show a modest improvement with an
accelerated improvement in 2021 onwards. Taking all of these items into account, the
underlying cash result was GBP273.1 million, 12% lower than 2018, which we see as a very
credible outcome given the trading background and our continued investments in future
growth.
It's important to remember that 2018 benefited from some one-off positives in the form
of accelerated tax relief and a shorter FSCS billing period. So, the like for like reduction is
actually much smaller. Our back-office infrastructure costs were GBP38.8 million, and the
key thing here is that 100% of our UK business has now been migrated on to the
Bluedoor system, which is in full use in a newly configured back office. This has been a
hugely complex program completed at a time when the business has been growing
strongly. We are naturally very pleased that the migration has been completed safely and
in line with plan.

Page 4 of 23

Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity

FINAL

We're now decommissioning the old systems and redundant back office processes and
the residual cost in 2020 will be no greater than GBP10 million. Once this work is complete
there'll be no further project cost.
I'll now turn to embedded value where the operating profit was GBP952 million. New
business profit reduced by 7% to GBP793 million and this is principally due to the new
business volumes for the year together with the growth and establishment expenses that
we've already covered in the cash results. On the other side of the equation, however, we
have seen continuing strong persistency, which drove a positive experience variance of
GBP82.1 million. The other notable factor within embedded value for 2019 is the
investment return variance of GBP768.6 million and that reflects the improvements in the
markets over the closing position in 2018.

Bloomberg Transcript

Based on embedded value at the end of 2019, the EEV per share is GBP13.20 and that
excludes GBP385 million of unrecorded embedded value that you may recall will emerge,
but which is not yet recorded in our results because of the contract boundary in our pre2018 pension product.
Turning to capital and solvency, our position remains straightforward and strong. Our
business model involves holding the specific assets required to 100% match liabilities and
that eliminates market risks. We then hold a significant buffer to protect against
operational risk and our policy of holding 110% of the standard Solvency II formula safely
meets this requirement now and for the future. You might have observed that the
Solvency II ratio has moved from 117% at the end of 2018 to 112% at the end of 2019. For
the 2018 ratio, was flat it is a result of the equity dampener that kicked in during that year
and reversed during 2019. If they say did not happen, the Solvency II ratio would be an
111%, which is consistent with our stated approach and also with the 2019 and indeed the
2017 positions.
Finally, I'd like to comment on the final dividend that we announced this morning. 2019 was
not an easy year with domestic political uncertainty, compounded by global economic
uncertainty, we were not immune and our cash result for the year tells a story of lower
discretionary flows providing less funding for investments in future growth. However, our
business remains in great shape. And post the UK election, 2020 is feeling different.
Activity levels are higher and we're seeing a pickup in investor confidence which is driving
higher activity levels in our business. This coupled with the material flow of cash to come
from our stock of gestation FUM over the medium term gave the Board the confidence to
recommend a 5% increase in the final dividend. This means 3% dividend growth for the
full year, notwithstanding that the payout ratio for this year remains above our targeted
range. And that's it from me.
And with that, I'll hand back to Andrew.

FINAL

Thank you, Craig. A solid performance given the difficult headwinds. I'm now going to
spend some time looking at other matters of note, where we have been investing for
growth and how we see the business prospects. The continued success for St. James's
Place is built on establishing and maintaining long lasting, highly personal relationships with
clients through our St. James's Place Partnership. Our aim is to put positive client
outcomes at the heart of everything we do with our advisers helping their clients to fulfill
their ambitions and aspirations through sound financial planning advice.
Our clients value the services they receive supported by the excellent retention and
feedback from client surveys. We have also once again received numerous awards with
two highlights being the Wealth Management Company of the Year and the Best Wealth
Manager. Both awards are voted by members of the public. We are not complacent, we
must respond to feedback and continue to enhance our client proposition and
experience. Against the backdrop of the strong performance across major investment
markets in 2019 our clients have benefited from very good returns with all of our
portfolios delivering strong growth and in the main outperforming no relevant our peer
group.

Bloomberg Transcript

In early June, we took the decision to move the investment management of our
segregated mandate from Woodford Investment Management to a combination of RWC
and Columbia Threadneedle. This was possible as the core principle of our investment
proposition is to appoint managers to manage our own segregated funds through a subadvisory mandate rather than by investing into third-party funds. Our approach of
segregated mandates enabled us to restrict investments to quoted liquid stocks and
consequently our clients continue to have full access to their money.
Our proposition as you can see on the left hand of the slide includes 74 lead fund
managers and 35 exclusive investment strategies in the UK retail marketplace. We also
continue to make good progress in developing our responsible investing approach and
build on our integration of environmental, social and governance factors into our fund
managers' investment decision making. It is therefore pleasing that we were awarded the
A+ rating in a latest United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment annual
assessment. Further, we continue to influence province positive change elsewhere with
some 90% of our investment managers now signatories to the UNPRI and we are
committed to achieving 100% during the current year.
We recognize that climate change poses a risk to our business and to client outcomes.
Therefore, in 2019, we became a supporter for the Taskforce for Climate-related
Disclosures and have committed to implementing this across the business.
I'm now going to spend a little time covering the investments we are making for the
future starting with the Partnership. As Craig has already said, 2019 was another strong
year to join us, with the Partnership now at 4,271, growth of 8%. These individuals have
average industry experience of 19 years with an average age of 47. This is a net increase
of 317 advisers during the year through a combination of attracting experienced high
quality financial advisers together with graduates from our Academies. And just pausing
here for a moment, a business with 317 financial advisers would rank by number of

Page 6 of 23

Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2020-02-27

FINAL

advisers as the 12th largest financial advice business in the UK. And that's our growth in
just 12 months.
We continue to invest in the Academies and there are currently 458 people in the
program who are not currently included in the Partnership numbers, but who will graduate
over the coming years. As a standalone business, this group of individuals would today
create the UK's sixth largest advice business again by number of advisers. And in the case
of the Academies, this would generate a diverse advice business with an average age of
just 34 and with the gender balance of 71% male, 29% female. And that's an aside the
advisers who had previously been through the London Academy were responsible for
14% of London's 2019's new business, demonstrating an excellent return on the
investment we have made in prior years.

Bloomberg Transcript

This sustained growth in the partnership provides us with confidence in our ability to both
service existing clients well and attract new clients to St. James's Place. However, the
increasing scale to the Partnership requires us to continue to invest in the supporting
infrastructure and professional development. We now have over 900 chartered advisers
across the Partnership, a figure which includes 316 fellows. The Partnership is a key
differentiator for St. James's Place. So, naturally, we will continue to invest in this important
area in 2020 and beyond.
The second investment to touch on is technology. 2019 has been a significant period for
our multi-year back-office infrastructure project as we successfully completed the smooth
migration of all our UK business to the new platform. We also completed all the remaining
internal system changes required during the second half of the year and have now
commenced decommissioning of the legacy system.
All our UK business is now processed on a modern technology platform, which provides
us with the scalability to accommodate our growing business needs. Greater operational
resilience and enables us to improve our service to clients going forward. This was a
significant milestone for the business. We can now start to leverage this modern
technology by increasing the system's functionality and capabilities.
At last year's full year results presentation Ian MacKenzie provided an update on
technology, where we were, what we were already doing and the many digital tools
available to partners and clients with a roadmap for the coming years. We are committed
to investing in the right technologies and we'll be providing all advisers with access to
leading-edge technology through a relationship with sales force, the number one global
provider of CRM tools.
This will include access to Einstein Analytics for financial services, an artificial intelligence
tool to provide additional insight to our partners. Together with Bluedoor, we will have a
world-class scalable ecosystem coupled with artificial intelligence to deliver operational
excellence and support advising clients into the 2020s. The cost of delivery will be funded
from our usual planned growth in expenses over the next couple of years. And over time,
this will become a business enabler improving service efficiency and allowing seamless

FINAL

integration with best of breed FinTech solutions. And as part of business as usual, we've
also been and will continue to invest in cyber and data.
At the start of the new decade, we are embarking on a brand enhancement project.
Whilst we see significant opportunities ahead, we can also see challenges from increased
competition, disruptive technologies and societal changes. We also know that some
consumers don't fully understand the value of advice and if they do, they don't always
think of us as the obvious place to start.
Despite being the largest advice company in the UK, we rank low for awareness beyond
our existing clients. We need to change that perception and of all of our brands to
differentiate us to make us ever more relevant to society and to strengthen the brand to
help drive growth. We are in the early stages of the project and we'll provide more detail
later. Suffice to say, the cost of this project will be absorbed in our normal expense
growth. Craig has already covered our investments in Asia and Rowan Dartington, further
investment we are making today for growth tomorrow.
Let's move on to talk about our prospects. As you've heard me say many times before,
the size of the market is large and growing with a considerable savings gap that needs to
be bridged. The need and demand for trusted face to face advice has never been
greater. There is a structural change in the way the individuals are able to access and
utilize their pensions alongside a long-term shift from annuities to income drawdown
driving DC consolidation. These structural changes provide a very large opportunity for
the advice sector. Meanwhile, the number of advisers in the UK is insufficient creating an
advice gap, whilst at the same time there is an expected GBP1 trillion intergenerational
transfer of wealth over the next decade.
The perfect environment for client-focused advice business like St. James's Place and we
are well placed to address this opportunity. However, like any sectoral business, growth
will not be delivered in a straight line there will be good years and lean years, we've seen
this in the past and will no doubt see variations in the future. So, it makes total sense to
look through short-term noise, continue to be totally focused on what we do, do this
exceptionally well and continue to invest for the creation of long-term shareholder value.
And let's put this into context by returning to our historic flows for a moment. Earlier, you
saw this slide showing our consistent quarterly net inflows, supported by the excellent
retention of existing client investments. Whilst the strong retention is something we are
quite rightly proud off, the other component is attracting new business and here you can
see the same chart for gross inflows. New client investments every quarter of every year.
And translating that into annual flows the position looks like this. Yes, there is variability
year by year. No, we haven't recorded 15% every year. But over this 12-year period, we
have achieved compound growth of 14%. As you can see we attracted new client
investments throughout the cycle.
Now, why is this, well, paramount is that we are an advice business, providing holistic longterm financial advice, our partners are helping clients navigate their life journey. This isn't
just an investment decision. Sure, investment returns, investment alpha, if you like, is

Page 8 of 23

FINAL

important. But of equal if not more important is the relationship alpha and the advice
alpha backed FTSE 100 company. Clients are investing for clear demonstrable purpose.
And let's simplify the advice process by thinking of our flows in two distinct categories,
buckets, if you like. Firstly, business that is less sensitive to short-term uncertainty or
market conditions such as clients utilizing their annual tax allowances, planning for intergenerational wealth transfer and pension consolidation. This business quite rightly
continues despite market conditions. And this bucket accounts for the vast majority of our
business.
The second bucket I will refer to is discretionary investment, the proceeds from the sale
of an asset or business, a bonus or an inheritance as an example. Naturally, discretionary
investment is sensitive to market conditions, but also particularly sensitive to uncertainty
where such conditions prevail and discretionary investment may be delayed. We have
seen this throughout our history during major times of uncertainty.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking back at 2008 to illustrate the point you can see gross flows were down 9%.
Whilst we can't predict the future, we can draw comfort from the past, historically, once
the uncertainty has been removed and clients have invested. This is evidenced from our
experience in 2010 where we saw growth of 35%. So, we can draw optimism from the
past experience and with the Parliamentary majority providing greater political stability,
investor sentiment has improved. And as we have already said this morning, we are
seeing this improved investor sentiment being reflected in an increase in activity across
the business with new client investments seeing a return to good growth in the early part
of the year.
So, to conclude, the market opportunity is very large and growing. We are the market
leader, the partnership is 8% larger than this time last year, the Academy is performing
really well. We have successfully completed the Bluedoor program and can start to
leverage the system's capabilities. Our client proposition and advocacy remain strong.
Both Asia and Rowan Dartington continue to progress, and let's not forget, we are fast
approaching a material maturity of funds from gestation from which the cash result will
see a boost. Uncertainties remain for the UK and there are market concerns as a result of
the coronavirus. But we are encouraged by the start of the year, which together with the
strength and scale of our business gives us confidence, we are well placed to continue to
grow. Our business is in great shape and we look to the future with confidence hence our
proposed 5% increase in the final dividend.
So, thank you for your attention and if I could ask, Craig, and Ian to join me for questions.
And whilst Craig and Ian are coming up I notice Sir Mark Weinberg, our regional founder
arrive. Mark, you are very welcome.

Q - Colm Kelly

{BIO 19140684 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you very much. Colm Kelly, UBS. Three questions. The first, just on the cash margin
on the average mature funds under management, which is very much in line with the
guidance you gave at the half year. You're reiterating the guidance, again, for 2020, so
does that imply we shouldn't see any mix effect, negative mix effect coming in for 2020,
driven by the higher pension business or are there other moving parts within that that we
need to consider.
The second question is just on the solvency, I think, the stability, the underlying stability of
the life solvency is really a important point and if we think about the dividend capacity. So, I
think, the life business paid about GBP210 million to the Group in 2019. What's been able
to maintain stable solvency an above GBO110 million? So, should we see that as a rough
indication of the dividend capacity of SJP, UK to upstream to the Group. And related to
that, given that the shareholder dividend is GBP40 million to GBP50 million higher than
that, are you confident that the other subsidiaries in the Group, namely the Unit Trust
business, St. James's Place International can upstream consistent cash flow to maintain
healthy dividend coverage on that cash basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then just lastly on the payout ratio on IFRS, it remains high at about 180%. I appreciate
that's not the primary measure of the performance of the business, but at the same time,
it's not a measure that should remain at that level for a very long time. So, to what extent
is that come into the discussion around the dividend each year and is there any allowance
in the business plan for the IFRS payout ratio to normalize down to lower levels? Thanks.

But I'm going to pass them to Craig.

A - Craig Gentle

{BIO 20095126 <GO>}

So, the margin on mature FUM, you're absolutely right guided to be the same. And you
also absolutely right that's because the net effect of whatever the mix is doing and I see
new Unit Trust and ISA business going straight in and gestation maturing have a
compensating effect, which means the overall margin for 2020 is expected to be pretty
much the same as it was for 2019. The Solvency II ratio, we haven't published any
underlying data, but if you were to look at the capacity for the 2018 year end and think
about that in the context of the 2019 dividend and then think about the capacity in 2019 in
order to support the 2020 dividend, you wouldn't be too far out.
The payout ratio, a few things there, obviously -- I think, the question you're asking is
around IFRS distributable profits. And we have a material stock of IFRS distributable profits
Page 10 of 23

FINAL

and is largely because of the way the Group grew at its early years. So, if anything were
challenged a long time ago was -- that was distributable profits emerging throughout the
Group. But the cash wasn't being generated in order to distribute those distributable
profits. So, in short, distributable profit is always a consideration is one of the things you
have to think about. But that is not blocking any critical path and we continue to have a
material stock.
In terms of the shape of that, a really important thing to remember is, we've always talked
in terms of underlying cash. And underlying cash has excluded a very significant project
called Bluedoor, which went through the IFRS accounts in the same way the every other
expense goes through the IFRS accounts. So, subject to the GBP10 million that I've guided
on today, you will see a sharp realignment they are perfect one because you've got that
there and all sorts of other things going on in IFRS, but you will see a sharp realignment
when you look at the bottom line figures.

Thank you. Morning. Jon Hocking, Morgan Stanley. I've got three questions, please. Firstly,
starting with the credit levy, it's about 10% the cash result now. If you -- what you're seeing
in terms of your adviser headcount growth. You seem to have sort of growing proportion
of industry advisers. Is it fair to say that as long as you keep growing the adviser count like
that, the FSCS levy is going to keep growing fast than underlying cash, is it unfair?
Second question, on the adviser productivity, over the last few periods that's flattened
out a little bit. I wondered if you could sort of explain a little bit, how much of that is
actually just a sort of market impact of gross flows, and how much of that is actually the
increased mix of new advisers coming through the Academy?
Second question -- the final question, you mentioned the coronavirus, just wanted how
well the Partnership is equipped to sort of work remotely if that becomes necessary at
some point? Thank you.

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Craig, do you want to figure out the levy point first?

A - Craig Gentle

{BIO 20095126 <GO>}

Yeah, the -- unfortunately, the answer is -- don't think of it in terms of adviser headcount,
but think of it in terms of our share of the advice market based on the current construct of
FSCS. If we continue to grow and if our market share continues to grow and if the FSCS
budget continues to increase then those charges will continue to go up. But is not linked
to the number of advisers, it's linked to the overall value of activity and market share.

And I'll start with the coronavirus and then pass it over to Ian, now clearly our major
concern around coronavirus is going to be our own people. So, you wouldn't be too
surprised to know we have a business continuity team that you've met on a number of
occasions have updated both the executive and the general population. Where the
business is impacted at this point in time is in Asia. We have a very, very small Shanghai
office, people in Shanghai are working remotely, the office is closed. And we are obviously
taking logical precautions in both Hong Kong and Singapore. Although, I would say that
both of those offices have had a very good start to the year in terms of flows.
In terms of the partnership.

A - Ian Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

Yeah, you're right, Jon. In terms of adviser productivity, the two elements there, market
conditions and Academy graduates arm is productive in the first two or three years. And
so that the two things together may have a flattening impact, however, at the start of this
year market conditions have been a lot better and so I suspect this year we'll see a
increase in average adviser productivity.

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

And I think just one other thing about the Academy is the average age is 34, so if you put
a net present value on these advisers if they stay with us throughout their career, that's a
very strong investment. And the coronavirus partners' ability to Skype and...

A - Ian Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

Well, absolutely, I mean, 80% of our partners work out of office anyway, they're not based
in offices. Within our offices, we've taken activity and actions to have cleansing facilities
and notice of what they should be doing. We're not seeing any evidence at the moment
of clients not visiting offices, partners are very resilient at finding ways around, having
meetings with clients either through Skype or telephone conversations. And so, at the
moment, we're not seeing any evidence of any slowdown.

Thanks. It's Andy Sinclair from Bank of America. Three from me. Firstly, is on tax relief,
which has unknowingly come back on to the budget agenda again, it sounds like, just
wondered if you can remind us, how much of your pension flows are actually genuinely
new to the system to the pension system each year versus just transparency and things
like that, and how much tax relief you actually get on those?
Secondly, just wondering if you could talk again about the strong growth in the
Partnership, can you split it out to -- into new recruits, Academy graduates versus

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Okay. So, I'll pick up the tax relief, I think, this is the sort of perennial question and it comes
up to budget time. I don't have an exact number to give you, Andrew. But the majority is
pensions consolidation most definitely and if you think about the annual allowance is now
GBP40,000, you also have tapering once you earn over GBP150,000 and is also the
lifetime allowance. So, many of our clients have already actually stopped contributing on a
regular basis to pensions and are using other investment tools. I guess, we wait to see
what happens on March 11, doesn't it, I think. So, yeah, Ian, do you want to do the sort of
growth in the advisers retention?

A - Ian Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

Yeah. I'll [ph], so the makeup of our new joiners would be that I think the numbers are in
the pack for new Academy graduates. So, you can work out what the balance is and they
will be experienced advisers joining the business, give me a bit more time, I'll find the
number, and maybe we can pick it up afterwards. The number of experienced advisers in
the United Kingdom is pretty level or contracting in my take. And growth, for us to
maintain our growth ambitions we have to kind of grow our own people. And the success
of the Academy in terms of taking second career risks [ph], having a longer training
period in other organizations, and then having a facility where we can put them into
existing businesses because the -- for an Academy graduate starting in the business is
the toughest period, but because we've got existing businesses that can provide a home
for them as they go through a training period and apprenticeship period and the kind of -and then have a mentor in development as the figures have been seen as being quite
successful. And we mentioned that so 12% of our new business is from Academy
graduates, 15% in London and here in the city, the city office in Lombard Street 25% of our

I've not seen any evidence that it's -- the retentions worsening. The retention is good
here. I mean, we have the -- one of the other advantages of the model is that it allows
pre-retirement partners to stay being active on a part-time basis having through BSP sold
part of that business to some of these Academy graduates, so they are coming in. So,
we've got an awful lot of partners who in an older model would have stepped off, but it's
staying on to service their top clients. So, these are advisers with lots of experience, lots
of growth there and maintaining relationships with our clients.

A - Craig Gentle

{BIO 20095126 <GO>}

Yeah. They are probably quite different stories really because with Asia, I think, it's fair to
say that the experience of 2019 will prompt a reassessment of the points at which net
cash will emerge. I've said that in 2020, we expect to get back to where we were at the
2018 year-end. That's our ambition. Given that at the end of 2018 we were talking in terms
of a five-year path to become cash neutral. My best estimate at this stage would be five
years from the point at which we bring that back into line, but it's important to remember
that the way we do that and what you have seen in the past and this is the same for
Rowan Dartington is that we grow the adviser base which grows the income. So, a lot of
investments is supported by that growth in income which takes me to the killer point
really, it's sort of within our gift as to when some of this turns cash positive.
And if you take Rowan Dartington, for example, we are still committed to some pretty
significant investments in that business over the next few years. We could potentially if we
choose to end up with a business that's not a business of scale turn that cash positive
quite quickly. But as we see things at the moment, it's succeeding and the likelihood is, If
anything, we'll see further opportunities down the path to create scale and in an industry
that doesn't have many businesses that have that quality, so.

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Oliver Steel, Deutsche Bank. Three questions. The first is on the latest guidance for
expense growth of 9% in 2020. How -- I mean, if your sales absolutely sort of sold in the
current year, is that 9% going to flex upwards as your previous 10% guidance has done in
the past. That's sort of 1A. 1B is, what about growth looking out beyond 2020 in that
expense line.
And second question is, DB to DC transfers, the -- I mean, across the industry that sort of
skills of pain that smaller advisers can't get professional indemnity cover. What are you
seeing in terms of your PI cover, what are you seeing in terms of -- or what are you
expecting in terms of DB to DC transfer flows in the current year relative to last year?
And then the final question is, industry competition, I'm not expecting you to give a view
or an outlook on your own charges. So, I don't think there's much point in asking that
question and I think you've actually won the debate that you're not actually right at the top
of the charging structure anyway, but what is happening across the industry that at the
upper levels of charges. What are you hearing there, what are you thinking -- how quickly
are you expecting charges across the industry to come down?

Craig, you want to do the expense growth?

A - Craig Gentle

{BIO 20095126 <GO>}

Yeah. I think, it's fair to say across the Executive Board and a pretty strong commitment,
Oliver, to land establishment expense growth at a level of 9%. Now, does that mean that I
can't envisage a set of circumstances where the right thing to do would be to spend, to
invest in an opportunity or something that would drive future growth, I think, we would
have to reserve that, right. But we are committed to that 9% figure, I think, that's probably
the best way I can summarize it. There was a part B and I'm afraid I didn't hear part B.
Sorry.

We're very conscious that the jaws opened up in 2019. And we are very committed to
saying what we can do to try and reverse some of that because you get the
compounding effect. We brought them down quite significantly in the second half of 2019.

That wasn't one single thing, it was lots and lots of little things, each of which had a
judgment behind that. And that's the important thing. And if we -- if in our judgment it was
something that could either be canceled or deferred safely without it impacting on the
business, that's what we did. And once you get into the habit of doing that, I think,
certainly, as a CFO, it's a habit I'd like to continue to foster.

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

I'll pick up the DB to DC, this has been a market that's always been there and the key
driver really is going to be transfer values. But in most cases a DB transfer is almost
certainly not the best thing to do. We have very strict guidelines, our partners who
operate in this market are separately licensed or DB transfer business is pre-approved by
our compliance people and that's pre-approved. And I think that market will always be
there. In terms of professional indemnity insurance, we're aware of the issues in some of
the -- in the market, we don't see that as an opportunity, we will carry on sticking with
what we do.
I'm not aware, that our Insurance has increased at all, but I'm just not aware and Craig is
not aware either. So if it increase, we would have sort of known. In terms of industry
competition we are probably best placed to talk about what we see in the face to face
advice market rather than the sort of self serve DIY market, but what you do see is other
entrants coming into the -- what that's called the DIY market. Do you want to talk about
sort of advice charges that we see out there as a whole?

Yes, thank you.

A - Ian Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

(Multiple Speakers) to acknowledge that. Thanks. I think, the debate over charges is more
about it should be a debate overvalued and were driven into a charge related debate
when actually what the clients are looking for are for the investment alpha, the
relationship alpha, the advice alpha, what do they get out of the relationship with this
person overall the rest of the life and what they're trying to achieve in that life. But
doesn't necessarily mean that you can over charge, obviously, you have to be
competitive, which we are. But what the industry seems, there is obsession with a few bps
here and a few bps there, compared with what the client -- the value the client gets out,
the long-term relationship with a partner who is in a sustainable business working for a
sustainable that's backed by the guarantee seems to seems to support client satisfaction
and doing business with the partners. So, there is margin pressure, there is margin
pressure in every industry all the time and we are aware of that and partners do have the
opportunity to flex charges with clients if so be it.

Good morning. It's Andrew Crean for Autonomous. Three questions, if I can.

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Why does everyone have three questions (Multiple Speakers)

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Given your guidance, Craig, I think your overall expenses going to grow 8% this year, the
total, not just the establishment expenses. There is a set of circumstances under which
your gross flows, which represent the quarter of your revenues might be flat again if
coronavirus chips into a bear market, which would push your, I suspect would push your
payout ratio above 100%. Are you comfortable with that? What would be the dividend
policy in that downside scenario?

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, in terms of your gross flow guidance, you've always said 15% to 20%, but I think
since 2007 it's 10% and [ph] 14%, is there any change to that long-term guidance. And do
you think that this year is going to hit your long-term guidance.
And then finally, if I could there was a figure, which I think, Ian, you gave at a meeting
privately, which is that the initial costs were not 5%, but actually 3% because partners
actually lowered the charge, negotiated lower charge, is that still the case?

A - Ian Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

I think, well, it's good for me to clarify that. And that was in relation to our ISA and Unit
Trust business in relation to the 5% bit of a spread and the average that was actually
charged by partners at point of sale was 2.9%. So, that was...

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

And does that cover across your business?

A - Ian Gascoigne

A - Ian Gascoigne

mentioned, the average charge was 2.9%.

FINAL

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Okay. On the 15% to 20%, and I'll now hand over to Craig for the dividend. I don't want to
get drawn into specific year, part of my presentation was that you get good years and you
can have some more difficult years. The 14%, by the way, and I did think about do I want to
put up 14% when it's 15% type thing, but that's on the back of two difficult years. So, that's
just the normal variability going in there. And what we aim to do is to carry on growing the
Partnership, carry on helping the Partnership improve their efficiency. And, therefore, long
term we should be able to continue to do what we've always done, but it isn't going to be
in a straight line and that's the problem. Okay.
Craig, you want to pick up that?

A - Craig Gentle

{BIO 20095126 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Give them all [ph].

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Craig Gentle

{BIO 20095126 <GO>}

I'll answer the question by starting where we were back in July when we were having a
similar conversation and the question was, would you be prepared to see the payout ratio
go up at the end of the year if certain things happen. And the answer at that time was,
yes, we would, but it would depend on the circumstances. And the question of whether
you're happy for a payout ratio to move in any direction will always depend on the
circumstances, that prevailed at the time you make that decision.
You're right. You could theoretically end up in a situation where gross flows full and
remained flat, but the one thing that isn't going to change is the flow of cash from that
GBP40 billion of gestation. So, there will always be a significant -- because of the business
model, there will always be a significant feeder into the cash result.
But the question as to whether a payout ratio can change, if you remember, back in July,
we said we are very confident in the business, but if you think about what we had at the
time we had political instability, we had a massive migration to complete during the
course of the second half which carries risk. And we had just reported flows that were
down. We still have the confidence, but they were the circumstances.
You wind the clock forward now and as we've said in the presentations, there is, you
might -- people might not like the politics, but there is political stability compared to
where we were. We've seen a turn in the business and we still got the funds in gestation
and sentiment is higher. There the circumstances at the moment. If I project any kind of
model forward and any impact that that model can have on our cash result, I have to give
the same answer, it will depend on how we feel about the business.

Q - Charlie Beeching

{BIO 21296314 <GO>}

Thanks. It's Charlie Beeching from KBW. Just pertaining to pension transfer business, I
believe the PRAs and the FCAs scheduled to publish on charging by the end of the
quarter. Just do you have any further thoughts on this, please? And secondly on sales
force, how much do you expect this to cost to rollout and over what time period? Thank
you.

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Sure. I'll pick up the pension transfer, you're right, there is a paper due imminently. We are
clearly don't know what that paper is going to say. We think banning contingent charging
will sort of limit access to advice, so we think that's not -- that would be a shame. In terms
of our own business, what happens is that you would go into something full advice and
you would have to pay whether or not you do the transfer or not. And because of the high
hurdles of where we operate with significant transfer values and other assets, the majority
would go through full advice and the advice would still be to transfer. But there is no
doubt that there will be cases, let's call a margin of cases where the decision isn't taken
not to go through full advice, because I don't want to pay a charge if the answer is going
to be no. And, sorry, the second one, sales force.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Craig Gentle

{BIO 20095126 <GO>}

Yeah. The way to look at sales force, firstly and to be very clear, the sales force will not
result in a new below the line charge called Bluedoor (inaudible). It's fundamentally
different, it's a significant investment within the business, but it's all budgeted as part of
our normal ongoing investments in technology. You'll -- you won't see it, but you'll kind of
see it in operational developments where I guided that the increase in operational
developments will be slightly higher than 10% and that accommodates the path of sales
force that will be charged to that line. So, there won't be any new below the line
disclosures for sales force. And although it is significant, it pales into insignificance
compared to the Bluedoor journey that we've been on, it's important for the business,
but it is no where near of that scale.

Q - Barrie Cornes

{BIO 2389115 <GO>}

Good morning. It's Barrie Cornes, Panmure Gordon. Just really one question, you came
into sort of a lot of criticism concerning remuneration of the Partnership during the year
and that seems to have completely reversed from the same quarters. Just wondered,
how is the Partnership feeling about remuneration going forward, do they know what the
new structure will be and what's their feeling?

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think, so it's interesting, I was with the group of partners, I mean, yesterday in Edinburgh
and we have this conversation. I think the second half of last year the Partnership was
feeling pretty morale wounded, I would say, but bittersweet [ph] because of the media
and the political environment and the uncertainty of the Brexit. They have come back this
year with a real spring in their step. They are absolutely aligned with the desire for us to
have a greater level of clients metrics that can have a positive or negative impact on their
remuneration.
There is an immense desire at the moment for more detail and I appreciate that, and I
understand where they are. We have a group of the executives working on this with a
view to being able to provide that detail at the half year. There is a big sophisticated
businesses running employee and lots of people with lots of revenue decisions. And so
anything that impacts on revenue has to be well thought through and right for them, right
for the clients and right for the business.
So, it's not a quick fix. But the sense of direction has been made quite clear, and
interestingly, we talk about sales force and sales force's ability to record in far greater
detail, client interactions will help the metrics to do with this project. The Partnership are in
a good place, I feel at the moment, certainly yesterday in the meetings, I've had, it's been
a great start to the year.

FINAL

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

It's Johnny Vo from Goldman Sachs. Craig, I think, this morning you spoke about, you said
that the Group's solvency is likely to decline. So, I was just wondering, given that the life
solvency is quite low and probably impacted by interest rates further given where interest
rates are, if the dividend from the life company is lower than expected are you going to
subsidize the dividend from cash in your holding company?
The second question just relates to provisioning and the coverage ratio, the NPLs what
sort of coverage ratio should we expect from the NPLs that are appearing on your
balance sheet. And the third question is just in terms of the relatively poor performance of
some of these loans on balance sheet, underperforming loans have increased, probably
about 70%. And is that going to impact any of your potential securitization going forward
and your ability to move these loans off balance sheet? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Craig Gentle

{BIO 20095126 <GO>}

So, solvency in the life company, I probably disagree with the word low, we have an
approach, which means we hold an enormous amounts of capital for operational risk. As I
mentioned earlier, we -- our business model means we don't face market risk, which was
usually needs to be captured within that sort of capital calculation. And the idea that 110%
or 111% or 112% is low is not the way to look at that. What we have is a chosen level of
capital and our chosen level of capital is equal to 110% of the standard formula. So, it's not
something that where we're running down, it's a number that we regard as safe
appropriate and sustainable.
And then, of course, in any business, once you've chosen your level of appetite for
capital, that will have an influence on distributions, dividends, expenses and everything
else. So, I don't think there's anything more to say really on capital.
On provisioning coverage ratios, am I right in thinking you're referring to partner lending? I
mean, the reality is, on a book of GBP400-and-something-million, the level of bad debt
experience is borderline negligible and the reason for that is that we generate the flows
on our systems that repay the loans. We're not even like a mortgage business where we
are relying on somebody to make a decision from their own bank account. We generate
that revenue and we put the transaction through to the loan. So, we've got probably 28
years of experience...

But the NPL is a 200 bps, I mean, if this isn't [ph] mortgage book, you will be at 20 bps,
so, and these are growing.

But then if you look to the mortgage book, I can think of two mortgage cycles you have
been through over the last x number of years that would have result in crystallized losses
and you won't see that in our book.

But what is causing these lines to underperform?

A - Craig Gentle

{BIO 20095126 <GO>}

They are so negligible, I wouldn't -- they -- a classic example that these happen very, very
infrequently, you could end up in the situation where we park company with an adviser
under difficult circumstances. And if we see that that's the best way to part company, we
will take a loss on the lending. But it -- we got to put these in context, they are tiny
numbers in the scale of loan book that we have. And I would say the same thing for the
underperforming. Underperforming is an IFRS heading and I'm afraid it's a little bit
alarmist. Let me give you an example of something that would become underperforming,
let's imagine, I'm a partner, I have a loan, I'll have a very long credit history with St.
James's Place, I might approach and say, could I have a repayment holiday for six months,
because I want to do something -- it could be something like a divorce even.
I need to work my way through something, can I have a repayment holiday? If this
happens in such a way that that loan then becomes operational other than in accordance
with the original terms and conditions, we are required to badge it as underperforming.
That does not mean it's impaired because the only reason we're prepared to make that
decision is because of the quality of the security. So, we hold pretty much every single
piece of information and every right that a lender would dream of, which is why the
numbers that we're looking at is so small. So, the loss is on our book, probably as low as
you will ever see in a lending book.

I think, I'll just come in back up there, I was surprised by the question, so I just wasn't
seeing that. And having been a CFO before, we have a very, very low write-off, it is
secured on the partners' business and their own personal assets. But there will be times
where can I have a repayment holiday, please, we look at the business and say, yes, of
course. And so I wasn't expecting that question at all.
Could we just pass over to Ashik and may call out the last question, we are coming up to
quarter two.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Ashik Musaddi from JP Morgan. Just couple of question. Is there any update on
the regulatory front, especially driven there is a lot of noise about early retirement
charges. Have you heard anything in past six months, is there a process going on to
review those charges again. I mean, just trying to get some sense if there is anything
going on in the background, which we should be aware of.

Secondly, on partners, I mean, clearly, there is a bit of increased competition from adviser
recruitment, I think, from some of your new competitors. Have you seen any unexpected
dislocation in terms of your hiring approach or people leaving because of someone
paying extra or something like that. So, any thoughts on that or is it still business as usual
on your Partnership side? Thank you.

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Ian, do you want to do the Partnership side?

A - Ian Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

Yeah. I think, it's business as usual, I don't -- we've not seen any dislocation, there is
potential occasionally a bit more competition for an adviser who is thinking of moving, but
the proposition is strong and we've got a good recruitment team and people have got
choice. I'm not aware recruitment flows are strong and retention is strong, so at the
moment it's business as usual.

A - Craig Gentle

{BIO 20095126 <GO>}

And we're not in any active conversations with the regulator around charging structures or
anything like that.

Should we -- we are just coming up to quarter to 12, so should we just draw a close that
you know where to find us. And you do very well at doing that but thank you very much
again for coming this morning. I know it's been a busy day in the markets, as Nick [ph]
called, Super Thursday or something today with all the companies reporting. So, thank you
very much.
