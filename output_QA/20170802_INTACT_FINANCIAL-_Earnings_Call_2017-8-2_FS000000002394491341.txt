FINAL

Thanks again. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning.
Yesterday evening, we announced second quarter net operating income of CAD 1.44 per share
driven by healthy underlying underwriting results and continued growth in distribution income.
Results were impacted by CAD 0.58 per share from CAT losses, which, while lower than last year,
were higher than expected.
Many of our customers, particularly in Québec and Ontario, face the consequences of one of the
heaviest spring rainfalls on record but as usuals, our troops work hard to get our customers back
on track.
Our top line was up 2% led by continued momentum in personal property. Growth in personal auto
and commercial P&C was tempered as our disciplined profitability actions including rate increases
flow through in a competitive marketplace. Our specialty lines business continued to contribute to
grow this quarter again.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the combined ratio, I'm not satisfied with 95%. But when I look at our underlying results, I see
strong performance in personal property and commercial lines, and continued momentum in
personal auto as our profitability actions in that line gain traction.
Our operating ROE improved to 12.1% for the past 12 months despite some 2 points from excess
CAT losses. We ended the quarter in a very strong financial position with over CAD 1 billion of total
excess capital.
When we compare ourselves to the industry at the end of the first quarter, we outperform by 550
basis points on ROE, above our target of 500 points. But to be clear, while we exceed our ROE
outperformance target, we don't view a 12% ROE as an acceptable performance level and we
remain focused on expanding our advantage.
So, let's now look at our second quarter results by line of business. Personal auto grew 1% in the
quarter as our rate actions implemented earlier this year are resulting as anticipated in some nearterm top line pressure. Our combined ratio rose slightly to 97.8% due to deterioration in prior year
development, but when I look at our underlying performance excluding pools, it improved close to
2 points year-over-year. This is consistent with the actions we've taken to-date and as further
supported by expense ratio improvements. We still expect rate increases together with continued
benefits from reforms and our claims action plan to bring mid-single-digit combined ratio
improvement in this segment in the latter part of this year.
When it comes to the industry outlook for auto, we continue to anticipate a competitive
environment with low- to mid-single-digit growth in the coming 12 months as rate increases are
implemented to address claims cost inflation. In personal property, premiums grew a healthy 6%
as recently introduced products and continued rate increases were deployed in favorable market
conditions.
The combined ratio of 99.5% included 16.9 points of catastrophes, mainly heavy precipitation in
Québec and Ontario. That said, our underlying performance was very strong and positions this line
very well going forward.
In terms of the industry outlook for personal prop, we expect the elevated CAT losses to support
continued firm market conditions and mid-single-digit growth over the next 12 months as the
industry continues to adjust to changing weather patterns.



FINAL

Turning to commercial P&C, while continuing competitive market conditions challenge our growth,
this business is performing very well. Our pricing and segmentation actions are paying off and the
combined ratio for this business line was excellent at 85.3%, while underlying performance
continued to improve by 1.8 points.
In commercial auto, premium grew 7% on the back of multiple initiatives and specialty lines. The
combined ratio for the quarter was strong at 89.9% as we continued to drive our profitability
actions to deliver a sustainable low 90s combined ratio in this line. We expect low-single-digit
growth in the coming year for commercial lines as markets remain very competitive across the
country.
Now turning to progress on our strategy. As you know, we announced the acquisition of
OneBeacon on May 2. The approval process is in progress and on July 18, shareholders of
OneBeacon approved the transaction. We received U.S. antitrust approval and we're on track to
close this fall. Transition planning with the folks at OneBeacon is well underway and we're looking
forward to the prospect of joining forces and creating a leading North American specialty lines
insurer.

Bloomberg Transcript

There's increasing alignment and momentum on the areas that require strong profitability
improvement. Two months into transition planning, we have greater confidence in our synergy
estimates and our roadmap to a low 90s combined ratio is shared and clear.
We also see significant opportunity to leverage the OneBeacon products in Canada and open up
cross-border capabilities, which will allow us to deliver broker and customer experiences, which are
second to none. We'll also be much better positioned to compete with international insurers here
in Canada.
The financials of the acquisition in our view are also compelling and we expect to generate midsingle-digit net operating income per share accretion within 24 months. We've already put in place
a large portion of the financing, which Louis will review in a moment.
So, while OneBeacon provides attractive diversification of our business and a significant new
growth pipeline, we very much remain focused on our domestic business. On the customer
experience front, we launched our new Montréal claims service center in April. Along with our
centers in Calgary, Ottawa and Toronto, we now have four locations across Canada, which have, to
date, served over 9,000 customers. Intact and belairdirect customers would choose to use the
service centers, benefit from an easier experience, higher-quality repairs and on average, at 25%
lower repair time. Satisfaction is up materially.
So in conclusion, I'm pleased with our healthy underlying performance, which demonstrated yet
again the resilience of our operations under challenged condition. Our commercial and personal
property lines are performing well and our profitability initiatives in personal auto are gaining
traction. Our financial position is very strong.
Momentum is good as we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives with a customer-focused
mindset, while the OneBeacon acquisition will open up new growth pipelines for our business. With
an ROE above 12% after absorbing elevated CAT losses and subpar personal auto performance,
we have a strong base to improve from.
I'm confident that the strategies we have in place position us well to deliver on our financial
objectives, to outperform the industry ROE by at least 500 basis points, and grow our operating
income per share by 10% per year over time.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Marcotte.

FINAL

Thanks, Charles. Good morning, everyone.
For the second quarter, net operating income of CAD 193 million was CAD 79 million better than
last year, which included Fort McMurray wildfires. The improvement was driven by better underlying
underwriting results, lower CAT losses and a higher distribution earnings. Somewhat offsetting this
is prior year development, which declined year-over-year.
Overall, our earnings per share grew 172% to CAD 1.82, driving the ROE to 12.3%. While Q2 CAT
losses were lower than last year, they remain elevated. However, we are maintaining our annual
run rate guidance at CAD 250 million as it is based on long-term trends. We still expect half of the
CATs to occur in the third quarter.
On auto, prior year development is down 4.2 points in the second quarter. There are two main
drivers for the change year-over-year. First, a 1.6-point deterioration from pools, which had high
favorable development last year. The remainder relates to development on some large files,
which predated June 2016 reforms. Despite the lower prior year development, we see personal
auto's underlying profitability gaining traction, with further improvements expected in the coming
quarters.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our expense ratio improved 2.3 points to 29.4% driven by lower variable expenses and our cost
saving initiatives. Our distribution business added CAD 50 million of operating earnings in the
quarter, 16% higher than last year on growth and profitability improvements as we continue to
invest in our broker network. We still expect distribution earnings to grow north of 15% in 2017.
Our Q2 non-operating results improved CAD 83 million in the quarter, reaching CAD 57 million.
Mark-to-market losses on our fixed-income portfolio due to rising interest rates were more than
offset by realized gains from our equity portfolio.
Even though the OneBeacon acquisition is not closed yet, our hedging strategies had an impact in
the quarter. Firstly, the strengthening of the Canadian dollar in Q2 led to a net unrealized loss of
CAD 121 million on the purchase price hedge. This hedge is mark to market through OCI until close,
at which point it will form part of the purchase price of OneBeacon and offset a lower Canadian
dollar equivalent purchase price.
Secondly, we recorded gains of CAD 41 million on our book value hedges related to OneBeacon.
Movements in the value of these hedges flow through non-operating results until close. After
close, these hedges will stay in place and offset some of the currency exposure on the book value
of OneBeacon.
The net impact of currency hedging transactions and acquisitions costs related to OneBeacon was
approximately CAD 0.71 on book value per share in the quarter. Based on the expensive transition
work we've done so far with the OneBeacon team, we've strengthened our belief in the
economics of the deal.
The combined ratio improvements are clearly in sight as we focus on three levers: managing the
portfolio of businesses and the performance of each line of business, capitalizing on Intact's risk
selection analytics and claims expertise across the OneBeacon platform, and capturing synergies
across our businesses including reinsurance, shared services and supply chain. We continue to aim
at a combined ratio in the low 90s within two to three years.
A few words on our financial position and the financing of OneBeacon. Our balance sheet remains
very strong with MCT of 224% at quarter end and total excess capital over CAD 1 billion. This



excludes any proceeds from the financing of OneBeacon. We expect our MCT to remain above
200% after closing of the transaction.

FINAL

We have secured the majority of the financing for OneBeacon at favorable terms. We issued CAD
425 million of tenure notes bearing interest at 2.85%. And CAD 150 million of perpetual preferred
shares that yield 5.2%. The proceeds from these issuances are reflected on our balance sheet.
Our subscription receipt offering raise gross proceeds of CAD 754 million. This transaction is not
yet reflected on our balance sheet at quarter end as the funds are held in escrow and the issuance
is conditional upon close. At close, the subscription receipts will be converted into common shares
and added to our book value.
The balance of the CAD 2.4 billion purchase price, including transaction costs, is expected to be
financed with a combination of excess capital, bank debt and preferred shares. Our debt-to-total
capital ratio was 22.8% at quarter end, slightly above our target level of 20% due to funds raised
and in relation to OneBeacon. We expect to reach 25% at closing. Our ratings were affirmed by all
agencies after the announcements.

Bloomberg Transcript

Concurrent with the OneBeacon announcement, we suspended our NCIB in order to direct excess
capital towards the transaction. Our priority post-closing will be to use excess capital to bring our
leverage back below 20% within two years.
We structured the financing of the OneBeacon transaction conservatively to maintain our balance
sheet strength post close. This is important as we believe that consolidation opportunities in both
manufacturing and distribution will continue in Canada and we want to be in a strong position to
participate as these opportunities arise.
In conclusion, our personal auto profitability plan is gaining traction, commercial lines' performance
remains strong, and personal property remains resilient despite elevated catastrophes. Our
operating earnings are supported by consistent investment income and bolstered by increasing
distribution earnings. We expect this will lead to higher ROEs.
With the OneBeacon transaction, we are opening up a significant new growth and profitability
pipeline while maintaining our financial flexibility to capture additional opportunities as they arise.
With that, I'll return the call back to Ken.

Kenneth Anderson

{BIO 16846692 <GO>}

Thank you, Louis. In order to give everyone a chance to participate in the Q&A, we would ask that
you kindly limit yourself to two questions per person. If there's time at the end, you can re-queue
for a follow-up. So Sheryl, we're now ready to take questions.

Q&A
Operator
Your first question comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning. So, first question is on the mid-single-digit personal auto
improvement in the second half of the year. Could you tell a little bit more detail in term of what
the driver behind that mid-single-digit growth in term of both the core loss ratio as well as the
expense ratio?



A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah, we'll ask Darren to give you a perspective on what's in the pipeline from a loss ratio point of
view and, Louis, you can throw in your comments on the expense side of thing, which, by the way,
is not really part of the improvement plan, but we're certainly pressing on expenses as well in that
sort of environment. So, Darren.

A - Darren Godf rey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Thanks, Kai. In terms of the improvement plan in the second half of the year, we've talked in past
quarters about the momentum we have from a rate increase standpoint. So, if you think back to
last quarter, we had earned rate increases of close to 2%, 1.8% in particular. We saw earned rate
increases in the second quarter of just over 3%. That will actually continue to grow into Q3 and Q4.
The gap between written and earned was 3 points in Q2. Our written increases will continue but
peak in Q3 and that gap will start to shrink as the earned premium gains momentum.
So, we have a lot further additional earned rate increases flowing into the second half of the year.
A lot of the actions we're taking from an underwriting standpoint, from a risk selection standpoint,
they will also continue to build as the year progresses and then, obviously, the action from Patrick's
team in claims as well will continue to gain momentum.
So, we're very encouraged in terms of what we see in the second quarter with two points of
improvement before pools, not satisfied obviously, but that momentum is building and our actions
are gaining traction for the latter half of 2017.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And if I can add, I think one of the things that's interesting in the quarter as you see that the
frequency and the severity in the markets where the action plans are bolder have actually started
to come down, which is, in my mind, a reflection of the non-rate action and it has upset some of
the bumps we've seen in other jurisdictions where there's no need really for action plans at this
stage.
So, that's encouraging and I think the written mix change to a certain extent, which will get earned
in the remaining part of the year, hopefully, will have a positive impact on frequency and severity.
And we have done a lot of work on the expense front with the region in the past, well, 10 years but
in the past year in particular. Maybe you want to give a bit of color there.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Sure. Thanks, Charles. So, on the expense front, what we have done is shaped some expenses
from last year – at the end of last year and that impacted this year's expense ratio. I would say that
probably is a bit less than half a point of the improvement and it flows through all lines of business.
The other big chunk that's impacting this quarter in particular are the variable expenses, those
include both the variable commissions, as well as variable compensation. So, those are linked to
current profitability, and because it's been lower than expected, those variable expenses are
reduced.
I'm hoping that as we increase the profitability, some of that will flow back through. But the
structural – what I would call the structural, which is really what we have shaved in expenses, is a
nearly half a point of overall general expenses.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's great. Thanks.



A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

The other piece that is not to be neglected is the work that we're doing in claims to address
inflation in automobile and maybe Patrick, you want to take a minute or two to give a perspective
of what's in the pipeline in claims that should pay off over the next 12, 24 months.

FINAL

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yes. So, over the past six to nine months, we've also implemented the list of actions trying to
address different sources of cost pressures we're seeing in this line of business. If I group some of
those actions into wide categories, the first one is tighter indemnity controls leveraging our
national IT platform that we deployed over the past two years. Those are controls that are
deployed in supporting the operations in identifying opportunities to reduce cycle times or reduce
(21:51) like rentals, and also controlling better the process of the repairs with the networks in terms
of parts used and the like.

Bloomberg Transcript

We also have accelerated our data analytics deployment in the fields of segregation (22:07), fraud
detection, supply chain management, which is starting to bring benefits. And lastly, maybe you
have mentioned to – we have also action plans specific to the longer tail lines like accident benefit
in Ontario, where we're focused on leveraging our Health Rely Network, so those clinics have a
better track record than average in bringing our clients back to work, which also helps on our cost
side.
And on the BI (22:32), we are very focused on maintaining settlements within minor injury
regulation by increasing staff and trying to sell those claims very early before they (22:42). And
that's without mentioning also as a reminder that the Ontario reforms launched last June have not
fully been reflected yet in our results. Some of it was applicable upon renewal. So, we finished that
cycle of renewals in June. And as well, the new CAT definition was implemented for all accidents
after June 1 of last year and given the long-tail profile of those claims, we haven't seen the full
impact yet, but this is building up.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

All right. Thank you.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you so much for all the details. So, my follow-up question on the reserve side in personal
auto is that this quarter have adverse development, which is probably the first one in quite awhile. I
just wonder you saw some, number one, (23:31) this sort of underlying trend impact your current
accident year loss pick. And secondly, is the indication that the future reserve releases will be
smaller than in the past that could impact your reported combined ratio in personal auto?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Darren.

A - Darren Godf rey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yeah, I can take that one. So, just a little to unpack the adverse prior development we saw in the
quarter, as we have mentioned in past quarters, we tend to get a little bit of noise from quarter-toquarter from pools. Q2 of 2016 and 2017 were two such quarters in particular with prior year
developments. So as Louis mentioned, pools contributed 1.6 of the 4.2 points of deterioration in
the PYD quarter-over-quarter.
So, with respect to the quarter itself, when we look at it before pools, we saw unfavorable PYD of
just shy of 2 points, 1. 8 points in particular, and this was largely driven through deterioration in
Ontario accident benefit large losses.



These were mostly on older accident years, in particular 2013, 2014, stemming from the combining
of psychological increase on top of physical injuries. So, this is what we call the stacking effect. It
was addressed, as Patrick mentioned, with the change in the definition in June of 2016 in those
reforms, but only obviously for new claims beyond June 1, 2016. So, definitely, we saw some
pressure there from the nature of those IB (25:13) claims, which the reforms are now addressing.

FINAL

In terms of the impact on our plan, our plan is not dependent upon favorable PYD.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

You mean our action plan.

A - Darren Godf rey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Sorry, our action plan is not dependent upon favorable PYD. So, at this stage, we're comfortable in
terms of what we have projected out into the latter half of this year.
With respect to guidance, we don't tend to give guidance by line of business, but when we look at
all lines IFC, we continue to expect PYD close to 3 to 4 points of opening reserves, but clearly with
a little bit of noise from quarter-to-quarter.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. And I think if you analyze the first six months of 2017, we're at the bottom end of that range
at three-point-something percent, 3.1%. No (26:07). Thank you.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you so much.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Kwan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.

Q - Geoffrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Just my first question is what we're seeing so far in Q3, just see if you have any
color on CATs, if it's good or bad. And I know out here in BC, there's been some wild fires, but
largely in rural areas, so I'm guessing it's probably not a huge impact for you.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

So, exactly as Charles mentioned, if I go back a bit to Q2, it was very wet in the east part of the
country with a lot of rain (26:50) CAD 105 million of CAT during Q2. But in the west, it was very
different for the latter part of the spring and the early summer it was very hot and dry, which led to
the situation at the beginning of July where lightning strikes have started a lot of forest fires in the
province.
So, at the peak of the threat by middle of the month, there was – more than 30,000 residents in
BC were evacuated and we were monitoring more than 200 different forest fires in the province
(27:27). But the situation has improved significantly over the past two weeks.
Now most of the fires are under control. The majority of the evacuation orders have been lifted
and people have been able to enter their premises and communities. Our claims operation are



deployed in all those locations, so we have good visibility on what we're facing. And the outcome
is much better than we could have anticipated based on what we saw in the media.

FINAL

In fact, the property damage is very limited. Most of the claims we had in the area for additional
living expense for the families that were evacuated. But at the same time, we had a few hailstorms
in Alberta during the month, but when we combine all those costs, it's very much aligned with what
we expect for the month of July. So, no change in our forecast for Q3.

Q - Geoffrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. And just my other question is the ICBC. There's been some talk, there was a
report out suggesting that auto premiums out here for the basic auto may need to go up 30%
over the next two years. And my question is more – if there's any insight that you may have of
when you have that type of potential shock in terms of increased rates for drivers, does that have
an impact on kind of the industry in terms of demand, profitability. Just recognizing also, too, if
BC's a little bit different out here as to how we do the auto and, obviously, Intact's exposure
specifically isn't as material as other provinces.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, I think that the first observation I would make is that if you let the government run what the
private sector can do, you end up with shocks like all of a sudden, there's a 30% gap in premiums.
And therefore, I think the first message would be better to have a competitive marketplace that
even when there's cost pressure going up, you have options to find ways to get a better deal,
which in this case, will be tough I think for drivers in British Columbia.
And therefore I hope that in BC we're starting to think about introducing more competition in the
marketplace as well as private operators that are in the business of trying to control costs ahead of
bumps in costs like that. So, I think, that's the main point I would make on that, Geoff.

Q - Geoffrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Charles.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Aiken of Barclays. Your line is open.

Q - John Charles Robert Aiken

{BIO 6329080 <GO>}

Good morning. I was taking a look at the lines in the sub pack about the direct-to-consumer sales
as a percentage of the total premiums and it's actually been quite stable over the last few years.
I'm a little bit surprised by that because I would've expected that to have a greater growth
trajectory. But is this something that's going on in the marketplace or is this actually a reflection of
the consolidation that you've been doing through the distribution, you actually are keeping pace
with your broker sales?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No. I think that there's been a fair bit of growth in the direct-to-consumer business. I mean, if I look
at the growth year-to-date in the direct channel, what we're seeing in personal prop is a rate of
growth that is almost twice that of the brokerage business and greater than that in automobile
insurance. So, I'll go back and look at the number that you're talking about, but there's actually
been pretty steady growth in the direct channel in the past year.

Q - John Charles Robert Aiken

{BIO 6329080 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles. Yeah. Thanks. I know I probably caught you a little bit flat-footed. And then, on the
OneBeacon, I mean, you're progressing forward on the transaction. You've got the financing



FINAL

effectively in place. You've been able to go through the operations with, I'm assuming a finer tooth
comb at this stage in the game. One of the proposed areas that you're looking at improving the
combined ratio is actually looking at the lines that OneBeacon has provided. Are you able to talk to
us at this stage in the game as to which lines may or may not be continued on a go-forward basis
after the acquisitions completed?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

The management of OneBeacon and my team are very much aligned on the work that needs to
happen. The deal hasn't closed yet and, therefore, I will not talk on their behalf at this stage, but
there's very good alignment on some of the work that needs to be done in certain lines and some
of the work that needs to be done across all lines and there's detailed plans that have been
developed at this stage and I feel pretty good about what we have in the pipeline.
I was with Alain in the U.S. last week to meet all the business leaders to talk about talent, talk about
growth opportunities, talk about the pockets of improvement and was quite impressed with the 15
business unit leaders that I've met individually. So, I think, there's really good alignment, but I don't
want to talk about specific segments at this stage before the deal closes.

Q - John Charles Robert Aiken

{BIO 6329080 <GO>}

I understood. Thanks, Charles. I'll requeue.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Meny Golman (sic) [Grauman] of Cormark Securities.
Your line is open.

Q - Meny Grauman

{BIO 15238080 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. Louis, you reiterated your run rate CAT loss guidance. But more broader
question is just what gives you confidence that you're not behind the curve on CAT losses.
Definitely, quarter after quarter now, we're getting preannouncements. And so, what's the risk that
history is not a good predictor for where CAT losses are going and how do you think about that
risk as you manage the business?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. We'll ask Patrick to give you a high-level overview of our thought process on that front.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yes. So, we try to learn from all the new events. Every time there's new one, we feed our models,
we update those on a regular basis. And when we say that we look at the long-term trend, we
adjust for the most recent observations all the time.
We have to also understand that in those models, we factor in our own actions. So, some of them
are on prevention to help our clients face changing weather patterns, but others are in our
products. We implemented a few changes to our products in the past few years to contain some
of those cost trends. So, when we factor all of this in and we project for growth in the coming 12
months, we still get the same ballpark figures of CAD 250 million per year on 3 points of loss ratio
despite the fact that in 2016 and so far in 2017, we've been higher than those expectations.

Q - Meny Grauman

{BIO 15238080 <GO>}



FINAL

And then, just as a follow-on question, it seems clear that you've learned the lessons from the
previous severe rain events in Central Canada. But I'm wondering, as you look at the experience
from this most recent event, is it just a check mark that you're saying we did what – we learned the
lessons from the past and we implemented them? Are there other things that come out of this
most recent experience in terms of what you can do to improve the situation going forward?

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Well, we have improved our technology in terms of as geo mapping with the experience of 2013
but also with development of new products like overland water over the past couple years. So, for
sure, we're implementing this into our operation. I think we're more equipped to respond also with
those geo-mapping technology to support the operations.
In terms of can we implement more changes, for sure, we learned from each event and how we
organize our own product with the government programs. This is one learning, key learning we had
with the Québec flood of the spring. But in terms of the cost of those events, I think it's very much
aligned with what we're expecting from those changes in products.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. So, I think, when I look back a number of years you get roughly to a ballpark 3% loss ratio
points of CATs across all lines and that number includes Fort Mac and Calgary flood, which you
could argue are one in 100-year-type events. So, the 3-ish percent includes a couple of one in 100year event.
But if you look prospectively, prevention product change claims action should help. And if we
realize that CAD 250 million is not high enough a guidance, we'll be the first ones to change it.
We'll need to take into account the OneBeacon acquisition, which helps us diversify away from
personalized personal property natural disaster to translate that into proper guidance.
It's too early to do that and we'll likely revisit in Q3 or Q4 what the guidance is. But at this stage,
there's not a view here that we need to increase the guidance, all else being equal. We're certainly
pricing and planning or pricing to make sure that we operate the business sub 95% in periods
higher than the plan. That's what we told you guys in the past few years.
The data point that I would have for you is that in 2016, with Fort Mac, we closed the year slightly
above 92% combined ratio all in for personal property, which is the most impacted line of business.
So, this is a data point that gives me some comfort that this is headed in the right direction.
We're year-to-date in the 96% range in that line of business. So, therefore, I think that we're
headed in the right direction. If we view that number should go up, we'll do that in short order and
we have this debate every quarter.

Q - Meny Grauman

{BIO 15238080 <GO>}

Are you more concerned about this issue now than in the past or would you not say that?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No, I'm less concerned with this issue now than in the past because of everything we've done. I
mean, look at personal prop, we've been changing the product, changing how we manage claims,
investing in prevention and then we've been increasing rates for four, five years in a row in the
mid-single-digit range.
You'll see that the quarters that are low CAT in nature, that business runs in the 70s to 80s. So, I
would say the risk roll risk of – or let's call this the mitigated risk of natural disaster is less today



than it was three years ago in our business. And we're looking at this business, quite frankly, as a
source of opportunity.

FINAL

I think Canadians realize that natural disasters are more important than in the past. Protecting
oneself against natural disaster now is much more tangible for people and we view the pie as an
increasing one in that segment. And I think the moves we've made to immunize the product are
giving us comfort that this is a good business going forward.
Now, you need to be able to stomach volatility, we're quite capable of that and that's why we're
very transparent with you guys every three months in terms of what that means in practice. I think
you want to look past the quarter and 2016 for me is a good example of what personal prop, in
particular, can generate in a bad year.

Your next question comes from the line Tom MacKinnon with BMO Capital. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning. A question on distribution income, up nicely, I think we're
up almost 30% year-over-year in – year-to-date versus – 2017 versus year-to-date 2016. So, what's
driving that? Is there any seasonality in the number here. How should we be thinking about that
going forward? I think before, you sort of talked about a 15% increase, but we seem to be running
better than that.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yes, but I will reiterate that for 2017, it's still 15% up from last year's results and so it's really...

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Not year-to-date, CAD 74 million versus CAD 57 million.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Not year-to-date from last year. So we have 1.11 (41:58) last year and at about 15, a bit north of 15
(42:00) and that's what we think we'll earn this year. And it's driven by our investments and don't
forget there's a bit of a lag. We acquire every year but there's a lag affect and we had a big year
last year. The earnings are starting to flow in. So, that's a positive momentum and we work on the
profitability as well of individual brokers. So, those two are the drivers of the improvements.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. I think that new acquisitions on that front are sort of coming in the pipeline. We're not
changing our guidance for 2017 as we integrate these businesses but, obviously, based on the first
six months, we're very confident that we'll hit the guidance on the distribution income and I think
we remain keenly interested in growing that business. It's a great business. So, you can expect
some more in the coming quarters.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. And as a follow-up on personal auto, I know that you talked about for 2017, you were going
to look to 4- to 6-point improvement in personal auto loss ratio. I think you had talked in your
earlier remarks that you've seen 2 points so far. Does that kind of mean that we would expect
another 2 to 4 points improvements by the end of 2017 in the personal auto line?



A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

That's sort of what we're shooting for, yeah, in the underlying results. The sort of action plan we
have in place should get us in that sort of zone and I think you've got the expenses tailwind that will
increase the likelihood of that happening, too.

FINAL

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay, and If I can just squeeze one more in the operating tax rate, it looks around 19%. I'm not sure
where you kind of guide, but I used to think it was in the low 20s.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

It is and, again, it's really the portion of underwriting income versus total operating income that
guides us. So, in a elevated CAT quarter, you'd expect a bit of a lower tax rate because the
nontaxable dividends become a bigger share of that. So, that's essentially the biggest driver of the
lower tax rate. But on a normal basis, I would expect something between 20% and 21%.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Young of Desjardins Capital Markets. Your line is
open.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Hi, Doug. You're probably on mute there.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Sorry. Good morning. That's my issue.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I was about to answer a question for you.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

I'm not in Toronto. (44:54) I was going to say I'm not going to ask something on personal auto, but
I might. But personal property, the guidance that you stated and you expect mid-single-digit
growth and I think last quarter, it was kind of mid to upper growth. Just wondering what to think
about, how we should read into this. Is it just that you pushed through so much in terms of price
increases over the last few years that you're going to start to see a little bit of that being (45:17) in
that?
And then, along the same lines with personal property, we did see a deterioration in the current
accident year loss ratio of just over 2 points, I believe. Just wondering, is that related to non-CAT
frequency, if any color you can provide on that and then I've got a follow-up. Thanks.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, so I think that the personal prop mid-single-digit growth guidance we're giving is that the
actions we're taking in automobile are ahead of the market and we're, I think, comforted by some
of the moves we're seeing in the marketplace in the past couple of months. But because personal
automobiles growth has been under pressure because of the actions we've taken and a big
portion of our portfolio combines home and auto, our view is that there could be unit pressure on



home insurance for a short while and, therefore, we're saying – think along the lines of mid single
digit here.

FINAL

But we're still acting on rates and I think it's more of a unit cautionary note but not raising big
alarms here. Just saying if auto is under pressure, eventually home suffers a little bit from a growth
point of view. So, I think that's the main point. What was the other part of your question?

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Just there's a deterioration in the current accident year loss ratio.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Sorry. Yeah. Frequency jump on the basis of non-weather in the quarter, 12% jump in frequency in
personal prop. Darren, any color you want to give?

A - Darren Godf rey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Mostly driven from Ontario and Québec with the heaviest rainfall that we've seen in many years.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, on the floods.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

And just on the personal auto side and I know I've harped on this in the past, but the pools – I know
the pools are a bit smaller than they were back in the day when they caused you a lot of problems,
but we are starting to see negative experience, I guess relative your view on negative experience
out of the pools. Is this or why is this not a concern to you?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Darren?

A - Darren Godf rey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yeah, I think when we look at the pools as we've talked to in the last little bit, we obviously see a
lot of noise from quarter to quarter. We look back Q2 was a very, very favorable quarter last year.
On the flipside, though, we saw the Q4 was an unfavorable quarter for us.
So, when we look year-to-date, pools is still driving a favorable outcome to our claims ratio just
slightly less than a point on a year-to-date basis. We finished 2016 with about 0.5 improvement in
the claims ratio due to pools and we expect a similar sort of response in 2017 as well.
So, yes, we see a little bit of noise from quarter-to-quarter, but generally, it impacts us favorably
when we look at our full 12-month period.

Q - Doug Young

Your next question comes from Jaeme Gloyn of National Bank Financial. Your line is open.



Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Thank you. First question is related to – going into personal auto. I just want to drive into the
top-line growth, obviously quite a bit softer than we would otherwise expect with the rate
increases in the industry not following at the same pace. What do you make of the industry's
actions to be a little bit slower on this and do you have any color of more recent perhaps in the last
month or two that gives you comfort that you'll be able to drive the 4 points of improvement just
from rate increases?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Let me just say that there's nothing new with us being ahead of the curve on pricing movement.
You've seen that in different lines of business over the past 10 years, 10-plus years and therefore,
we've cautioned the Street that we were taking action in personal automobile insurance and would
be comfortable with unit pressure before and nothing new in terms of the Street's another street,
but the industry's slow reaction there at moving. But there has been in the past few months, what I
would call green shoots in terms of the great actions and maybe, Darren, you can give sort of highlevel perspective there.

A - Darren Godf rey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. I mean, we are starting to see a little bit of movements, in particular in Ontario and Alberta.
As Charles mentioned, clearly, we are still ahead of the pack and we expect to probably stay here
at the pack for a little bit. But we are starting to see, as I say, a little bit of movement from some
companies, which will help us a little bit as we move forward but we probably continue to see
some top-line pressure here in the short term as we stay ahead of the pack.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, and I think the phenomenon that is important to understand and that's one we like to avoid
is that once you spot cost pressure in the system, you ought to move fast in regulated provinces
because when people wake up and everybody feels like they need to move their rates, obviously,
regulators get nervous for (51:05).
And therefore, being ahead of the pack, it gives you an overall profitability advantage, but you can
do that in a much more constructive environment than an environment where everybody, all of a
sudden, wants to increase their rates and it's been our strategy over the years and so we (51:26)
we learned from that experience and acted as such last year.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And second question related to commercial auto, obviously, top line growth has been
helped by specialty products including Uber, so up 7% over here. Can you break down that growth
between, let's call it organic or core products versus specialty and sharing economy products? And
what you see for commercial auto top line growth going forward?

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Well, I think that overall, when I look at the growth, I would say majority of our growth is coming
from the sharing economy product, okay? We're still seeing a competitive market with places like
trucking that are firmer and we're taking some action there that is putting a bit of a pressure on
the top line because we think that's natural and necessary action that we need to take to improve
the portfolio there. And overall, we think that this will still continue to grow at low single-digit on an
organic basis at the industry level.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Okay. And just in terms of – just following up on the specialty lines of sharing economy. Should we
expect any sort of base effect as we grow into 2018 where this high-single-digit growth rate from
specialty lines subsides? Or is there still a lot of traction in the Uber? I know in past quarters, it's



been a little bit too early to tell based on miles driven and things of that nature. But can you
provide any color looking into 2018?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Indeed, we started this program in July last year and, therefore, you will have a base effect coming
in in the second part of this year. Upsetting that is the fact that we've been taking real harsh action
on a portion of the commercial lines auto portfolio, trucking an example, which has been a
meaningful drag on the top line which should subside in the coming period as well. Alain, I don't
know if you want to give some more color.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Well I was just going to add on the Uber side, like we've mentioned in the past, this is a usage
base program, so the more usage there is, the more premium there is. There was like an
annualized impact for the first two quarter this year that will subsidize after that. But as the
popularity and the usage of Uber continue to grow, we will see other growth on this side.
On the trucking side, we've been taking a very solid action on the rate side, okay, and that will
continue at least till the end of the year and we'll probably subsidize a bit in 2018, okay. But we're
seeing some pressure on the unit side because of the action we're taking on the rate side under
trucking this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Okay. And if I can sneak one more in then, just quickly on some of the more recent innovative or
technology investments. Can you write any color on progress with Metromile or Turo and the
impact they're having in the commercial auto sector?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, I think that with regards to Metromile, I think making good progress on this front. I mean,
these guys are day in, day out, rolling out their new offer. They are starting to manufacture product
per say that we're more of a distribution play to start with moving now into manufacturing. We're
giving them a bit of help on that front given it is our trade, but satisfied with the progress we're
seeing on that front.
And I think Turo is a separate business model, which is in the car sharing as opposed to ride
sharing space and I think good traction on that front as well. This is a smaller impact for us in terms
of the insurance element of that, but this is another model. And our view is that the sharing
economy is probably the most important trend that will influence the industry in the coming three
to five years and we want to be all over that trend and, therefore, our involvement with a number
of these businesses.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Holden with CIBC. Your line is open.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Thank you. Question for you related to the commercial P&C segment. You talked about
competitive forces there impacting the premiums written. Is it possible that competitive forces will
also impact the loss ratio and if not, why not?



A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Alain, why don't you give us your perspective on this.

FINAL

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Okay. I think, competitive – the situation in the commercial P&C market is we're in a much softer
market than we were a year ago and going into that, it's very important to us to protect and
maintain on our underwriting margin. And in fact, in Q2, despite a competitive market we've
passed on rate increase to the tone of about 3%, and that has really had an impact on the overall
growth.
And although, we're not happy with the overall growth when we split our portfolio, let's say into
two parts, parts where we're quite happy with the profitability level and everything, that part has
been growing to the tone of about 4%.
The part where we see action still needed, classes where you needed rate action or account that
have been unprofitable and we've taken non-renewed or things like that, this part are strong by
20%. So, overall, when we look at that, the quality of the portfolio in our minds has improved a lot
and has more than offset the impact of the negative growth in the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And I think that we're seeing very strong performance or pockets of the market that are indeed
quite competitive and where we're taking action, we're improving the quality of the portfolio. So,
I'm certainly not concerned about the margin in that environment. And keep in mind that we are
seeing 3% rate increase for the fifth year straight in that segment. So, it is competitive, but we're
growing where we want to grow and, therefore, that's good for the margins.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Thank you for that. And then, second question would be related to OneBeacon and I know there's
probably a number of things you can do ahead of transaction closing to help set yourself up for
quick execution post closing. So, maybe if you can quickly give us some color on some of the
things you're able to do over the next few months.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

You mean what to expect upon closing, Paul?

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Well, no. I mean, if you – you mentioned you're down there for a week recently, like what kind of
things are you working on with the OneBeacon team today so that you can execute quickly post
closing? Or are there things you're able to execute even on today before closing?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. I think that we let them run their business until closing for sure and then we'll work with Mike
Miller, who's a great leader, and his team post closing. But there's a lot of work in cooperation
going on at the moment.
We have 10 different transition teams that have been working since May to prepare the transition
that'll upon closing. We have an operational group, an IT group, a claims group, a finance group, an
HR group, et cetera, that are making sure that we hit the ground running upon closing. We'll
announce a new structure that will sort of reflect the addition of OneBeacon to the Intact family in
the coming weeks.



FINAL

We expect to have profitability improvement action plan that will take place if they're not already in
the pipeline upon closing. We expect to have new products by the end of the year here in Canada.
We expect to have a cross-border capability or service that'll be offered to brokers in 2017.
So, while we haven't closed, there's a ton of work that's gone into preparing us welcoming the
OneBeacon team in the coming weeks when we close. And so, on all fronts, I think we're not
waiting upon closing to establish the base to build a leading North American specialty lines insurer
and we're sort of all hands on deck working with these guys now.

Your next question comes from the line at Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is open.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great. Pardon me. Thank you very much. Just one quick question if I can. When you look at the
various sharing economy products that you're writing and that you're planning growth within, do
they have a different loss ratio, expense ratio mix than the legacy business?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

There is an important difference in the loss ratio, expense ratio mix than the traditional business
absolutely, first point. Second point, it is a business that is performing well and that is consistent or
better than the overall results you're seeing in commercial lines.
And so, when one looks at the underlying loss ratio of commercial auto for instance, one has to
realize that the loss ratio, expense ratio mix is quite different from the rest of the book. And
therefore, I encourage people to look at the underlying combined ratio in commercial auto, better
understand the trajectory of the margins there. Is that what you're looking for?

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Yeah, I mean, my assumption and please correct me if (01:02:38) is wrong is that the
expense ratio was lower and the loss ratio was higher but the profitability part has been – bottom
line is still better. My (01:02:46)?

A - Charles Brindamour

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS. Your line is open.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Hey, thanks. Yeah. Meyer got my first question right there, but second one, could you talk a little bit
about what's going on with the distribution income? I noticed that the acquisition there have sort of
slowed pretty dramatically first half. Is that just function of the pipeline or is that purposeful given
the OneBeacon transaction? And what should we expect to going forward?



A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

FINAL

So, you're right, in Q2 it was CAD 42 million, about half of what we had last year at the same time.
It is not related to the OneBeacon transaction, it's more the environments, the pipeline. We're still
very active there and it can be choppy quarter-to-quarter. But we still have expectations to be able
to make deals over time.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, the guys who make the deals happen don't have a deal objective number. We have
hundreds of relationships from coast-to-coast and the same way we think about. And then they
broadly – we go with the flow, we go with the relationship and that's the best way to transact. And I
think from quarter-to-quarter, you'll see fluctuation.
Our view is that there's a lot of consolidation and distribution still to take place for the coming
midterm for sure. And we're very keen and there's not been constraints imposed on the
distribution, consolidation activities or in us financing entrepreneurs who want to get bigger in
distribution, whatsoever, because of the OneBeacon transaction. We like the margins we're seeing
there. So long as the margins and the returns are in line or above what we're looking for, we'll find
a way to deploy capital in that space.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Great. And lastly, so I'm just curious, does the OneBeacon transaction constrain you guys at all
financially from potentially doing a transaction up in Canada if something becomes available?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

No, that's why we structured our financing conservatively, and we feel comfortable if something
comes up in Canada to be able to participate in the opportunity, no doubt.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. The way we think about that, Brian, right now in terms of capital deployment is pause on
non-Canadian staff, focus on improving or working with Mike Miller to make sure that our specialty
lines operation is top quartile in terms of the combined ratio performance. That's, outside Canada,
the priority. But here, we're very keen to expand our position in Canada, both in manufacturing and
distribution, and we have some resources we can leverage, and if not, we'll convince investors that
putting some more capital in Canada is a good idea when we're convinced it is.

Your last question comes from the line of Mario Mendonca of TD Securities. Your line is open.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Charles, I'll try to be clear. I want to go back to personal auto, the adverse
development. What gave rise to it? Was it individual claims, actual claims that were resolved in a
way that was higher than expected? Or was it an event that played out in the quarter that caused
you to review the assumptions on those older policies in 2013 and 2014?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So, beyond the pools, that's largely a flow of large losses.



Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

So, no specific event like litigation that would have caused you to review assumptions?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

No.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

And going to then Q4 2012 and I know that's away back, but I figure there's enough institutional
memory on this call. That was the last time there was adverse development in personal auto and it
sort of – it disappeared by the very next quarter. By the very next quarter, we're back to positive
development. Do you recall what it was that caused the adverse development and why you
recovered so quickly?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think that this was the – and Darren is there who used to run personal lines in Alberta or claims at
that time in Alberta. So, you're right about the institutional memory.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think it's with the Sparrowhawk decision in Alberta related to – a decision related to – if you have
jaw damage, you would be deemed non-minor injury claims and this led to a change in assumption
in reserving claims on that front. Maybe you want to give some more color. This is a long time ago,
but I think that's....

A - Darren Godf rey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

That's exactly it. I mean, we had that one decision, sort of repositioned the minor injury cap and
the definition given that judicial decision. And at that point in time, we did exactly as you said,
Charles, looked at the reserving level and made that move to increased reserves because of that
adverse decision.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

So, I'd be right in saying that this time around, the causes are very different? It has nothing to do
with decisions or anything of that nature?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, I think that's right that this time around, the decision is – or the core decision is not something
that happened. There has been a weakening through common law over the past three, four years
in Ontario and a number of the large losses we've seen are a result of some of these past
decisions, but it's not something that's happened in the quarter that leads us to reassess our
outstanding reserves in its entirety.
Some of these decisions that were 2013, 2014 in nature, I forgot the exact dates, has been tackled
by the June 2016 reports.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Okay. So, you don't feel any big need to go back and review files throughout 2013 and 2014, and
reassess assumptions as a result?

FINAL

I don't think so. I think we're reassessing every quarter the flow of claims that we're getting, see if
it changes our ultimate view of those accidents years. We have been sort of increasing reserves
for those accident years throughout the past year, which has put a bit of pressure on our PYD. But
it's not a common-law decision that has taken place in the quarter per se that is leading to a
fundamentally different view on the ultimate.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Okay. That covers it. Thank you.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thank you.
