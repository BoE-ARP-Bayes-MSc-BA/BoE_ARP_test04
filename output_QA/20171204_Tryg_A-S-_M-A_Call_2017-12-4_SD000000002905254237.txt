Presentation
Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. This is Gianandrea Roberti, I'm Head of Investor Relations for Tryg.
We're hosting this call this morning to present you the acquisition of Alka. I'll -- a few short words,
I'll leave the -- yes, the words to Morten.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you. And a good morning from me as well. And particularly thank you for spending the time
with us this morning. This is a special day for us with very good news and an important driver in the
value creation for Tryg in the future. We start on Slide two announcing this important acquisition for
us. And it's quite clear that Alka will strengthen our core Danish private business in a very highquality customer segment. Alka having delivered average combined ratio of 84% in the last five
years on average.
If we look at Alka's technical result during the last 12 months through September this year, it is
more than DKK 300 million. And we expect run rate synergies of DKK 300 million in '21, which
would be the third full year after authority approval. There's no doubt that there is very large
synergy opportunity to improve both businesses. There are areas where Alka is clearly more
advanced than Tryg. And vice versa areas where Tryg is more advanced than Alka.
Christian will return to the synergies. But just to give you a few examples. We can see, for instance,
that fraud, which was a theme we discussed at the Capital Markets Day, Alka is significantly more
advanced than Tryg. And even more advanced than our ambitions for the next three years. It is
also clear that on cost of sales, which we discussed at the Capital Markets Day, Alka is significantly
ahead of Tryg. Those will drive, amongst others, significant financial impact in Tryg.
On the other hand, it's clear that there are number of areas where Tryg is more advanced. For
instance, we showed our advantage of claims procurement driving a lot of value in Tryg. This is not



FINAL

an area that Tryg -- that Alka has developed and an area where we can add significant synergies in
the Alka business. Then, of course, we have a number of areas where there are overlapping
functions, which will drive synergies. But Christian will get back to that.
We will issue DKK 4 billion of equity, which is already fully underwritten. This will be accretive to
earnings in the first full year, which will be 2019. And then we will have high single digits accretion by
'21. Also on this slide, we reconfirm our extraordinary dividends of DKK 1 billion expected to be
paid in Q1 2018.
Now if we turn to Slide 3, we comment that this is a very rare opportunity to buy a high-quality
businesses in our core Danish private market. We show a headline purchase price of DKK 8.2
billion. But bear in mind that, that includes excess capital of DKK 2.5 billion, which can be released
in the transaction in Alka. And therefore, the actual price for the operations we're buying is DKK 5.7
billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

As I mentioned, the business we are acquiring is generating a technical profit of DKK 325 million
rolling 12 months. And we intend to deliver merger benefits of DKK 300 million by '21. Financing
supported by our largest shareholder, TryghedsGruppen. And of course, we're very pleased that
this will drive higher earnings growth. It will also drive higher potential for dividend growth in the
future. We show also here a pro forma solvency ratio calculation after the transaction and the
capital increase.
On Slide 4, we elaborate on the strategic rationale. We will clearly deepen our presence in Tryg's
core market segment. We will grow the market share in Denmark, in general, by 4%. And more
importantly, by 6% in the private lines market as this is predominantly a private lines business. We
are very importantly investing in what you already know is our most efficient and most important
business. And Alka brings very high-quality customers and high-quality business.
We see that over a number of years, the loyalty and satisfaction amongst Alka customers has been
extremely high, while at the same time delivering very strong growth and very strong financial
results. And through Alka, we'll have -- Tryg will have a long-term business with the unions and the
union members. And bear in mind that in Tryg stand-alone, we already have more than 75 years of
experience working with unions to build upon.
As part of the transaction, we've entered into contract with the current union customers for five
years, which is the legal maximum period. Also important that the union members and all other
customers of Alka will become members of TryghedsGruppen. And as a result, they will also in the
future receive the membership bonus, which for the past three years have been 8%. And of
course, that reinforces our belief that the partnership will create value both for the members. And
customers and for Tryg.
As I said, it's quite clear that Tryg can learn in a number of areas from Alka. It's quite clear that in,
for instances, online sales. But also the work with data, pricing and a number of technical skills, also
including fraud detection, Alka is very, very advanced.
On Slide 5, we have shown our Capital Markets Day targets. And then we have shown an update
post this transaction. And importantly, we've shown update of the technical result target for 2020.
Previously, DKK 2.8 billion, increased to DKK 3.3 billion, of course, driven by the current earnings
ability of Alka. And then, of course, the synergies driven in both Tryg and Alka as a result of the
transaction.
Then bear in mind that the full peak of the synergies is not in 2020. But in 2021. You will also see
that we have revised of our ROE target back to 21% post-tax. This is, of course, a function of the
DKK 4 billion of incremental equity. And of course, while 23% to 21% is a reduction, when you do
the math, it's actually a tightening of the financial targets on ROE and that reconfirms our focus to



FINAL

work with our balance sheet and work with capital repatriation. Then finally, please notice that we
are improving our combined ratio target from 87% to 86%.
If we turn to Slide 6, there's no doubt that we have always admired the success of Alka business
from the outside, particularly their ability to combine strong combined ratio results with growth
above market growth level and very high customer satisfaction. The quality of the business is
supported by strong relationships with the unions. And given our more than 75 years' experience
with unions, we are certain that we can drive that in a strong way forward.
We show that the historical evidence of 84% combined ratio for Alka stand-alone over the past five
years indicates a very strong business. And in addition to the financial metrics, it's quite clear that
we're attracted to the strengths of the technical capabilities. But also the digital market presence.
We show here, for instance, that in 2017, 36% of Alka sale is online, of course, with a substantially
lower cost of sale, while Tryg's Danish proportion of online sale is extremely limited. Then also, we
see a very strong Alka brand awareness. And we show that on Slide 7. Now Alka might not be as
large as some of the other insurers shown on this graph. As I mentioned, a 4% Danish market
share and importantly, a 6% Danish private lines market share. But what you also see from this
graph is that the brand awareness is very strong.

Bloomberg Transcript

Only Tryg is ahead of Alka. And in other words, we are combining brand awareness in Danish
insurance #1 and #2, which clearly bodes for strong market positioning in the future. We believe we
can further capitalize on the strength of both brands, both to build even higher customer
satisfaction, grow the business and deliver strong financial results in the process.
On Slide 8, we show a little bit of the split of the business. There's no doubt that the Alka business
is very focused on Danish private nonlife, which is almost 80% of the total top line. And of course,
that is highly complementary to Tryg's business.
On Slide 9, we show that over the past 10 years, Alka has consistently outgrown the Danish nonlife
market, while delivering very high customer satisfaction and very strong combined ratios in the
process. We also show the historical development in market share, which of course, gives us
significant conviction regarding the strength of Alka's prospects.
We believe it is realistic to take Alka through also in the future, another stage of significant growth
as part of the Tryg family. But of course, very importantly, to continuing to build upon their strong
financial result track record. Finally, on Slide 10, before handing over to you, Christian, we show
market shares where clearly Alka adds significant presence to our core lines of business. Alka has
approximately 6% in private lines Denmark. And here, we show a little bit of the product split
where Alka brings 5% to 6% in each of motor insurance, accident and health and fire and property.
And over to you, Christian.

Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Thank you, Morten. And as you can see on Slide 11, Alka have had a long track record of very good
combined ratios and they're here compared to Tryg's private business. So very much in line with
how Tryg's private business has been performing. There has been a period of elevated runoff in
Alka. And during our due diligence, we actually found that we were dealing here with a company
that was even more conservative in their reserving practice than Tryg has been. So a very strong
due diligence and a very strong balance sheet when looking at the reserves of Alka.
The 2016 numbers that kind of peaks up a little bit is, however, a -- some work that was done on
the reserving models giving a peak to the results. But in 2017, we see the results coming back
down to historical levels or the combined ratio coming back down.



FINAL

On Page 12, which is basically our DKK 300 million benefit -- merger benefit. And I think it's
important here that we're calling it merger benefit. From our point of view, we can see a lot of
things that we can learn from Alka and that Alka can learn from us.
Morten has already mentioned on the claims side. And we see here about 45% of the DKK 300
million is coming from claims. When we at the Capital Market Day showed that we are detecting
1.5% of fraudulent claims, Alka is excess 4% of detection. That's 3percentage point more detection
than Tryg is doing. Basically, this is where a lot of the value is going to be driven and where we are
going to learn a lot from Alka taking their models and their data analytical models here to improve
our business in Tryg's main.
On the procurement side, we can see this is an area that Alka has not been working on for the
past as much as Tryg has. And for example, looking at the -- when we showed on the Capital
Market Day that we have a 6.6% average better procurement on auto, Alka does not have this. But
when we merge together, Alka will benefit from these procurement agreements that we have and
thereby giving us better performance in Alka.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the cost optimization, we basically are talking about double functions. And a lot of these
double function will be reduced by natural churn. The other 25% of revenue optimization and
commercial best practice, Morten has already mentioned their presence on the -- on online. With a
36% online sales, they have been working with cost of sales over the past many years where Tryg
is just getting started. And we have much to learn from Alka here.
Their -- generally, their use of data and analytics is an area that we will benefit and reap a lot of
benefits from over the next coming years. However, on the product and services side, we can see
that our product offering is much larger than what Tryg is. And there, we can sell more products to
the Alka members or the Alka customers.
And lastly, a component that you won't -- wouldn't find in their normal cost ratio. But is a synergy
for us, is about 5% of reinsuring and investment synergies where combining the 2 entities are
going to give us these benefits. Bear in mind that there is a DKK 250 million transition cost will
affect our 2018 numbers.
Turning to the next page, which is the funding page. As Morten has already mentioned, the DKK
8.2 billion consist of a DKK 2.5 billion excess capital in Alka that will be released upon closure. The
price paid is then DKK 5.7 billion. And of that, we are raising DKK 4 billion of equity, which has been
fully underwritten by TryghedsGruppen at a minimum price of DKK 146 million guaranteed.
Furthermore, to finance this transaction, we have a Tier 1 capital issue that will be done during Q1
'18. And we have a DKK 1.2 billion of Tryg capital used for this transaction. Trying to put on the next
page, which is our solvency ratio and pro forma, again, trying to give these moving parts a little bit
of a content. We have put a solvency ratio pro forma based on Q3 2017, how would our solvency
ratio look if we apply all these numbers. And it ends up at DKK 170 million.
Now bear in mind once -- upon closure, these numbers will differ to the extent that time has
passed and we will kind of get the final numbers on all these components.
I think that was on the financial side, Morten. And back to you to summarize.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Christian. And just lastly, before we turn to Q&A, on the last slide, we summarize that
we are extremely pleased with the news today. It is indeed a very rare opportunity to be able to
buy a high-quality business in our core Danish private lines area.



FINAL

The economic value of the operations we're buying, when you take out the excess capital of DKK
2.5 billion, is DKK 5.7 billion. Alka has rolling 12 months now been delivering in 2017 technical result
of DKK 325 million. And we expect to deliver DKK 300 million of synergies across Tryg and across
Alka in 2021. This will be strongly accretive to our EPS. And it will strengthen our ability to grow our
dividends in the future.
We very much look forward to welcoming the management and the employees of Alka, once we
have completed and received approval. We very much look forward to welcoming the customers
of Alka with strong propositions in the future, including the 8% membership bonus. Then, we'll very
much look forward to continuing a Tryg journey of long-term profitable growth and very strong
shareholder returns.
And with that, we will turn to your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And the first question is from Per GrÃ¸nborg from SEB.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per GrÃ¸nborg
A couple of questions from my side. First of all, one clarification. Your gross premium was DKK 2.5
billion, (auto) plunged to DKK 2.1 billion something. Can you elaborate on what the difference is? If
it's life, what's the profitability of what is on the life business? That was my first question. My
second question is related to the DKK 2.5 billion you are taking out in excess capital from Alka. You
leave the company with an equity to premium ratio of only 20%, assuming DKK 2.1 billion and not
DKK 2.5 billion. That seems like a quite aggressive giving compared to where you're running your
own business, must imply that you could run your own business with almost half the capital it has
currently. And my final question on the goodwill, I guess a part of that will end up as client
intangibles that needs to be amortized over a period of time. Can you elaborate a bit on how we
should expect that accounting treatment to turn up?

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Good morning, Per. The DKK 2.5 billion to DKK 2.1 billion is -- the difference is the group life
business there. And the group -- the life business is basically more or less a zero-sum game with a
collaboration with the unions. So the DKK 2.1 billion is where you would find us as our nonlife portion
of the business. When it comes to the DKK 2.5 billion in capital -- excess capital release and the
solvency ratios and the premium ratios that you're talking to, you have to bear in mind that this is a
private line business. And when we look at our numbers and look at our private line business, it's
very comparable to the ones that we're using for Alka. So you are right, if Tryg was an only private
line business, we could be running our solvency at a different level. But since we have workers'
comp and other corporate lines that does consume more capital per premium, it -- when you
combine those things in Tryg, it is a -- it's a higher solvency ratio. And on the goodwill part, could
you just repeat the question, sorry?

Q - Per GrÃ¸nborg
The goodwill arising from this deal, I assume part of that will be classified as client intangibles that
needs to be amortized over a period of time? What sort of amortization cost should we expect?

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

I think we'll revert to that at a later stage, Per. And give you more details once we have kind of
finalized and closed the deal.



Q - Per GrÃ¸nborg
Okay. Can I just add one more in. In your closing remarks, you said that this will be strongly
accretive to EPS. In the release, you say that this would give a high single-digit profit growth or is
that EPS growth?

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

It is EPS growth. So it is within the three years. So we're saying '18 will be sort of transitioning year,
we'll get the authority approval, et cetera. '21 will be the year 3 of full collaboration and ownership.
Then in '21, we will see a high single-digit EPS accretion.

Operator
And next question is from the line of Steven Haywood from HSBC.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

And can I just clarify that last statement quickly, sorry. You say the acquisition is initially earnings
enhancing, is that on a EPS basis?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay. Then...

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Slightly enhancing the first full year and a high single-digit in '21.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

On a per share, that's good. A couple of other questions. The excess capital of DKK 2.5 billion that
you removed from Alka, what would that drop the 360% Solvency II ratio to? My first question.
Then the reserve -- the buffer on reserves now trigger those -- I think, with a 7% buffer, what does
-- what level does Alka reserve at? Then you also -- and finally, you mentioned that you grow -you're going to grow the dividend in the future. And this deal is supportive of that. Is there any
change to your special dividend philosophy going forward?

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Good morning. So the DKK 2.5 billion excess capital, you have to think of this as a combined entity.
So we will not post-Alka solvency ratio post this. This is both combined with a cash excess and also
the capital synergies that we get from Tryg. That is the total of the DKK 2.7 billion excess capital.
When it comes to the reserving buffer, we are not disclosing kind of like Alka's reserving buffer. But
as I mentioned, during our due diligence, it was very evident for us that the reserving practice at
Alka is at a conservative level and even more conservative than Tryg has been working at. With
respect to your last question, which was?

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

On the -- any change to the special dividend?

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Thank you. Yes, sorry, I didn't get to write that one up. I think you have to bear in mind the way that
we operate with our special dividend, it is at a year-end consideration where we look at our capital



position and our financial forecast. And by then, we will decide whether to distribute excess
extraordinary dividend. So there is no changes to our practice.

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And I can just complement by saying that over the past 15 years that I've been in Tryg, we've had a
number of due diligence exercises. And it's fair to say that I've never previously seen our actuaries
being positive about anyone else's reserves. But they were in this case. And of course, that is very
positive.

Operator
Our next question is from the line of Paul De'Ath from RBC.

Q - Paul De'Ath
And just a couple of questions, please, more around the kind of the brand and growth aspects of
the deal. So you mentioned how strong the Alka brand is relative to its size and are you intending
on running the 2 brands in parallel going forwards and how does that work, does that affect
anything in terms of the way the businesses are run? Then the second point on that was and you
also mentioned you'll confidently continue to grow Alka's business going forward. But does that
have any impact on Tryg's business? I mean, where has Alka been growing in the last 5 or six
years? Has that been impacting Tryg's market share? And essentially does 2 plus 2 equal 4 or does
it equal 3 in terms of sales?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, to you as well. Yes, on the brand attraction, it is our intention to continue
to use both brands. It is our expectation that it will be separate products, separate prices. The
unions have special agreements. Those special agreements will continue. There is, of course, a
strong link between the high brand awareness and the sales methodology and the cost of sales,
because what we're seeing in the Alka business model is that they have reduced the cost of sales
significantly. Amongst others, the 36% online sales, which is extremely high in a Danish market
context. And of course, the high brand awareness creates a pull impact of customers contacting
the company. And as such, there is a very strong value creation in continuing the Alka brand,
continuing the products and the pricing and continuing the cooperation with the unions. And that is
very much a part of the transaction and the agreement. When it comes to your second question on
growth and how that relates to Tryg, we can see that over time, Tryg has lost net some customers
to Alka every year. But to be honest, that is not a large number and is not Tryg customers has not
been the main source of Alka customers at all. So the overlap or cannibalization, if you will, has
been quite small. So generally, Alka has been active in the entire Danish market and not specifically
towards Tryg. Then, of course, you should bear in mind that we expect that the 8% membership
bonus will gradually grow in awareness in the Danish market. And that, that will over the next 4, five
years benefit both Tryg private lines customers, commercial customers, corporate customers. And
now and the future, also the Alka customers. And of course, that will strengthen the value
proposition of Alka's, which is already attractive in the Danish market.

Operator
Next question is from the line of AsbjÃ¸rn MÃ¸rk from Danske Bank.

Q - AsbjÃ¸rn Nicholas MÃ¸rk
Just 2 questions really. First, on the excess capital, the DKK 2.5 billion. Just to clarify, will that capital
be freed up more or less from day 1? Or is that sort of a transitional phase here? The second one
relating to your rating. So I guess, your solvency ratio will increase quite a lot the next couple of
quarters before the transaction goes through, because you take on the equity. But the 170%
solvency pro forma, I guess, that leaves the risk on your ratings. Is that factored into your synergies
of DKK 300 million per year? Or what impact you expect from this?



FINAL

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Good morning, AsbjÃ¸rn. So to the excess capital, yes, it will be once upon closing that we will
release this DKK 2.5 billion. So it will come up and be freed up more or less at closing. With respect
to the rating, we don't -- we have had a discussion with Moody's and given them all the material
needed. We don't expect any significant changes. If we are having any changes, bear in mind that
not too long ago, we actually had a notch up from Moody's and it has not really given us an impact
on the business overall. So you could argue that it is included in the DKK 300 million synergies. But
we expect very low impact for any kind of rating changes.

Operator
And next question is from the line of (Ayes Vandanka) from Danske Bank.

Q - Unidentified Participant
My question has already been answered. So no further questions.

Operator
Okay. So we go to the next question, which is a follow-up from Per GrÃ¸nborg from SEB.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per GrÃ¸nborg
Yes, I have a few other things. You were addressing the high brand awareness of Alka. It's pretty
obvious that Alka has probably had a marketing spend that was way above what Tryg had. Is that
part of the synergies taking away that marketing spend? In that case, how much are we talking
about? And my second one is, this -- the synergies you will take into account, is that including a
head office relocation? That was my 2 additional questions.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Per. It's nice to see that you're awake twice this morning. No, on the brand
awareness, to be serious, we expect -- you're right, Alka has a very high brand spend. They will
continue to have a very high brand spend in the future, because we see that -- again, it's a
combination of cost of sales and branding spend. I think that once we have had closing of the
transaction, of course, we will do some changes to branding spend. But you should expect that we
will continue a higher branding spend on Alka, because combined with a very, very low cost of sale
and the 36% online sale, the totality of those 2 is extremely attractive. And there's no doubt that
we are not planning to just return to a traditional Tryg model where our branding spend is lower.
But then our cost of sale is significantly higher. So some adjustment you should expect, Per. And
some of that would also flow into the synergies. But you shouldn't expect a revolution on the
branding spend. Then on the head office, on the other hand, it's quite clear that Alka's employees
in Denmark are positioned in 3 different locations. They are positioned in Taastrup in Copenhagen
area and in -- also in Aarhus and Kolding in Jutland. In all 3 of those locations, we expect that there
will be a relocation. It will happen expectedly in 2019 on all 3 locations. And of course, that will both
do something for the culture and also do something for the cost.

Q - Per GrÃ¸nborg
Okay. Can I add one more question. When I look at the pricing of the products of these 2
companies, I just take up my own house, your price is 35% more expensive than Alka's price. You
are buying a mid; to low-end priced company. Your own company is priced totally at the other end
of the price range. Now the content of these products will be the same. Don't you feel that there
will be a cannibalization that the people will take the cheap Alka product knowing that there's Tryg
quality behind where some might have been a bit uncertainty about yesterday?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}



FINAL

I think, first of all, Per, it is completely clear that there is a lot of difference on prices, there's a lot of
differences on products and there's a lot of difference on process. There will continue to be a lot
of differences on all 3. Alka products will not become Tryg products. We will continue to drive this
as 2 separate market positionings. And therefore, you will continue to see the same difference in
the future. What you will, of course, add to the equation is a membership bonus, which our 60%
shareholder is paying for. And of course, that will strengthen the Alka equation. But there's no
doubt and that is one of the reasons why we will continue to have 2 brands and to a large extent, 2
separate parts of the organization with separate focuses. That is also today, if you look at Tryg's
current business with the unions, the unions business within Tryg is a separate organization that has
other prices and other products and another business model to the broader private lines Tryg
Denmark business. And similarly, that will continue for Alka as well. So very separate profile,
separate products, separate prices. And therefore, I'm not worried about the challenge you're
mentioning.

Operator
And the next question is from the line of Robert Rankin from UBS.

Q - Robert John Rankin

{BIO 1883443 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Two questions from me. Just on capital. Just want to check that the Slide 14 roll forward
supercedes the Capital Markets Day. One, i.e, no more IT investments and then it looks like the
partial internal model approval has dropped off ? Then the second question, what -- can you tell us
what reserve releases we're running up at the nine months for Alka? And a bit color around what
the reserve addition was in 2016?

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Good morning, Robert. With respect to the solvency ratio pro forma, I think when we mentioned at
the Capital Market Day the work on our internal model, you can see the second bar being internal
model for Danish workers' comp is the one that has been approved. Now the continuous work on
our model is something that will come in the future. So we haven't taken all the component in. And
also, as you mentioned, the IT spend that will come in 2020, this is more a pro forma of what this
transaction does to us. Now with respect to your other question, what's -- go ahead, sorry?

Q - Robert John Rankin

{BIO 1883443 <GO>}

Okay. So both -- we can still expect both the IT and the continued optimization?

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Yes. That is correct. And your second question was on the run-off levels. The run-off levels for Alka
in 2016 was somewhat lower than average. It's been around 8% over this last 5-year period. I think
that we expect run-off levels of Alka to go down to levels of Tryg being the 3% to 5% in long term.
So that's what been contributing their performance over the last five years.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

It is fair to say that given that the reserving position of Alka is slightly more conservative than
Tryg's, we're quite comfortable with that. But we're trying not to be too positive in our outlook on
future run-offs. So we've taken a conservative stance. So what you can actually see when you do
the math is that we've assumed that run rate combined ratio increases assuming more
conservative run-offs. And then we improve it again with the synergies. That is the math we've
done.

And next question is a follow-up from Steven Haywood from HSBC.



Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

The pro forma 170% Solvency II ratio, is this level quite comfortable for you? And looking at your
history and you've previously given the Solvency II ratio on the standard formula, could you provide
some information here, would it be around the 130% level on the standard formula?

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well I'll start to kick off, Steven. We're showing the 170%, which we think is fully comfortable given
our business model and the transaction we have now done. But you should bear in mind that prior
to this transaction, we have given no guidance as to target range of solvency in the future. And
we're not starting to give guidance on solvency ranges in the future either. For us, it's quite clear
that our important drivers are on the earnings targets, including the targets for return on equity.
Then we have our dividend policy and our track record of high capital repatriation. So no further
guidance than we're comfortable at the 170% we're showing here.

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

And with respect to your second question on the standard formula, I can see that Gian, he'll get
back to you on those numbers to give you the details Steven.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

But Steven, just to be clear, we can provide the information on the standard formula. And we will
do that. But so you know, we are using a partial internal model. We are not using the standard
model for purposes within the group. So just so that's clear.

And next question is from Jan Erik Gjerland from ABG Sundal Collier.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Just wanted to clarify one more question regarding -- most of them were answered. But the
accretion of the new -- after the new shares, of course? And finally, there was some noise during
the weekend from a lot of stuff in the local press. I just wanted to confirm or hear your thoughts on
those noises as you have acquired Alka?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Good morning, to you as well, Jan Erik. Yes. The EPS accretion is, of course, the net impact of the
new shares issued and the change to earnings. So that is completely correct. You're correct that
there has been some noise in the local papers during last week and over the weekend. And I
guess, it's fair to say that when you change a company from being owned by unions to no longer
being owned by the unions, then there's a lot of, of course, getting used to what does that mean
and how does that potentially impact the unions. We're quite clear that the offering to the union
members until now has been very strong. And the customer satisfaction has been extremely high.
The growth and the results have been strong. We're continuing exactly the same membership
benefits for the union members. So there's no deterioration on that. Then, of course, our 60%
shareholder is adding the 8% membership bonus in addition. So I think once everyone has gotten
used to that there has been a change, I think what will be seeing is that the new offering is actually
the same or if anything, slightly stronger than the old offering. So I think that will be a positive to
the customers and the union members. And there's no doubt that, that has been a very important
part of the choice also on the unions when choosing whom to sell this company to that they saw a
strong commitment on our side and they saw a strong DNA relationship, our strong experience
with unions through 75 years, our giving back to society through our main shareholder and the 8%
bonus. So I think that will come down during the coming period.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}



Okay. Just 2 quickly. On the life side and the capital at use, is it so that there's no risk for Tryg's
shareholders (and their fish), because this is covered by a sort of 100% combined ratio scheme for
the union members? Or is it anything capital at risk for -- on the life side even though it's a very
small part of it?

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

There is no significant impact on the risk profile of Tryg given the small portfolio of life. It is a very -currently a very profitable portfolio that where there is a -- as mentioned, a combined ratio of 100
sharing between the unions and Tryg in the future. So no significant change in the risk profile.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. And the final, who approached who in this transaction? Is it sort of you were approached by
Alka or did you approach them?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think what you can read from the press -- of course, we are well informed of our own process. But
what you can read from the press is that it was an initiative taken by the company and the seller.
And therefore, they approached us.

And the next question is from the line of Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Probably, just one question I had was, a few years ago, when there was a lot of pricing competition
from the likes of Alka, I don't think you were that complementary about their reserving and pricing
practices. So I just wanted to understand why your view is different today, have they changed some
things? Then, just one follow-up is that, what was the motivation for Alka to seek a buyer -- I mean,
if everything was going so strongly, what could drive them for solvency those were not very neatly
derived?

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Good morning, Vinit. You always have a good memory of what has happened in the past. I think
that when you look outside and in the company, you kind of -- and you see them performing, as
Morten mentioned, with strong combined ratio and strong growth, you kind of get -- trying to find
out what is actually driving this. But during our due diligence, we have found that it's a strong focus
on pricing, it's a strong focus on just performing on -- with the portfolio constantly, which basically is
giving them the ability to keep their -- maintain their low prices and maintain them at high
profitability. So once we've been under the hood and see the engine is actually a well-oiled engine
that we are absorbing into Tryg, which we are really looking forward to learn a lot from.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I'll just complement what Christian said, I think it's fair to say, Vinit, that from the outside, a strong
competitor with low pricing is not a -- of course, that is challenging for everyone. So we have
mentioned that in the past. I'm quite sure we have never mentioned anything about Alka's
reserves. So I think that is your interpretation, not something we've ever said. Then when it comes
to the motive of the unions, it's quite clear that it is very important for the unions to have strong
value creation for their members. So they get offers and propositions that are unique to their
members and that is an advantage to the members. Therefore, it has been very important for the
unions in the negotiations to secure that, that will continue in the future and even be strengthened
further with a membership bonus. But what has also been clear as to the motive is that there's
really no reason why the unions would have to own the company to have those advantages. And it



is a very, very significant value concentration for the unions to have so high asset value in one
specific company. And that has been the main motivation.

FINAL

And there are currently no further questions registered. So I'll hand the call back to the speakers.
Please go ahead.

A - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Well this is Gianandrea, again, closing the conference call. Thank you very much. It's been a hectic
morning. And I guess, we woke you up more or less. But Peter and I are around to take all your
questions. And we'll be in Copenhagen and London in the next few days. Thanks, again.
