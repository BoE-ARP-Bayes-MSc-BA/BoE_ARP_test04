MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Gjensidige Q2 2016 Results Presentation. Today's
conference is being recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Janne Flessum, Head of IR. Please go
ahead, ma'am.

Janne Merethe Flessum

{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

Thank you. And good morning and welcome to the second quarter presentation for
Gjensidige. Our CEO, Helge Leiro Baastad, will start by giving you some highlights for the
quarter before our CFO, Catharina Hellerud, comments the numbers in more details. And
then, we will, of course, have good time for Q&A. Before we start, just remember, you can
download the presentation material from our website.
Helge?

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Janne. And welcome from me as well. If you look at page 2 in the
presentation, we deliver another second quarter, with a proﬁt before tax expense of NOK
1.7 billion. It's very strong insurance results, NOK 1.072 billion, which gives 80.6% in

combined ratio. We have a strong growth in premiums, 6.7%; underlying is 1.2%. I will
come back to the growth and the situation operationally afterward.
Still a good underlying frequency claims development and were not as expected. The
proportion of large losses, it's somewhat lower than expected, but it's signiﬁcantly above
last year. Cost ratio is 15.6% and it's negatively aﬀected by the Baltics and the integration
there. The ﬁnancial result became – of NOK 570 million, and that gives us return on
ﬁnancial asset of 1%. Annualized return on equity, 21.7%. Catharina will go back to the
detailed ﬁgures afterward.
If you turn to page 3, this quarter, we recorded growth in premiums of 1.4% in Norway; it's
0.2% for private and 2.7% for the commercial segment. The slowing growth rate is in line
with expectations, and it's also as communicated earlier, given the general slowdown in
the economy and the increase in competition in its way. Generally speaking, we see that
growth in the Norwegian insurance market has leveled up, and that we have strengthened
our leading position, both in absolute terms and in relation to the main competitors, as
you can see from the chart.

Bloomberg Transcript

The competition is intense, but the development illustrates that our competitiveness
continues to be good. We are especially pleased with development given that we
continue to deliver a combination of good proﬁtability and high customer satisfaction.
We continue, however, to prioritize proﬁtability over growth. Over time, though, we
expect to continue to grow organically in step with the nominal GDP, but at the moment,
as we have seen, growth in the insurance market is lower. Weaker growth requires
continued good cost of discipline, and we will maintain a strong focus on further cost
eﬃciency measures to ensure that the cost base will remain in the peak scene and that we
deliver combined ratio at this low end of the target rate.
Long-term partnership agreements are important to Gjensidige, as partnership
agreements and participation in new ecosystems really become even more important to
grow proﬁtability going forward. The agreements helped to increase our customer base
and strengthen loyalty.
In the second quarter, we expanded our agreement with the Norwegian Society of
Engineers and Technologists, NITO, to also included accident and health insurance with
eﬀects from January 1, 2017. NITO has 80,000 members in Norway and a signiﬁcant
percentage of them are Gjensidige customers via our long-term P&C insurance
agreement.
In Denmark, we entered into a new agreement with the Danish Community of Senior
Citizen Organisation, which has 140,000 members. The agreement in Denmark covers a
wide range of products, including the 55-plus product launched in Norway earlier this
year.
Over time, as communicated in connection with the ﬁrst quarter ﬁgures, accident and
health insurance would grow in scope and importance in our total portfolio, driven by the
Page 2 of 22

FINAL

technological and demographic development we see around us. The situation outside
Norway remains relatively unchanged compared with the last quarter. The situation in the
Baltics will continue to get worse before it gets better, but we remain on track towards
achieving probability in 2018, as earlier communicated.
The acquisition of Vardia was closed on July 1, and we are looking forward to starting the
integration work in Sweden as well. The portfolio will make a positive contribution to
achieving proﬁtability in Sweden over the next year.
Then moving to page 4. The Gjensidige Foundation has again distributed its dividends to
Gjensidige general insurance customers in Norway, as it has done every year since our
stock exchange listing in 2010. The unique customer dividend model helps to both
increase familiarity with Gjensidige and increase customer loyalty. At the total since the
listing, almost NOK 11 billion has been paid in customer dividends since, as I said, the
stock listing in December 2010; and that corresponds to between 11% and 16% of
premiums paid every year. This year, it was 13.5% of premiums paid for 2015; and that
corresponds, as you can see, to NOK 2 billion.
More than 80% of customers now receive their customer dividend automatically into their
accounts and the model this year as well has been (06:42) digital marketing and in social
media. And the awareness of the customer dividend among non-customers was record
high at 62% at the end of the second quarter.

And then, we can go into more detail in the ﬁgures, Catharina.

Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Thank you, Helge, and good morning. I'll start by commenting on the ﬁgures on page 6.
We report of strong insurance result this quarter as well, NOK 1.072 billion, which is the
best development compared with the corresponding quarter last year.
The main explanation for the good insurance result is the combination of good tariﬀ, solid
growth and the continued good underlying frequency claims development. Large losses
on the other hand are NOK 134 million higher than in the corresponding quarter of last
year, although it's been signiﬁcantly lower down than the expected level.
However, the increased proportion of large losses was more or less oﬀset by the run-oﬀ
gains. And the run-oﬀ gains are now more or less in line with what we expected over the
coming two-and-a-half years and four-and-a-half years. Pension and savings recorded a
good performance in the quarter. Improvement is primarily due to higher ﬁnancial result.
The Retail Bank reported very strong proﬁt this quarter, about NOK 30 million higher
proﬁt before tax than in the second quarter last year. Improvement in proﬁt performance
is due to combination of increased volumes and somewhat reduced provisions for losses
and a higher ﬁnancial result. The Retail Bank continues to show rigid growth, although the
growth rate is slowing somewhat. Lending has increased by 24% for the last 12 months.

FINAL

The investment portfolio yielded a satisfactory return of 1% in the quarter; and the proﬁt
before tax was NOK 1.7 billion compared to NOK 1.6 billion in the second quarter last year.
So turning to page 7. The combined ratio was 80.6% in the quarter, corresponding to
79.8% on a discounted basis. The cost ratio was 15.6%, up from 15% compared to last year.
As I had commented before, the increase is due to acquisition of business of Norway with
a higher cost ratio; and in addition, there is integration cost in the Baltics. As a result, the
degree of the project cost ratio will be somewhat above the 2015 level, both this year and
the next, but it will still be in the 15%. If we exclude the Baltics, the cost ratio was 14.5%,
which is unchanged from second quarter 2015.
The loss ratio was 65.0%, which is 0.6 percentage points higher than in the corresponding
quarter last year. The underlying loss ratio is actually unchanged from last year. The motor
portfolio in private Nordic continues to show good proﬁtability. There are some increases
in claims within additional coverages, particularly relating to rental cars, rescue and
(09:59) claims.
However, the long-term frequency reduction in serious personal injuries, major material
damage will continue, and we still expect claims inﬂation to remain at about 1% going
forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

The property portfolio in Norway shows a very good proﬁtability in the quarter; both the
frequency and average length are below our expected levels.
The commercial portfolio in Norway had also very strong results in the quarter. The
situation in our commercial property is much the same as from private portfolio property
with the loss frequency and also a few large losses in the quarter. The accident and health
service also – they also show stable and good development. Price pressure is increasing,
particularly in the large account accident and health schemes that we see now signs of the
frequency increase as the result of a somewhat weaker macroeconomic situation.
The Nordic region recorded a poor performance in the quarter. A large part of the reason
was signiﬁcantly higher proportion of large losses, but there's also weaker underlying
possibilities, particularly within motor and property in Denmark. About half of the
underlying weakening in this quarter is related to the weather, which especially aﬀects
property products.
For the motor portfolio in the commercial market, we will be keeping a close eye on the
possibility going forward to see whether there's we need to adjust the motor tariﬀ.
Moving on to the premium growth on page 8. As you can see, we continue to have some
premium growth, 6.7% in the quarter, with underlying growth of 1.2%. Helge has
commented on the growth in the Norwegian insurance market. Nordic reported growth of
14.9%, with underlying growth of 0.5%. The underlying growth in the damage portfolio
was SEK 3.9 million in local currency, which we are satisﬁed in. It is especially the
commercial property portfolio that is contributing to growth.

FINAL

The Swedish credit portfolio is also growing, but they still are missing a lot of customers in
the Swedish commercial portfolio as a result of the re-pricing that we are undertaking in
order to ensure a more proﬁtable portfolio.
The Baltics reports growth of 108.4% and 2% adjusted for currency and acquisition. The
underlying growth is inﬂuenced by the repricing of the portfolio, as well as implementing
new tariﬀs. However, we are seeing the positive eﬀect of the measures which are
implemented in distribution, including measures to get customers purchase a broader
range of product.
And turning to page 9, you can see that most of the nominal increase in cost of NOK 90
million comes from the Baltics and the Nordic segment, and it's due to our acquisitions
last year and also some currency eﬀect. And as you can see, the cost control in the
Norwegian segment is still very good.
On page 10, you ﬁnd details on our large losses in this quarter. Large losses amounted to
SEK 198 million, which is signiﬁcantly lower than expected, and the expected level was
SEK 318 million. But the level of this quarter also seem signiﬁcantly higher than large
losses in the second quarter last year, however, it was very low, SEK 4 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Fires were (13:36) main cause of the large losses in the quarter. And as you can see, the
increase in large losses are especially related to the Nordics, which is signiﬁcantly higher
than the same quarter last year.
Turning to page 11. Run-oﬀ gains of NOK 227 million ﬁrst half, the positive impact on the
combined ratio of 4.1 percentage points, which is around the expected level the next two
and a half years to four and a half years. The eﬀect of the corresponding quarter last year
was 2.0 percentage points.
Page 12 gives you some details from the investment portfolio. The portfolio was NOK 54
billion. This yielded a return of 1% in the quarter. The match portfolio, over NOK 36
million, makes a stable contribution to the ﬁnancial results is a return of 1%. The held to
maturity portfolio is one of the proﬁt driver in the match portfolio. So far, this year, the
average investment rate for the whole majority portfolio has been 3%, while its running
yield is 4.6%.
The excess value in the held to maturity portfolio increased by NOK 100 million in the
quarter to NOK 1.7 billion, which will make a positive contribution to the (14:56) in the
years ahead as well. The free portfolio amounted to NOK 18 billion and we derived a
return of 1.1% in the quarter.
The fall in the interest rate and the narrowing of the credit spreads contributed to the
bond portfolio which yielded a good return in the quarter. Convertible bonds were an
exception and were yielding a weak proﬁt return (15:17).

The shares in SR-Bank showed a good development and contributed positively to the
result with NOK 66 million while other current equities yielded zero proﬁt in the quarter.

FINAL

Current equities portfolio yielded a slight negative return of minus 0.5% in the quarter
and there were no special events in the portfolio in this quarter. And the property
portfolio also delivered a satisfactory result.
Then turning to page 13, the presentation of our strong capital position in three relevant
perspectives. The rating requirement is the most (16:01). The capital adequacy ratio on the
rating perspective is 110% the strategic buﬀer is NOK 1.4 billion, which represents an
increase of NOK 500 million since the end of the last quarter.
Few special elements aﬀects the numbers this quarter. We have included the capital
eﬀects on the Vardia acquisition of NOK 500 million even though the transaction was
closed on July 1. So there we have gained S&P's acceptance for reducing the technical
provision as a result of expected (16:35). This reduces the capital requirement by just
under NOK 500 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Therefore, also the underlying increase in the strategic buﬀer is NOK 500 million from last
quarter. This increase is mainly due to the 30% retained earnings that we add to the
weight of capital during the year, and the lower market risk gives a lower investment
portfolio after the diﬀerent payments in the quarter and also somewhat lower excess
(17:04). And they also have some of our insurance risk due to (17:08) somewhat lower at
the end of the quarter partly due to the currency eﬀects.
The solvency margin under the internal model factor increased from 181% to 187%, and
under standard formula, it increased from 139% to 148%. Based on our understanding of
the guarantee scheme, the solvency margin was 191% and 151%, respectively. Also in this
perspective, the Vardia acquisition has been taken into account in the calculation with
around NOK 500 million.
Looking at price come back (17:46) for the underlying improvements are the same as for
the rating perspective. In addition, cost increased due to proﬁt in premium provisions in
general insurance due to seasonal eﬀects and also increased due to proﬁtability growth in
the pension company. And lastly (18:05) in the pension company in the quarter.
So to sum up, we have a solid capital position in all perspective. We still consider it
possible to achieve a further improvement in capital eﬃciency by using some of the Tier-1
capacity, which amounted to NOK 2.7 billion by the end of the quarter. And as mentioned
earlier, we are not (18:28) the whole capacity and we are seeing a substantial buﬀer.
Then, I'll hand the word back to Helge for a quick wrap-up before the Q&A.

FINAL

Yeah. Thank you again. Then, it's on ﬁnal comments on page 14. We have strengthened
our market position in Norway, and we are maintaining our competitiveness as you have
seen through the presentation. We manage to do this in combination with continued
good proﬁtability and high customer satisfaction.
We are also seeing that it's limited organic growth and we expect that to continue in short
to medium term. This is driven by weak macroeconomic and consequently increased
competition. Over time, though, we expect to grow in that with nominal GDP. In addition,
we are well positioned to take part in structural changes in our region to exploit
economies of scale product. It's also important to continue with cost discipline. And we
have lots of initiative to continue what we have done for a number of years. In order to
achieve all the ﬁnancial targets which remain unchanged. It is all about balancing
underlying cost eﬃciency measures with relevant investment to secure competitiveness
also longer term. This includes initiatives related to increase the utilization and
automation. For instance, the utilization of robotics.
We will continue to deliver good customer experiences in combination with high value
creation and a predictable high and stable cash dividend for owners. Our strong capital
position as Catharina presented provides an important support. And with this, I'll hand it
back to you, Janne.

Yeah. Operator, we are then ready for taking questions please.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We can now take our ﬁrst question. It comes from Jakob Brink of ABG. Your
line is open, sir. Please go ahead.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning. I have three questions please. The ﬁrst one is regarding
the NOK 500 million adjustments to the S&P model due to your excess reserves. How will
this NOK 500 million be adjusted going forward? I mean, when you actually book those
run-oﬀ gains, will they then reduce this NOK 500 million? Or how will S&P actually treat
this?
Secondly, any news on your potential hybrid or Tier 1 issue? And ﬁnal question is on other
bonds in the free portfolio. The return here has been very strong for the past two quarters.
What should we expect from this line going forward, please? Thanks a lot.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

The ﬁrst question was related to the S&P in terms of when the NOK 500 million in eﬀect.
What's expected is that we reduce the reserved when we calculate the requirement for
Page 7 of 22



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2016-07-15

the insurance, which means that of course when these run-oﬀ gains are actually reported
in our results, it will be part of P&L and we understand they were successful, but the
reduction in the capital requirement has been taken in the accounts as from this quarter's
(22:31) reduction.

FINAL

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Sorry, why is it only NOK 500 million?

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

It's a reduction – the capital requirement is reduced by NOK 500 million due to the
technical reserve. So that's the eﬀect on the capital requirement.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

And news on the Tier 1 hybrid. Well, the news there is there's no news this quarter, only
that we continue to see that possibility to do this during 2016, and this is something that
we do to optimize the capital. So if you don't ﬁnd the terms eﬀective, we will – and we will
push it into 2017. But it's something that we view as possible to do during the second
quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

And then you asked about the bonds portfolio and the free portfolio. And, of course, it's
due to what happened on the interest rate side (23:47) from the margin. So it was a
(23:48) based on market movement in the interest rate and sometimes credit spreads.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

And what is your maturity on that portfolio?

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

It's now around somewhat about three years. We have the exact ﬁgure in the report. It was
3.5 years.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. Thanks for the...

And go back to benchmark. You could look at internationally managed investment grade
on high yield (24:23). These are internationally managed (24:28).

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

FINAL

Great. Many thanks.

Operator
Thank you. We can then move on to our next question, it comes from Jonny Urwin of UBS.
Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Good morning, all. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two from me. Firstly, I'm
interested to hear your commentary on the dynamic between pricing movements and
claims inﬂation across each of your key market. So you mentioned earlier that claims
inﬂation is running about 1%. I mean, are you able to price that out? What sort of action
are you putting through the book?

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, just thinking about the customer dividend model, I'm sure you gave us some
interesting stats at the Capital Markets Day about what the customer dividend model
does to retention for customers that are aware of it versus customers that aren't aware of
it. I wondered if you had any similar sort of statistics, and then if you could quantify the
impact of retention. Just any commentary there would be interesting? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Jonny. The ﬁrst question, it was related to pricing and inﬂation; although
pricing is, of course, to meet the combined ratio. And as you know, our target is to be in
the lower end of 86% to 89% in the period a run-oﬀ gain. And, of course, we have to
compensate for claims inﬂation to manage that over time.
We are also working analytical with dynamic and segmented approach to price
adjustment and trying to balance proﬁtability with growth. And so, pricing in Norway is
based in expectation is the same as you have heard before. Medium, long-term, it's
around 1% related to motor, and it's more 3% to 4% related to private property. But in the
situation we are now, we have also very, very strong proﬁtability, so we have to look at the
pricing up against what we deliver at the proﬁtability level. More normal results going
forward, we have to secure that that can price in line with the claims inﬂation.
What I said also to my presentation is that we see generally low price increases from our
competitors. We expect this to continue short term, medium term and long term. We
have to price in line with the claims inﬂation to secure the proﬁtability long term. So it's
nothing new related to our estimates for claims inﬂation actions.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Just to comment...

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

We have had a couple of years with very benign weather situation, very mild winters and
of course that's also part of the estimate at the moment.

FINAL

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. And did you say, was that pricing increases of 1% on motor, 1% to 4% on home, or
was that claims inﬂation or both?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

No. No. The price increase is at the moment and there's always long-term estimates for
claims. And estimates for claims inﬂation is the same as before, 1% for private model, 3%
to 4% related to property. And the price increase is below that at the moment, and we
expect that to continue in short-term.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Great. Thank you.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And then, you had a question about the customer dividend model. And what we see
there is that – we know that more than seven out of 10 customers say that this model is
part of their decision staying customer with Gjensidige. So it's deﬁnitely an important
loyalty tool for us.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

And do you have any sort of view on the diﬀerence that that leads to between customers
that are aware of the dividend and customers that aren't aware?

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

We know that out of our customers, nine out of 10 customers are aware of the model, but
probably closer to 100% now. But when it comes to non-customers, we also stated now
that we have the record high awareness of 62% after the campaign this quarter. So it's
gradually increasing also among non-customers.
And if you look into our retail book, just to give you a sense of the retention that we have
in our retail book in Norway, 85% of the premium in the retail book are premiums to our
loyalty and aﬃnity customers. And, there, the retention level is 92% in that part of the
book. And, of course, also again, the customer dividend model is supporting this.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Great. Thank you very much.

Operator
Can we move on to our next question?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yes.

Operator
Thank you. We can now move on to our next question. It comes from Paul De'Ath from
RBC. Your line is open, sir. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yeah. Hi there. And thanks for taking my questions. A couple from me please. Firstly, on
the Norwegian commercial business, so you've won another large scheme this quarter,
and there's one last quarter as well. And I believe on this quarter, and it's from one of your
major peers and judging by what they said during this week. I guess, on that point, just
kind of a – can you give us any more detail on why is that you're winning this game? Is it –
or these games, is it based on price? Is it brand? I guess, what's the driving factor for why
you're getting – winning these oﬀ your competitors? And are you going to be as
proﬁtable as they would have been had they want it, if that makes sense?
And then, the second question was just going back to the capital point and the buﬀer on
the S&P rating is now NOK 1.4 billion, and can you give any indication of where you're
comfortable for that buﬀer to be because it was at NOK 0.9 billion previously, and I think
that point, you were still talking about potentially being able to reduce it. And so, is your
base assumption still you're happy with lower than NOK 0.9 billion on that going forward?
Thanks.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah. If I understand your question related to the Norwegian commercial operation, we
are really pleased with the combination of proﬁtability and growth in that part book as
well. And it's important to comment the situation, we had growth driven, in particular by
one large new customer in that book came in 1st of January this year. So, we will have that
large account in our ﬁgures through the year.
We expect underlying growth to be limited on the commercial side especially related to
accident and health, its strong competitiveness that's being managed actually to price in
a way that we continue with strong proﬁtability. So we are really pleased with the whole
Page 11 of 22



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2016-07-15

operation in Norway, but it's limited growth and the growth we reported partly driven by
one large account.

FINAL

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yeah. And then you asked about the strategic buﬀer, which is now NOK 1.4 billion. The
main purpose for the buﬀer is, of course, the same that it has been all the time. It's to
meet regulatory uncertainty, to be able to ﬁnance smaller acquisitions, and obviously to
support stable dividend. And the buﬀer used to be higher last year, and that was due to
the higher regulatory uncertainty related to the implementation of Solvency II. So the level
has been reduced, reﬂecting that we now consider the regulatory uncertainty to be even
much lower than before we saw the full consequences of Solvency II implementation in
the Norwegian regulation.
But it's now mainly there for supporting M&A activities and also to support stable
dividend. And of course, it's up to the board, especially once a year, when they consider
the dividend for the year, to discuss the price of the buﬀer. And that said, just to remind
you that we have our ROE target and prospect, and we are very eager, of course, to
deliver on that target. So, we will not give any unnecessary buﬀers. So, let's think –
thinking it's the same as it's been before, that is – the buﬀer is higher than we need. These
are the remaining two main purposes of the buﬀer. The board will discuss cash and
dividend.

And just to add to your ﬁrst question of our competitiveness in general related to
commercial in Norway. It's important to remember that our commercial book is ﬁrst and
foremost, the SME book is only 20% to brokers. So, we have managed to build up a very
modern multi-client distribution model based on the principle from the private line. So, I
think that's also an explanation. And if you compare over business in the commercial
book in Norway up against our two main competitors, I think we have more direct
business compared to our main peers.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Okay. Great. That's very interesting. Thanks.

Thank you. We can now move on to our next question. It comes from Vinit Malhotra of
Mediobanca. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hi. Can you hear me? Just a few questions please. First is on the – in the Nordics, I
understand the underlying gross ratio of the group level was – in this quarter was driven
by the Nordics segment. And then we also see that the Nordics segment had some large
losses. Could you just comment a bit about whether it's Sweden mostly or Denmark
driving, because as I understand it's largely Denmark. But if you could just comment a
little bit there on this trend please.

FINAL

Second thing you said, we picked up that the free portfolio has had some portfolio
reallocation in the bonds more towards U.S. Has it been just towards the end of the
quarter? Is it something that was very practical? I mean, it's reasonably a sizable shift from
30-odd percent to 45-odd percent of bonds. If it's just a currency play, so that's one thing.
And last question please on the commercial – for the last two quarters where we have
seen one of the large transactions driving commercial growth in Norway, is it partly
attributable to the dividend model? Or how would you consider those one-oﬀ
transactions because now both quarters have seen some large deals and commercial
only? Thank you very much.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I think Janne (37:48) try to ﬁnd out how to answer your second and third question and I
can start with the ﬁrst one. And that's related to the Nordics segment. And as you know,
we report now Denmark and Sweden together. And it's completely a diﬀerent situation
between Denmark and Sweden.

Bloomberg Transcript

Just to start with Denmark, we are really pleased with the situation in Denmark, it's
positive underlying growth of 2.9% in local currency. If you include numbers related to
acquisition, it's 9.5%. Then you understand that we had a negative growth in Sweden, and
the Swedish operation is around or less than 20% of the Nordic premiums. 40%
commercial in Sweden and 60% private. We do repricing of the commercial book in
Sweden, so we have reduced premium volume related to commercial. And we have a
positive and good development in the private segment in Sweden.
In Denmark, as we communicated, we had several large losses in the second quarter. Last
year, it was zero. And this quarter, it was NOK 90 million, nine zero. In addition, we have
had also, as you have heard, also commentary earlier this week; it has been some local
heavy rains through the second quarter. And that has given some claims. And in addition
to that, somewhat weaker underlying growth or somewhat increased sales level
underlying. And I think this is, more or less, just in line with what you heard from earlier
this week.
So, you have to understand the split between Sweden and Denmark, and if you adjust for
large losses, we are really pleased with the situation in Denmark.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

And then, you asked about the allocation in the free portfolio. There is no special reason
why there is almost higher exposure towards this quarter. It's just based on ordinary
management of the portfolio. There is no speciﬁc reason behind that bond shift.

And then, Vinit, you had the third question. I think you need to repeat that, we didn't quite
get your question.

FINAL

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Sorry. Sorry. If it's clear now, let me try again. In both 1Q and 2Q in Commercial Norway,
we have seen you point to some of the large deals which helped the growth. I am just
curious whether these large deals are partly the result of the ongoing customer dividend
model or is it something just normal business?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

No. We need one new large customer, signiﬁcantly premium volume came into our book
January 1, and that will ﬂow into the ﬁgures through the whole 2016. And then, when we
come to January 1, 2017, we will not have – we will have it on...

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

I'm sorry, I thought that there was another one this quarter. Sorry. Apologies. I
misunderstood. I thought it was fourth quarter something.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

It's the same customer.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Thank you. We can then move on to our question. It comes from Matti Ahokas of Danske
Bank. The line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. It's Matti Ahokas here from Danske. Two questions please. First thing on the
capital, a bit surprised that the economic capital is up NOK 1 billion quarter-on-quarter,
and there seems to be some kind of new calculation taking up on the provisions in Life
Insurance. Is this a kind of one-oﬀ thing or is this dependent on interest rates? Or how
should we see this going forward?
And the second question is regarding the Baltic operations. Has something happened
underlying here because at least if I listen to Helge, you sound relatively still bearish
overall about the Baltic situation? Or are this kind of is the sub-scale proﬁtability more a
function of the recently acquired assets? Or a clariﬁcation on what's going there would be
very helpful. Thanks a lot.

FINAL

I can answer the question about the capital requirement. There are two one-oﬀ that
explain some of the movement. The rest are more ordinary and change is more ordinary,
changes, some speciﬁc events or anything. It's the Vardia transaction, it's a one-oﬀ. And
then, it's the S&P, the change in (43:02). So those are the one-oﬀs this quarter. The rest is
just ordinary and mainly (43:11).

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Sorry. I'm talking about the economic capital, the S&P way, is that also in the economic
capital calculation?

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yes, the S&P. Yes, it's a lower – no, the change in S&P model is a lower capital
requirement; and the Vardia transaction; it's both the capital requirement and the
economic capital. So the Vardia transaction has a fall through eﬀect on cash ﬂow of NOK
500 million. Around NOK 200 million is increased capital requirement and around NOK
300 million is reduced capital available.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Okay. But still to clarify, the S&P has nothing to do with the economic capital of NOK 20.8
billion, I guess?

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No. You're talking about the solvency capital available?

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yeah. Exactly – or the economic capital available. Actually, on page number 27, that was
up NOK 1 billion from NOK 19.8 billion in Q1 to NOK 20.8 billion. And it's a very sizable
increase taking into the account the fact that your proﬁts, excluding dividends, would
have gone up by something around NOK 300 million?

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yeah. One thing is, of course, that we assume that 30% from that result is added to the
capital during the year. So we retained 30% of net proﬁt. We also took a subordinated
loan in GDF, the pension company, NOK 300 million which also adds to the available
capital. We talked about the Vardia acquisition, and it has a small eﬀect – a negative eﬀect
on available capital. And then you have future proﬁts in provisions both within the general
insurance business and the lifestyle business. And in the general insurance business, it's
mainly due to seasonal eﬀects. And within the pension business, it's mainly due to some
growth.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

All right. Great.

FINAL

Related to the Baltic question, I was rather short, but the communication should at least
be just the same as last quarter. It will be worse until it gets better. So we are working with
integration and improvement program, and we are on track with that. And that means that
we will see proﬁtability in 2018.
Regarding the Baltic market, it's also ﬁerce competition out in these three countries. We
are trying to go from broker to multi-channel distribution, and that requires investment
and you have seen that in our cost ﬁgures. We are also implementing tariﬀs and
processes portfolio management based on our knowledge from Norway and the Nordic;
and we have started with motor in Latvia, and we are continuing with Lithuania.
So what we actually overall want to do out there is leveraging Gjensidige's brand and best
practice from Nordics to the Baltics. We want to launch better risk-based pricing using
GLM models. It's about claims handling processes, eﬃcient and eﬀective claims handling.
So we're actually building a completely new company and that requires investment. And
we also try to get faster to market with products and tariﬀs compared to before.

Bloomberg Transcript

And ﬁnally, of course, we want to integrate the PZU with our own companies, and it's a
signiﬁcant job related to leadership and employee and culture. But we are on track as the
communication should actually being just same as last quarter.
Regarding the market, it's very price-sensitive standardized products. Most competitors
fail to breakeven on motor products. But we also see some encouraging and interesting
development, health insurance products, marketing; it's growing rapidly, 15% to 20% in
Latvia. So it's something interesting also happening in the market. So we use more group
resources and we are according to plan.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

When you say it's going to get worse before it gets better, does it mean that the quarterly
underwriting proﬁt will still go down from current levels or how should one interpret that?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

It may happen. But we will breakeven and get proﬁtable in 2018.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. Thanks a lot.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

We are in the investment period. So from broker to multi-channel is biased investment;
and building tariﬀs and building the systems around the claims handling processes and
the pricing processes require investment. So it's on the cost side, as you have seen, but
we are comfortable.

Thank you. We can now move on to our next question. It comes from Blair Stewart of Bank
of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thanks very much. Good morning. All the good questions have gone, so mines are pretty
rubbish. Here we go. First one is in The Pensions and Savings segment. I noticed there
was a drop in premium income, and that's unusual given that's a growth market. So I just
wonder if you could comment on that and the outlook.
Secondly, I wondered if you had a cost income ratio target or something in mind for the
bank, which had a very good Q2. And thirdly, you mentioned in the commentary that
claims frequency is still lower than normal. I think that's what you said anyway. I may be
paraphrasing. But if that is the case, is it possible to comment on how favorable that has
been so far this year in terms of the combined ratio eﬀect? Thank you very much.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I can start with the latter, Blair, and Catharina is looking for the two other questions
together with Janne and (49:44).
Claims frequency is – we have had very good situation for a long period now. If you go
back to 2010, we had a signiﬁcant freeze in the whole Nordic area. And as I remember, in
our ﬁgures then, we had almost NOK 400 million, NOK 360 million to NOK 400 million,
in extraordinary claims related to that hard, harsh winter. We haven't really had that kind
of winter since 2010.
And if we have a very hard winter coming in November and leading maybe in March,
April, we will have a completely diﬀerent trigger situation on motor, private and property.
And that's the diﬀerence between then and the years later.
So, it's warmer climate, but still it's the – that's the long trend. So, we should – if we have
winter lighter next winter. And then we will have a completely diﬀerent frequency
situation. When we operated claims inﬂation, it's more long term based on the situation
that we will have harsh winter now and then.
I don't know if I answered your last question with that comment. But if not, try once again,
Blair.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

No, no. (51:15). I think I've probably been asking the question since 2010 actually, but it
seems that you're saying that a harsh winter cost about NOK 400 million in additional
Page 17 of 22



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2016-07-15

claims. You haven't had that since, so if we did get a harsh winter, then that's the
magnitude of the impact that might have on your underwriting result, which would be
about 10% of your underwriting result, more or less.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. It was – I think it was NOK 350 million on that premium volume.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

But the competition we have today, lots of the new players, they haven't really
experienced that winter. And that's – that could actually happen again next winter.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yes. Of course. Thank you, that's great.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. When it comes to the cost income ratio in the bank, we don't have a target that we
can (52:08), the target is to be a lean bank, to have a low cost income ratio, of course. This
is interest based bank. They did not have their own physical distribution. The target has
been a lean bank supporting the Private segments in the Norwegian market.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Would it be fair to say then that you should expect the cost income ratio to reduce
over time? If that's your objective, presumably, you'd want to continue to grow the top
line.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

It's about scale. That's correct.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

I'm sorry?

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yeah. It's about scale. That's correct.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Should reduce over time, absolutely.

Page 18 of 22



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2016-07-15

Yeah. Okay. Thank you. And on the pension side?

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. It's a reduction in the income is, I think, it's more or less seasonal ﬂuctuation. So, we
do have a good competitive position in this market, competing market, the three others
bigger players. There's no speciﬁc reason behind the fall in the premiums for the quarter.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah. It was – is this the ﬁrst time that the premiums have reduced as far as I can see for
quite some time both in Q1 and Q2.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yeah, we continue to compete harder in that market, and we think we still have a very
good position. And it is done, again, the support of our commercial book and very good
of less 85% of the premium customers are also P&C customers. And of course, that's the
main reason why we have this pension company. But as I see it, it's very hard – these
products are very often found (54:09) health products with the P&C. And as we have
commented, it's very hard, competitive landscape out there now within these schemes.
And if we look at, for example, the workers' comp market in Norway within the (54:27)
product within the P&C market, the market has actually fallen over the last 12 months.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right. Okay.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Good morning. Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. And I've got a couple. Firstly, on
your appetite for M&A, it now seems that you've got quite a hefty integration going from
both Baltics and in terms of Vardia. So, I was just wondering what your kind of capacity,
not in terms of capital, but in terms of, as an example, management resources to do a
further bolt-on M&A that you've talked about in the past.

Page 19 of 22



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2016-07-15

And secondly on digitalization, I think you have a target for 2018 to have 75% digital
customers and over 50% of claims supported online. Just wondering if you've got a
update against those metrics. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah. If you can ﬁnd the update on the metrics for the latter question, Janne. Your ﬁrst
question is good. It's lot of work. Every time we have bought – we have now bought 16
companies the last 10 years – 10 years, 11 years. And it's a signiﬁcant job every time to
integrate the company. And today, we are working in Sweden and Baltics, as you said.
That means that we will not acquire small portfolios, small companies that are too
complicated to integrate.
So the appetite short term will be robust. We will, of course, have appetite all the time to
buy and integrate it, particularly important companies, which is possible to actually
handle for us regarding integration.
So we have a very skilled team. They look at things all the times. And if the right target
occur, we will, of course, look seriously into that. But too complicated and too small, we
are short term, we do not have appetite short term if it's complicated and small.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

And then when it comes to diﬃcult customers, the number at 63% updated. So, that is the
last number we have versus the target that you mentioned. And when it comes to claims
reported online, we are actually approaching very fast now, that's over 50% already.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Brilliant. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. Okay. We have another question. It comes from Jakob Brink of ABG.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Yeah. It's Jakob again. Just one follow-up please. In the bank, I also noticed that your net
interest margin is quite strong in the second quarter, and actually, it has been quite ﬂat
since last year when it dropped into Q3. If we look at other Norwegian banks, it seems as
if there's a competition in the beginning of the year, so I was just – this year. So, I'm just
wondering why don't you see the same pressure on margins.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Page 20 of 22



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2016-07-15

Well, if we look at the margin, it's 1.82%. And it's, of course, the combination of the kind of
(58:22) it's combination of healthy mortgages which is, of course, a low margin product.
We also oﬀer consumer ﬁnance, as well as car ﬁnance. It's a combination of the healthy
portfolio which (58:34) this 1.82%.

FINAL

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Although competition is not actually comparable with the large banks because we have a
relatively high proportion of the business outside mortgages, consumer ﬁnance and car
ﬁnance with better margins.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

And you're not seeing any pressure on these segments?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Pardon? Not seeing...

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

And you do not see the same pressure in car ﬁnance and consumer ﬁnance as the larger
banks are doing in the mortgages? Is that what you're saying?

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Speciﬁcally loans.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah, mortgages. Of course, we see the same pressure as the other one. But the
composition in our bank is diﬀerent compared to the large bank.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Yes. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
