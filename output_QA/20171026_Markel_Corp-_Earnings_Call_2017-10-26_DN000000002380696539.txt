Good morning. This is Tom Gayner, the Co-CEO of Markel Corporation and it is my
pleasure to welcome you to our third quarter 2017 conference call. I'm joined this morning
by my Co-CEO, Richie Whitt and our Chief Financial Officer, Anne Waleski.

FINAL

In a few moments, they will review our financial performance from the first nine-months of
the year as well as provide some comments and updates on our insurance operations.
Following, that I will return and update you on our investment and industrial operations
and then we will take your questions.
Mark Twain once said, A man who carries a cat by the tail learns something he can learn in
no other way. I don't know if Twain was anticipating the record catastrophe losses of 2017
when he penned those words. But as a fan of his, I'm going to give him credit in foresight
-- for brilliance with this bit of wisdom.
2017 will be a record year for catastrophes. And at the moment, we've got 66 days to go
before the ball drops in Times Square to call time. Catastrophes are known as cats in the
property and casualty insurance industry and it is our job to pick them up by the tail. That is
what we do. In doing so, we fulfill our social responsibility and our reasons for being by
responding to the cats with the resources to help our policyholders put their lives back
together again. As we reported, we record charges of just over $500 million net of our
reinsurance recoveries to pay claims to our policyholders for losses they suffered as a
result of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Additionally, we've witnessed earthquakes in
Mexico and fires in California into the fourth quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

As I said a minute ago, 2017 is not over yet. The good news is that our policyholders can
count on us to help them in their time of need. Times like these demonstrate why they
bought insurance. Times like these also speak to why we manage Markel in a conservative
and prudent way.
We do so in order to have the ability to respond quickly and appropriately to help our
policyholders get back on their feet. We keep our promises. As Twain alluded, we also
learned something, as we pick up these cats by the tail. Specifically, the underwriting of
insurance involves gathering data and making informed judgments about the probable
costs of bearing the uncertainty of future losses.
In each and every event, we learn more by gathering new and expensive data and future
predictions become based on more robust [ph] data, experience and judgment. Just as
we have in the past, through previous record catastrophe events like the World Trade
Center attack, Katrina, Rita, Wilma and others, we will learn, adapt and proceed with more
knowledge as we go forward.
Finally, I want to remind you, as fellow shareholders that we, as a company are reporting
positive comprehensive income to you this morning. We've designed Markel to be a
resilient and durable company that our customers, shareholders and associates can
depend upon.
In addition, and I do mean in addition to the $500 million of catastrophe related payments
we are making to our policyholders, we earned pre-tax net investment income in
dividends and interest payments of roughly $300 million.

FINAL

We also earned pre-tax unrealized gains on our investment portfolio of over $800 million.
We produced EBITDA of 115 million at Markel Ventures so far this year and if you towed up
these items, there are positive returns from two of our three engines that totaled well
over a $1 billion of pre-tax ins compared to the 0.5 billion of pre-tax outs.
I also specifically used the words pre-tax since there are elements of tax efficiency in
these numbers that also improved our net financial circumstances. I am proud of our
organization that we can create the win-win situation of providing $500 million of support
and payments to our policyholders and increase the net worth of the Markel Corporation
at the same time.
That is the design of Markel and it is win-win. It is easy to say and hard to do, but we've
done so. With that, let me turn it over to Anne and Richie to give you the details on the
numbers and commentary upon -- on our insurance operations.
After their comments, I'll turn to pick up on our investment and industrial business. Anne?

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. Markel's comprehensive income and
growth in book value for the first nine-months of 2017 reflects strong performance in our
investment portfolio and demonstrates the value of having diversified operations.
While underwriting results were impacted by several catastrophes, we continued to see
positive growth across several product lines. Within our Markel Ventures operations, we
completed the acquisition of Costa Farms in August. Costa Farms is a Florida based
grower of house and garden plants, which adds to the diversity of our portfolio of noninsurance Markel Ventures Company.
We're also excited about our upcoming acquisition of State National, which is expected to
close in the fourth quarter. Now, let's talk about our results for the first nine-months of
2017. Total operating revenues grew 5% to approximately $4.4 billion in 2017. The increase
was primarily attributable to an 8% increase in earned premiums, which reflects higher
earnings in all three of our underwriting segments.
Starting with our underwriting results, gross written premiums were $4.1 billion for the first
nine-months of 2017, compared to $3.8 billion in 2016, an increase of 9%. The increase in
gross premium volume was attributable to premium growth in all three of our
underwriting segments.
The increase in gross written premiums in the US insurance segment was attributed to
growth within our programs, general liability and personal lines business, as well as
premiums from our new surety business.
In the international insurance segment, higher growth written premiums were due to new
business in our marine and energy and excess liability product lines. Higher gross written
Page 3 of 18



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2017-10-26

premiums in our reinsurance segment were attributable to two large specialty quota
share treaties that were written in the first quarter of 2017.

FINAL

Assumed reinstatement premiums attributable to the 2017 catastrophes and higher
premium volume in our professional liability and workers' compensation product lines.
Partially offsetting these increases with lower premium volume in our auto, property and
general liability lines of business.
Net written premiums for the first nine-months of 2017 were $3.5 billion, up 11% from last
year, for the same reasons I just discussed. As well as a one point increase in retention
from 83% last year to 84% this year.
Earned premiums increased 8% to $3.1 billion for the first nine-months of 2017 due to
higher premium in all three underwriting segments. Our consolidated combined ratio for
the first nine-months of 2017 was 108% compared to 93% last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

The 2017 combined ratio included underwriting losses of $503 million, net of
reinstatement premiums from Hurricane Harvey, Irma and Maria and the earthquakes in
Mexico or 16 points on the consolidated combined ratio.
Excluding the impact of the catastrophes in 2017, our combined ratio decreased due to
higher earned premiums in 2017 compared to 2016. As we discussed in the first quarter,
the 2017 combined ratio also includes $85 million or three points of adverse development
on prior year loss reserves in our Reinsurance segment, resulting from the decrease in
the Ogden rate which is used to calculate lump sum awards on UK bodily injury cases.
In 2016, the combined ratio included $71 million or two points of adverse development on
our medical malpractice and specified medical product lines within our US Insurance
segment.
Now, I'll talk about the results of Markel Ventures. Revenues from Markel Ventures
increased to $933 million compared to $906 million a year ago. Higher revenues across
our non-manufacturing operations due to increased sales volume were partially offset by
lower revenue in certain of our manufacturing operations, primarily attributable to one of
our transportation related businesses.
Net income to shareholders from Markel Ventures for the year was $38 million for the first
nine-months of 2017, compared to $50 million last year. EBITDA was $116 million in 2017,
compared to $134 million last year.
Operating expenses in 2017 include $20 million of inventory losses arising from Hurricane
Irma. We have not yet recognized the potential for any insurance recoveries resulting from
these losses. Insurance recoveries will be recognized as income in the period in which
they become more certain.

Looking at our investment results, investment income increased from $279 million for the
first nine-months of 2016 to $304 million this year. The increase was driven by short-term
investment income, primarily due to higher short-term interest rates and higher dividend
income due to increased equity holdings compared to the same period of 2016.

FINAL

Net realized investment losses were $2 million for the first nine-months of 2017, compared
to net realized investment gains of $66 million last year.
Net realized investment losses in 2017 included a $40 million net loss in our investment in
the Markel CATCo funds related to underlying losses on Hurricane Harvey, Irma and Maria.
Given our long-term focus, variability and the timing of realized and unrealized gains and
losses is to be expected. Looking at our total results for the year, our effective tax rate
was 32% in 2017 compared to 27% a year ago. The increase in the effective tax rate from
2016 to 2017 was primarily attributable to the impact during the third quarter of having a
small pre-tax loss for the first nine-months of 2017, which magnified the effect of certain
tax adjustments.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have reported a net loss to shareholders of $40 million for the first nine-months of
2017, compared to net income to shareholders of $323 million a year ago.
Comprehensive income to shareholders for the period was $546 million compared to
$696 million a year ago.
And as a result, book value per share was $641 at the end of September 2017, an increase
of 6% since the end of 2016. Finally, I'll make a couple of comments on cash flows and the
balance sheet.
Net cash provided by operating activities was just under 600 million for the first ninemonths of 2017 compared to approximately $325 million for the same period of 2016.
Operating cash flows for 2017 included higher premium collections in the US insurance
segment, lower claims settlement activity across all of our underwriting segments and
lower payments for income taxes and employee profit sharing compared to 2016.
In 2017, we also used cash of just under $600 million for acquisitions including the
acquisition of Costa Farms in the third quarter and SureTec in the second quarter. Invested
assets at the holding company were $2.5 billion at both September 30th 2017 and yearend 2016.
With that, I'll turn it over to Richie. To talk more about underwriting results.

Richard Whitt III

{BIO 1836438 <GO>}

Thanks, Anne. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll focus my comments on our
underwriting operations and also provide an update on our CATCo operations and also a
brief update on our pending acquisition of State National.

FINAL

Obviously, as we've heard the news for Markel's underwriting operations, Markel CATCo
and the insurance and reinsurance industry as a whole is the significant catastrophic
events that took place in the third quarter.
As Anne pointed out, our underwriting losses were $503 million, net of reinsurance and
before tax. These are obviously meaningful losses, however, with our strong balance
sheet, we're well positioned to respond for the claims of our insurers and we're also
prepared to respond to our insurer's and producer's ongoing insurance needs.
So, starting with the US Insurance segment, gross written premiums were up 115 million or
17% compared to the third quarter of '16. On a year-to-date basis, writings were up 171
million or 9% to last year.
Results attributable to our new Markel surety business added $22 million of gross written
premium in the quarter and $34 million to the year-to-date premiums.
Premium growth, excluding Markel surety is driven by growth in our programs, personal
lines, which is primarily our classic auto program, and several of our general liability lines
on both the quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

Earned premiums were up 9% for the quarter and 7% year-to-date, due to the same
drivers as gross written premium increases. The combined ratio for the US Insurance
segment was 112 for the third quarter of '17 as compared to 101 for the same period a
year ago.
The 2017 cat events added 24 points to the 2017 quarter-to-date combined ratio.
Excluding the impact of the 2017 cat's, the segment combined ratio decreased due to
more favorable development on prior year loss reserves in '17.
For the third quarter of '17, favorable prior year loss development was 88 million
compared to 21 million a year ago.
The third quarter of '16 included 37 million of adverse development on our medical
malpractice and specified med lines.
The year-to-date combined ratio was 99 compared to 95 in '16. The 2017 cat events
added nine points to the 2017 year-to-date combined ratio. Excluding the impact of the
2017 cat events the segment combined ratio decreased due to more favorable
development on prior year loss reserves in '17.
On a year-to-date basis, prior year redundancies were 207 million for '17 compared to 126
million for '16. This difference was largely a result of 71 million of adverse development on
the medical malpractice inspect med lines last year.

FINAL

Next, I'll go on to the International Insurance segment. Gross written premiums were up 51
million or 19% compared to third quarter of '16 on a year-to-date basis, writings were up
70 million or 8% to last year. New business in our marine and energy lines during the third
quarter of '17 drove the growth in the quarter.
Premium growth on a year-to-date basis was also driven by growth in our excess liability
lines. Earned premiums were up 10% for the quarter and 6% year-to-date due to the
same drivers that gross written premium increases were caused by.
The third quarter combined ratio was 136% compared to 91% for the same period a year
ago. The 2017 cat's added 47 points to 2017 year-to-date combined, excluding the impact
of the '17 cats. The segment combined ratio decreased due to lower current year loss
ratio, partially offset by favorable development on prior year losses having a less
favorably impact on the combined ratio due to higher earned premiums.
So, very similar dollars, but a lower combined ratio impact due to higher earned. The
lower current year loss ratios is due to the higher traditional large losses in 3Q 2016
primarily on our Marine and Energy lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

The year-to-date combined ratio was 105 compared to 95 in '16. The 2017 cats added 17
points to the 2017 combined ratio excluding the impact of the cats. The combined ratio
decreased due to more favorable development on prior year losses, primarily in our
general liability lines and a lower expense ratio due to lower profit sharing expense and
the impact of higher earned premiums on our G&A expenses.
Next, I'll discuss the Reinsurance segment results. For the third quarter, gross written
premiums for the segment, are up 33 million or 17% compared to 2016. On a year-to-date
basis, writings are up 106 million or 11% to last year.
For the quarter, premiums were up due to the increase, due to increased property
premiums, due to the impact of assumed reinstatement premiums from the '17 cat
events. For the year, growth was primarily driven by the two new large specialty quota
share treaties. In the first quarter, Anne mentioned those. They were roughly 137 million.
Excluding these contracts year-to-date premium is actually down due to reductions in our
auto and general liability lines.
As mentioned in previous quarters significant volatility in gross premium volume should be
expected in our reinsurance segment, due to individually significant deals and the timing
of renewals on multi-year contracts.
Earned premiums are up 26% for the quarter and 13% year-to-date due to the -- due to
similar drivers as gross written premium increase. The third quarter combined ratio was
183% compared to 94% for the same period a year ago.

FINAL

The '17, cat events added 95 points for the '17 quarter-to-date combined ratio. Excluding
the impact of the 2017 cat events, the segment combined ratio decreased due to a lower
expense ratio. The decrease in the expense ratio was driven by lower profit sharing
expenses and the impact of higher earned premiums on our G&A expenses.
The year-to-date combined ratio was 135% compared to 87% last year. The 2017 cat
events added 34 points to the '17 combined ratio excluding the impact of the cat events,
the combined ratio increased due to less favorable development on prior year losses.
This was partially offset by lower expense ratio due to the impact of higher earned
premium on G&A expenses.
Anne discussed the development on prior years, was impacted by the 85 million related
to the Ogden rate. Excluding this impact from the year-to-date results, there were slightly
less favorable development on prior year loss reserves in our property and general
liability lines.
Now, I'll make a couple comments about the market. It feels like for the last several
quarters I've been saying, the market remains competitive and not much new to report.

Bloomberg Transcript

Coming out of the third quarter, I have some new things to say. The property market is
clearly in transition. By that I mean, post the events of the third quarter, there's clearly
momentum building for rate increases.
Questions that remain are, how much will rates increase and how broad based will rate
increases be. Our sense is the extent of rate increases will play out over the next several
months, all the way into next year.
As the actual losses from these events are realized by companies and as we get closer to
the critically important January 1 renewals, the breadth and depth of rate increases in the
property market and beyond will emerge. At Markel, we are seeking rate increases on all
property business.
However, we're not taking a one-size fits all approach. On loss free or better rated
accounts, the necessary increases will be smaller. On loss impacted or relatively more
aggressively rated accounts, we will need larger increases.
We also believe that rate increases are needed more broadly than just property business.
We believe there is very little, if any margin left in casualty business and that rate
increases are required in casualty lines as well. The spillover effect of increasing property
rates into other lines of business could take longer than finding the new higher market
level for property rates, but we do believe this is going to occur. We will be actively
seeking appropriate rate increases across all of our casualty lines. A long time industry
veteran recently said to me, talk doesn't move market pricing earnings and capital
destruction moves market pricing.

FINAL

It is clear that these events represent meaningful earnings and capital destruction to the
industry and the only logical response will be, for companies to raise prices to more
adequate levels.
Next, I'd like to make a few comments about our Markel CATCo operations. They
obviously were also impacted by these events. Assets under management including funds
held that will be used to settle catastrophe claims increased to 4.5 billion at September
2017, up from 3.4 billion at September 2016.
As of September 2017, Markel's investment in the Markel CATCo funds was approximately
204 million. During the third quarter, we recognized a loss of 52 million due to change in
the net asset value of the funds, due to the estimated losses from the third quarter
events.
Consistent with our conservative approach to managing our loss reserves, we have
impacted the value of our investment in the funds based upon the higher end of Markel
CATCo's previous released estimated range of results for the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

The CATCo team is currently working hard to determine the extent of clients losses and
required side-pockets, renew new clients with appropriate rate increases and raised
capital needed to meet 2018 client demand. We believe we are making good progress
on all fronts, but will not have the full picture until closer to year-end.
Finally, just an update on State National, the day before our last quarterly call, we
announced entering into an agreement to purchase State National. Today, I'm happy to
report that this Tuesday, State National shareholders overwhelmingly approved the deal.
The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions, including one related -excuse me, one remaining regulatory approval in Delaware and we expect to close the
deal before the end of the fourth quarter.
We are very excited to welcome the State National team to Markel, we look forward to
adding the premier fronting platform in the US as well as adding a recognized leader of
collateral protection insurance for credit unions and regional banks.
Now, I'd like to turn it over to Tom. Thank you.

Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Thank you, Richie. Markel enjoys a relatively unique position and that we have three
powerful engines to drive this Company forward. Richie described our insurance engine
circumstances and I'll pick up with our investment and industrial products and services
engines.
The investment engine produced excellent results during the first nine-months of 2017.
We earned 17.6% on our equity investments through September 30th.
Page 9 of 18



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2017-10-26

FINAL

More importantly, our longer-term record remains one of the finest in the investment
industry. We've outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 100 basis points over
decades and this record continues in 2017.
We do so, at extraordinarily low costs and with a high degree of tax efficiency. Currently
we have roughly 64% of our equity capital invested in publicly traded equity securities.
This is enough to give us a meaningful return in pleasant environments like what we've
experienced so far this year.
It is also balanced and conservative enough to provide a measure of safety and liquidity
to absorb bad debts and remain in a position to make positive investments in more
turbulent times.
In our fixed income operations, we continue to execute our strategy of owning high
quality plain vanilla bonds and matching the duration of our portfolio to that of our
insurance liabilities. We earned 2.8% on our fixed income holdings through September
30th and we continue to earn the coupon. There were no credit losses to report as has
been the case for quite some time.

Bloomberg Transcript

That is how it should be. I'm delighted to report to you that is also how it actually is. Our
industrial products and services engine, known as Markel Ventures also produced
substantial positive results. We earned EBITDA of 115 million versus a 133 million in the
prior year.
When you look at those raw numbers, I would suggest that you also look at a couple of
additional items. One, we recognized a $20 million loss due to storm losses on inventory
from Hurricane Irma. That number represents the cost of inventory that was damaged by
the storm.
As we pointed out in the 10-Q, we recognized nothing for future insurance recoveries
from that loss. Let me assure you as fellow shareholders that we were insured for that
loss and we do expect meaningful recoveries in the future.
The two fundamental principles of accounting are conservatism and matching. In the
fundamental covenant of what accounting is meant to do, those principles mean that
whenever there is a choice about how to present financial outcomes, you're supposed to
present things in a more conservative rather than aggressive way.
You are also supposed to match revenues and expenses in the period in which they occur.
I would suggest you if that this $20 million of expense is about as conservative as it could
possibly get.
I would also suggest to you that I, as a former accountant struggle to understand how this
third quarter expense comports with the fundamental principle of matching revenues and
expenses in the same time period.

FINAL

When you go from the covenant of accounting principles to the contractual process of
GAAP accounting, rule makers necessarily delve into definitions, processes, terms and
procedures that are necessary to create actual journal entries.
I'm told by our GAAP accountants that the expense of the inventory losses are certain and
knowable as of the end of the third quarter. I'm also told that the insurance recoveries are
not knowable enough or precise enough to do the other half of the journal entries, where
we would report the receivable on our books in anticipation of future claims that we
expect to collect.
What all this means is that in the not too distant future we should collect insurance
proceeds from this loss and at that time, we'll record the entire amount as income in that
period with no associated expense.
Secondly, we recognized $10 million of expense in the period for paying out an incentive
earn out from a previous acquisition. I remind you that paying an earn out greater than
what we expected means that things have gone even better than we originally
anticipated.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let me say it plainly, that's a good thing. On the surface though, we're reflecting that
unalloyed good news as an expense flowing through the income statement. In my fantasy
world of GGAAP that stands for gain or generally accepted accounting principles, I would
consider that payment a balance sheet item and a capital transaction of payment for an
income producing asset rather than a period income statement expense.
The good news for fans of GGAAP and GAAP is that we will all agree to the same number
in the future periods. The payment has been expensed and the future expenses for the
earn out will be zero no matter how you go about accounting for the issue.
Adding these two items, which totaled $30 million to the reported EBITDA of 115 million
doesn't seem completely nuts to me, feel free to make your own judgment about my
logic. I apologize for the accounting digression, but I think it is critical to discuss this issue
in order to understand and more fully appreciate the underlying economics of the
business.
Finally, I want to close with a reminder that at Markel, we are about the task of building
one of the world's great companies. We do this by building a durable and sustainable winwin-win organization that does things for our customers, shareholders and associates
rather than to them.
The results of 2017 demonstrate the reality of this mission in States. First and foremost we
are responding to losses suffered by our policyholders with claims payments that we
currently estimate to be more than $500 million.
This is a win for our customers. We are there for them when they need us. This is true, not
just to the insurance, but in our industrial operations where we build bakery equipment,
Page 11 of 18

Date: 2017-10-26

car trailers, truck floors, dredges and dorm room furniture among other things and where
we provided housing, medical care, IT consultants and other valuable services to our
clients.

FINAL

Secondly, we created a win for our shareholders with positive overall returns from our
investment and industrial engines.
Additionally, we're creating a win for our shareholders with the transformative acquisitions
of SureTec and Costa Farms so far this year and expectations that State National will soon
follow.

Bloomberg Transcript

These new additions to Markel expand the revenue base of your company by
approximately a third and we are funding these purchases without raising any equity to do
so. We filled[ph] a balance sheet over the years that can respond to the highest
catastrophe year ever and pay for three meaningful acquisitions all at the same time.
Ladies and gentlemen, that's a powerful statement. Finally, as said in the Markel style our
covenant that describes how we operate this company, we are creating a win for our
associates by providing an atmosphere in which people can reach their personal potential.
This is a company full of people who are creative, adaptable, continuously learning and
dedicated to our customers, shareholders and fellow associates.
We continue to celebrate the task of serving each and every one of these people and we
take joy in doing so. We continue to travel down the path of becoming one of the world's
great companies through our daily act of service that are our jobs. Thank you for your
long-term support and partnership as shareholders and your provision of the financial
capital required to complete this mission.
With that, we look forward to your questions. Kate [ph] , if you would open up the floor for
questions, please.

Questions And Answers
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first
question is from John Fox of Fenimore Asset Management. Please go ahead.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, everyone. I have a few questions. The first one is, I guess, my only
surprise in the quarter was the high rate of gross premium written, which is in the low to
mid-teens, ex the acquisition. I'm just curious given my sense within a soft market for a
period of time and your disclosure in the Q about most premium rates kind of trending
down, where are you seeing opportunity to write business -- at really double-digit on a
gross premium written rate? Thank you. Then I have an unrelated question?

FINAL

All right, thanks, John. I'll try to tackle that one. There is no doubt that Markel is
competitive and we've talked about it in previous quarters, is there's only a number of
lines where we're probably shrinking or actually shrinking. But there are some areas where
we've found opportunities and we're growing. In London, we found a particular marine
and energy program last year that we added to the book this year and so that's coming
online that number was zero last year and that program is coming online it could be 50
million or 60 million by the end of the year.
Similar things happened in the US where we found another program. That property -- it
was kind of a property package sort of program. And again, it's probably a 60 million to
70 million opportunity that's coming online. That would have been zero last year. So,
we've, we've had some nice pick-ups like that, very, very targeted rifle [ph] shots. And
then we're growing in other areas such as the our classical auto program.
We're seeing some nice increases in our national markets over in London, which is retail
business, which has been -- it's stickier business. It's a -- it doesn't move around as much
in terms of price and so it's a good place to grow. So we're -- I guess, I would say we are
not surprised by the growth. These are things that we kind of put into works in 2016 at the
end of 2016, I knew they would come online during 2017 and hopefully the goal would be
each year to find a few things like that, a few gold nuggets amongst what is otherwise a
fairly competitive market at least up until now.

Right. Okay. Well, I hope you're not surprised, Richie.

A - Richard Whitt III

{BIO 1836438 <GO>}

No.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

So -- how do you think about the return on equity or the returns on that business? When
you find these pockets, was it -- you think about gee they have a good combined ratio or
you say, gee, we can write $2 a premium for $1 equity, and a 90 combined and that's a
good return. How do you think about or identify that's a good niche?

A - Richard Whitt III

{BIO 1836438 <GO>}

We, first and foremost, as we always do focus on what we think we can write it terms of
the combined.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Richard Whitt III

{BIO 1836438 <GO>}

So -- no, we are not going to bring on a program. We think we're going to have a one
tenth combined on it. These are programs (Technical Difficulty).

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

All right.

A - Richard Whitt III

{BIO 1836438 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah, they're the programs, we believe, we can make an underwriting profit on.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then my second unrelated question is, you've reported 2.5 billion at the
holding company at the end of the quarter. Of course, 900 is going out for the
acquisition, insurance acquisition, do you guys have a kind of a minimum you'd like to have
there, like a Berkshire talks about their minimum? and if so, do you need to reload that or
can you just talk about the -- your liquidity and kind of the minimum you like to have?

A - Anne Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Yeah, John. I think we are comfortable. You will note that the balance was flat to year-end
and we've closed out the two acquisitions already year-to-date.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

Yeah. All right.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Anne Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

We're comfortable that we can absorb the State National acquisition and still have
sufficient liquidity. I don't think we feel like we have to replace that. We will, as we have
always done be opportunistic about that. So, if there is some option to do that and it
makes sense for us economically, we'll certainly look at it, but we are not concerned about
the liquidity levels around the organization.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then my final question was -- I understood, that you mentioned the
Ogden rate which I understand is going back up, could you just either confirm that or not,
or would it have any impact going forward. Thank you.

A - Richard Whitt III

{BIO 1836438 <GO>}

There is a -- the government has picked up the issue. The UK government has picked that
issue up. And what they've really said is, they will look at that rate more often. I think it had
been something like 15 or 16 years since they last looked at it and they made this rather
aggressive move.
I think most people believe it will come back up, but that's not their biggest issue right
now. I think they're focused on Brexit. So, when that change occurs, we'll obviously take a
look at it, and see what it means for us. But that could take, we believe that could take a
while. They've got a lot of bigger things to deal with.

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

Okay I won't pencil [ph] anything in. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

But it is. The one thing I will say, John, is it's interesting. The government set the rate at
negative 0.75. The reality is the market has basically ignored that and when deals are
settling, when claims are settling, they're settling at something between zero and positive
one rate. So as often is the case, the market sets the rates the government doesn't.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

Right because everyone knows, you're making a positive return on fixed income and I
mean, you are over reserved at minus 0.75. So, yeah it makes sense.

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

So, it is interesting deal -- the claims that are settling are settling in that zero to plus one
range.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

Yeah. It makes sense. Okay, thank you.

The next question is from Scott Heleniak of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Q - Scott Heleniak

{BIO 15171212 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate the thoughts on pricing and just wondering if you've
seen any early signs of pricing moving since the storms. Anything you can share there.
And is there some sense -- as others I know you guys talked about casualty pricing
moving. I mean, everyone that we've heard has certainly talked about property
reinsurance, but do you get the sense that others are going to -- are going to follow suit
with that just anything anecdotally you can share on that front, would be appreciated.

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Yeah, sure. We're seeing the ability to raise prices on property. We are definitely seeing
that ability. I would say, you know, in terms of the market how much and what you do on
loss free accounts, what you do on non-cat expense accounts, it's a little all over the place
right now and I think, but I think that will, that will develop as we go forward.
The market will kind of find a level, but we are seeing the ability to push for rate on
property accounts, certainly. It may take a little longer to be able to push and get rates in
Page 15 of 18

casualty lines and other specialty lines, but I think that's going to happen. I do believe
that's going to happen, but I do believe that could take a little longer than what we're
seeing right now on the property side.

FINAL

Q - Scott Heleniak

{BIO 15171212 <GO>}

Okay, that's, that's helpful. And I wanted to ask you about the California wildfires.
Appreciate you guys putting the loss estimate there. And it was interesting -- we've heard
a lot of industry loss numbers out there anywhere from a few billion to 10 billion and just
wondering what kind of industry loss estimate you guys might have assumed when you
came up with your number for that, that you might be able to share?

A - Richard Whitt III

{BIO 1836438 <GO>}

As you know, we tried as best as we could and we noted in there, this is an ongoing and
developing situation so that ranges -- it's got a lot of estimation to it. So we tried to build
it bottom up as best we could. I think we see those industry numbers as well. And I think
we're picking it anywhere between a $3 billion to $6 billion or $7 billion event and
unfortunately it's growing every day because there are still fires out there. So, that one is
very tough to pin point right now. I can't caution enough about the volatility that could be
in that number.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Scott Heleniak

{BIO 15171212 <GO>}

Okay. In an expense ratio, you have the benefit from the reinstatement premiums
received and lower contingents paid, I believe you guys said, was the run rate in the
quarter, was that still kind of, in the 38% to 39% range is sort of a normalized rate, if you
were to take those out of there. Any major change in there or.

A - Anne Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

The expense ratio also benefited in the quarter from the increase in gross written, which I
think -- yeah. As that comes into earned we'll continue. So I think the run rate is likely to be
37, 38.

Q - Scott Heleniak

{BIO 15171212 <GO>}

Okay. All right. And just the last question on the $20 million inventory loss charge from
Irma, was that specific to one particular operation or was it multiple operations?

A - Richard Whitt III

{BIO 1836438 <GO>}

One.

Q - Scott Heleniak

{BIO 15171212 <GO>}

One. Okay, thank you.

A - Thomas Gayner

Your next question comes from Bob Farnam of Boenning & Scattergood. Please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - Robert Farnam

{BIO 15005467 <GO>}

Yeah, hi good morning. I think just a follow-up question on Scott. We are talking about the
California wildfires. Do you get a sense whether that's going to be more of, a your
insurance operations, or reinsurance operations where you see most of the losses there?

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

That's hard. It is really hard to say right now. It's going to hit both. And in fact, it's probably
going to hit more widely through our portfolio because I mean it's going to be classic cars,
it's going to be camps, it's going you know, it is just all over the map in terms of where it
might touch our portfolio. I don't think it'll be outsized on insurance or reinsurance. I think it
would be fairly well spread.

Q - Robert Farnam

{BIO 15005467 <GO>}

Okay. All right. That was it for me, that just -- just want to see if I can clarify that. Thanks.
