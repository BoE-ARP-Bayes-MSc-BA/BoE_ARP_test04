MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call of Everest Re
Group. Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference
over to Miss Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Elizabeth B. Farrell

{BIO 1986541 <GO>}

Thank you, Destiny. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's second quarter
2015 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the
company's President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting
Officer; and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer.
Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include
extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note
that statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature, such as
statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various
risks.
As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations.
Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection

with such statements.
Now, let me turn the call over to Dom.

FINAL

Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Thanks, Beth. Good morning. We are pleased to report that operating earnings for the
quarter were $225 million, which was primarily driven by pre-tax underwriting income of
$183 million and net investment income of $125 million.
The tax rate in the quarter jumped to 16.6%, causing some distortion relative to our first
quarter numbers. Other factors affecting the first quarter comparison include a $50 million
difference in foreign currency adjustments, $30 million of catastrophes, other weather
related losses not recorded as cats per se, and finally, a marine loss from the Pemex oil
platform.
Adjusting for these items clearly puts our results in line with last year on a quarter and
year-to-date basis. And while the returns are still quite favorable, improvement year over
year is affected by market conditions.

Bloomberg Transcript

We believe that, in an absolute sense, we are well above our cost of capital and are near
the top of industry performers. I expect that industry results will bear that out. We
achieved above market returns with strong expense controls, innovative and dynamic
portfolio management, and new products.
In these last six months, we have continued our expansion of capital market tools to
leverage our capital and achieve a net return in excess of the gross. Mt. Logan has grown
to $830 million of assets under management, and our purchase of IOWs has increased
this year versus last year at this time.
These tactics allow us to increase market capacity on attractive business without
increasing net exposure, while maintaining an above average return. Premiums were
down for the quarter and flat for the year with strong growth in the insurance segment,
offset by a reduction in our reinsurance premiums.
The factors affecting reinsurance were less quota share premium, the impact of foreign
currency translation, shift of excess capacity to higher layers, increased corporate
sessions to hedge accumulations, market pricing, and non-renew deals due to terms and
conditions.
Offsetting these trends have been initiatives on the new product side. We continue to
modestly grow our credit and financial assurance business and agricultural lines in the
reinsurance segments.
In the insurance segment, the growth has been strong at 20%-plus as we continue to see
momentum in professional lines, excess casualty, contingency, crop and property E&S.

The insurance operation is on an excellent trajectory with a attritional combined ratio of
93%, excluding crop.

FINAL

We continue to aggressively build out our insurance platform with the addition of
underwriting talent. Market dislocation has made this a bit easier these days and a
determined build is our preferred course of action here.
Despite what we all see swirling around today in the M&A space, we're generally not
inclined to take on significant dilution and then still face the generally enormous
integration, cultural and legacy challenges, unless, of course, it is ROE accretive in some
reasonable timeframe.
We have the capital, patience and discipline to build a top-tier insurance operation
consistent with our pricing and risk appetite. None of this, whether it's reinsurance or
insurance, will be easy. The market conditions in the reinsurance sector are challenging,
but we appear to be closer to a turning point.

Bloomberg Transcript

Capital markets seem to be hitting the floor, but the traditional markets' results will be a
more important factor. The reality is that there is not much margin for even the small
events, let alone larger, inevitable catastrophes.
Based on expected second quarter industry results for reinsurers, we are likely to see that
a few small cats and a large risk loss will produce returns on capital below 9%. Along with
declining bond values, this begins to feel as if a market turn must happen. Of course,
markets are not always rational and a quick snapback would be atypical.
We are not waiting, however, as we continue to leverage our strengths to manage our
portfolio smartly and outperform. An element of managing our portfolio will be an
emphasis on insurance growth.
Furthermore, we will manage capital accordingly. In this quarter, our share repurchases
were $50 million. This was below our typical pace for a number of factors. Among them
were longer-term capital needs driven by our insurance growth objectives. However, we
have demonstrated over the long-term we're committed to returning excess capital when
market conditions warrant.
As I sum up the first half of the year, despite some previously mentioned cautions, I'm
quite optimistic. We finished the first six months at $554 million of operating income, up
from $532 million in the prior year and with a 15% ROE.
Excellent results in such tough times, especially when compared to the industry. We
continue to be able to navigate through a difficult reinsurance market by managing risk,
staying opportunistic with new products, and maintaining our pricing and expense
discipline.

I am most optimistic about the trajectory of our insurance operations. Excluding crop, our
year-to-date growth was 26%, or $130 million, and continues to produce profitable
accident year underwriting results. And my expectation is that this will improve over time.

FINAL

Thank you. And now, I will turn it over to Craig for the financial report.

Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. Everest had another solid quarter of
earnings with net income of $209 million, or $4.68 per diluted common share. This
compares to net income of $290 million, or $6.26 per share, for the second quarter of
2014.
Net income includes realized capital gains and losses. On a year-to-date basis, net
income was $532 million, or $11.88 per share, compared to $584 million, or $12.46 per
share, in 2014. The 2015 result represents an annualized return on equity of over 14%.
Operating income year to date was $554 million, or $12.38 per share. This represents a
9% increase over operating income of $11.35 per share last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

These overall results were driven by a solid underwriting result and sizable foreign
exchange gains compared to the first half of 2014. The results reflect an overall current
year attritional combined ratio of 83.0% on a year-to-date basis, up from 82.0% at yearend 2014. The attritional measure includes higher than expected current year losses in the
US reinsurance market, including estimated losses for the marine energy market and
numerous weather-related losses that did not meet our $10 million catastrophe threshold.
All reinsurance segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter and for the first half
of 2015. Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $177 million for the quarter
compared to a $181 million underwriting gain last year. For the first half of 2015, total
reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $382 million compared to a $396 million gain
last year. The Mt. Logan Re segment reported a $28 million underwriting gain for the
quarter compared to a $9 million underwriting gain for the second quarter of 2014.
On a year-to-date basis, Mt. Logan reported an underwriting gain of $50 million
compared to a $19 million gain for the first half of 2014. Everest retained $7 million of this
income and $43 million was attributable to the non-controlling interest of this entity. The
insurance segment reported an underwriting loss of $23 million for the quarter compared
to a gain of $4 million last year.
On a year-to-date basis, the insurance segment reported an underwriting loss of $12
million compared to a gain of $8 million in 2014. The insurance segment loss primarily
related to a claim review of umbrella claims on a run-off program that was discontinued by
the company several years ago. As a result of the review, we booked an additional $31
million of prior-year losses rather than waiting for the reserve study that will be completed
in the fourth quarter.

FINAL

The Insurance segment current year attritional combined ratio was 93.4% on a year-todate basis, excluding crop. This ratio has improved compared to 93.9% one year ago. The
overall underwriting gain for the Group was $183 million for the quarter compared to an
underwriting gain of $195 million for the same period last year. On a year-to-date basis,
the underwriting gain was $420 million compared to a gain of $423 million in 2014.
These overall results reflect $40 million of current year catastrophe losses in the first half
of 2015, all recorded in the second quarter. Of the total, $20 million related to losses from
storms in Australia and $20 million came from flooding in Chile.
The 2015 cat losses were partially offset by $10 million of favorable development on prioryear cat losses, primarily from the 2013 U.S. storms. This compares with $45 million of
catastrophes during the first half of 2014.
Our reported combined ratio was 84.1% for the first half of 2015, compared to 82.5% in
2014. The year-to-date commission ratio of 22.1% was slightly up from 21.9% in 2014,
primarily due to higher contingent commissions. Our overall expense ratio remains low at
4.7%. This includes our industry-leading expense ratio of 2.8% for our total reinsurance
segment.

Bloomberg Transcript

As for loss reserves, in June, we released our fifth annual global loss development
triangles for 2014. There were no major changes since the 2013 release. Our overall
quarterly internal reserving metrics continue to be favorable.
For investments, pre-tax investment income was $125 million for the quarter and $248
million year to date on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Investment income for the first
six months declined only $7 million from one year ago. The pre-tax yield on the overall
portfolio was 2.9% with a duration of three years.
The first six months reflected $22 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared
to $52 million of realized capital gains last year. These losses were mainly attributable to
impairments on the fixed income portfolio in 2015.
Other income and expense included $44 million of foreign exchange gains in the first six
months of 2015 compared to $15 million of foreign exchange losses in the first half of
2014.
On income taxes, the annualized effective tax rate is primarily driven by lower than
planned catastrophe losses, resulting in higher than expected taxable income for the year.
The 13.9% effective tax rate on operating income is in line with our expected rate for the
year, given our planned cat losses for the remainder of the year. This rate is consistent
with the 14.4% tax rate at the same time last year.
Strong cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $683 million for the first half of
2015 compared to $590 million in 2014. Shareholders' equity at the end of the quarter
was $7.7 billion, up $276 million or 4% over year-end 2014. This is after taking into account

over $200 million of capital returned for $125 million of share buybacks and $84 million of
dividends paid in the first half of 2015.

FINAL

Book value per share increased 5% to $174.84 from $166.75 at year-end 2014. Our strong
capital balance positions us well for potential business opportunities as well as continuing
stock repurchases.
Thank you. And now, John Doucette will provide our operations review.

John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Thank you, Craig. Good morning. As Dom highlighted, we continued our solid underwriting
results into the second quarter of 2015. Our group gross written premium for Q2 was $1.3
billion, down $157 million from Q2 last year with decreases coming from each of our
reinsurance segments, which I will get into shortly. Our U.S. insurance operation gross
written premium is up meaningfully in Q2 compared to Q2 last year with growth coming
from almost every insurance profit center.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our group net written premium for Q2 was $1.2 billion, which was down 4% compared to
Q2 last year. Year to date, our group gross and net written premium are both essentially
flat year over year. Year to date 2015, underwriting profits for the group are $420 million,
virtually in line with 2014.
For our reinsurance segments, total reinsurance gross written premium, including Logan,
was $900 million for the quarter, down 17% from Q2 last year. This decrease in gross
premium for the quarter was driven by several items.
First, exchange rate. The stronger U.S. dollar had a meaningful impact on our international
operations and our Bermuda operations. On a like-for-like exchange rate, our overall
reinsurance segments would have been closer to 13% down compared to second quarter
last year.
Second, declining, reducing or non-renewing business that had pricing we could not
support. These occurred across all reinsurance segments of the group.
Third, in the international segment, a major deal for a strategic relationship was
restructured with essentially the same economics and net premiums, but the top line is
down significantly on a gross basis. Reinsurance net written premium, including Logan,
was $870 million, down 7% compared to Q2 last year. On a constant exchange ratio basis,
our net written premium would be down roughly 4% due to increased retrocessional
protections, including ILW purchases and other hedges to help us manage our peak zone
PMLs.
Our reinsurance book, including Mt. Logan, generated $206 million of underwriting profit
in Q2, an 8% increase over last Q2. These strong underwriting results, despite both an
increasingly tougher market and the loss events mentioned by Craig, confirm our

FINAL

reinsurance strategy, leveraging our core strengths, expanding our product offering, and
increasing our opportunity set to achieve profitable growth.
In addition, our utilization of alternative capital structures allows us to conservatively
manage our net risk position while generating fee income and lowering our cost of capital.
Under this strategy, we have and will continue to effectively deploy our capital towards
achieving some of the best risk-adjusted returns in the industry. At July 1, Mt. Logan
celebrated its two-year anniversary.
We continue to see strong investor interest with inflows of approximately $80 million of
new third-party investments this quarter, raising total funds in Logan to about $830 million.
Logan remains core to our overall capital markets conversion strategy to hedge and
manage risk across our overall portfolio and earned fees. To complement this, we also
secured more ILW protection heading into this hurricane season, mostly for Southeast
USA and Florida wind.

Bloomberg Transcript

With Mt. Logan, our cat bond and ILWs, we maintained our conservative risk position with
peak zone PMLs at 7.1%, close to flat compared to our 1.1% PMLs as a percentage of GAAP
equity on a net after-tax basis. Here is some color on June 1 and July 1 reinsurance
renewals. Group-wide, our in force property pro rata GWP is slightly down as we nonrenewed some treaties and some clients bought less pro rata or converted their treaties
to excessive loss.
Our worldwide property cat excessive loss gross written premium went up compared to
prior periods, but there was more churn compared to other renewals. We cut capacity on
non-renewed underpriced business, but we also added meaningful capacity on deals we
like, particularly for long-standing key clients. Our average dollar attachment on property
treaties went up as we deployed less capacity lower down and more capacity in higher
layers, both in Florida and internationally.
This typically consumes more capital, but has better margins. The end result of the midyear renewals with our expected combined ratio is essentially flat compared to our
expiring portfolios' combined ratio. On a risk-adjusted basis, property pricing moderated
and was off mid single digits, although there were several regions around the globe that
remained extremely competitive, including China, Australia, some parts of Latin America
and U.S.-backed business.
Other regions, however, provided opportunity due to a meaningful increase in demand.
We therefore continue to build an attractive portfolio overall. On a dollar basis, the
expected dollar margin in the overall property book increased slightly compared to the
expiring portfolio.
Turning to our global casualty and longer-tail reinsurance books, reinsurance terms
continue to be under pressure for commodity type treaties and ceding commissions on
casualty pro rata treaties remains high. Therefore, we deploy capacity to new products
and new opportunities through current and new distribution sources.

FINAL

We continue to receive preferential signings on attractive deals across both long-tail and
short-tail business, and across geographies, including the U.S., Latin America, Canada,
London, Europe, Singapore and Bermuda markets, due to our lead market position,
financial strength, ratings and long-standing trading relationships with clients and brokers.
Moving to our insurance operations, our premium was $344 million in Q2, up 9% from Q2
last year. However, excluding Heartland, which was impacted by changes that delayed
timing on premium recognition for 2015, insurance gross written premium is up
approximately 20% for the second quarter and up 26% on a year-to-date basis. This
growth is very diversified, originating from over 10 separate insurance profit centers,
including newly launched product lines resulting in a very balanced portfolio of both short
and long-tail lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

Year to date, we are up 41% on what we describe as direct brokerage business, which is
underwritten internally by Everest underwriters. Program business is up 9% year to date.
We expect these trends to continue as we focus on building out our retail books. Also
noteworthy, the direct brokerage business has run to about eight or nine combined ratio
points better than the program business over the last three years.
As Dom indicated and you've seen from our recent press releases, we have been hiring
key leaders in our insurance operations to build out this platform. We are also in the
process of establishing a Lloyd's syndicate. If approved by the Lloyd's franchise board, we
will target an early 2016 launch. Lloyd's will provide access to international business and
new products, diversifying our insurance portfolio. We expect that growth in our domestic
and international insurance operations will accelerate over the next several quarters as
our new initiatives gain traction.
Insurance rates are mixed with most long-tail lines of business up, except financial
institutions and management liability, due to increased capacity and competition. And
similar to reinsurance, property rates are down in several segments. Bottom line, our
overall calendar quarter insurance results were disappointing in Q2 with a loss of $23
million driven by prior-year development on the terminated umbrella program mentioned
by Craig.
However, the underlying accident year results of our insurance book are profitable and
improving, both for the quarter and year to date, compared to the same periods last year.
Now with some detail on what we're seeing in each insurance market. For California
workers' comp, the gross written premium was about $80 million in Q2, relatively flat to
last year with a mid-90s combined ratio and still getting positive rate, but that has slowed
down with increased competition from a few players.
Professional liability premium, with financial institutions the largest contributor, was $55
million for Q2, up 23% compared to last Q2 with some attractive new opportunities.
However, we see excess capacity and rate pressure here. Other casualty business is up
approximately 22% driven by new initiatives.

FINAL

In the short-tail business, including property, DIC, non-standard auto and contingency
business, written premium was $84 million for the quarter, an increase of over 26% from
last Q2 as we have deployed more property insurance capacity. We remain bullish on the
property facility and contingency businesses, but we see increased competition in the DIC
book with lower rates and looser terms.
Accident and health premium was up over 35% in Q2 compared to last Q2 to
approximately $30 million, benefiting from several new initiatives. Regarding Heartland,
crop conditions are favorable and commodity prices are stable. To date, it is running at a
slight underwriting loss, partly due to the delayed recognition of earned premium.
However, we anticipate positive results for the year if prices and weather hold.
In summary, we believe that our market position, core strengths and sustainable
competitive advantages, coupled with the new growth initiatives for the insurance book,
will propel bottom line returns that are superior to most in our industry. We continue to
execute successfully in this environment for both reinsurance and insurance.
Thank you and now back to Beth for Q&A.

Certainly. Looks like, we will take our first question from Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan.
Please go ahead.

Hi, good morning.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

On the M&A that we've seen in the industry, could you just talk about what the
implications are for Everest Re from a competitive standpoint, as well as on the primary
side? Does that mean that insurers could perhaps purchase less reinsurance and what
that would mean?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Page 9 of 22



FINAL

Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2015-07-28

Well, Sarah, this is Dom. Look, the answer to that question basically in two sectors. First of
all, on the reinsurance side, we don't necessarily see any major impacts from the M&A
activity that are occurring today in that space to us. As I have mentioned in previous calls,
we certainly feel we are of sufficient scale and size to maintain our relevance in the
market. And we – with approximately $8 billion of capital, we feel we are operating in this
market with $10 billion of capital, and we managed to get the signings and operate with
our clients in the areas that we would prefer to do so. So, no meaningful impact that we
can see from that.
On the primary side, the trend of acquisitions there and what that means to the
reinsurance purchase, I think that's just a continuing trend of, as capital grows, the larger
players in the marketplace have purchased less reinsurance over time. But frankly, there
are many other participants in the market that certainly need reinsurance.
And in addition to that, as these entities get larger, they generally look to larger partners,
and by partners I mean reinsurance partners. They will still continue to buy reinsurance,
but they are more likely to look to partner up with larger and stable and meaningful
companies. So that's kind of how we view the impact of all that. If that answers your
question.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Great. Thanks. And then if you were to look at acquisitions, what lines of businesses
or geographies would you be interested in? Would it be more on the insurance side or in
Lloyd's to accelerate your growth strategy there?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

The only thing that we tend to pay more attention to in the M&A space when presented
with a variety of opportunities tends to be on the insurance side. But again, as I've
mentioned in my comments, our natural preference is to build our own organization that
matches our risk appetite, avoiding the cultural and any legacy issues that could arise from
an acquisition.
We don't ignore them, but frankly, given some of the premiums that are involved in some
of these transactions relative to building our own platform, we don't see the value in
acquisition at this point. It doesn't mean it won't exist in the future, but currently that's not
our focus. And we can't rely on that strategy. We can't rely on an acquisition strategy to
further our insurance objective, our strategic objective in that space I should say.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thanks for the answers.

And we'll take our next question from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Thank you. Just first one follow-up to Sarah's question on the industry
consolidation. You started up like a greenfield in Lloyd's and there's some news that a
large syndicate is waiting to open to merger partners. Just can you talk maybe more
about build versus acquire? And if you build out, would we expect at least initially higher
expense as the teams ran up?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, certainly there would be higher expense, but even in an acquisition with any
amortizations of intangibles that you'd have to bear, we tend to feel that the expenses,
frankly, would be – it would be more economical to build. And as we build and as we've
been adding resources, we have been growing the top-line as well. So I don't think you
will see any meaningful degradation in our expense ratio if that's really where you were
going.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Would you – just a follow-up, would you be interested in the sort of large-scale
acquisition in the Lloyd's syndicates, or you prefer to go through like a...?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Not at some of the prices that certainly have been bantered around in the press, no.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. That's great. Then on the sort of large non-cat losses, could you quantify what's the
impact for this quarter?

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Overall, Kai – this is Craig Howie. The overall losses are coming through our attritional loss
deck and what we've had were losses that took place in April, May and June through
Texas and the Midwest. Also that's what's coming through for the first half of the year are
winter storms that took place in the Northeast. None of those storms rose to our $10
million cat threshold, but we have totaled those numbers to be almost $90 million to $100
million of losses.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Is that including the Pemex or the offshore energy losses as well?

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

That's correct.

FINAL

Okay. That's great. And lastly, if I may ask on the capital management, it looks like the
pace of buybacks have been relatively slow compared with the – your earnings stream as
your total payout ratio is less than 50%. Given that the reinsurance space is slowing down
in terms of capital needs, I just wonder are you saving like capital for potential acquisitions
or is it over the long run? Were you expecting like a 50% payout ratio?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, Kai, as you know, we don't give guidance on our share repurchase program. I think
what we tend to do is look at this over the very long term. And we have returned a
substantive amount of capital over the last 10 years to shareholders through dividends
and share repurchases. We look at certainly our long-term objectives in terms of growth.
And over the long-term, we think clearly insurance and frankly for that matter, reinsurance.
Again, over the very long-term, we feel that we can succeed in this space.
So we have to balance that up against our objectives in terms of what we would like to
bring stock in at. And it's a long-term gain. So this past quarter, based on what we saw as
our future growth objectives balanced up against what the opportunities were to bring
additional shares in, we opted to do $50 million this quarter. And clearly, over the longterm, we remain committed to buying shares consistent with whatever growth objectives
that we might have.

Q - Kai Pan

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Great, thank you. And then I guess, I mean, just off of first quarter, I think we were sort of
looking for a little bit more growth. Should we be thinking about this sort of as the level,
and just given the sort of challenges that you outlined in reinsurance? I mean, is there still
an opportunity to grow your sort of piece of the pie here, or would you expect to
continue to see areas where you'll cut as a result of not meeting your profitability
standards or the like? Just trying to get an idea of how we should be thinking about
premium production on the reinsurance side here.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Yes to all of that. And it's interesting because some are looking for growth; others are not
looking for growth; some are critical of growth; some are critical of lack of growth. So it's
an interesting dynamic. And as kind of each of us kind of mentioned in our prepared
comments, there's a number of things going on. So, you've got FX. You've got less
proportional business that met our pricing guidelines. You've got us moving up an
attachment point which lowers rate on-line. You've got more retrocessional protections
that we purchased which is up significantly year over year, all of that kind of leading to a
lower net written premium growth.
Interestingly, on an XOL basis, we actually did have some growth in our portfolio from
gross XOL premium but, again, that was offset by some of the retrocessional protections
we purchased. All with an eye towards improving our net returns on capital as compared
with our gross returns on capital. So we will -- we believe that we continue to make
headway in being a larger presence in the marketplace and winning and gaining share
from other market participants. But that doesn't mean that we are also not paying
attention to things that don't meet our return hurdles.
I think I mentioned in last quarter's call that there some things in Florida that where we
backed away from some writings where others had put down large lines. It doesn't mean
Page 13 of 22

FINAL

that they're right and -- they're wrong and we are right. It just means that it didn't quite
meet our pricing objectives. So again, we still continue to make headway in terms of
growing our book, our margin, our net margin, is up year over year. It doesn't mean there
aren't some headwinds in the marketplace, but we think we are doing quite well. And we
will continue to manage that way going forward, and at some point, we certainly believe
that there will be a turn in this market and we will be well positioned to even take greater
advantage of that than we are right now.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

I mean, I guess, Craig, you mentioned about nine -- it sounded like about nine points of
underlying losses. So if I take that into consideration, should I mean that the sort of true
underlying actually improved year over year, so profitability is improving in reinsurance?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

You meant we said, Michael....

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

The $90 million I guess, the $90 million of non-cat large losses?

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On an overall basis I would say. On a net basis we think that it's improving. And that is the
reason if you back out those $90 million to $100 million of losses, yes.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

I mean essentially our operating income on a year-to-date basis year over year is up, right.
Yes, this quarter, we had a number of things happen. Some of which, frankly, were losses
that we were unaware of that were winter losses for example that came from the first
quarter that got reported to us in the second quarter. So to look at reinsurers' results just
on quarter by quarter, sometimes can be a little bit misleading. And so on a year-to-date
basis, we are up year over year. We think it's a very – it's quite a solid year to date so far.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

All right. I guess one question would be is, I mean, they're great results, is there a need
then for the market to change at all? I mean, because it seems like at these profitability
levels that -- I mean, I don't know how the conversations happen between insurers and reinsurers. But it seems like these levels of profitability are pretty attractive.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, remember that it depends on scale, it depends on your expense ratio. And we've
argued for a long, long time that we have a distinct advantage in the marketplace, given
not only our size and the signings that we can obtain, but also our expense ratio
advantage and our global diversified platform.

FINAL

Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2015-07-28

So compared to many other market participants that don't enjoy some of those
advantages, you see, you've seen already I believe and will probably continue to see
some returns dipping below, as I mentioned again in my comments, below 9%. That
doesn't sound like a completely terribly robust market. And at the same time, you see a
few losses that come through and hit the industry here in this quarter have -- take a pretty
good bite out of the apple. So it suggests that there isn't much margin to handle the
larger catastrophe. But notwithstanding all of that, we think we clearly have unique
advantages which enable us to continue to expand our offerings.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. And then just one numbers question if I could, maybe Craig. The negative ceded
premium in the international segment, I'm just trying to think about should we be looking
at like the net written line as sort of a good base or starting point? Should we be looking
at the gross written line and then assume like normal sessions occur from here? Just
trying to sort of square that. And maybe you could give us some context in terms of what
drove that negative number. And thank you all for all your answers.

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Michael, that was really driven by one large strategic deal that we had done. It's better to
look at the net written premium on the international book for that reason. That deal was
restructured, so going forward, it's at the same margin, but the premium will be booked
differently going forward. So, more appropriate to look at the net written premium.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Great. Thank you again.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

The gross though was still important in the sense of how we are utilizing the capital
market -- we have -- Cat bonds, not Logan, ILWs. So again, gross is -- you can't ignore it,
because that's also indicating what our reach is into the marketplace. It's just that this
particular quarter, given the adjustments we made on some of those transactions that we
talked about earlier, that distorted that historical relationship for just this quarter.

And we'll take our next question from Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Please go ahead.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning. Two quick follow-up questions on the discussion on capital.
Number one, one question we were getting last night as it pertains to Everest Re is how
does I guess the forthcoming changes or the upcoming changes to the AIR model, how
does that impact your view on capital PMLs, and how much of that is actually connected to
the capital management pullback?

A - Dominic James Addesso

Page 15 of 22

FINAL

None of that, actually. We don't expect any major change to the PMLs. No question there
will be some change. There is ups and downs depending on the territories that you write
in. And I'll ask John if he has any additional thoughts, but remember that our view of the
risk positions that we talk about is essentially our view of risk. It is looking at all the models,
whether it's AIR, RMS, and, frankly, our own internal models. So to the extent that AIR is
changing some of their calculations, it will have some impact, but we do not expect it to
be a meaningful impact. John, is there anything to add to that.

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Yes. Just follow on that, so net-net, we view this as a positive as this will be potentially an
increase in demand, a push on demand for some of our clients. And that will be – just
following on what Dom said, first, we create our own view of risk. We've been spending a
substantial amount of time and resources over the last six or seven years building out
Everest's view of risk for all zones around the world, all perils, all return periods. And we
use many, many things to input this and we are continually enhancing our views of this and
have a very smart, capable team of people that are analyzing this around the Group.
And we think this is one of our core competitive advantages. And it allows us to take all
the different inputs, not just AIR, but the other vendors, as well as we've been trading for
over 44 years in a lot of countries around the globe, and so we look at our own results
and look at the damageability against losses, we look at external, we look at academic
studies that are done around the globe and all that rolls up to our view of risk. So, our
view of risk is we're trying to enhance it all the time, whether it's tied to AIR changing its
results or somebody else, or internal studies that we do. And we're always looking to
enhance that. But net-net, we think this is a positive for us and a positive upward on
leading (48:25) going forward.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Thanks. Thanks for that color. The other question for Dom, and this is sort of a follow-up
to Sarah's and Kai's question. It seems that the market is more forgiving in terms of doing
dilutive tangible book value deals. And I'm curious, looking at that, has that changed your
view in terms of how you might look at things going forward or not?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Not a bit. The market is more forgiving today. We'll see what that turns out to be two
years from now.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it. And then final question -

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

I mean, look at – I – what we have to pay attention to here is how we feel we can best and
economically and also given what our strategies are, how we can best build out our
insurance platform, but it doesn't mean that we turn a blind eye to any kind of a

Page 16 of 22



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2015-07-28

transaction that might be presented to us. It's just that, to date, as we look at the
alternatives, our alternative looks a little better.

FINAL

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it. That's actually quite helpful. The final question is on the reserve adjustment. I think
it was $31 million in the run-off book. Can you sort of maybe give a bit more color, is that –
how should we view that $31 million versus, I guess, the size of that book? Can you put
some ranges around it which sort of give us comfort that there is not going to be possibly
more noise, or maybe just talk a bit more about this.

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Amit, this is Craig. This was a claim review that was done on a run-off program book-ofbusiness for umbrella. The company discontinued this book several years ago, but the
program has been running hot, if you will.

Bloomberg Transcript

We've had reserve adjustments over the last two reserve study cycles. There were over
300 open claims reviewed. About 195 claims had adjustments. Some of them were down.
Most of them were up, obviously, with respect to adding additional $31 million of prioryear losses.
We took into account some things like other cases and local and state labor laws when we
were going through these claims, but relatively speaking, this is $31 million. What we
wanted to do was take this charge. The company reacts very quickly to unfavorable type
development like this. But keep in mind, this is $31 million on a $10 billion book of reserves,
so it's a very small number. The rest of our reserves I am very comfortable with the overall
book and it continues to run very favorably against our internal reserving monitoring
metrics.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

And then I think I would ask that everyone consider, as Craig emphasized, that it's part of
$10 billion of reserves and look at our track record of calendar year results for reserve
development. It's quite strong. And again, as I've said many times before, we have some
200 different reserve groups that we analyze. This happens to be one subset of one of
those. And we're going to get blips in any one of those different reserve groups from
time to time.
What's most important is the integrity of the balance sheet, and I think we've
demonstrated that our reserve position is quite strong. Our reserve triangles have been
out. We've obviously released those in the last couple of years. All the analysis on that
indicates that it's very positive, and clearly our own internal metrics suggest that as well.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

should think about ceding commissions going forward, or I should say commission ratios?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Sure. Let's – we can talk about it. What's your specific – maybe a more specific question...

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

I see the big drop-off in international premium and the uptick in the acquisition expense
ratio. I'm wondering if that's one-time in nature, how I should think about that going
forward?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

I'll let Craig take that one.

Page 18 of 22

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

FINAL

Well, in the international book, as we've mentioned a couple of times, what's driving that
this quarter Josh, is one strategic deal that we had done that changed this quarter for the
year and going forward. So, while the margin is the same, the premium is being booked
differently on a gross basis. So, therefore, it's probably more appropriate to look at it on a
net basis for this quarter anyway. That will give you a better indication of how that is
driving the current result.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And so, if I think about going forward for the remainder of the year, year over year, is the
expense ratio higher than it was a year ago?

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

I don't think the expense ratio will be significantly higher for acquisition costs even on an
international book.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay. And so, in thinking about 2Q 2016, not that I'm asking for guidance or anything, but
more interested in this deal. Is this one-time in nature how it was booked this year, and
when we think about next year, you will be doing that again, or have you discontinued the
relationship or how does that all play in?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

We have not discontinued the relationship. There have been some law changes in Latin
America with respect to how to treat these transactions going forward. So over the next
five years, we would expect these transactions to decline going forward, but that will be
over a longer period of time, over five years.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And this next question is very subjective. You can answer it any way you want, whether it's
about Everest, whether it's about the industry. If you were prohibited from writing cat
business for some reason, just hypothetically, what do you think the combined ratio is in
the reinsurance market for non-cat business today?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Was an option there not to answer your question?

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Whatever you want. I'm trying to tease out – it's still – look, you had a higher loss ratio, still
very attractive, in a non-cat quarter always hard to deduce what the real numbers are.

A - Dominic James Addesso

Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2015-07-28

Look, I'm going to take a guess at it more than anything, but at this point – because part
of the answer to that question, if that were the case, the whole marketplace would be
within a different dynamic, right. So a transaction that you might do with clients might be
done on a different basis. But I think the answer to that question would be somewhere in
the low 90s would be kind of a guess. Obviously, you've got casualty business, you've got
all of our facultative writings, you've got property per risk, you've got professional alliance
treaties. I mean, it's a multitude of things. But the whole mix of the business would
change. But I think what you are really asking is what's the rest of the portfolio kind of
running at.

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right, Josh. This is John, and just to add some more color to Dom's answer. So it very
much would depend on the book of business that we have. And, I mean, one of the things
that Everest has built very intentionally over the last 40-plus years is a very, very
diversified book of business and we are not a one-trick pony tied to property cat. And we
keep talking about these 200-plus IBNR groups. That means we have 200 different
segments of business around the Group, different lines of business and different
geographies. So, we're always looking for profitable business and based on a combined
ratio, ROE, and other metrics that we look at.
So, I think it very much depends on what the opportunity set is. We feel very good about
our opportunity set, and we have for many, many years been a lead re-insurer in the
casualty market. And we are capable to deploy as much capacity there as market
conditions dictate and we desire to given the market condition. We can flip from
reinsurance to insurance. So, we have a lot of dials, as we talk about on each of the
earnings calls. But we trade in many, many different classes of business that there is
margin in, not just in the property cat space.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

new money yields are right now versus your current portfolio and your fixed income? Are
we getting close to a bottom with respect to your book yields?

FINAL

A - Craig W. Howie

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

We don't see a bottoming out until probably mid-2016, Brian.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Then the last question, on the Lloyd's start-up here, a couple of Lloyd's guys in
Lloyd's have kind of commented that the price competition in Lloyd's right now is
equivalent to kind of where we were back in 1999, so pretty darn competitive. I'm curious
why from a timing perspective now going into Lloyd's, given the competition?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, first of all, I think some of those comments were related to some very, very specific
classes. And so that's number one. And those are not classes that we necessarily have on
our radar screen, at least, not in the near-term.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

And frankly, just like in our reinsurance lines, if the market is not giving us the return that
meets our pricing metrics, then we won't write the business. We don't necessarily though
have the choice as to when we start these projects literally months and at least a year in
advance, you have to kind of start thinking about how to get these things running.
So you don't have a choice in terms of timing sometimes, but you do have a choice in
terms of what kind of business you put on the books. And we will continue to maintain our
underwriting discipline and our underwriting culture, which will dictate the kind of business
we write. And frankly, the business plan that we've put forth we believe can generate a
very nice underwriting margin for us.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks for your answers, Dom.

results, positive operating results for the first half of the year. And it's really a long-term
business and we think we have to look at it on a six-month basis. And we think we've
