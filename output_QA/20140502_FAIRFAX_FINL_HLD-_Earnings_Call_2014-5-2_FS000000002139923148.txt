{BIO 1552007 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's 2014 first quarter
results. This call may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ,
perhaps materially, from those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result
of a variety of uncertainties and risk factors, the most foreseeable of which are set out
under Risk Factors in our Base Shelf Prospectus, which has been filed with Canadian
securities regulators and is available on SEDAR.
I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa.

FINAL

Thank you, Rick. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Fairfax's first quarter
conference call. I plan to give you some of the highlights and then pass it on to Dave
Bonham, our CFO, for additional financial details.
In the first quarter of 2014, book value per share increased 11.7%, adjusted for the $10 per
share common dividend paid in the first quarter of 2014. Our insurance companies had an
excellent first quarter with a combined ratio of 93% with excellent reserving and
significant underwriting profits of $99 million. OdysseyRe, again, had an excellent
combined ratio of 85.6%, while Zenith had a combined ratio of 90.6%.
As shown on page 28 of our quarterly report, we realized gains on our investment
portfolio of $380 million. Excluding all hedging losses and before mark-to-market
fluctuations in our investment portfolio, we earned $493 million in pre-tax income.
Including all hedging losses and mark-to-market fluctuations in our investment portfolio,
we reported after-tax income of $0.8 billion in the first quarter of 2014 in excess of $0.6
billion loss for the full-year 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

As I mentioned to you in the past, prior to last year, we had two years, 1990 and 1999,
that we had a negative total return on our investments. In both cases, we rebounded
significantly in the following year. With our losses in 2013, our first quarter in 2014 has
rebounded significantly again. You will note our investment portfolios went up by $1 billion
in the first quarter of 2014, in spite of being fully hedged 30% in cash and little exposure
to corporate bonds.
How did it happen? U.S. treasury rates dropped by approximately 30 basis points and our
common stocks like the Bank of Ireland did much better than the Russell Index. We have
yet to financially benefit from our hedges and are approximately $100 billion in deflation
swaps and, of course, our cash position gives us great optionality.
At our annual meeting, we made the point that while we were protecting our capital on
the down side, our investment portfolios could also do very well. The first quarter of 2014
was a case in point. Our common stock portfolios continue to be hedged at
approximately 90%. We did not add to our hedges. We continue to be soundly financed
with year-end cash and marketable securities in the holding company of $1.1 billion.
Insurance and reinsurance businesses, premium volume remained flat in the first quarter
of 2014 after a number of years of growth. The combined ratio for our insurance and
reinsurance operations, as I said before, was 93%. At the subsidiary level, the increase in
net premiums written in 2013 and 2014 and combined ratios were as follows: so
OdysseyRe had a 5%, approximately, decline in premium in the first quarter, combined
ratio of 85.6%; Crum & Forster was up 16%, combined ratio of 99.8%; Northbridge in
Canadian dollars was up about 1% with a 99.8% combined ratio; Zenith was up about 1.2%
with a 90.6% combined ratio; and Fairfax Asia was up about 35.6% with a combined ratio
of 93.8%.
As we have said before, very low interest rates and reduced reserve redundancies means
there will be no place to hide for the industry. Combined ratios will have to drop well

FINAL

below 100% for the industry to make a single-digit return on equity with these low interest
rates. Although short-term, it's always tough to predict, fundamentals will eventually play
out.
Net investment gains of $1.006 billion in the first quarter consisted of the following. Please
refer to page 2 of our press release. Net gains on equity and equity-related investments
of $562 million, resulted from net gains of $63.7 million from common stocks and a $71.5
million net loss on our equity hedge, reflecting the outperformance of our common stock
portfolio which is the Russell Index. We realized gains of $393 million in our equity and
equity-related holdings in the first quarter of 2014. Also, we had unrealized gains of $474
million, primarily on our municipal and Treasury bond portfolio because of the impact of
dropping interest rates.
As we've mentioned many times in our annual meetings, annual reports, and quarterly
calls, with IFRS accounting, where stocks and bonds are recorded at market and subject to
mark-to-market gains or losses, quarterly and annual income will fluctuate wildly and
investment results will only make sense over the long term.

Bloomberg Transcript

Core inflation continues to be at or below 1% in the United States and Europe, levels not
seen since the 1950s, in spite of QE1, QE2 and QE3. Our CPI-linked derivatives with a
nominal value of approximately $100 billion are down 72% from our cost and are carried
on our balance sheet at $164 million at the end of the first quarter, even though they have
7.7 years, almost eight years to run. Please remember that it took five years, as we
mentioned in our annual meeting, took five years in Japan before deflation set in for the
next 18 years.
When you review our statements, you will note that when we own more than 20% of a
company, we equity account and when we own more than 50% we consolidate, so that
mark-to-market gains in these companies are not reflected in our results.
As you see on page 11 of our quarterly report, the fair values of our investment in
associates is $2.5 billion, which is the carrying value of $2 billion and unrealized gain of
approximately $0.5 billion that's not on our balance sheet.
We continue to be concerned about the prospects for the financial markets and the
economies of North America and Western Europe, accentuated as we have said many
times before, by the potential weakness in China and emerging markets. As we have said
now for some time, we believe there continues to be a big disconnect between the
financial markets and the underlying economic fundamentals.
As of March 31, 2014, we have $7.7 billion in cash and short-term investments in our
portfolios, which is approximately 30% of our total investment portfolio to take advantage
of opportunities that may come our way. As a result, in the short term, our investment
income will be reduced.
Now, I would like to turn it over to Dave Bonham, our CFO, so he can give you some more
information on the underlying financials. Dave?

FINAL

Thank you, Prem. First, I'll focus on Fairfax's consolidated results for the first quarter of
2014, then I'll move on to the operating company results, and we'll finish with the
consolidated financial position.
For the first quarter of 2014, Fairfax reported net earnings of $785 million, or $35.72 per
share on a fully diluted basis. And that compares to the first quarter of 2013 when we
reported net earnings of $162 million, or $7.12 per share on a fully diluted basis. Fairfax
showed improved underwriting results in 2014, with our insurance and reinsurance
operations reporting an underwriting profit of $99 million and a combined ratio of 93%.
That compares to the first quarter of 2013 when we reported an underwriting profit of
$86 million and a combined ratio of 94%; that's a year-over-year increase of $13 million in
our underwriting profit.
In terms of reserve development, we experienced $56 million of net favorable prior year
reserve development and that benefited the combined ratio by four points in the first
quarter of 2014. In the same quarter last year, we reported $36 million of favorable
reserve development, representing 2.5 combined ratio points.

Bloomberg Transcript

Current period catastrophe losses totaled $31 million, or 2.2 combined ratio points in the
first quarter of 2014, and that was essentially unchanged on a year-over-year basis. As
Prem mentioned already, net premiums written by our insurance and reinsurance
operations increased slightly in the first quarter of 2014 by 0.4%.
Now turning to our operating company results, starting with OdysseyRe; in the first
quarter of 2014, OdysseyRe reported an underwriting profit of $75 million and a
combined ratio of 85.6%. That compared with an underwriting profit of $95 million and a
combined ratio of 83% in the first quarter of 2013.
Catastrophe losses were $22 million and that translated into 4.3 combined ratio points
and those were principally comprised of flooding in parts of the UK and other attrition
losses. That compared with current period catastrophe losses, all primarily which were
attritional of $32 million or 5.8 combined ratio points in the first quarter of 2013.
OdysseyRe's combined ratio benefited from $22 million, or 4.2 combined ratio points of
net favorable prior year reserve development, and that was principally favorable
emergence on prior year's non-catastrophe loss reserves. OdysseyRe wrote $573 million
of net premiums in the first quarter, a decrease of approximately 5% from net premiums
of $604 million in the first quarter of 2013, and that principally reflected lower writings of
property business and most notably a year-over-year decrease in participation on a
Florida property quota share reinsurance contract, and that was partially offset by growth
across most lines of the U.S. insurance division, and the growth there is inclusive of
renewals related to the surety business of American Safety.
Moving on to Crum & Forster, Crum & Forster's underwriting results were relatively
unchanged in the first quarter of 2014 compared to last year with combined ratios of
Page 4 of 13



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2014-05-02

$99.8 million compared to $99.7 million, respectively. Similarly underwriting profit of $0.6
million in the first quarter of 2014 was comparable to the underwriting profit of $0.8 million
in the first quarter of 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

Current period catastrophe losses of $7.5 million had a 2.4 percentage point impact on
Crum & Forster's combined ratio in 2014 and were the result of severe winter weather in
the U.S. Northeast. The first quarter of 2013 was not impacted at all by catastrophe losses.
Net premiums written by Crum & Forster increased by 16.1% in the first quarter of 2014
and that primarily reflected renewals of the American Safety business, the environmental
casualty and the CoverXSpecialty lines of business, the positive impact of the acquisition
of Hartville in pet insurance and the growth in the Fairmont accident and the health
business.
Zenith reported significant improvements in its combined ratio, which decreased from
110% in the first quarter of 2013 to 91% in the first quarter of 2014. That improvement
reflected the following: a year-over-year decrease of 7.2 percentage points in the
accident year loss ratio in the first quarter of 2014, and that was related to earned price
increases, exceeding estimates of loss trends. Secondly, Zenith had increased net
favorable development of prior year's reserves, representing 10.2 percentage points on
the first quarter of 2014 combined ratio, and that development was primarily related to
the 2013 and 2012 accident years. And finally, decreases in the underwriting expense ratio
of 2.2 percentage points, and that was the result of a 10% increase in net premiums
earned on a year-over-year basis. Net premiums written by Zenith of $290 million in the
first quarter of 2014 increased by 1% year-over-year and that reflected premium rate
increases.
Northbridge reported a combined ratio of 99.8% in the first quarter, an improvement
relative to its combined ratio of 100.5% in the first quarter of 2013. Northbridge's
combined ratio included the benefit of net favorable prior year reserve development
across most accident years and lines of business of $15 million or 6.7 combined ratio
points. And that compared to net favorable development of $9 million or 3.5 combined
ratio points in the first quarter of 2013.
There were no catastrophe events in the first quarters of 2014 or 2013, but Northbridge's
accident year combined ratio was adversely affected by severe Canadian winter weather
and the impact it had on Northbridge's transportation logistics and direct personal lines
business.
Adjusting for the one-time impact of the intercompany unearned premium portfolio
transfer between Northbridge and Group Re in 2013 and excluding the unfavorable
impact of translating Northbridge's premiums from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars, net
premiums written by Northbridge increased by 1.1% in the first quarter of 2014 in Canadian
dollar terms. And that reflected modest improvements in rate, retention in new business,
partially offset by the strategic non-renewal of one portfolio of business.

FINAL

Fairfax Asia's combined ratio increased from 91% in the first quarter of 2013 to 94% in the
first quarter of 2014, and that was primarily the result of net adverse prior-period reserve
development of 4.6 points, compared to net favorable prior-period reserve development
of 6.5 points in the prior year.
Unfavorable emergence in 2014 was principally related to health and marine hull loss
reserves at First Capital and the impact of the mandatory participation by Pacific Insurance
in the Malaysian motor vehicle insurance pool.
On a year-over-year basis, net premiums written by Fairfax Asia increased by 36% in the
first quarter of 2014, principally reflecting increased writings in the accident and health,
engineering, commercial auto and property lines of business.

Bloomberg Transcript

The combined ratio of the Insurance and Reinsurance – Other division improved from
98.4% in the first quarter of 2013 to 97.7% in the first quarter of 2014. Net premiums
written decreased by 17.3% in the first quarter after excluding the initial one-time impact
of that unearned premium portfolio transfer to Northbridge that we mentioned, which
suppressed the net premiums written in the Insurance and Reinsurance – Other segment
by $39 million in 2013. So after that adjustment, the decrease of 17.3% principally reflected
the non-renewal of certain classes of business, where terms and conditions were
considered to be inadequate at Polish Re and Advent.
Runoff reported an operating loss of $21 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to
an operating loss of $34 million in the same period in 2013. The year-over-year
improvement in operating profitability primarily reflected lower net adverse development
at (17:53) Insurance.
Our consolidated interest and dividend income decreased from $100 million in the first
quarter of 2013 to $91 million in the first quarter of 2014, the decrease reflected lower
dividends earned on common stocks as a result of the sale of dividend paying equities in
2013. The company recorded an income tax provision of $334 million in the first quarter of
2014 at an effective tax rate of 29.9%. The effective tax rate was higher than our Canadian
statutory income tax rate of 26.5%, reflecting the significant income earned in the U.S.,
which is taxed at the U.S statutory income tax rate of 35%.
Turning to our financial position, our total debt to total capital ratio decreased to 25.1% at
March 31, 2014 from 26.1% at December 31, 2013, and that was primarily as a result of the
increase in our common shareholders' equity reflecting the net earnings in the quarter.
And now, I'll pass it back over to you, Prem.

FINAL

Thank you. The first question is from Paul Holden with CIBC.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Great. Thank you. Wanted to ask you a question about your appetite to underwrite more
business. If I look at your underwriting leverage, it's still a little bit on the low side at about
0.8 times equity, didn't see much premium growth this quarter, but yet your underwriting
margins are quite healthy, so, just kind of square off the healthy margins versus lack of
organic growth?

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, Paul, that's a good question. As you said, we're writing 0.8 times capital. We've got
lots of capital and at the moment, the prices across the industry are coming down some,
more on the cat-related business and less on other businesses. We've got a very well
diversified worldwide business, and you see some of them are expanding. You've seen in
Fairfax Asia for example, we've got significant growth in Crum & Forster because of the
acquisition of Hartville and the environmental business, we've expanded. But broadly
speaking, it's not a hard market by any stretch of the imagination and we've got the
capital, we've got the management, we've got the ability to expand at the right time and
at the moment we're holding steady.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Thank you, Paul. Next question, Wendy.

Operator
The next question is from Tom MacKinnon with BMO Capital.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Prem, when I look at the Holdco cash position, it's
just a little over $1 billion and it's actually a little bit lower than it was in the third quarter of
last year. And then like about 45 days after the third quarter of last year, you raised equity
and the primary purpose of it, you mentioned in the press release was to augment your
cash position at the holding company. So you've got $1 billion at the holding company now
and you had $1 billion at the holding company in the third quarter and you wanted more
then. So can you help us understand why you might have needed the money then and you
don't need it now with the same kind of Holdco cash levels?

FINAL

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes, Tom. That's a good question. And at the end of the third quarter when we looked at
it, results in the third quarter and for the nine months reflected significant unrealized
losses. And we've just said before, we had just focused on having a rock solid balance
sheet under any circumstances. So, our thinking was at that time that if those conditions
continue for some time, then our financial position perhaps will be less strong. We took
the opportunity to raise the equity and just keep it really, really strong. Well, today it's the
opposite, Tom. You saw our first quarter's earnings, you saw the cash position. We
realized, as you know, the Bank of Ireland went up more than three times and we sold
one-third of our position. And we got our capital back. We're big fans of the Bank of
Ireland and Richie Boucher who runs the company. And I said in our annual meeting, that
that's the first company that we have $1 billion approximately depending on the stock
price on a day-to-day basis of unrealized gains. So we are in a very sound financial
position and we have no intention of raising any common equity. We're very, very careful,
but financial position will always – if we have any doubts about financial strength, we'll
raise some equity. And today, we think we're in a very strong position and getting
stronger after the first quarter.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

But do you anticipate some to augment that $1 billion more or move it up higher or what
would be the potential flows out of the subsidiaries as a result of the Bank of Ireland
gains?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yeah. So Tom, like we've said that our dividend capability normalizes between $0.5 billion
to $1 billion from our insurance companies like OdysseyRe and Crum and Zenith. And we
don't need to take those dividends, they are in the companies. As Paul in the previous
question said, we got 0.8 times of operating leverage. So we have excess capital in our
companies. We can take that up at anytime if we need to, in terms of augmenting that $1
billion that we have in the holding company. So we like the fact that our insurance
companies are well capitalized and not significant operating leverage there. We can,
literally as I've said this before, we can double our premium when the opportunity comes.
And of course we can take dividends if we wanted.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

FINAL

Yes. Thank you for taking my question and this question comes from someone who fully
shares your concerns about the economies, developed economies and the markets in
general. But my question to you is, under which circumstances or under which scenario do
you conceive changing substantially your investment stance, one that you have
maintained, if I'm correct since mid-2010? Thank you.

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Repeat that last part again, if you don't mind, Mikel.

Q - Mikel Abasolo

{BIO 3756596 <GO>}

Yes. The questions is, you've had your equity investment portfolio hedged essentially
since 2010 based on your diagnosis of the dreadful economic situation, underlying the
apparently better numbers that economists throw out. And I guess that also, in terms of
your concerns about valuations. Now my question is, what would change your mind about
those equity hedges, what would make you feel more constructed about investing in
equities or about hedging your equity portfolio? What would be the scenario, what would
be those circumstances?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yeah. Now, that's a very good question. And it's one that we of course review all the time.
I answered that at our annual meeting. And we might, as time goes by, just muddle
through so that the United States grows 2% or 1.5%, 2.5% something like that. Europe
muddled through and China also, all the problems in China, we talked about it at our
annual meeting, may well muddle through. So, in that case, we won't have any problems,
any unintended consequences, and our hedge will slowly come off. Right now we haven't
increased our hedge. We haven't reduced it either. Our stock positions went up, our
hedges were the same amount, so it's down to 90% right now. So, that's certainly one
possibility.
On the other side, you saw the first quarter G&P growth in the United States very minimal.
You saw inflation in Europe about 0.5% and in the United States in the 1% area. China,
there's lots of things happening in China, you can monitor them. In terms of the capital
markets, much default (27:59) in the trust area and the wealth management products and
corporate bonds, a lot of changes. And in the midst of all this, as the Fed tapers, meaning
they're no longer buying government bonds, the long Treasuries went down as you know
in the last few days to 3.42%, below 3.5%. So we look at all of this and wonder if we're
going to muddle through and we might well desire, but there is a possibility of course of
unintended consequences. They might originate from China. They might originate in the
United States. We've got a very low economic growth or almost no growth in the first
quarter. Many people say it's because of the winter. Well, if the second quarter comes in a
similar way, I'm not saying it will, I'm just saying it might, and we might all wonder what the
effects of QE1, QE2, and QE3 are.
So we take all of this into account and all of us has – we've got our investment committee
and we watch it very carefully. But today, we're very happy with the position that we've
got. So thank you for your question.

May I go to the next question, Wendy?

Operator
The next question is from Daniel Baldini with Oberon Asset Management.

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Good morning, Daniel.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Daniel H. Baldini

{BIO 20809529 <GO>}

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question, and it's a little bit long, so please bear with
me. Over the past couple of years, you've committed a fair amount of capital to the
Runoff business. And I was wondering if you could explain a little bit what your operating
philosophy is there. And maybe by way of comparison, if I look at the results in 2013 and
2012, there was a small underwriting profit in 2013, and a small underwriting loss in 2012.
And when there has been pre-tax income, it's come really from the gains on investments
and that happened again in the first quarter of this year. The only company that I am
familiar with, which is the same business is Instar. And my sense is that they are roughly
the same scale as your Runoff business. And they seem to have operating income of $100
million plus every year or the past couple of years, but really not so much in terms of
investment income or realized gains. Now, I'm assuming both companies are capably
managed, and I'm wondering if you could sort of outline your philosophy and how it leads
to these different results.

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yeah. So in the business of runoff, first of all, you've got to have an exceptional runoff
team, and we do have an exceptional runoff team located in the United States and in the
UK, and they've been doing this for the better part of 20 years. They're among the best
in the United States and in the world. There's only a few runoff companies.
So in the last five or six years, we might have made, Daniel, about seven acquisitions,
something like that, and our rates of return, we watch this very carefully, and our rates of
return are in excess of 30% for the whole book of business. We look at each one of them,
and we see what the rates of return are, and the rates of return are exceptional, and
there are two components as you well know; one is on the underwriting or making sure
that the claims are well reserved and are paying off with their expenses below what we've
set them up. And the second is the investment side. So the advantage of the runoff is, we
have noticed over the years, as you know the claims, you can see every claim. If you like,
before you buy something, you can check every claim and make sure they're
appropriately reserved, you can add a margin on top of that which we do. While in the

Page 10 of 13

ongoing business, you take risks in the ongoing business and you never know what can
happen and whenever you underwrite.
So the runoff business has a lot of attributes to it that provide downside protection as
long as you know what you're doing, and we have a separate runoff company. It's not
mixed with our ongoing operations. It's separate, they're focused on it, and we think it will
continue to be a great opportunity for us. But there's no pressure to buy a company just
like there's no pressure to Fairfax to buy a company, an insurance company. There's no
pressure to add to our runoff. It has to meet our requirements which is to make a 15%
return on our capital. And if it does that, then we make the acquisition. In the past, as I said
five years, six years, the runoff book has done really well.

Q - Daniel H. Baldini

Bloomberg Transcript

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, Art.

Q - Arthur Charpentier

{BIO 1418113 <GO>}

Good morning. You showed a very nice unrealized gain in your bond portfolio in the first
quarter and in your opening remarks you seemed to attribute that to, I think, 30 basis
point rally in the U.S. Treasurys. And I guess my question is, and I understand it's not
necessarily your position that rates would be rising. My question is, should we see a
reversal of that and the next several months or quarters or whatever show rates moving
30 basis points, 40 basis points, 50 basis points in the other direction, would we see the
mirror image of this or do you in fact have, I don't know, mechanisms, protections,
whatever to mitigate the harm that that could cause?

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes, Art. That's a good question. Of course, if interest rates go up, you'd see some
reversal of our position as long as we haven't sold the bonds. If stock prices come down
for Bank of Ireland or other stock positions that we have, you'll see some reversal. Yes,
so, that's the reason, Art, I make the point that the only way to measure results with markto-market fluctuations is to take the long-term view and wait until they're realized, and so
that's been our view for a long time. But your point is well taken, things can change, can
reverse, and that can certainly happen. Next question...

Q - Arthur Charpentier

{BIO 1418113 <GO>}

And may I ask if you do have any appetite to realize some of these gains?

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

FINAL

Just repeat that again, Art, sorry.

Q - Arthur Charpentier

{BIO 1418113 <GO>}

I said, may I ask if you have any appetite at this time to realize some of those bond gains?

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes, I mean obviously I'm not going to tell you when we're going to realize it or not. But
yes, you know Bank of Ireland, it went up three times, we sold a third of our position. So
we realized it you might say. That position was like a $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion in our books,
and you might say, how are they going to realize as they own almost 10% of the company.
Well, the environment changed and there was a ton of demand, and Wilbur Ross and
ourselves sold a third of our position. So yes, we are in the marketplace. We look at
opportunities. We look at prices fluctuating every day. We don't react to them, but when
we want to, we can, we have and we will and we can.

Okay. Thank you very much.

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Thank you, Art. Thanks again. Wendy, next question, please?

Operator
The next question is from Tom MacKinnon with BMO Capital.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Thanks very much. Prem, just looking on the Bloomberg on the Bank of Ireland Holdings,
some is listed under Fairfax and some is listed under Prem Watsa. Now, are those
amalgamated or are those supposed to be the Fairfax Holdings? Is that the way you
should be looking at that?

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes. That's a good question, Tom. Because I am the controlling shareholder of Fairfax, so
any position that Fairfax owns comes to me. I wish that whole position was mine, but it's
not. So it's – I think I might have, Tom, and I think it's something like 100,000 shares of
Bank of Ireland, and the rest is all Fairfax. But any time we disclose a position that Fairfax
has, from a reporting standpoint, it comes up to me because of a control position. And
then, of course, if I'm a Director that you have reporting obligations because of being a

Director also. But I think I have to – I'm sure I'll report separately my own position and
Fairfax's position.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thanks for that.

A - V. Prem Watsa

call, and we look forward to presenting to you again after the next quarter. Thank you,
