Presentation
Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. My name is Gianandrea Roberti. I am Head of Investor
Relations at Tryg.
We published our full year results earlier this morning. And I have here with me Morten
Hubbe, our Group CEO; Barbara Plucnar Jensen, our Group CFO; and Johan Kirstein
Brammer, our Group CCO.
With these few words, over to you, Morten.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Gian. And we'll start on Slide 3 with our ﬁnancial highlight, where we reported
Q3 full pre-tax result just below DKK1.6 billion, actually up 30% year-on-year, of course,
including Trygg-Hansa and Codan Norway. And we're very pleased to report the highest
ever Q4 technical result of DKK826 million for the quarter for Tryg Classic alone, and that
of course contributes to the highest ever full year technical result of DKK3.7 billion.
Investment income of DKK941 million for Q4, which, of course, includes RSA Scandi result
for the quarter. Combined ratio of 86.2 driving the technical result of DKK826 million with

good growth, improved underlying claims, Alka synergies as the key drivers. Underlying
claims improved 80 basis points for the group while being ﬂat for private in line with
recent trends. As I mentioned, total investment income of DKK941 million bear in mind
that you need to split it into two as we also do in the P&L, where DKK373 million is more
classic investment result from Tryg with equities and properties contributing well. And
then DKK568 million net proﬁt contribution from RSA Scandinavia. As you know, this is
the equity accounting methodology that you've now seen for a couple of quarters, and
we will of course return to the strong operating performance in Trygg-Hansa and Codan
Norway.
Finally, big surprise, we will be paying a dividend per share of DKK1.07 for Q4, bringing
the total full year to DKK4.28 per share, and a solvency ratio of 188, slightly higher than
expected; and we, of course, maintain our ﬁrst year '22 guidance of a solvency of 195 to
205.

Bloomberg Transcript

On Slide 4, we elaborate on customer highlights; as you've seen in previous quarters, we
have implemented in 2021 a new method, which measures both touch points like for
instance, buying insurance on the phone and the full process, for instance, claims
handling, which could cover many contact points. We're very pleased to see
improvements from 84 to 85 and driven by and mainly an improved telephone contact
measurement in commercial Denmark and improved process measurement in claims
Denmark and claims Norway.
If we move on to Slide 5, we show the highest ever Q4 technical results in Tryg Classic,
and as I mentioned, also for the full year. And for the quarter, the technical result of
DKK826 million, up 6% from DKK780 million year-on-year, positively driven by higher
premium income and lower underlying claims and negatively impacted by lower run-oﬀ
gains and no positive COVID-19 impact, which is clearly diﬀerent from the year before.
Private continues to improve through higher volumes and help from higher run-oﬀ gains,
but then also slightly lower weather claims. Commercial improves the underlying
proﬁtability, but reported a lower result year-on-year. We see a lower level of runoﬀ gains
and a higher level of large claims pulling downwards.
In corporate, we'll continue to improve the underlying claims. And at the same time, the
reported numbers are helped by much lower large claims year-on-year. Sweden continue
to improve the underlying claims as well, really positive. But we do see that much lower
runoﬀ levels leads to a lower technical results.
On Slide 6, for the last time we show Alka synergies, very pleased that we end up by the
DKK333 million, which is 10% higher than our target of DKK300 million, which is really
positive. Synergies is, of course, very important and was a very important part the
rationale for the Alka transaction. And we are very happy to see that we've overperformed on all areas in the synergies and also that gives good comfort in the RSA
transaction and the synergies planned there.
On Slide 7, we show the Q4 ﬁnancial performance for Codan Norway and Trygg-Hansa,
very pleased to see a strong reported growth of 5% in Trygg-Hansa. Actually that has

Page 2 of 25

FINAL

been adjusted, because as you may remember in Q4 2020, so not '21, but Q4 2020, there
was a DKK180 million debt write-oﬀ in Trygg-Hansa and we've adjusted for that when
calculated growth of 5%, whereas in Codan Norway, we saw limited growth. If we dig
further into the Trygg-Hansa growth, there was a strong new business growth in personal
lines, and particularly, in motor, where Trygg-Hansa has the underweight historically. And
in the SME commercial lines, we see that retention is up, but also new business in motor is
developing positively.
Look at the technical results, Trygg-Hansa for the quarter was DKK5.08 million with a
combined ratio of 78.8%, and Codan Norway improved signiﬁcantly to technical result of
DKK44 million with a combined ratio of 84.2%, but bear in mind, held by the absence of
larger claims. Overall, Trygg-Hansa and Codan Norway beneﬁts from a robust investment
result of DKK218 million with risky assets performing well in Q4, particularly REITs, which is
real estate.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we look at Slide 8, as you know, RSA Scandi has only been in our accounts for seven
months in '21. And we use this equity accounting methodology, where we see a net proﬁt
being reported as a separate line investment. And we will, of course, change this April 1,
'22 expectedly after de-merger, which means that in Q2 results for the ﬁrst time, we'll see
through consolidation and we will leave the equity accounting concept.
Now seven months is a little bit of a strange timing to report, so we thought it'd be helpful
on this Slide 8 to show 12 months full year '21 results for Codan Norway and Trygg-Hansa,
but bear in mind, we only owned it for seven months. For the full year, Trygg-Hansa
delivers just over DKK2 billion of technical results with a combined ratio of 78.8%. And
bear in mind that includes the single weather event in Gavle of DKK149 million and then
Codan Norway delivers a DKK163 million technical results for the full year with a
combined ratio of 85.5% with a strong improvement to the year before. So, all-in-all, close
to DKK2 billion technical result for the full 12 months for the new family members in
Sweden and Norway, and I think oﬀ to a very good starting point; and that thing is a
segue to synergies, Johan.

Johan Kirstein Brammer

{BIO 18640275 <GO>}

Thank you so much, Morten. And let's dive straight into synergies on Page 9.
So, for 2021, we report synergies of DKK63 million, and these are unsurprisingly to many
of you on the call, mainly cost related in line with the experience from the Alka
transaction. In general, there is a positive impact from natural attrition, savings from not
being part of the RSA group, and reduced marketing spend. We have together with
Trygg-Hansa and Codan Norway in working hard on the synergy part so far as this is a
very critical part of the rationale behind the RSA transaction. And we are pleased to
emphasize that we feel very comfortable that we we'll deliver the promise synergies
according to the targets we have already laid out.
With that, moving to Page 10 on shareholders remuneration, Tryg is, as Morten said,
paying DKK1.07 dividend per share in Q4, DKK4.28 for the full year. And a couple of

Page 3 of 25

months ago at our Capital Market Day, we did publish a relatively precise guidance in
terms of shareholders returns for the next three years. We aim to pay between DKK12
billion to DKK14 billion in ordinary dividends between 2022 and 2024 and adding to that
a buyback of approximately DKK5 billion starting in ﬁrst half 2022 following the FSA
approval. We aim very clearly to remain a dividend stock and the full consolidation of RSA
ﬁgures, the synergies development, and the booking of nearly all transaction and
restructuring cost in 2022 will drive our earnings substantially higher, and therefore,
boosting our dividend capacity in the next three years. So, after 2021 and 2022 with some
turbulence in the P&L, things are soon stabilizing and our commitment to a strong
dividend development is as ﬁrm as always.
With that, we're turning to the next section on premiums and portfolio, looking into Slide
12. So, top line growth for Q4 was reported 2.6% and 5.1% adjusted for the bonus
premium rebates driven by growth in all private and commercial segments. In the next
slide, we will in more detail describe the bonus and premium rebates.

Bloomberg Transcript

Private being the most proﬁtable area and therefore we are very satisﬁed with the growth
in this segment of reported 3.1% and 7.3% adjusted for bonus premium rebates.
Commercial had a growth of 5.1%, which was a combination of organic growth in
Denmark. And in Norway was driven by price increases for especially larger commercial
customers.
COVID on the other hand showed a negative growth of 2.5% and was impacted by
proﬁtability initiatives across countries. In general, please bear in mind, growth is not the
key in the corporate business. What matters here is improvement in the proﬁtability across
all countries. Sweden showed a growth of 1.5% impacted by price adjustments and good
development for its bank distribution with Danske Bank.
That brings us to the bonus and premium rebates on Page 13. Tryg's premium growth was
signiﬁcantly impacted by bonus and premium rebates in Q4, and overall, for the full year
2021 due to strong proﬁtability across partner agreements. Many of our partner
agreements have a proﬁt sharing mechanism and strong performance drives higher proﬁt
sharing, which accounting-wise is deducted in the premiums. As you know, Tryg has a
strong focus on partner agreements as these are, in general, characterized by a high
retention and therefore low expense ratio, making it possible for us to oﬀer products at
competitive prices.
I will revert to that on the next slide. From 2023 and onwards, as part of the IFRS 17
implementation, the bonus and premiums rebates will no longer impact the premiums,
but be part of the claims, which in our view makes it much more sense and will make our
premium growth more stable going forward.
Turning to Page 14 on our partnership agreements; as mentioned, Tryg has a strong focus
on proﬁtable partner agreements and we have many years of experience in this area both
in Denmark and in Norway. And we're satisﬁed with the many partner agreements we've
worked with for many years, and due to our strong partner setup, we have also recently
been able to attract new partners from competitors. As mentioned at our Capital Market

day in November, partner agreements are in general characterized by strong leads
coming from the partners with eﬀective hit rates, with attractive risk proﬁles, many
products per customer, a high customer lifetime and therefore an associated low expense
ratio.
The commercial metrics are therefore inherently diﬀerent from those of our direct
business, which allows us to have both diﬀerent product features and diﬀerent pricing for
our partnership customers. But looking at across our partnership agreements, we of
course, see diﬀerent levels of performance both in size and proﬁtability as we do with our
direct customer. But as a whole and I think this is the important key here, the partner
portfolio has a combined ratio around 85 close to that of the rest of the private portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to Page 15 on pricing; adjusting crisis in accordance with inﬂation is critical and
therefore we monitor the development very closely, especially these days. In periods with
high inﬂation in the prices of materials, Tryg has been able to mitigate this through strong
procurement agreements. We now begin to see some inﬂation impact, especially for
house and building, and therefore, we will continue to adjust prices to mitigate this going
forward.
Turning to Page 16 on customer retention, customer focus is extremely important and
customers' view of Tryg is best monitored through the retention rate. For private
Denmark, we experienced in the past few quarters as expected a slight drop in the
retention rate as a consequence of the drop in the Nordea portfolio. We are however
satisﬁed that we have a net positive impact when looking at the Nordea and Danske Bank
portfolios due to very strong sales to Danske Bank customers and we are also satisﬁed
that for this Q4, we're seeing the retention rate improving with 0.6 percentage points.
In Norway, we are happy to continue to see a high level of retention, even with the high
growth for the past two years. And for commercial, we saw an improved development for
Denmark with 0.2 percentage points and an improvement for Norway even in a period,
where we have been working very much with price adjustments.
And with that, I will pass it over to you, Barbara.

Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Johan.
For the details on claims and expenses, please turn to Slide 18. For Q4, Tryg reported an
improvement in the underlying claims ratio of 80 basis points for the group, while the
private segment was ﬂat. This is in line with the previous quarters in 2021. The
improvement in group underlying claims ratio was primarily driven by proﬁtability
initiatives in the commercial, and in particular, the corporate segment, and we saw a
higher reported claims ratio for commercial compared to the same period previous year
due to a higher level of large claims in this segment.

FINAL

As previously mentioned, the strong growth in the private segment is impacting the
underlying claims ratio as new business is not as proﬁtable as what you could call old
business. The claims ratio for the new business is approximately 3% higher than the claims
ratio for existing business primarily, because the new customers tend to make more
frequent claims under their insurance policies during the ﬁrst couple of years. For the
group, we expect the improving trend to continue in 2022.
Please turn to Slide 19. The two charts show the large and weather claims experienced in
the quarter. The large claims were higher than normal while weather claims were below a
normal Q4. At the bottom, you can see the development in the discount rate of Tryg's
liabilities and the runoﬀ results. The discounting rate of our liabilities move upwards to
0.7% compared to 0.2% last year following a general increase in the market-based interest
rates. With respect to the run-oﬀ, the result was 3.8% for Q4 and 4% for the full year 2021,
both somewhat lower than last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

On Slide 20, you can see that the expense ratio continues to be stable. The expense ratio
for the fourth quarter was 14% in line with the same period last year. In general, we believe
that an expense ratio around 14% is strong and a very important competitive advantage.
The eﬀort goes into continuously to identify improvement related to a more eﬃcient
distribution, which to a large degree, ﬁnance the IT investments. During Q4, we saw a
slightly higher number of employees, primarily driven by the higher business volume,
investments in IT and IT and digitalization, and continued expansion for the credit and
surety business.
In the following section, we'll take you through our investments, our capital, and our new
targets. So, please turn to Slide 22.
In this slide, we show the split of our invested assets, which currently add up to
approximately DKK43 billion. The match portfolio is backing our insurance reserves and is
around DKK30 billion while the free portfolio, the capital of the company is approximately
DKK13 billion. The asset mix of the free portfolio is broadly unchanged, so not much new
to report here. Please also note that the investment assets described here are for Tryg
Classic or Tryg standalone. The investments that -- the investment assets related to RSA
do not go into our portfolio yet, however, this will be the case at the time of demerger.
On Slide 23, you can see more details on the standalone investment results. For Q4, Tryg
reported a standalone investment result of DKK373 million driven by a very robust return
on the free portfolio primarily beneﬁting from strong equity markets as well as good
returns and property assets. The match portfolio also produced a small positive results,
primarily driven by a tighter spread between the discounting curve in euros and the
assets invested in Danish kroner. In general, Q4 was really strong and we would like to
highlight that a total investment result of DKK373 million in a quarter is approximately the
double of what we expect in a normal year. And it is really important not to extrapolate
expectations on this particular quarter.
On Slide 24, we take a look at the solvency position. Tryg is reporting a year end solvency
ratio of 188, up from 179 at the end of Q3. The upwards move is driven by a strong organic

Page 6 of 25

FINAL

capital generation with net proﬁts, almost doubling the dividend in a more or less ﬂat to
SCR.
Looking at the SCR, you would see two diverging moves, Tryg's standalone SCR is driven
up by a higher market risk following a strong capital markets trend in Q4. And at the same
time, Codan's SCR is down due to some technicalities in Codan's model. At our recent
CMD, we guided a solvency ratio in the range between 195 and 205 at the end of the half
year '22. The higher than previously expected SCR for Tryg and the lower Codan SCR at
the end of Q4, does not impact this guidance. We maintain the 195 to 205 guidance,
which already includes the intended DKK5 billion share buyback. And we see it as a
strong starting point for the new group to drive further shareholder return.
On Slide 25, you can see the current Tier 1 and Tier 2 capacity. There's not much new in
this slide. But Tier 1 capacities linked to the overall level of the core equity Tier 1, which is
ultimately driven by proﬁts and dividends. As mentioned in the last bullet on the slide, it is
important to remember that the year-end SCR of DKK9.9 billion will be approximately
DKK1 billion lower when we close the sale of Codan and Denmark, hence you should
consider the current Tier 2 capacity to be extraordinary. Tryg has no plans to issue further
debt.

Bloomberg Transcript

Slide 26 shows the updated, as per end of Q4 buildup of our solvency capital
requirements split into diﬀerent categories. Please remember that we only use our
internal model for the insurance risk; all else is on the standard formula. Additionally, we
are showing the split of the market risk charge between the diﬀerent asset classes. Like
shown before, equities continue to attract the highest capital charge.
In Slide 27, we show the historical development of our solvency ratio. It's quite clear that
adjusting for transaction events like the acquisition of Alka and recently RSA Scandinavia,
the development of the solvency ratio is very stable. In a normal year, our own funds
primarily move due to the development of net proﬁts and dividends while the solvency
capital requirement moves very little driven by the growth of the business. As mentioned
on Slide 24, we end the year at a solvency ratio of 188 and repeat the guidance for the ﬁrst
half of '22 in the range between 195 and 205, including the impact of the share buyback.
An updated snapshot of the solvency ratio sensitivities can be found on Page 28. And you
will notice that there is not a lot of changes on this slide. The sensitivities to the solvency
ratio are broadly unchanged. And as covered bonds are largest as it lasts by far, it's not a
surprise that the biggest sensitivity relates to this particular spread rate. 2021 was an
eventful year and we expect '22 to also be quite exciting.
On Page 29, we have summarized a few important reminders about what to expect. The
starting point is getting to demerger of Trygg-Hansa in Sweden and Codan in Norway,
from Codan in Denmark after which we will be able to fully consolidate the results of
Trygg-Hansa and Codan Norway into the Tryg numbers. This is expected as Morten
mentioned before to be the case from 1st of April '22. You should also note that we have
booked slightly less transaction and integration costs in '22 compared to what we
originally anticipated. The diﬀerence will ﬂow into '22, where we expect to book the vast

majority of the remaining part. The remaining part is approximately DKK1.3 billion and
we'll come back with more precise comments on this topic during 2022. And regarding
our new ﬁnancial targets for '24, we publish these at our CMD in London in November.

FINAL

Morten, can you remind us what we're targeting?

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes. Of course. On Slide 30, we repeat all of our targets as given in the -- at the CMD. And
for 2024, I'll now go through all of them and I'll just repeat our extremely important and
ambitious technical result target of DKK7 billion to DKK7.4 billion by 2024 and then our
target to payout DKK17 billion to DKK19 billion to be send back to our shareholders, split
between ordinary dividends and the expected and announced buybacks. So, that will be
an important and I think interesting journey. And of course, we ﬁnish oﬀ with our favorite
quotes on Slide 31 from John D. Rockefeller, who I hope will be pleased with our planned
increase in dividends and payouts going forward.
I think with that, we'll turn to your question.

Questions And Answers
Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

(Question And Answer)
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Asbjorn
Morks of Danske Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Asbjorn Morks
Thank you, and good morning. A couple of questions from my side. First on the -- on the
premium rebates and the private portfolio that you have. A couple of questions really, but
I mean considering the growth you had the last couple of years from partnerships, it
seems like we have sort of reached the maximum on how proﬁtable these agreements
can be without you having to sort of reimburse your client base and I can see you're
expecting underlying claims ratio improvements in private going into 2022.
So just wondering, is this on a net basis? Is this as good as it gets for a relatively big part
of your private portfolio or how will this actually develop in 2022 if you do actually show
improvements in those areas of your business? That was the ﬁrst question.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Maybe I can start by commenting on that, Asbjorn. I don't think we'll ever reach a point
where we believe that it is as good as it gets. Our view is that we continuously work to
improve the underlying claims ratio for all of our portfolios, including private. And then, of

Page 8 of 25

FINAL

course, depending on the growth that can have an impact due to the new customer
proﬁle as Barbara expects.
So no, we will not stop working on improving the underlying claims in private, but we'll
have a continued focus on improving that. Of course, the delta on the premium rebates is
a little bit larger than we thought, and perhaps the split between the quarters could have
been better because the Q1 or Q4 impact in Denmark is a little bit on the high side, but it
has also been slightly unusual, for instance, some of the partner agreement has a higher
component of travel. So, when travel is lower because of COVID with that 60% lower
travel claims, that hits particularly partner -- particular partner agreements more than
other lines. So there are various nuances as to why the premium rebates is higher for Q4.
Ideally, we would have split it better, but we'll continue to improve underlying claims and
some of that will be shared with partners.

Q - Asbjorn Morks
But business, so I mean, if I look at the slide 13, you do emphasize quite a lot on the
diﬀerence between the growth as reported in the -- and the underlying growth excluding
this. But isn't so that if you didn't have this, we would have higher premiums, but then we
would have a worse combined ratio. So I guess the net proﬁt impact would be the same,
right. So if we look at the adjusting for IFRS-17, I guess we just get higher premiums, but
with a deteriorated combined ratio.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

So you're right that with IFRS-17, it will no longer be deducted from the premiums. It will
be shown on the claims. It will not result in a worst combined ratio, it will be solved in the
same combined ratio as today. But you're right that the expense if you will of that proﬁt
sharing will be shown on the claims. So it won't actually change the bottom line. It won't
change the technical results, but it will give less of -- it will improve the visibility of the
actual growth traction. Because today the model means that when there are stronger
bottom line, it deteriorates the top line growth, which is quite counterintuitive with it. But
you're completely right, it won't change the technical result.

Q - Asbjorn Morks
But isn't so with the partnerships, quite a lot of them that you have right now. I guess, if
your proﬁtability improves further, you will just have to pass that to your -- back to the
clients. Will you be able to retain some of it?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, it -- there is a variety of models of sharing. Some of the sharing is a proportional
sharing. So, that means that a lot of improvement would be kept by us, some of it would
ﬂow to the partner. Some proﬁt-sharing agreements are picked to a particular combined
ratio. Then there is more of the impact that we mentioned. In some partnership
agreements, we choose to turnaround and use the higher than expected proﬁt to invest in
new products, on new digital solution which drives new growth and new results.

FINAL

So there's a variety on that Asbjorn. So, it's not -- it's not as simple as you put it and there's
a number of the partnership agreements where stronger proﬁtability would lead to
stronger technical results for us as well. And then of course, the volume that goes into it
will improve our technical results as well. So, it is a little bit of a mixed bag because the
sharing methodology there's a great variety of that.

Q - Asbjorn Morks
Okay, fair enough. Then if I may go to Slide number 7 on your newly acquired assets. I'm
struggling a bit to read whether I think this is good data or maybe slightly disappointing
data, but if I look at the growth in the Swedish business. Of course, very strong, reported
5.7, if we adjust for the one-oﬀs, but then I guess you also have some FX tailwinds that at
least the growth at 3.5-ish% in the period, which I guess is okay, but then the combined
ratio deteriorated 3 percentage points in Trygg-Hansa year-over-year. And you do write
that there's a COVID-19 and there's run-oﬀ, but could you just elaborate a bit on the
underlying claims ratio trends for Trygg-Hansa, if you have that data available at this time?
And I guess the same for the Norwegian business growing premiums by 19%, but what I
calculate as 8% FX tailwinds. Of course, still good growth, but the 50 percentage points
combined ratio improvement, I guess, you're also saying large claims had an impact, but
how do you see the underlying development, if we just put this on that business as well?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yeah, I think for the Norwegian business you pointed to some of the biggest areas of
impact to the lack of large claims that's been driving a substantial part of the
development this year. The underlying it's slightly improved, but it's not a massive
development there in 2021.
For Trygg-Hansa, bear in mind that obviously there was also the large weather claim back
in Q3. And as you point out there, there was higher run-oﬀs for 2020, that sort of
supported the very strong results in Q4. And obviously, they also beneﬁted from COVID
in 2020 compared to '21. So it's a mix of diﬀerent things where I would say, Trygg-Hansa
probably looked a little bit too strong in 2020, whereas Codan Norway, probably is a little
bit on the strong side in '21.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think it's fair to say Asbjorn, that many competitors, including RSA has chosen historically
to take the COVID impact more or less straight into the P&L, which of course has ﬂatter
2020. And then it's a negative year-on-year comparison into the later parts, particularly
'21. And as you know, in fact, we've chosen to be slightly more on the conservative side
and be slightly less keen to take every single impact into to the P&L, but there is that
diﬀerence when you compare '20 to '21.

Q - Asbjorn Morks
But I guess the conclusion varies quite a bit on how -- if the underlying combined ratio is
slightly improving or is it deteriorating somewhere between 0% and 3%. I fully
acknowledge what you're saying. And also fully acknowledge that you might not have the
Page 10 of 25

full insights into COVID-19, et cetera. But do you have any feel on whether the underlying
claims ratio in Trygg-Hansa is actually stable to improving?

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

We're seeing more and more underlying data we have a direct access to everything from
1 of April, but we're seeing more and more underlying data on each of the product lines
and the overall assessment is that it is extremely stable and the control is extremely
strong. So I think when we look at the totality, the two acquired entities in Sweden, and
Norway makes almost DKK2.2 billion for the full year in technical result. And I think we see
that as extremely strong and something that we can then further improve with the
synergies plan.
And then also bear in mind that actually when we look at particularly the quarterly
numbers, historically RSA didn't even report quarterly numbers. So I would probably wait
a little bit into '22 before I try to ﬁnd detailed nuances and the diﬀerences on quarterly
numbers from the acquired entities. And also, it will be after 1 of April where we have full
data access to everything.

Q - Asbjorn Morks

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, fair enough. The ﬁnal question if I may on Alka, you reported the 333 million of total
synergies, and I believe they were 279 at Q3. So you realized an additional 54 million in
Q4. We're just wondering what drove this. It sounds like a pretty big number for a single
quarter and why should we -- why should this stop 1 of January this year? Should there be
further improvements in Alka going forward on synergies.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yeah. I think what you should take from Morten's comment, that this is the last quarter of
Alka synergies is just stating the fact that we would not report speciﬁcally on this going
forward. Bear in mind, we put out two-year target back in 2018. And those are the ones
we have been following up on. And obviously, it is also becoming more and more diﬃcult
to sort of split out Alka speciﬁc synergies to what is going on in the rest of Private. So you
can say it's the last quarter that we will report speciﬁcally, but obviously like with the rest
of the business we will continue to work on improving and strengthening the business
going forward. If you --

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And I guess it's fair to say and you can comment on the synergy for the quarter, but it's
fair to say Asbjorn, that whether you look at the underlying proﬁtability development in
Alka or you look at the synergies development in Alka, they both tell a very strong story,
and of course, that story doesn't end 1 of January '22, and we are very pleased that that
performance ﬂows into the continued improved performance going forward for the total
private business of Tryg.

FINAL

And then if you look at Slide 6, Asbjorn you can see where the DKK54 million stems from.
So DKK29 million is by using the procurement agreements we have when sorting the
claims for Alka customers. 12 -- DKK12 million stems from cost beneﬁts related to staﬀ
functions, and then the remaining DKK13 million are revenue synergies that comes from
cross-selling to Alka customers, when we also use the Tryg agent model on the customers
of Alka.

Q - Asbjorn Morks
Yeah. I was just wondering, three years after you acquired the company, that you're still
able to realize quite that many synergies on a quarterly basis. So there was more -- but it
sounds like that there's more to come going into 2022. So that was basically I guess --

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

But I think that, Asbjorn that that three years is a natural time horizon for peak of synergies
in an acquisition, but I think in any well-run company would target that you can continue
to improve the acquired business also after the three years. And of course, we intend to
do that. So that is exactly our focus.

Q - Asbjorn Morks
But is that part of your 2024 target?

Thank you. Our next question goes to the line of Will Hardcastle at UBS. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 22230376 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thanks. Two questions if I may. First one is, you're experiencing this twopronged underlying margin development. You've got the Private ﬂat, the group
improving, implying major commercial and corporate improvement. I think your Private
underlying growth has been about 7%. It certainly was in Q4, it might be something
slightly diﬀerent for the full year, I guess. But at what level of premium growth should we
expect the private lines to help contribute to the margin improvement below that 7%
perhaps.
Second one is, we've had the higher net earnings that's boosted the Solvency II ratio. I
know you touched on a couple of SCR adjustments there as well. But I'm surprised you
haven't suggested that you could now exceed that 195% to 205% at the half-year. Is it fair
to say you've moved up to the upper end even within that? Or was this perhaps just a
timing beneﬁt? Thanks.

FINAL

Yeah. Well, let me start with the guidance on the half-year solvency. As you point out,
some of it is a timing impact and some of the things that you saw for Q4, will move the
other way when we start looking at the opening balance and all the other moving parts
that you will see in particular in the second quarter of the year. So this does not change
the range and we don't point to a speciﬁc part of the range, because there are still quite a
few moving parts in the coming quarters.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think on your question on the link between growth and underlying claims for private
lines. If we look at Private lines in Q2 and for the full year, the growth was 8.3% before
bonus and premium rebates, which is quite high. And I think with such a high growth,
we're sort of just juggling on the balance of the ﬂat underlying development.
So, typically the growth would need to be slightly lower than that to have a positive
development in the underlying claims in Private. But what we're working on every day is
to secure a balance where we both have a rather large growth in private and we improved
the underlying claims at the same time. And of course, what you can take away is that
without this higher than usual growth, underlying claims is developing really well in
Private lines. But of course, we're ambitious people, so we want to achieve both. So we
want to achieve the high growth and we want to achieve improved underlying claims as
well. And that is exactly what we're working on. So, let's see if we're not able to strike
both, but of course, 8.3% growth is a high number.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 22230376 <GO>}

That's great. I guess the return on capital is highly attractive and is there a trade-oﬀ here
that the marginal return on capital makes it actually better to grow top line at this point
and keep margin? Or is it still a fairly balanced trade-oﬀ between margin and growth?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well I think as Barbara explained, I think if you look at a very macro level, I think we're
really pleased to see that after total growth, it is predominantly driven by Private and SME
where returns on capital is extremely strong and then we actually see negative
contribution from corporate lines, where return on capital is not as it should be. It is
improving, but of course, is not as high as it should be. And then, as Barbara mentioned,
typically these 3 percentage points higher claims for new customers, typically last for a
couple of years and that's why we see that those customers were then sort of fairly few
years starts to contribute to the higher earnings again. So I think if you look at the lifetime
capital return, a logic of that, that is extremely strong. So we have zero doubts that creates
a lot of shareholder value, but of course, it does impact the underlying claims short-term.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

And if I may add to that, obviously, I would be a little bit worried if we show the growth
rates that we experience in private and commercial in the corporate segment for exactly
the reasons that -- that Morten pointed out.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jakob Brink from Nordea. Please go

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Just coming back to the questions, I'm underlining Trygg-Hansa if I
may. Barbara, I think you said that in Trygg-Hansa, 2020 was a bit too strong while Codan
Norway has been a bit too strong in 2021. Is it possible to maybe give a bit more detail
also regarding the Gyda weather-related claims in Q3? Should we adjust for the whole of
that or has been weather claims in Q1, Q2, Q4 been better than normal in 2021? Just to
get a sense of the sort of run rate of weather and large claims and run-oﬀ claims in TryggHansa, please.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Of course, and I fully appreciate your question Jakob. To start with, what I said was that
the combined ratio was somewhat stronger than what you would anticipate in TryggHansa in '20 compared to '21. As we said, we don't have all the full details on the
underlying claims ratio, but what we can see is as was also said before a stable to slightly
improving trend through '21.
And when it comes to the guidance on large weather claims, et cetera, et cetera, we are
reviewing that and will have far more details after the demerger where ﬁrst of all, we can
also align what they qualify as being large and weather claims because there are some
nuances in the way that we categorize it between Tryg and RSA. Hence, we will give you a
lot more guidance on that when we have the details. It's just too early days now because
we don't have the granularity of the details that we would like to in order to give you any
meaningful guidance.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And also, Jakob, we are, of course, in 2022, including Trygg-Hansa and Codan Norway in
our reinsurance program. So it's not only recalibrating expectation on large claims or
weather claims and using the same deﬁnition to make it apples and apples. In fact, we're
also making sure that we receive in the same reinsurance light, which has created good
synergies that's positive, but it does mean that there is some data modeling going on.
And you will have that in advance of having to report Q2 '22, which will be the full
consolidated deck. So we'll make sure we will give you ample data on that beforehand,
but that modeling is going on and there are deﬁnition diﬀerences. So, I don't think we
should jump into the nuances of that now, unfortunately.

No, it's ﬁne, thank you. But then just one, one small extra detail. So the synergies that you
have already realized in Trygg-Hansa, the DKK63 million. How's that book? Is that booked
in Trygg standalone or is that part of the proﬁt in Trygg-Hansa for the second half of the
year?

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

That is all -- all those synergies realized DKK63 million in 2021 are being booked within
the Trygg-Hansa perimeter. So, it doesn't fall in group.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

So, it's in the Trygg-Hansa you said. Sorry, just missed it.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

It's in the Trygg-Hansa ﬁgures.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay. So actually, the 78.6% combined ratio is also boosted by that DKK60 million, okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes. It is slightly boosted by that, and I think we need to take it into the bigger picture
where we are comparing a year of 2020 with 2021 with a lot more run-oﬀ in 2020 and a
lot more COVID impact in 2020. So it is a mixed bag of pluses and minuses, but the
synergies are captured in the 2021 ﬁgures.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And then just small details on ﬁgures, so one of them are pre-tax, the
other one is after-tax, but you have -- was it 568 million was the after-tax result of TryggHansa, Codan Norway, Codan Denmark in the results or in the quarter. And then yes, you
also told there was a slightly less 60 million less was with the technical proﬁt in TryggHansa and Codan Norway. Could use -- the residual, could you give us the split between
how much is investment income in Trygg-Hansa, Codan Norway, and how and how much
is Codan Denmark?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I can't give you the split between the three countries on the investment results. I can give
you the total investment result that goes into our numbers, which is DKK280 million for
the fourth quarter of 2021. But unfortunately, I can't give you the split related to the three
diﬀerent countries.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay. Fair enough. Last question, the 5 billion buyback in connection with Q3 I believe it
was, you said that there was a lot of moving parts back and forth. And if they came out on
the negative side, you could pay -- do the 5 billion buyback. But if some of them then
Page 15 of 25



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2022-01-25

turned out more positive, I guess, you could pay out more than 5 billion. Have you come
any closer to knowing if 5 is the number or if there could potentially be more?

FINAL

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yeah, I think it's a very good assumption that the 5 billion is what we plan for. As we also
state, we are quite mindful of having a good outset on our solvency ratio going forward.
And bear in mind when we launched the share buyback, we will have the immediate
impact of the full size of the share buyback. So not only taking into account you can say
the opening balance and how that looks, we're also are quite focused on making sure that
we have a good outset for, you can say the journey that were on in the combined
company going forward.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay. Very clear. Thanks a lot.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Martin Birk of Carnegie. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Martin Birk

{BIO 19920552 <GO>}

Thank you. A couple of questions from my side. First one, maybe coming back to
Asbjorn's question on synergies. So recent quarter strength has been an 80 bps
improvement in underlying claims ratio assuming that Alka synergies will continue to be
realized in the coming years. Should we add those 80 basis points to the synergies from
RSA going forward? Or how should we think about underlying claims ratio development?
That would be my ﬁrst question.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I think as a starting point, synergies going forward that we will report on a quarterly basis
will be related to RSA. We have a base, you can say the whole business case, when doing
the acquisition on the business that we have acquired, the potential is to combine that
with the remaining-type business. So therefore the synergies that we will report will be
speciﬁcally related to the RSA assets.
When looking at Alka, I think as we said before, they now sort of move into the ordinary
way that we run our business, continuously looking at improvements and eﬃciency. So
that will go into, you can say, the overall improvements that you will see for the private
segments going forward. So, you will not have the speciﬁc insights on the Alka, and it will
not go into the RSA numbers. But as Morten said, obviously that is part of the overall
ﬁnancial targets for the group running into '24.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I guess it's also implicit in your question, Martin, will we continue to chase the underlying
claims ratio improvement in Tryg Forsikring, of course, we will. And as you see at the
Page 16 of 25

FINAL

moment, we are improving that net-net mainly in commercial and corporate and we'll
continue to do that, and then of course, we'll see an improvement in Trygg-Hansa and
then we'll see a negative as we start to grow the business more. So, we'll see both
impacts. But what is driving the improvement underlying today is of course, Tryg
Forsikring and we'll continue to drive that also as we start to implement the synergies of
what we have acquired.

Q - Martin Birk

{BIO 19920552 <GO>}

Okay. Very clear. Then maybe moving on to -- moving on to the Codan and Denmark sale.
Our brands got their competition approval push to Phase 2. As far as I recall when you
were in Phase 2 with Alka back in, it took 185 days to solve, which pushed your timeline
quite a bit. If this timeline is also pushed equally as much, are you guys able to commence
the share buyback in H1?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think that's a good question. We're following the news as closely as you are. And I think
ﬁrst of all, we are not part of and preview to the dialogue with the DCCA around this. That
being said, we are not surprised that this approval is going into Phase 2 where they have
90 days to approve the transaction. We're not surprised, it is a transaction of a certain
size.
That being said, I would be hesitant to compare it to the approval process we went
through with the Alka transaction, all situations are diﬀerent. This is quite a diﬀerent
scenario, I would say. And you're right in saying that potentially this could be delayed. It
could possibly delay the closing of the deal. It could possibly delay the buyback slightly.
That being said, I think, I would lean on advanced communication to the market, saying
they still expect the transaction to close in the spring, which would -- should allow us time
to close the deal and initiate the buyback as we expected. But you're right, these things
are, and can be a little bit unpredictable. I must say though, we ﬁnd a lot of comfort in the
fact that (Inaudible) has undertaken what we call a hell or high water clause, meaning they
are required to undertake any remedies required to make the transaction go through. So,
as for the content, we are quite comfortable. Could the timing be a little bit delayed?
Possibly. We don't expect so, but it could be.

Q - Martin Birk

{BIO 19920552 <GO>}

Okay. So just to be --

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

--most important that we fundamentally know that this will go through, and then we
worked enough for processes like this to see that weather timing is one or two months
more or less, you just have to live with that. But fundamentally it doesn't change the
fundamentals of what you're doing and that's the most important.

Page 17 of 25



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2022-01-25

Okay, maybe just a quick follow-up on that. The ﬁrst one being, so basically what you're
saying is that you need the money in your account before you can commit to share
buyback. And then second, let's assume in a complete unlikely event that competition
authorities they say no to this, what is happening then?

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Let's just take the second part of your question ﬁrst. The event that they say no is an
unlikely not going to happen event. So what will happen most likely in these situations is
that the authorities will come back and explain what concerns they have and what
remedies could possibly repair these concerns. That is the scenario that we're looking
into. The scenario where there's a blank no, is not a scenario on our slate at all,
whatsoever.
And what would happen on the proceeds, Barbara, maybe you'll comment on that.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yes. Obviously, the two events are linked. So, we would very much like to see the closing
of the sale before we can launch the share buyback.

Q - Martin Birk

{BIO 19920552 <GO>}

Okay. But what would happen in that extreme outlier scenario?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

In which scenario?

Q - Martin Birk

{BIO 19920552 <GO>}

In the extreme outlier scenario that competition authorities, they say no.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Just to be very clear, and I think and maybe partner has been very clear about this also in
their perspectives around the rights issues, that they've undertaken in applications to
whatever it requires, selling out any part of the new business or existing business in order
to meet any concerns from the DCCA. That means that having accepted all remedies,
there's no real risk that this will not go through. All remedies have been accepted under
this hell or high water clause. That's why we feel very comfortable with this situation. So
it's clause. It's not a matter of subject matter, it's a matter of timing and process.

Q - Martin Birk

{BIO 19920552 <GO>}

(Multiple Speakers)

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

If you compare it Martin to the Alka process. Yes, there was a delay, yes that's annoying.
Yes there were some remedies. Were those remedies of magnitude to fundamentally
Page 18 of 25



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity

change the case? Not really. So, and I would personally see this transaction as a less
important transaction from a competition point of view. So, I think most likely this is more
a potential timing discussion, then a real risk of any kind.

FINAL

A - Johan Kirstein Brammer

{BIO 18640275 <GO>}

Just want to put that out on the question, just maybe taking one step back on the
question. I think we shouldn't read too much into the fact that they're going from Phase 1
to Phase 2. This is very expected for a transaction of this magnitude, having to do
whatever market research the authorities need to do to accept or even express whatever
concerns they might have. This is as expected, it's not a surprise. So, I would recommend
not reading too much into the fact that it's going into a Phase 2.

Q - Martin Birk

{BIO 19920552 <GO>}

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tryfonas Spyrou of Berenberg.
Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tryfonas, if you have your phone muted, you need to
unmute that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Tryfonas Spyrou

{BIO 21705826 <GO>}

Oh, hi. Sorry about that. Hi, morning. And I have one question, just on the discount rate
going forward. So we expect the tailwinds from higher rates given a higher discount rate
for reserves, particularly on the long-term lines in Denmark and Sweden. If you can
perhaps remind us the sensitivity of that to earnings and I was thinking presumably this is
now much higher, given the larger multiples you have in Sweden, and given you have
Trygg-Hansa now. Thank you.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yes. I think when looking at the impact of rates, just bear in mind our match strategy,
where you can say you -- you matched the obligations we have on the insurance liabilities,
with the investments we have on the investment portfolio. So in that connection, you can
say those should basically hedge the movements in the underlying rates and thereby the
discount rate.

Q - Tryfonas Spyrou

{BIO 21705826 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

So I guess you should -- the question is do you ask about the short-term impact or the
longer-term impact, because the short-term impact is of course exactly as Barbara
explained, they net each other out. So there is no short-term impact. So I guess
traditionally insurance companies have negative when rates go up, because then they

Page 19 of 25



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2022-01-25

have a negative on bonds. We don't have that. We have a neutral on day one. So that's
extremely important.

FINAL

And then, of course, going forward, the higher discount rate, depending on where on the
curve the rates change, but net-net the higher discount rate or higher rates will resolve
and higher discount rates which will result in positive on future combined ratios going
forward, because, of course, the combined ratio will drop with that higher discounting.
I think you can ﬁnd the report in our web page, which explains the sensitivity. But there is
a sort of broad, broad signaling which is, if you have 100 basis points increase in rates,
then the discounting reduces combined ratio by roughly 100 basis points as well. But it
does depends on where you are on the curve. So, it is not that simple in reality, but that
gives you an indication.

A - Johan Kirstein Brammer

{BIO 18640275 <GO>}

We could see, eventually, you are going to have a larger Swedish multiple, which has a
long tail to that. So, we should certainly see some higher, better reserve releases, I guess,
in the longer-term from higher rates from that book.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

So, of course, it would be if rates go up and the longer end of the yield curve, it's
traditionally Workers' Comp in Denmark, together with for instance liability and motor
liability, and then in Sweden of course empty bills even longer, and of course, children's
insurance it's long duration as well. So, those would be some of the lines that would have
the highest beneﬁt typically from higher rates going into future higher discount rates. So,
a neutral day one as opposed to most insurance companies which is negative day one,
and then a future positive depending on where on the yield curve rates increase.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

And if I may just add a ﬁnal point. We highlighted the sensitivities in our material today,
but those would apply to the current investment portfolio, which does not include, you
can say, the investments related to the new business. And that will obviously also be
updated posts the demerger where we will bring on board not only the liabilities on the
insurance side, but obviously also match the investment portfolio. So those two go handin-hand.

Company Name: Tryg A/S

Date: 2022-01-25

Thank you. Good morning. I have some couple of questions as well. First of all, is on the
motor competition in -- it looks like there could be a strong competition in Sweden, where
your Trygg-Hansa operation is. Could you explain how that has worked for you during
2021 versus 2020?

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

So I guess the motor business in Sweden is slightly diﬀerent to Denmark and Norway, in
the sense that you have the used car market, which is quite similar to Denmark and
Norway. And then you have the (Inaudible) in Sweden, where you typically buy the new
car with a period of insurance and that is typically not decided car by car or rather brand
by brand, and that methodology is diﬀerent in Sweden than Denmark and Norway. If you
look at this (Inaudible) or insuring new cars by brand in Sweden, typically that's a market
where Moderna or old Swedish business was not been present and where Tryg-Hansa the
acquired business has not been present either.
We've seen that Trygg-Hansa has done some more activity in that space and landed
particularly one larger agreement. So, I think we'll see over time that as Trygg-Hansa does
not have a monopoly on children's insurance, neither does anyone else have a monopoly
on ensuring new cars in Sweden. And I don't think that will fundamentally change the
market dynamics or competition. And I think it will be a very gradual slow movement, but
bear in mind that the majority of cars are used cars, and that is the biggest part of the
market and that hasn't really changed.

one-oﬀ event, is it customers you have dismissed? Or how should we treat them? Is it
because of proper weather? Or is it -- what has to happen so to speak?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I would say if you look at the large claims in total, for the year we're actually at a lower
level than you would ordinarily expect for our business. So you cannot expect a year with
zero large and weather claims. And what we have seen in particular in Q4 has mostly
been in the commercial space, and it has been very much ordinary course of business. So
it is not something extraordinary and I would say even though we have seen more in Q4
then we expected, then it is not at any extraordinary high levels.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. And ﬁnally, then on the discount rate and annuity. How much of the interest rate
increased in Sweden helped you run-oﬀ games develop positively in 2021 for TryggHansa?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

To be honest, we don't have that visibility at this point in time. Again, bear in mind that we
don't have the full visibility on all the line items at this point in time, because we are still,

you can say a little bit in the distance from having all the details. So we won't be able to
give you the precise details on this as of yet.

So I guess, if each of the maybe of RSA had been legal entities, then most likely we would
have had old data from July '21, but as Denmark -- sorry, as Sweden, Norway have been
underneath Denmark from a legal entity point of view, then really only the full separation
happens expectedly 1 April '22, and that is why all reporting of data goes through
Denmark, through the old legal entity structure, and that will be changed after the 1 of
April where we have the demerger expected, and we have full access to all data and we
have the full country split. So, sorry for that being the reply to several questions, but that's
just a structure of all the results of having to split the legal entities or split into legal
entities by demerger.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Understand. And then turning on the premium rebate, you touched upon how it works.
Could you tell us how many of your contracts is so-called proportional and how much is
pegged through the combined ratio? And ﬁnally, maybe how many have been in the
performance-related split between them if this is possible to say anything about?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I don't think we've ever published that. I don't think we will publish that either. But what I
can say is that the number of partnership agreements which is pegged through a
particular combined ratio is fairly limited. So, I think I would give that overall signal.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay, thanks a lot for that.

Operator
Thank you. And we have time for one further person from the queue, that's Per Gronborg
of SEB. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. A couple of questions from my side. First back to the rebates. You stated it
doesn't impact your technical result. Is it fair to say that the precise accrual of this
dividend impacts your technical result by an approximately DKK100 million negative in
Q4 versus the ﬁrst three quarters.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I'm not sure, I understood the question Per.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

If you -- Barbara did you understand it.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

FINAL

No. I was also asking if you could please repeat.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. You have premium cost of approximately DKK400 million in the fourth quarter
versus and average run rate of 300. This is something that is charged somewhere in your
proﬁt. Is it fair to say that if you had accrued your rebates correctly, then this would have
been the same amount each of the -- or roughly the same amount each of the four
quarters and therefore your technical result in that case would have been DKK100 million
better in the fourth quarter. And of course, similar in the ﬁrst three quarters.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Okay. Now I get it. Yes. Your logic absolutely applies. The one thing that I would say
though is that what you should remember is also the question around periodization
where also you can see that in a year like 2020 where you had COVID impact that runs
into '21 and so forth, that might also impact the overall number. But as a starting point,
your logic in terms of accruals, that should even it out over the course of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yeah. But this accrual is part of that, actually also included in the prior year's result. If some
of these accruals actually should have been booked as a charge already in 2020, then I
will guess this would have had to -- that this is included in your prior-year result. Is that
correct?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think you're right, but there are adjustments which go back in time and which then
actually are related to claims here that are older. But I think in the current reporting
regime, where you can only subtract it to current year's premium, you will get all of it in
whatever instance where you realize it, where we probably have to get back to pay under
IFRS-17 whether you're able to go back and post it in the right underwriting years as it
might relate to a claims year which is not a current claims year, now becomes a little bit on
the technical side. But I think there is an element of that because sometimes it is not only
the current underwriting year's claims, it is also prior year's claims development. So, I
think all-in-all, for me at least going to report this on the claims makes a lot more sense. It
doesn't change the technical result impact, but it shows in a better way that this is a cost
and not a top line.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Any thoughts about improving your accrual during the year?

FINAL

I think that we would very much like for the accrual to be much more smooth, but -- and
we're working on that as well. I think sometimes the decision on whether to use it for
developing new products or whether to use it to develop new digital solutions or whether
to pay it out to the partner as a part of proﬁts. Sometimes, it's not easy to predict what is
the result of that debate. So I think we'll probably never get to an accrual model which is
fully even, but we would like it to be more even than what we saw in Q4 for private
Denmark particularly.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. That gives some color on what's the chances. My ﬁnal question, if I look at
Commercial Q4, it looks reasonably soft both on headline and underline, the only thing
you are writing in your comments is that it's due to higher level of large claims and
substantial level -- lower level of prior year gains. To me it seems like both your costs are
unusually high, and your claims are also running at a somewhat higher speed than we
have seen previously. Is that just the ups and downs of single quarter. So how should -what should we read into this?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. I think in particular when it comes to the costs for commercial, bear in mind as we
mentioned right now, we are growing the surety and credit business through Europe. So
that accounts for a few more headcounts. And then obviously, as the volume of the
business is also growing, that also accounts for an increased number of FTEs. So right
now you can say, it's a question of adjusting to the business movements that you see. And
I wouldn't put anything in particular in terms of assessing this to be the trend going
forward.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

But what we do see, of course, is that growth in number of customers in Commercial, both
in Denmark and in Norway is predominantly the really small commercial customers, and
seldomly the medium to larger claims and commercial comes from those customers. So if
anything, we're diversifying further downwards also within the commercial space as we're
doing in corporate as well.
And I think, really is only in the recent couple of years that we've had this focus to grow
the 0 to 5, 0 to 10 employee space in commercial in Denmark and Norway. We're very
pleased to see that happening, because honestly, the returns are higher and the large
claims frequency is lower.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

This is Gianandrea, again. We just want to thank you all for all your questions. As usual,
Peter and I, and Investor Relations will remain at your disposal, if you had more during the
day and looking forward to speak to you in the next few days. Thanks.
