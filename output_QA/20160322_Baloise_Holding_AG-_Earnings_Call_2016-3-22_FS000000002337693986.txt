MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to the Bâloise Group
Annual Results 2015 Analysts Conference Call. I'm Moira, the Chorus Call operator. I
would like to remind that all participants will be in listen-only mode and the conference is
being recorded. After the presentation, there will be a Q&A session. The conference must
not be recorded for publication or broadcast.
At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over Mr. Marc Kaiser. Please go ahead, sir.

Marc Kaiser

{BIO 15056036 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning for our full-year results
and Q&A conference call. It's a pleasure for me to introduce you to our new Group CEO,
Gert De Winter. Please, Gert.

Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Thank you, Marc. Ladies and gentlemen, you all received this morning, of course, the
information pack. What I would like to do is run through the highlights and then actually

open up immediately for questions. But, let me ﬁrst run through the most important facts
about the results and the outlook.

FINAL

We are very satisﬁed with the full-year results 2015 as it stands for another reliable and
strong set of results for more than a decade. Bâloise belongs to one of the most proﬁtable
insurance companies in Europe. An achievement over the last 10 years which we really
feel proud about and to which we are fully committed for the next strategic chapter.
The Group's and others proﬁt for the period of CHF 512 million is underpinned by the
following three pillars of success. One, the volume of business increased at a healthy rate
of 3.3% and we generated as such above average growth in our target segments and
gained additional market shares.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second, our operational margin with the net combined ratio of 93.3% has never been as
good as since 2008. Our ongoing focus on operational excellence, a disciplined riskbased underwriting and our group-wide cost initiatives have led to this successful and
reliable core business. And third, following an exceptionally strong year in 2014, the life
business delivered a solid proﬁt contribution despite challenging market conditions.
The insurance industry, however, is facing some severe and disruptive changes in the
coming years. The current economic climate will likely persist for a long time. Ever
increasing regulation and negative interest rates are pushing the industry far away from its
core mission – protect life and property for our clients. We at Bâloise have the strong
belief that we cannot rely on what worked well in the past, but have to ﬁnd new ways to
deal with today's challenges and get even closer to our customers. Luckily, we did our
homework in the past and can build on a very strong platform to engage our future.
We will talk in detail about our future strategic journey on the today announced Investor
Day, October 26, 2016. But our future will build on strategic principles. One, we will
radically simplify our core business for our customers. Two, we will go beyond traditional
insurance business and provide new services in assistance and protection. And three, we
will relentlessly embed the customer focus in our corporate culture. With that we will
become the trusted choice for our customers, partners will seek to collaborate with us,
our employees will be proud by the inspiring jobs they do, and investors will value us
highly as a strong and sustainable business with a very attractive and reliable payout.
These were the highlights. So I would like to open up for questions.

Q&A
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The ﬁrst question is from Mr. Daniel
Bischof from Baader Helvea. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Yes. Good morning. Two questions, please. The ﬁrst one on the life side. So stripping out
the CHF 80 million of one-oﬀs, you were, I think, nicely in line with the CHF 200 million
guidance there. Now, year-to-date, you're seeing bond yields declining by another 30
basis points or so. Should we expect any additional negative impact from reserve
strengthening in that segment?
And then, the second one is on capital management. Could you provide some more
details what your thoughts were when deciding to go for an unchanged dividend?

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Let me pick up the second question ﬁrst, if I may, and then, hand over the other question
to the colleagues. Over last couple of months, it is clear that the Swiss regulator has
announced a couple of times that they will be moving much more to the standard models
in everything that is related to Swiss Solvency Test and – on capital, the intention being to
decrease complexity and increase the comparability.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, this is a major fundamental shift if you look at what work that has been done over
the last ﬁve years or so, and it is only generating, at this point in time, open questions, a
lot of uncertainty and everybody is actually making its own interpretation of what the
Swiss Solvency Test should be. So we think there is no need or even it is not wise to
actually disclose numbers that are absolutely unclear today. That's one. What we can say,
of course, is that both with the internal models and the standard models, our solvency has
always been above 100%, and we've never gone to the market to raise capital for
solvency reasons and we don't intend to break that tradition.
Coming back to the life question, I'll hand over to German Egloﬀ, our group CFO.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well, that's of course the question ﬁnally what the interest rate curve is doing at closing.
But, if the trend is going on, you are certainly right, then you need an additional reserve
strengthening – that's quite clear. And ﬁnally that's done on the local GAAP (07:17) basis.
So I just – we just had a board meeting in Belgium a week ago and we heard a ﬁgure
there, and it's exactly – there for example, the measure to have the additional reserve is
the ﬁve-year average of the Belgium government bonds. And the year that falls out of that
series now is 2011, and 2011 was especially high in yield.
So the pressure to re-reserve the book is still going on. So that's right. Even though, I
mean, that's not – I'm not saying it will cost us such and such kind of millions in the half
year that I just don't know it. We have to see what's happening there. I mean, we have
seen it in the last year. Just because interest rates picked up just before the end of the
year, the second half of the year was somehow surprising in the results for us as well.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Can I ask a follow up on capital management. I mean, looking at the Bâloise Holding, the
CHF 204 million in other income related to Luxembourg, I'm not quite sure I understand
the nature of this, is it called impairment reversal?

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

That's just the outplays of (08:51) participations. Because in the Luxembourg Holding, it's
the Luxembourg business and the Belgium business as well.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. So, excluding this item, the holding cash ﬂow – I'm not sure – did it actually (09:04)

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

That's not a cash ﬂow issue.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Well, therefore, I mean the holding cash ﬂow did actually not cover the dividend, is that
correct?

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

The cash ﬂow – say it again.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

The holding cash ﬂow to Bâloise Holding did not cover the 2015 dividend.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Yes, it did but you wouldn't see it.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Okay, so maybe you could provide some more details there? And then also (09:40)

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, it's mainly that it's always sort of the same. The biggest two dividend payers
are up to now, the Swiss non-life business and then the internal reinsurance business, and
that's unchanged.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

But we have – the Belgium dividend for example, goes to Luxembourg, and then from
Luxembourg that's more like in a, let's say, ﬁnancial or tax optimization machine that you
have to run how much dividend or how much cash ﬂow you're then transferring to from
Luxembourg to Brussels.

And maybe, Daniel just – it's me, we can get back to you on that element, just to clarify the
holding statement if there are any uncertainties after this question, yeah?

Operator
The next question is from Mr. Michael Huttner from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Fantastic. Thank you very much. Just on this reserving point. Can you remind us what the
cost was to shareholders in the ﬁrst half of 2015 of that (10:59) that may help us form a
view on what could be done now? And the other thing is, you know, as interest rates drop,
so you have to add to the reserves, but at some stage the back book, if you stop writing
this traditional business, the back book starts shrinking and then will release capital, and I
just wondered when will that start?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then on Germany, so the combined ratio was a little bit higher, I think one of 6% or
something. And I just wondered, in the past I had hoped that this is the second half of
2015 was then we'd actually see below 100. Can you give a bit more color when this might
happen now? Thank you.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

May I just ask you to repeat the ﬁrst part of the question because we didn't get that here?
The sound was very bad, so we missed actually half of the question. We got the question
about Germany all right, but the other questions we're about blurred in the – somewhere
– got lost in the clouds somewhere. Please repeat?

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

It's lost in the clouds, that sounds like me. Yes. No, of course. Thank you. The ﬁrst question
was on the ﬁrst half 2015 you added to reserve. Now, you can't tell us how much you're
going to add this year, but clearly you're going to add something. Can you tell us how
much you add and how much was the cost to shareholders back in ﬁrst half 2015, just so I
can understand how the accounting and the reserving works?
And then, the other question on the reserving is a bit more complicated. So, as interest
rates drop, you keep adding to the (12:47) liabilities current size. But at some stage, if you
stop writing this traditional business, presumably, it will start releasing, I mean, as the
policies mature, it will start releasing capital. I just wondered when that might be. And
then of course, the question on German non-life. Thank you.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, let me pick up the Germany question, also an attempt to the second question
about the traditional business. Germany, ﬁrst thing I have to say about Germany, of
Page 5 of 22

FINAL

course, is that we do make proﬁt in Germany. That's a one thing.
Secondly, that Germany is certainly a part or a pillar of our strategy and that the strategy
we're pursuing in Germany is correct. But it is indeed complex and it will take longer than
we expected. I think overall, if you see the optimization program that we're running in
Germany, it's delivering very good results, especially in the area of cost reduction. You
might have seen that the cost rate has gone down by 1.2% and that we actually have to
separate ourselves of 300 of the 400 planned colleagues.
Especially promising is also that we are outgrowing the market in the non-life and the life
target segments we selected in Germany. But what is true and where we still have a way
to go is the fact that the non-life portfolio in terms of the quality is not good enough yet.
So, we need to increase the quality by further sanitizations. And secondly, we need to
grow the proﬁtable part of the business in order to really have the sustainable scale to
absorb large claims, because this is exactly what happened in 2015. We have a number of
large claims which deteriorated the combined ratio.

Bloomberg Transcript

Besides that, we need to invest in the service we oﬀered to the agents and the brokers in
Germany, because that's the way we will be able to grow. But it will indeed take longer as
you suggested.
On the life book and then I will hand over to the colleagues, but on the life book
question, we are still writing traditional life business, of course. We are extending and
diversifying and growing in the modern life insurance product with semi-autonomous
solutions like Perspectiva in Switzerland which is pension business. But we are continuing
to write the traditional business. So, there is a diversiﬁcation and a shift into modern life,
but we're not stopping traditional life business. We are not going and run-oﬀ in traditional
life business. But I'll leave it up to the colleagues to comment more on that.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

I'd say it is a hard one. And the main reason for this is that you do this re-reserving on
local basis. And the rules for local GAAP are diﬀerent in every country. So, therefore, it's
diﬃcult to give you a sort of company rule and say, well, it's like this and this, and it will be
like that. And the other thing which is very important is whether you're talking about a
legal quote business or not. Because if it is legal quote business, then of course, you're
trying to see it in a way that it is as shareholder-friendly as possible. And sometimes, you
have to calculate around some corners and the result might look funny.
Now, you're additional question was, when will it become free again? And sometimes, it
happens even now. Because, for example, we have recalculated a conversion rates in the
group life business in Switzerland (16:41) for the extra-mandatory part. And that created
some of the extra proﬁts which we have seen in the second half of 2015. So, therefore, it's
not just the one way road, but it is – I mean, the book of the traditional businesses is so
big and so long-running, if you're just thinking about the running in unities, that I think we
will not be together at the telephone when we don't have to – if interest rates are going
further down so what we don't hold (17:22).

But if we don't have any portfolio risks, that can potentially be re-reserved, at least that's
my opinion, without having calculated it. But Martin, maybe you have additional
comments.

FINAL

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

Well, from the management side, I can only add that the situation is, of course as
described by Michael Huttner or by Bischof in the beginning that we had declining
interest rates. So, it's a little bit similar to last year. But if we have to add up to the reserves,
we also have with the declining interest rates. We have the possibility to do so. So, that's
the good news. That's one side.
And the other side is, while the reserving is always according to the risk free rate, we have
on the investment side, we have diﬀerent possibilities. And in the ﬁrst quarter, the spreads
have rather increased. So, what you're trying to do is, you to take advantage of that and
still with good quality, but trying to get a little bit of that increased spread into the
recurrent income and with the risk-free investments being able to cover the reserves.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay. But, so I'm just a little bit confused. Does it mean that we could actually have a
positive, because you're got this in the accounting, right? So, the IFRS you would – we
would see the gains, but we wouldn't necessarily see the extra reserving, or am I making it
up or am I being too optimistic?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

No. It's normally for the direct link. It's a sort of the question how you work in latency. I
give you one example which I have just in present (19:24). In Belgium, you have in local
GAAP a funny thing called the fund for future appropriations. You can do whatever you
like with it. So, put money in, put money out. Now, and we have this regime about local
reserving, which is called (19:50) reserve. So if we do the (19:55) reserve, it can well be
that to provide the money, you have to realize gains. But, in fact, in local GAAP, we can
take it from the fund of future appropriations. That means in local GAAP, it might be more
or less neutral and in IFRS you see the gains. But in fact, of course, we have put the
reserves in, but maybe two years ago. So that makes it complicated, too, and that's just for
Belgium, in Luxembourg (20:31) Switzerland as well.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

But that's just as an example why it's not so easy.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Not so easy. Okay. Well, I'm glad I'm (20:39) and not the CFO. Thank you.

Right. Yes. No, no. That's very clear. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Operator
The next question is from Mr. Stefan Schürmann from Bank Vontobel. Please go ahead.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Yes. I have two questions. The ﬁrst one is on the duration gap. Can you update – on this
one, I see that the average duration of portfolio has increased by almost a year to 8.9
years, so I assume that the gap for liabilities and assets are more as close now that it
means you expect the interest rates will remain low.
And the second one just a small one on the German life run-oﬀ deal which you made last
year, I see that was, I think CHF 2.6 billion (21:29) of reserves oﬀ, but average technical
interest rate in the life book remained unchanged at 3.3%. That's right.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Okay. Maybe to the ﬁrst question, I can tell you that indeed, we have lowered the duration
gap. Overall, you see that also in the interest rate sensitivity that has been coming down
quite substantially. I don't think we have closed this completely, because you see what
we've done from the investment side, of course, is that we rolled up the yield curve due to
the negative yields at the beginning of the curve and to still positive at the latter side. We
rolled it up and so, it's actually good if you still have a little duration gap where you can
do that, because once you're fully matched, you couldn't do that anymore. So, I wouldn't
say the duration gap is fully closed. We are probably still around one year to one-and-ahalf years.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Okay. Good.

Operator
The next question is from Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two from me today. Firstly, just going back
to capital returns. I was just wondering if you could give us any insight into what the
headroom on the statutory payout ratio basis would be. I know it's getting tight on IFRS
and cash. So, I'm just wondering what is the binding constraint there.

Page 8 of 22



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG

And then, thinking about the non-life business, I was just wondering if you could run us
through brieﬂy what the pricing trends and the claims inﬂation trends are that you're
seeing in each of your key country markets. That would be very interesting. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Well, let me try to describe the pricing situation in the diﬀerent countries and then get
back to the ﬁrst part of the question and I'll leave it to the colleagues.
I think the pricing situation overall – and I'm not going to give the details per country – but
overall, what you see is that the competition is increasing and the price pressure is
increasing in the diﬀerent countries. It depends a bit on the level of intensity. But we see
everywhere in the non-life business throughout our countries, in Europe, we see indeed a
tougher game in terms of pricing. Be it both in the retail business and be it in the SME
and the industry-related business.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

For the ﬁrst question, can you put the question again, because we haven't quite got it.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, sure. So, I guess – it's interesting to look at your payout ratio on an IFRS basis, which
is just under 50%. But I was just wondering what the payout from statutory earnings is as
well, whether or not it's more (24:27) of a constraint.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Yeah. We could actually be the real thing. (24:31) I'll answer it later. I have to calculate it.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Thanks.

The next question is from In-Yong Hwang from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Hello. Two questions from me, both on non-life. Firstly on your expense ratio. Most of the
reduction in the expense ratio seems to be from the acquisition cost rather than on
operating costs. So, given the ongoing cost reduction you have in Germany, could you
just give us your outlook for what you expect to happen to this going forward?
Secondly on the long-term disability claim (25:12) I think the diﬀerence between the
stated combined ratio in your presentation and the claims number on your IFRS accounts,
that seems to have decreased signiﬁcantly since 2013. Should the current level be
assumed to be continuing going forward? Thank you.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

FINAL

I mean, ﬁrst on the expense ratio, the expense ratio in non-life is indeed going down. It's
driven by diﬀerent countries, Germany, certainly. As I said, we've brought the cost ratio
down by 1.2% by a variety of measures and of course also the reduction of full-time
equivalents. It's also driven in Belgium where actually the same has happened.
I don't think it's – I don't know the details, but I don't think it's on acquisition cost, it's
actually the gross reductions are material on the administration costs. We have growth in
Belgium which is actually driven by – we have growth and actually stable acquisition costs.
So, I think, certainly on administration part. Germany going forward, we still have the – the
cost program and the optimization program is still outstanding. So, we will further work
on reducing the cost levels in Germany. You come to the average benchmark of the
German market.
The long-term disability, I didn't get really – I didn't get the question or at least maybe you
can repeat the question about the long-term disability.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. So, I understand that the diﬀerence between the claims number on your IFRS
accounts and the stated number in your presentation, your claims ratio, arises from
employed (27:05) cost of long-term disability claims which is included in one but not the
other. But that seems to have gone down substantially since 2013. So, I was wondering
whether this current low level is a sustainable level.

A - Marc Kaiser

{BIO 15056036 <GO>}

This is Marc. This is Marc speaking. In-Yong (27:30). Maybe to answer your question, I
think your question is, if you recalculate the combined ratio according to our disclosed
numbers, so, it's always a little bit of gap between what we disclosed and the ﬁgures you
have there. And you are referring to the annuities we have out of the accident business.
And because (27:51) and the gap there is actually more or less pretty stable all the past
years. But we can get back to you by phone and clarify that. You have there the details.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

I think I know what you mean. I think this is the legal yield you have to put on annuity
reserves in Belgium and in Switzerland, and that is producing a systematic previous year
loss.

A - Marc Kaiser

{BIO 15056036 <GO>}

This is it. We have the details (28:21) we'll get back to you about that.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

The next question is from Ralph Hebgen from KBW. Please go ahead sir.

FINAL

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Ralph Hebgen from KBW. I've got three things and they all relate to the life book
or the life business. Starting oﬀ, I've noticed in the life MCEV accounting that your
earnings unwind from in-force was very strong indeed in 2015. It will help us, I think if you
could illustrate the driving forces behind that increase, especially whether these dynamics
are sustainable into the future or whether that perhaps were driven by eﬀects which are
more isolated in nature. So, that's the ﬁrst point.
Number two relates to slide 10 where you helpfully (29:40) outlined the analysis by source
(29:43) Just relating that to the risk result which was CHF 240 million in 2015 and CHF 213
million in 2014. Just asking these two numbers there, are they relatively clean or are they
also supported by any one-oﬀs or any gains harvesting? What I wish to just see is whether
that's a very strong increase here, whether that increase again is pure and then perhaps a
sustainable in the future.
And the last thing I wanted to ask is, you have the sort of guidance that your EBIT in life is
going to be around CHF 200 million. Do you conﬁrm that guidance for the future or not?
Or if not, under what circumstances would you see the need to reduce this guidance.
Thank you very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Let me maybe start with the last question on the life result and the expected result in EBIT
going forward. If you look at the strong life result in 2015, it's mainly driven by two
reasons. First one is that in the ﬁrst semester, the ﬁrst half year, we did a number of clearly
additional reserving given the lower interest environment. But in the second year, as there
although interests have gone – dropped also by the end of the year, interest rates have
gone up again. And that means that we didn't have to reserve as much as in the ﬁrst half
year in the second semester. And that's why the second semester result was so good in
life.
The second reason, something that Chairman already alluded to, (31:39) reserve or the
ﬂashing light reserve in Belgium which is a regulatory requirement and where we have to
realize gains in order to fulﬁll that requirement. Those are the two major reasons why our
life reserve is up to CHF 270 million plus. If you would normalize it out of those two
eﬀects, we would, indeed, be in the area of CHF 200 or just below the CHF 200 million.
German, may be adding to that.

Yeah. Well, ﬁrst for the risk result, that is the only thing that comes to my mind, which has
sort of one-oﬀ character, was the change in biometric basis in the group life business in
Switzerland what I already mentioned in the extra-mandatory business, so conversion
rates mainly. And that has, of course for mortality and inﬂuence. I think the eﬀect was CHF
20 million to CHF 30 million, something like this.

FINAL

Then in the MCEV on life (32:55) I mean, operationally, we did a couple of improvements.
You see that in the cost development as well. Then there were a couple of management
decisions like they just mentioned conversion rates and the duration on the active side
has been increased. So, that are probably the most important factors that have led to the
higher earnings.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Just two quick follow-ups. You mentioned the CHF 20 million
to CHF 30 million impact in the risk result. Was this positive or negative impact in 2015?

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Positive. It's probably around the CHF 30 million (33:44). I think about it.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Yes. Indeed. And so that was a positive impact there. In 2014, any distorting impact in the
risk result of a similar nature?

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

I can't remember at the moment. I have to think about it. Come back to it later. (34:10)
answer to the payout ratio on local step basis. That's about 58% without the share
buyback.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

And can I just have one more follow-up. What I meant with my third question is whether
your guidance that's CHF 200 million EBIT in life, will be a sustainable number going
forward. This particular guidance, do you conﬁrm this today?

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well, from what we know at the moment, yes.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay. And what would the circumstances be which would perhaps urge you to lower that
guidance?

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well, let's say a massive interest rate movement, be it up or down. And massive regulatory
changes. Anything like this.

The next question is from Farquhar Murray from Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just two questions from me both with regards to ALM.
(35:34). Firstly, on the duration gap, could you just elaborate on the rationale for reducing
that now after having capital position opened for quite long? Is that a change in view or
does it reﬂect the shift in the SST model towards the standard formula (35:49) manage
capital?
And then, secondly, the speech refers to liquidity management challenges, could you just
detail what precisely those are? Is that just reinvesting into a very low rate or something
more than that? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Okay. For the ﬁrst question – I just can repeat myself or explain that, I think there was the
opportunity last year because of the negative yields of quite substantial duration bond or
maturity bonds that were in negative territory. We had the chance to get rid of paper that
has a negative yield and invest into paper that has a positive yield. And at the same time
realizing the gains, the proﬁts that were necessary to fund the reserves.
Third, it was basically a market position to do so while the interest rate or the running
yield we have been able to have a good situation in going into other currencies, because
currency is the second eﬀect that was, let's say, a second order eﬀect of the decision of
the Swiss National Bank. Due to that decision and the substantial increased cost of
hedging, euro denominated bonds for Swiss investments were simply not attractive
anymore. They had also a negative yield beyond the yield they have in the market in
Europe, because of the high hedging cost. So, we switched from euro into U.S. dollar and
we're taking advantage as I said of the yield curve that was still higher at the later end. So,
it was an economic decision to do so.
The second question was the liquidity management. I mean, the biggest impact was that
we got risk of liquidity. We were carrying something between CHF 1 billion and CHF 2
billion in cash usually to – for our needs. And given the negative interest rates, we were
cutting that down to almost zero. We can do that, because we have a repo agreement
with the Swiss National Bank, so I can get liquidity at all time for the operational need and
I'm just at the level of new liquidity and time and so I am also not hit by the negative
interest rate.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Just little follow-on on that, I mean, in terms of the shift towards a standard model, I
mean, how much does that change the way you've been managing the funds so far and
how much pressure does that put on the kind of headline ratio that we're kind of looking
at?

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

We wouldn't have at the moment. I mean, frankly spoken, we have no calculation in the
standard model for the whole group at the moment. It's just that we have signal that it
goes that direction . Depends a bit with whom you're speaking, but I mean somehow, the
whole thing has to be comparable and currently it isn't. And that – so, we will see what's
happening. And it might well be that certain constellation or certain decisions are then
taken a bit diﬀerently.
Even though, I think at the moment, what was the idea of the (39:26) behind it is that the
steering (39:32) is according to an internal model that the regulation is somehow ﬁxed on
the standard model. So, that's the diﬀerence to the idea we used that was always sort of
postulated there in the past.

The next question is from René Locher for MainFirst Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - René Locher
Yes. Thank you. And good morning, good afternoon to all of you. First on slide 9, the
Swiss combined ratio of 83.2%. You mentioned in the video presentation that Swiss NonLife business beneﬁted from low level of claims, and I guess a healthy PYD. So, simple
question is the Swiss combined ratio current level is this something sustainable, or do we
actually anticipate a little bit higher more again to that 85% or 86% level? That's my ﬁrst
question.
And then second question on slide 31, still looking on these German business because I
guess the outgoing CEO promised us an EBIT of some CHF 100 million sooner or later. So
I was just wondering a little bit where the uplift should come when compared to last year.
The life business in Germany decreased from CHF 35 million to CHF 20 million and the
non-life business improved from CHF 46 million to CHF 53 million. Now, I got quite a lot
of information, like the 6.6 percentage points lodged claims. But if I deduct it from the 107,
I would end up some of that 100%. So, is it fair to assume that the understanding quality
of the German portfolio is not as good as it should be? And here again, I remember that
an old target was some 94% to 96% combined ratio.

FINAL

And then, the third question is on slide 39, slide 41. It's the Swiss Group life business. So,
very simple question, the guarantees on the extra-mandatory is 0.75%. So that's the ﬁrst
question. And then on slide 41, there you can see quite a sharp drop in the average
guarantee in the Swiss Group business from 180 to 140. And I was just wondering if you
could explain a bit more, or if you can split it between the reserve strengthening, lower
guarantees business mix? Thank you.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Well, I'll try to answer at least partially some of the questions. Coming back ﬁrst to the
combined ratio in Switzerland, we do believe it is sustainable. It's an outstanding
performance, of course. But I think by focusing on our target customer management and
our operational excellence for the last decade, we have been able to outperform the
market every time. We are also continuously working on the quality of the non-life
portfolio in Switzerland as in the other countries and where we don't have proﬁtable
business, we actually take the necessary action. So we're growing and proﬁtable, and we
are actually changing if we need in less proﬁtable. So going forward, it's indeed the
combined ratio Switzerland should be sustainable.

Bloomberg Transcript

Germany, I've alluded to that before. It is a diﬃcult market, that is true. The optimization
program is running. Costs are going down and growth in the target segments is coming
where we want it in non-life and in life. But it is true that the quality of the non-life book is
not suﬃcient and we need to further work on improving that one by looking even deeper
into the industry book of business, and on the other hand, by increasing the growth in the
retail and the SME business branches because they are proﬁtable.
I'm looking around to see which colleagues can actually add to this and provide
somewhat more detail.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well, now I think you've said the essential (44:25) thing. I mean I know you said we
promised certain target (44:31). I mean nowadays, you'd probably say it's not related
(44:42). About the mix, life, non-life, this is not to over-interpret. I was just looking, I think
in the previous year we have realized quite a lot out on the life book and that was the
reason that disrupt (45:05) on the life side. But the mix between life and non-life that to a
certain degree that's accidental as well of course. And I think that is not an indication of a
systematic change in the business mix as far as I see.
And in Germany, of course, we have the same situation that I explained before. With
Belgium, you have on the local have this (45:26-45:40) and then you have a a weak
portfolio (45:43) business. So therefore, it might look funny sometimes on the IFRS side
even if the legal (45:56) thing was quite normal.

Q - René Locher
No, but – very quick (46:00) I mean you have roughly CHF 700 million German non-life
premiums now. Now if you achieve CHF 100 million, that would – yeah, 7% on this CHF

Page 15 of 22



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG

Date: 2016-03-22

700 million, that would add CHF 49 million to the EBIT level. So what I was just asking a
little bit more is that the uplift in the German EBIT should come from the non-life business.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. Basically, yes. I mean the German life business is to a large extent, a traditional
business as well.

Q - René Locher
Okay. And just on the group life, the slide 39 and 41.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

The mixture there, the average technical rate includes already the lowered BVG rate to
1.25% in the mandatory part and 0.75% in the over mandatory part. So that is about how
the mixture is composed.

Q - René Locher
But I think that also beneﬁted from reserve strengthening you took in H1 2015, I guess.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Yes. That's true.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - René Locher
Okay. Okay. And just a follow-up. I remember that you always mentioned that you would
like to have an extra dividend at holding level. And I was just wondering where we stand
these days.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Yeah. Sorry. The question was about the dividend, whether we have retained earnings.

Q - René Locher
Yeah. I remember that you always mentioned or that you would like to have an extra

FINAL

Yes. Hi. Thanks for letting me on the call again. So three more things, if I may. One is – and
apologies if perhaps you have answered this already. I wasn't on the call all the time. It's in
Germany, the industrialized business in the P&C segment. I noticed you had to strengthen
reserves again this year, and that's an ongoing requirement. But perhaps could you sort of
add some explanation on the dynamics there, for how long do you expect that reserve in
requirement is going to be ongoing?
And number two is just a quick numbers question. I wonder whether – if it's possible for
you to share with us the amount of cash that was actually remitted to the holding.
And third, going back to the guidance question which we discussed, I remember you
lowered your guidance from the range of CHF 200 million to CHF 250 million to a spot
200 CHF million I think in 2014. What were the drivers for that decision to lower the
guidance in 2014? Thank you very much.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And maybe going back to the ﬁrst question about the industry business in Germany. As I
told you, the quality of the non-life book and especially the industry business in Germany
is not satisfactory. And that is why we actually are looking into it deeper now on a riskbased level, on a contract-by-contract based level, on a client-by-client based level in
order to get the improvement in there. And we expect this to last at least another one to
two years before we can actually stabilize and improve the quality of the non-life industry
business in Germany.
On the cash – on the second and the third question. The third question is diﬃcult for me
because I was not here at the time. So I leave that to the colleagues and I'll see to the
second question what comes out of it.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well, the third question was that – the reason was actually the movement of the interest
rates. Because there we have seen the trend in (52:17). It's a bit like the question we had
just at the beginning of the call today. It's about – if it's going on like this, it's probably
rather closer in the 200 and 250. Because for 250, we need at least favorable interest
rates or even rising interest rates. And in 2013, we have good reason that interest rates
could actually go up to a certain extent. About the cash ﬂow to the holding, I mean, you
see just the holding. You see that the local closing in the holding in the ﬁnancial report.
Apart from that we don't really do a cash ﬂow reporting. And if we did that that would be
sort of a change in policy which could be this half that's probably a good idea, but then
we have to drop a couple of other things, and that's the reason I think.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay, that's ﬁne. But perhaps just on that. I think in the past you sort of indicated that the
businesses other than life sort of remitted close to 100% up to the holding...

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Page 18 of 22



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG
Company Ticker: BALN SW Equity
Date: 2016-03-22

Yeah.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

FINAL

All right. So, that's correct. And if there was a bottleneck that would be basically the life
business. I mean that sort of interpretation is broadly indiscernible (53:51).

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Yeah. No, no. That's still true. With the attachment, what I said before that of course,
where you have in between holdings like for example, in Luxembourg, and that
sometimes you look that you'll have the optimal mix for loans – internal loans you have
and tax situations and that sort of things.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

So there are a couple of intercompany eﬀects that are in there as well. And the other thing
is, of course that it's not only dividends that come up to the holding, it is other things as
well.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. As in loan interest and internal loans and reinsurance and things like that.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Exactly. Advisory fees, that sort of things. I mean, as probably the look-through – the lookthrough component in the MCV gives you an ID what kind of cash is from the life business
coming to the holding as well.

FINAL

large claims which are now being stable and yet – and in your presentation and then the
comments and discussion, one of the issues is the large claims are speciﬁcally in
Germany. But at the group level, it seems absolutely ﬁne. So I'm kind of trying to weigh up
in my mind if you improve Germany, does it mean that the rest will worsen to keep that
ratio roughly where it is?
And the other on the prior year, eﬀectively I'm trying to home in on the Germany a bit –
the prior year, I have in mind that the run rate, normal run rate is about 1.5%. Is that right,
or should it be closer to 2%? Yeah it's – and ﬁnally on Germany, so you explained and
everywhere, you explained the pressure on pricing, but the feeling I have is that claims
remain quite benign, or am I wrong? I was thinking thanks to low inﬂation and mild winter
and whatever. Thank you – in Q1 2016 of course?

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

I think if you look at the overall group, it is true that indeed 2015 has been a year without
major large claims on a group level. So the claim situation in 2015 on a group level is
certainly satisfactory, exception made of course for Germany. Now, if Germany will
improve which is absolutely of course the intent, would the rest actually worsen? The
answer is no. I don't – Germany is not the benchmark in terms of the cost ratio or the,
sorry the claims ratio – it's into the other countries that are setting the benchmark, of
course.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the second question about the 1.5% and the 2%, I didn't fully get that one.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

The prior year – you call it PYLD, prior-year loss development.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Yeah. Prior year loss development.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

I was just wondering what's the normal run rate here.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

That's a bit diﬃcult to give an indication there because if in an ideal world, it won't be nil.
And of course, it isn't normally. And now, we said the experience is actually between 1%
and 2% now. It was even higher in the past. But the reason there was the whiplash
reserves from Switzerland and because the law and decisions have changed there. But
that's calm now, so that's why it's going to be a bit lower, I guess between 1% and 2%.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay. That's perfect. And then just on Q1 trends, you said pricing is tough but I got the
impression maybe from speaking with your peers that claims actually is very low as well. Is
that fair?

Maybe I can shortly summarize then the key points and then come to an end of the call.
Again, I think in 2015, we have proven some very solid results in line with the
expectations, in line with what we have delivered over the last decade. The CHF 512
million is what we think upon or slightly above the market expectation, healthy growth of
3.3%, excellent combined ratio of 93% which is the second best since (59:13) the second
best ever, probably, because – and then, also in the life business, especially by the solid
risk products and solid proﬁt.
So we are overall absolutely satisﬁed with 2015 and absolutely committed to continue this
