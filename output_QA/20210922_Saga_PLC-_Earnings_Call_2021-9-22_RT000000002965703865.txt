Operator
Hello, and welcome to the SAGA Plc 2021 Interim Results Analyst and Investor Q&A. My
name is Boyka, and I'll be the chorus operator for today. There will be an opportunity for
Q&A later in the call. (Operator Instructions)
For now, I would like to hand over to Euan Sutherland. So, Euan, please go ahead.

Euan Sutherland
Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for taking time to join
me on today's Q&A call. I'm joined today by James Quin, our CFO. I'm sure you have
seen our result statement and video this morning, but I'll do a quick run through of the
ﬁrst half highlights before handing over to questions.
It's been a period of continued progress and delivery against the priorities that we laid
out 12 months ago as we position the business to emerge stronger from the COVID
pandemic. We have made continued progress across the group and have further
strengthened SAGA in ﬁnancial, operational and strategic terms.
The results are in line with expectations driven by a robust performance in insurance and
a successful return to crews. Taking insurance to deliver positive results across all key
metrics, maintaining motor and home policy growth, while improving margin and

retention rates. We look forward to welcoming Steve Kingshott, our new Insurance CEO
who joins us in November.
As for travel, we've successfully proven our ability to reintroduce a safe and compelling
crews' oﬀer, including the launch of our new ship, Spirit of Adventure. While capacity
restrictions remained on early sailings, and we were limited to cruising around Britain, we
achieved a strong set of cruise metrics in the ﬁrst half. We carried over 3,000 guests with
per diems at over GBP294, while monthly burn costs were lower than guidance at GBP5.9
million per month, and very high customer satisfaction levels.
Pleasingly, in the ﬁrst half, customer demand was greater than our supply, demonstrating
customer conﬁdence in our proposition, and as we returned to international cruising at
the beginning of half two. A particular learning has been that shorter Round Britain
cruising has been a hugely popular product for ﬁrst-time cruisers, and this is something
that we will build into itinerary planning for the future.
Across SAGA, our strategic focus on delivering the required data, digital and brand
transformation has continued with all programs on track for delivery in half two. These are
incredibly important foundations in the resetting of our business for future growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

We've also continued to support our colleagues and the community across our business
and have been shortlisted for the for the UK's best mental health strategy at the National
EBA Awards. All of this progress has been underpinned by a further strengthening of our
ﬁnancial position with the issuance of a new GBP250 million bond, which has improved
liquidity and providing greater ﬂexibility for the business for today and for the future.
We're still mindful that there is still some uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic. We
are emerging stronger from the pandemic than we went in. And looking ahead, we plan
to relaunch our brand and our business in the coming months and I'm conﬁdent that we
are well set to return Saga to sustainable growth and create signiﬁcant long-term value for
all shareholders in the future.
So with that, I'm taking a pause and hand over to Q&A which is the main business of this
call. We're happy to take your questions.

Hi. Good morning, everybody. I've got a few questions. I'll ask a couple ﬁrst and then
maybe come back later. But just to kick oﬀ.

A - Euan Sutherland

FINAL

Hi.

Q - Nick Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Hi. Can you just say how much of tours revenue bookings for next year of GBP109 million
relates to postponed bookings from prior to COVID? And how much of that number is
actual new bookings?
And secondly, on insurance pricing, how does the rate being paid by three-year ﬁxed
customers who took out those ﬁxed price policies a few years ago? How does the rate
that they're paying now compare to the current market rates? And will there be a sort of
reset downwards of the rate for those customers once the three-year ﬁxed expire? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Euan Sutherland
Great. Thanks, Nick. A couple of good questions to kick us oﬀ. Let me try and provide
some color around the ﬁrst one, then perhaps pass over to James for more detail on
three-year ﬁxed. Broadly, retention as we reported before in both cruise and tour ops has
been strong. Through the last 18 months, we've retained a lot of customer loyalty through
that period with higher in Cruise about 70% of retained bookings being pushed forward.
It's around the 40%, 45% of bookings in general terms for tour operations. So that will
have ﬁltered through and underpinned the numbers that we are reporting in terms of
forward guidance for tours.
Clearly, the relaxation of the restrictions around red, amber, green at the weekend is
encouraging more ﬁrst time bookers to come back onto our tour operations business.
We've seen a step up over the weekend of interest, but too early to call some of those
very recent trends. But it is true to say that the numbers in 2022 are supported by loyal
customers retaining their money with us, but more in Cruise than on tour ops. Well that
help to give you some color there. On the three-year ﬁxed point, James, do you want to
update on that?

A - James Quin

{BIO 18345789 <GO>}

Yep. Thanks, Nick. So on the three-year ﬁxed pricing, so as customers renew this year. So
we have -- we haven't been through a full cycle of sort of the policies being renewed at
the end of the three-year period. So the people who're renewing now are essentially
either ﬁrst-year renewals or second-year renewals. And in terms of what they are paying,
they are obviously paying the ﬂat price that they started paying at the beginning of their
product. So that is essentially, what we haven't done is, we haven't started cutting price on
three-year ﬁxed at all.
The -- in terms of retention, retention has been extremely good on three-year ﬁxed. So
we're very pleased that. I think the point you are making is, what will they pay at renewal?
Page 3 of 16

FINAL

When those policies essentially have run the course of the three-year ﬁxed and they
hopefully buy a new policy. The price they will pay then will be the new business price
since all of that will be post the market study and obviously, post-market study what you
will pay in renewal will be exactly the same as what you would pay for a new business
price. So that would be the price that they'll start paying from April next year onwards
which is when the sort of the ﬁrst lot of, the ﬁrst tranche, if you like the three-year ﬁxed
customers will start to renew brand new policies.
So that answer your question.

Q - Nick Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Yes, that's really helpful. Just I was wondering if you have a sense for -- obviously, most of
the pricing in particular has moved quite a bit up and down since you started selling
three-year ﬁxed price policies. Just wondering if you have a sense for where market
pricing is now compared to where it was when customers ﬁrst started taking out threeyear ﬁxed price policies.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Euan Sutherland
Yes, you're right. So pricing did go up a bit in the ﬁrst year. So if you bought that policy in
2019, yeah, they couldn't, price would have probably gone up a bit then it would have
come down a bit as well. We have been reasonably cautious on our pricing of three-year
ﬁxed though because we're very conscious of the fact that we're writing a policy for three
years, not for one year. So in terms of the sort of the current new business price you would
get on three-year ﬁxed. We've only essentially take into account an assumption that you
will get a lower price for one year rather than three years. So if for example, the new
business price was down 10%, we would -- we wouldn't put the three year price down
10%. We would put it down the third of that. So what that -- what you would see therefore
is that the new business pricing on three-year ﬁxed is a bit more stable than the pricing on
one year policies. So well that also then means is that it shouldn't be quite such a big
impact when those customers come to renew next year.

Q - Nick Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Okay. Yeah, that is -- that's clear. That's very helpful. Thanks very much. That's all from me
for now. Thank you.

A - James Quin

{BIO 18345789 <GO>}

Yeah, just the other part I'm going to make is, obviously that there are a lot of other
considerations around pricing post market study, particularly for those customers who
switch from one-year contracts onto three-year ﬁxed, but that's probably going beyond
the scope of your question.

Q - Nick Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Thanks very much. Thank you.

FINAL

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We now have the next question from Ben Cohen from
Investec. So Ben, please go ahead.

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

Yes, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question.

A - Euan Sutherland
Hi Ben.

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

I guess that there were two things that I wanted to ask. Firstly, how quickly do you think
that you can get to your target load factors and start to get to the sort of target run rate of
the GBP40 million per ship per year given the various headwinds that you're facing?

Bloomberg Transcript

And I suppose the second question is really a similar question for tour. And maybe you
can just remind us actually what you are trying to achieve in tour, because it would seem
from the statement today that you're sort of maybe a little bit less clear in terms of really
where you're going to get to with that division? Thanks.

A - Euan Sutherland
Thanks, Ben. So, yeah, I think this is a period of two halves as we look forward in the next
couple of months or so. I think what we're seeing is, it's just a little bit longer to fully come
out of the pandemic issues largely impacted by national issues and government policy
around everything from the booster jab through to the clarity of the international travel
requirements for passengers, which has really helped our cruise business because it takes
UK and door-to-door. So that's why we're seeing very strong demand and underpinning a
faster start there and a slightly slower start in tour operations.
If you look ahead to the target load factors, and then talk about the target GBP40 million
EBITDA per ship. We're very conﬁdent on both of those metrics coming through. In the
medium term, if you look at the ﬁrst half of 2022 season, we're already at 80% load factor
for the ﬁrst half, 60% load factor for the entire year, next year, we're looking 18 months
ahead. We are carrying a little bit higher cost into that because our commitment has
always been and will always be to fully protect all guests and crew on board. So we are
continuing with our COVID based protocols. Everything from the VIP transport from your
house to the ship for an individual household rather than mixing households through to
more protection around shore excursions, several medical teams, et cetera.
We haven't had to use them all in force because we haven't had the instances of COVID
on board that we -- that would fully test those, but it's a sensible precaution. So therefore,

Page 5 of 16



Company Name: Saga PLC
Company Ticker: SAGA LN Equity
Date: 2021-09-22

FINAL

very conﬁdent in the load factor coming through in the beginning of next year which
would support the GBP40 million EBITDA.
We are carrying a little bit of cost into the next half of this second half, which we will be
able to remove when it's sensible probably through the early part of the ﬁrst half of next
year. So that then gives us more conﬁdence that we have restated today that the GBP40
million EBITDA per ship is more than doable. Of course on top of that, we're seeing very
healthy per diem. So that the per diem when the business case supporting the GBP40
million EBITDA per ship are lower than where we are today for the second half and lower
than where we are seeing the numbers coming from next year. So there is an upside from
very strong per diems through the cruise proposition. So hope that gives you a bit of
color on the conﬁdence there.
On tours. Yes, you're right. We are -- we completely reset that business within the period
of the COVID hibernation. We're coming back out to the market with that now. We're
conﬁdent in the new proposition. We are just waiting to see the full volume coming
through, much more encouraged by the bookings that we're seeing already for early
2022. And as we said today, there -- it's just taking our customers a few more weeks
probably rather than signiﬁcant months to get back into the conﬁdence for international
travel through international airports, et cetera. But conﬁdence in the reset of that business
clearly, it's a much lower contributor to proﬁtability than cruise.

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

Okay. Great. I'll leave it there and maybe follow up if there's time later. Thank you.

A - Euan Sutherland
Okay, thanks.

Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Philip Crate of Altana Wealth. So, Philip, please
go ahead when you're ready.

Q - Philip Crate

{BIO 18074771 <GO>}

Hello, good morning. Number of my questions have been answered. I just got a few. The
ﬁrst is, I missed, in terms of the load factor, did you say load factor for next year, for full
year was 60%? The next question relates to cash burn. We note that the cash burn rate
came in below your expectations. Would you expect to see that continue to decrease as
load factors improve? And lastly, I wonder if you could provide some context in terms of
CapEx? We've been looking at CapEx guidance, sorry, CapEx numbers on Bloomberg,
and it seems to be signiﬁcantly higher than guidance. So I just wonder if you can conﬁrm
CapEx guidance for this year and next year. Thank you.

A - Euan Sutherland

Company Name: Saga PLC
Company Ticker: SAGA LN Equity
Date: 2021-09-22

Great. Excellent and happy to do that. So importantly, the 60% load factor for next year is
where we are today. So clearly, we still have the rest of this year and all of next year to sell
that load factor. So we would naturally expect that to rise as we're selling through cruises,
typically we'll get to the end of January with about 80% of the following year sold where
we're heading this year is to exceed that. So by the time we start eﬀectively the next
ﬁnancial year, we would expect a normal year to be 80% sold. We're well on track and
indeed ahead of that forecast. So it's just a snapshot of where we are for future load
factors as it looks today. Hopefully that helps. Cash burn, yeah, very much more healthy
position for that and CapEx as well. James, you want to pick up on those two?

A - James Quin

{BIO 18345789 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. The cash burn -- cash burn is sort of a relevant metric when the ships are not
operating. I think as they are operating, it sort of ceases to be meaningful because
obviously we would expect quite positive and signiﬁcantly positive cash ﬂows. And in fact,
even with load factor for the second half, we'd still be cash positive. So I'm not planning
to talk about cash burn again unless we have to put these ships into suspension mode
again, which we don't think will happen. So I hope this is the last time I ever have to talk
about cash burn.
CapEx, I'm not sure what's on Bloomberg. Sometimes I think people do include the ships
in CapEx, which is one way of looking at it. That wouldn't be the way I would look at it. But
the CapEx guidance, I'm not sure we really given much guidance, but it's -- I would say
that the CapEx that you see in our operating cash ﬂow statement which is the CapEx and
this doesn't include essentially the sort of ring-fenced diﬀerences. But there will be small
consumers of CapEx anyway. So the CapEx would probably be somewhere in the region
of about GBP20 million a year. So that's essentially the sort of group and insurance
CapEx.
In terms of Cruise. There's a little bit of CapEx that you would expect in any one year, but
certainly nothing very much for the next few years given that no dry-docks or anything like
that in the ﬁrst few years of operation.

Q - Philip Crate

{BIO 18074771 <GO>}

Okay, that's clear. Thank you. I'll join the queue.

{BIO 19956412 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi Euan, hi James. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, just on reserve releases. I think
at the trading update you suggested that they're going to remain sort of elevated for the
ﬁrst half of the year. But then you also, I think in the presentation, said that you've got a
partial release of prudent revisions here from last year. So, is that sort of an indication that
we expect them to remain? And then secondly, just on the diems, they're very strong and
ahead of guidance, how sustainable do you view that in the current market?

A - Euan Sutherland
Great, thanks. I'll ask James to comment on the reserve releases point. I think we're pretty
conﬁdent -- very conﬁdent that the per diems are in the right place. It has been -- we
haven't particularly targeted taking price. We're certainly seeing that we've got strong
demand and strong load factors coming through. We're seeing customers not trading on
price at all, they are looking for reassurance, certainty, peace of mind. So, we have seen
that we've taken market share based on our commitment to those factors, and for
customers feeling very willing to trade a little bit of price for those beneﬁts.

Bloomberg Transcript

So therefore, we're conﬁdent into the outlook for per diems being ahead of plan in 2022,
2023 season, and indeed there's opportunity for us to further enhance our cruise oﬀer as
we fully come out of the pandemic. So we don't think it is something that is unsustainable.
But clearly, value for money is still incredibly important to us. We feel we're providing that
today and in future and customers are clearly seeing that value at the current per diems.
James, do you want to do a quick update on that?

A - James Quin

{BIO 18345789 <GO>}

Yes. You're right. I mean, I think the half-year signal that we'd expect some elevated
reserve releases for certainly this year. In terms of what we see in the ﬁrst half, that sort of
continues to be the case in terms of sort of ongoing reserve release emergence,
principally from our large loss assumptions which are quite conservative. So, historically
being very conservative. And then the other piece of it is that we were quite -- also quite
prudent on how we begin 2020 accident year. So we essentially took a sort of prudent
view around claim severity and other assumptions.
Now, six months on, trends have been pretty well behaved. And so we have released half
of that provision, so that's about GBP10 billion, and that is included within the reserve
releases in the ﬁrst half, and then we've still got the other half still in reserves as well. So,
for the second half, I think, we'd probably expect to see something that looks a bit like the
ﬁrst half. We're still pretty conservatively reserved. The reserve releases will start to go
down and they're deﬁnitely not going to continue the current levels forever, we've
probably still got a bit of favorable momentum there to take us into the ﬁrst half of next
year, I would say.

A - Euan Sutherland
Does that help with those points, Alex?

FINAL

Great. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. We now have another question from Leopold Bian from Tresidor. So, Leopold,
go ahead.

Q - Leopold Bian

{BIO 18978050 <GO>}

Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Three quick ones, if I may. Just as the ﬁrst one,
given the cash balances you now have in the balance sheet, do you plan to accelerate the
payments of the third portion of the cruise ship debt, the GBP52 million if I'm not
mistaken?

Bloomberg Transcript

Then second question, is it fair to say on cruises that if there are no restrictions next year in
terms of sailings, is your expectation that would be able the GBP40 million EBITDA per
ship already next year? And then the third question is just a broader question. The stock is
down sort of I think one-third since June, at the same time you restarted travel. I guess the
question is, what is that telling you? And if you have any plans to do anything about that?
That's it. Thank you very much.

A - Euan Sutherland
Hey, thank you. I'll ask James to talk about the signiﬁcant cash balances that we've got
and the ship debt. I guess that in the context of your question, if we are seeing a
completely unrestricted year for cruising next year, there's no reason why we cannot get
to the GBP40 million EBITDA per ship, where we're clearly at the mercy of governments
changing their views. We're seeing a steadily improving position, we are sailing
internationally. We're sailing very successfully internationally today, and we expect weekon-week and month-on-month for that situation to improve.
So, as we said in previous answer to the question, we're carrying a little bit more of
sensible precautionary cost to protect crew and guests on board today, but as restrictions
ease and the situation improves, clearly that cost pressure that temporarily goes into the
GBP40 million reduces pretty quickly too. So we're seeing positive on per diems, very
positive on load factors. Those are the major two numbers that go into driving the GBP40
million. So in an unrestricted year next year, yes, we're very conﬁdent in the cruise
proposition.
I guess a comment on the stock down a third, largely out of our control to be honest. I
think we're kind of at the mercy of headlines that are moving around, particularly in the
travel space. I think I would encourage all investors to look at the fact of our proposition,
and where we are winning an emerging stronger from the pandemic. Actually, I think you

Page 9 of 16



Company Name: Saga PLC
Company Ticker: SAGA LN Equity
Date: 2021-09-22

FINAL

would guess that I would say that I think that under values us in terms of the potential
coming out of this on a medium to longer term valuation point.
We're certainly seeing the strength coming through in our insurance business. We are
making the right investments around data, digital and brand. And those are coming
through very strongly in the second half in front of customers. And our travel businesses
are bouncing back pretty fast compared to competitors in both of those sectors. That's
underpinned by a target customer group that has been least economically impacted by
COVID that are feeling increasingly conﬁdent to travel internationally and have got the
money to do so.
So, I guess it is very diﬃcult for us to comment in detail on where the market is valuing us,
but we think that it's undervalued today. On the cash balances and ship debt, James?

A - James Quin

{BIO 18345789 <GO>}

Yes. So we certainly could pay oﬀ those cash at the obviously deferred elements on the
ship debt. And to be honest, we're not paying very much interest on it, so actually it's not
like there's a major incentive to do so. It's something I think we might think about doing
equally also it's not as if the terms of the ship debt deferrals are putting a lot of constraints
on what we cannot do.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we -- I mean, we can't pay a dividend until those deferred payments are made, but we
won't be paying a dividend anyway. So, I think there's no immediate pressure on us to do
that at all, it is probably something we might look at doing maybe next year.

A - Euan Sutherland
Does that help?

Q - Leopold Bian

{BIO 18978050 <GO>}

Yes, absolutely. Thank you very much, guys.

A - Euan Sutherland
Great. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. We have the next question from (inaudible) from Mirabaud Asset
Management. So (inaudible), please go ahead when you're ready.

Q - Analyst
Hello I just had two questions, please. In terms of your 2024 bonds, can you tell us when
we should expect those to start being redeemed? And also, how would that process
occur, should we expect it be a tender at par or we do open market exercise? And the
other, my last question is just on your cash balance, what is under normal operating
Page 10 of 16



Company Name: Saga PLC
Company Ticker: SAGA LN Equity
Date: 2021-09-22

conditions the minimum amount of cash you would want on your balance sheet? Thank
you.

A - Euan Sutherland

FINAL

Great. James, you want to pick up those two?

A - James Quin

{BIO 18345789 <GO>}

Yes. So the remaining amount on the 2024 bond we would expect to redeem at par when
it's essentially Q4 redemption. So that would probably be, I think the point at which we
could do that would be in the early 2024. I mean, if there's an opportunity to buyback
cheaply before then, I think that's something we might do. But that in ordinary course of
events we'd just let it run until redemption.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of the minimum amount of cash, we should look to hold that's been leased, we
clearly are not going to run the GBP175 million amount of cash. In the sense that it is -- it's
a lot more than we need. Clearly there are some sort of calls on that cash, notably I think
obviously the point that it just made around the ship that deferrals and the fact that we
have to cash those payments in upfront way. I think at the moment, it is probably still a
sensible policy for us to run with the lot of cash on the balance sheet to give ourselves a
bit of extra security through the next 12 months, given there are sort of less things that
could happen around COVID, but it makes sense for us to be protected from it, that's one
of the reason that we did see bond issue when we did it.
So, I think it's probably a question for us maybe in sort of 12 months' time, as we start to
obviously rally for COVID behind us and we will start to think about what's the size of the
cash balances that we'll run with. But long-term, we're not going to run with GBP175
million of cash, that is for sure.

Q - Analyst
Just two follow-ups on 2024 bond, but under your agreement with the RCF you must take
out those bond by 1 March of 2024, that's ahead of maturity clearly. And given that,
roughly the RCF becomes immediately due, so there is a clear agreement incentive for
you to take out the bonds prior to maturity. And the other thing within that, given that the
banks have a desire for the bonds to be taken out earlier, I would have thought there
would have been an incentive at the very least for goodwill towards the bank, to not wait
until the actual last moment or last required date to take out those bonds.

A - Euan Sutherland
Yes. So, you're right, certainly in the RCF, I mean, I think not surprisingly I think quite
reasonably. I think the banks were keen to essentially ensure that the duration of the -there was an incentive risk to repay the bond. I mean, we absolutely intend to do. I think
it's just a practical question for us. So I think if we start -- if we were to try and repay the
bond early, that's when we start to get into having some penalties involved. I think it's
from the 1st of February I think is the period or 1st of March, I can't remember which date
when we can redeem it without any penalty. So that would be sort of plan A if there is

Page 11 of 16



Company Name: Saga PLC
Company Ticker: SAGA LN Equity
Date: 2021-09-22

opportunity to redeem the bond a bit earlier, then I guess that's something we might do.
So, but certainly either way, we would redeem it at that point in March, if not before.

Q - Analyst

FINAL

Okay. So I can see that. So you'll use either the part call option or potentially you could
just kind of require to bondholders, and that would be no penalty to you.

A - Euan Sutherland
Yeah.

Q - Analyst
Yeah. And last thing in terms of just clariﬁcation on the minimum cash level. Should we
look at I guess pre-COVID levels to give an indication of where we can kind of guestimate
where, let's say, world becomes normal where cash could go?

A - Euan Sutherland
Yeah, I mean that's probably not a reasonable one. I mean, I think it certainly would be a
sensible thing for us to have cash on balance sheet at all times, probably supported by
some level of credit facility as a backstop as well. So, again, it's not something I've given a
lot of thought to, but probably somewhere in the region of GBP50 million of cash would
be a sort of sensible number on an ongoing basis.

Thank you. We now have a follow-up question from Ben Cohen from Investec. So Ben,
please go ahead when you're ready.

Q - Benjamin Cohen

{BIO 18668171 <GO>}

Hi there. Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask two things. Could you just give us a bit
more detail about the underlying cost inﬂation that you see in both parts of the business?
I guess, particularly on the insurance side in terms of claims trends as you see them, and
maybe as they've changed as COVID has moved behind. But then also just where are we
with cost pressures in tour and cruise and needing to match those? And also, I think you
made some reference to starting up and needing to stay ahead of that. And the second
question was, just on your readiness and your conﬁdence ahead of the rule changes for
the FCA, you're obviously not giving any kind of guidance as to the outlook, but may be
any color you could give in terms of your increased preparedness since you last updated?
Thank you.

Thanks Ben. Well, we're trying to cover all the aspects of the cost -- inﬂation and cost
pressures. First, I guess looking across the board, we've seen some shorter-term pressure
during the summer around some cost inﬂation and pressure in our claims operations
through the network. That network was suﬀering like the rest of the UK from the
pandemic, right, the way through to shortages in staﬀ. We've seen that in our call centers
as well as we ramp up, clearly we were ramping up both travel businesses from period of
hibernation, rehiring colleagues, frontline colleagues that's been more challenging than
we were expecting due to the national job situation that is evident across the country.
We're improving that now and largely getting back into where we need to be by the
middle of October. That has caused a bit of wage inﬂation, to be honest, but nothing that
is particularly signiﬁcant to the numbers. And in travel area, the only other areas of cost
inﬂation that we're seeing is around our crews, food supply, where we've seen some
inﬂation coming through but we need to take a bit of the hit because it's an all-inclusive
oﬀer. Again, not particularly signiﬁcant for the medium term, but we're seeing some shortterm pressures as the rest of the country is seeing, all within the bounds of the guidance
that we've said, so there's no need to adjust any numbers on that. Wider cost inﬂation
across insurance. James, you want to take on that?

{BIO 18345789 <GO>}

Yeah. So I mean, there is fully bit of underlying claims inﬂation. Nothing I think that is
particularly newsworthy. So, this is fairly typical underlying inﬂation probably across motor
and home. Obviously, that's been very much obscured by the impacts of lockdown on
motor claims frequency, certainly, through the early part of this year motor frequency was
well down because of the both lockdowns we went through.
Right now, and certainly in the last couple of months, I would say that although motor
frequency is still a bit below where it was before the pandemic, it is more or less in line
with pricing assumptions. So I think we along with everybody else in the industry is
making some allowance now for an ongoing lower level of claims frequency, and that's
been passed on in pricing. So at the moment pricing and claims costs of running more or
less in line with each other, obviously, something we're going to keep a close eye on in
terms of what happens next.

A - Euan Sutherland
I think kind of standing back from the scenarios that we've presented previously, when
we've spoken from crews, treated too roughly due to insurance, very much within the
guidance that we had previously given, I think that we're seeing in terms of inﬂationary
pressure is going to kind of move that away from that guidance.
In terms of FDA readiness, we're well-prepared. We have hit all of the milestones that we
need to hit through the regulatory product development pricing, et cetera. We're further
reinforcing the team, clearly seeking shortest joining, in about six weeks' time as the CEO
of insurance. We're also announcing today that Graham Wright is the lead pricing
consultant from Willis Towers Watson is joining us as the Pricing Director for Insurance in

December as well. So the team is well set, team is working incredibly hard over the last
year to be ready for the FDA market study. We're adding to the capability, so we feel
conﬁdent around the prospect of that. And as you said before, we think this is the right
move for our customers long-term. So, nothing really to report in the lead up to that other
than on plan.

Hi again. Just this one follow-up from me please, just on the footprint expansion in motor
underwriting due to the model upgrade. Can you just give us a feel for what segments
that might be in? And perhaps how signiﬁcant -- talk about how signiﬁcant that is as a
development in terms of future growth potential and the capability in insurance? Thank
you.

A - Euan Sutherland
Yeah, I think we've made some really good progress in underwriting under Steve
McGuinness coming into the business about nine months ago. We're treading that
business really strongly back into policy growth there for the ﬁrst time in quite a long time.
Electric vehicles have been added to the book and we're seeing successful uptake there,
number of other areas that we're looking to expand the footprint. But that's a positive
indication of where we're moving with the footprint. James, anything else you want to?

A - James Quin

{BIO 18345789 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, I think at the moment probably it's much about a core competitive versus
the panel, as opposed to necessarily opening up new types of business that the broking
business would not have been competitive on previously, but it is also about that second
piece as well. And so there is a piece there, which I think we -- I mean, it's still early days in
terms of what we could expand that into. So it's probably more a case of small steps at the
moment in terms of that second piece of opening up on footprint expansion from a
broking perspective as opposed to the sort of the competitiveness of a core versus other
people on the panel.

Q - Nick Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Great. Thanks very much, indeed.

Thank you. We have now no further questions registered at this time. (Operator
Instructions) We now have a question from David Cullen of Howie[ph] Investment. So,
David, your line is open.

Q - Analyst
Good morning. Thanks for the opportunity to ask the questions. Can I just ask about
debt? What is the, I think now is the right level of debt to the business, if you could end
that both inclusive and exclusive on the ship there. Because I guess going forward, with
any cash generated you're just paying down debt. I'm curious to know what's the point
where you can start to, I guess, rethink the capital allocation strategy? Thank you.

A - Euan Sutherland

Bloomberg Transcript

So, in terms of the right level of debt, I mean, I think the right level of debt would be
probably quite a lot less than we had at the moment, without one of these decisions
about it. I mean I think that clearly what we've done in the short-term is take on more debt
-- more gross debt, haven't changed the net debt particularly in the interest of really
giving ourselves more security over the next few years, but really what happens with
COVID. And also to extend the maturity proﬁle as well, so we got no reﬁnancing needs
really at all for quite some time from now.
The goal here clearly has to be then to reduce both gross and net debt. And I think that
this goal that we've set ourselves of having debt to EBITDA of below 3.5x I think is -- I
mean, that is deﬁnitely a sort of minimum objective I think that we would have. And what
we've said really, that puts a priority over other calls in terms of dividends as well. So, I
think minimum is to get it below 3.5x debt to EBITDA, including the cruise ships
obviously. And that will take us a few years to do, but I think once you're down to that
level then the balance sheet would look very diﬀerent.
I think there's obviously other questions that we will look at over time, but I think that
would be the objective for now anyway. Does that help?

Q - Analyst
It does. Did say 3x or 3.5x?

A - Euan Sutherland
So I think 3.5 would be the minimum that we would want to get it down to, so below 3.5.
Now, I think that you could argue well, why not go further than that? And I think the
question then obviously is one about, I mean, the reality here is that cruise is an assetbacked bit, this it probably wouldn't make sense to try and run that on a totally debt-free
basis. And so it's a business that can support a reasonable amount of debt.

Now, you want to get the loan to values down to probably be somewhere below 50%. But
at that point, that seems like a reasonable place to be. And then if you take cost to
insurance business, you'd run with much lower levels of leverage, maybe 1x EBITDA or
something like that. And if you put the two together then you probably end up with
somewhere around about sort of 3x EBITDA or is an ongoing level. Big question then is, is
that the right shape of the balance sheet for future? It's a good question, it's probably not
top of mind right now, but it's certainly something we'll be looking at over the next 18
months.

Q - Analyst
Great. Thanks very much.

A - Euan Sutherland
