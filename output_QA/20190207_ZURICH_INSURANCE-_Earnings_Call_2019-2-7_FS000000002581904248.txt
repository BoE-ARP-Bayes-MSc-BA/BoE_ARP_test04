Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Good day everybody. Thank you very much for joining us. Before we get into the Q&A
session, I just want to provide you with a few remarks from my side. First of all, we're very
pleased with our full year results. It demonstrates further progress against the targets and
the priorities that we outlined in November 2016, and they have been achieved despite a
challenging ﬁnancial market in the latter part of the year and continued elevated natural
catastrophe activity.
Particularly pleasing has been the strength of the results in our Life business. Even
adjusting for positive foreign exchange movements, they increased by 23% year-on-year.
The results also show the high quality of our Life business. 90% of revenues are coming
from either technical margins or fees and loadings and there is very little reliance on
investment results. This underlines the success of our consistent strategy of focusing on
protection, unit-linked, and corporate products. We continue to execute on this strategy
over 2018 where 86% of the APE came from these products and 100% of new business
value was from those products.
Our Property & Casualty business also performed well. We saw an improvement in the
accident year combined ratio. This was driven by improvements in the accident year loss
ratio with our commercial business also seeing improvement in very tough market
conditions. Our reserves remain strong as demonstrated by the continued positive prior
year development at slightly above 102.2% guidance. As in 2017, 2018 demonstrated the
eﬀectiveness of our underwriting with below natural share of elevated natural catastrophe
events in the U.S. Investment income in Property & Casualty has also stabilized as
reinvestment yields have continued to improve. Looking forward, we expect our
underwriting performance to be upper end of the 95% to 96% range as the impact of
business mix shift, rate increases, and expense reductions continue to earn through.
Farmers has continued to demonstrate solid growth in their chosen areas and in their
ability to innovate with new business oﬀerings like the commercial rideshare business with
Uber and like Toggle which is insurance on-demand quite successful last year. Their
customer focus strategy is also continuing to drive improved customer metrics, and this
has been achieved with an improved underwriting performance. After many years,
Farmers has a double-digit combined ratio and we're very proud and satisﬁed with that.
These trends should continue to support growth in Farmers Management Services.
Our balance sheet is strong and the Z-ECM ratio is at 125% despite the impact of ﬁnancial
markets in the latter part of the year, and this reﬂects the strong operating capital
generation within our businesses. Importantly, we continue to turn this capital generation
into usable cash remittances to the group with a further $3.8 billion of remittances in 2018,
bringing the cumulative total over the past two years to $7.5 billion which is well on track
to exceed the $9.5 billion target for the end of 2019. This ability to generate cash
underpins our dividend which has been increased by 6% to CHF 19 per share, and this
represents a 76% pay out which is in line with our stated dividend policy.
2018 has also seen us continue to deliver against our key strategic priorities. We have
further strengthened our leadership positions in the faster-growing regions in Asia and

FINAL

Latin America, and we have built out our leading position in the fast-growing travel and
assistance business through targeted acquisitions while also continuing to build
additional distribution partnerships.
We have continued to invest in innovation. In 2018, we had the inaugural Zurich
Innovation World Championship, which saw a wide range of interests covering all aspects
of the insurance business with the winners announced last week. We look forward to
working with the winners to bring new and innovative solutions to our business.
We've also continued to roll out other innovative customer oﬀerings with the launch of
our ﬁrst application under our cooperation with CoverWallet; the launch of Klinc, an
innovative provider of on-demand coverage for personal possession; as well as
announcing a strategic collaboration to use Snapsheet's virtual claims technology across
the group. These initiatives will help ensure that our customers beneﬁt from simpler
interaction with our businesses and greater levels of customer service, while delivering
very greater levels of eﬃciency.
Overall, these results and development give us conﬁdence that we're well on track to fully
deliver against our current targets and position us well for the next phase of our
development, which I look forward to presenting to you later this year, actually in
November in London.

With this, I would pass back the line to you for Q&A.

Q&A
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The ﬁrst question is from Peter Eliot,
Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. The ﬁrst question was I guess on the sort of the underlying earnings
that you're seeing. I mean, there's lots of moving parts in the numbers including some
positive one-oﬀs. But considering the sort of the high level of nat cats we've seen and
restructuring costs, my sort of calculation of sustainable earnings gets me to a couple of
hundred million higher than you reported. And I mean the fact that you've reported for a
dividend close to 75% of NIAS kind of implies that you think NIAS is a good estimate of
the sustainable run rate. I'm just wondering if you could sort of comment on that or
whether I am (00:08:27)?
And the second question is on the impact of the P&C portfolio mix changes. And we've
seen the commission ratio hike of 3 percentage points over the last three years which just
seems quite a lot, I mean. I'm just wondering if you can sort of give us some clarity
numbers around sort of the proportion of the business and the extent to which that's
driving and I guess will continue to drive it. And I guess your guidance of ﬂat P&C
Page 3 of 20

premiums next year on the back of the portfolio mix change, I'm just wondering if you can
sort of say when we should expect to see the end of this and when we could maybe start
to see premiums starting to pick up? Thank you.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Peter, thanks. This is George. So on the ﬁrst one we actually have a slide in the investor
deck today. I don't recall the precise number; 9, 10, something like that. In that, we've
tried to break out both for last year and for this year. What we see is the – I hate to use the
phrase underlying earnings, but certainly if you take out some of the obvious one-oﬀs and
as you may have seen from that slide already we would see it substantially higher than just
$200 million.
There's two obvious things we would adjust for. So one is the extra point in nat cats sort
that we have in the year. So a bit more than $260 million. And the second thing is the
element of simpliﬁcation that we have within the operating proﬁt. If you adjust for both of
those, you got a number that's a bit north of $5 billion for operating proﬁt.

Bloomberg Transcript

There are other items that are one-oﬀs. And so, for example, I'm sure you're aware of the
conversations with the IR guys today that there are certainly one-oﬀs in the Life result that
are positive. But equally you'll ﬁnd other one-oﬀs that are negative, for example, around
hedge fund. So we tend to net the rest of it to pretty much zero. So if I were doing a
normalization calculation, I'd be adding back something between $400 million and $500
million as opposed to $200 million.
On the second point around the portfolio changes, I mean, we covered that a bit at the
half year and the picture hasn't really changed certainly so much from then. I mean,
obviously it's driven by – we talked about three things at the half year. So we have the
travel business with Cover-More, and I think as everyone knows that's a pretty high
acquisition cost business given the characteristics of the type of product and the low
volatility nature that it brings.
Second was the ﬁnance and insurance business in the U.S. So that business grew pretty
substantially in the ﬁrst half of the year. So that was just a driver of that 1.1 percentage
point increase you really saw in the ﬁrst half of the year. And then, of course, LatAm where
we've been pretty successful in ﬁnding new distribution agreements particularly around
the retail side in Brazil; that's also exerted some upward pressure on the acquisition cost
ratio.
I don't expect it's going to change markedly in the short-term. I think the one thing to
bear in mind though is that, I mean, we obviously don't normally look at the commission
ratio. What we're trying to say when we like the business is the overall performance. So for
us, I mean, if we do have to trade a slightly higher commission ratio to further improve the
characteristics of the book, i.e. better margin with lower volatility characteristics, that's
something we would continue to do. I don't immediately see that in our future but, I
mean, I couldn't entirely rule that out. So, I mean, for me I think you need again to look at
the overall technical performance and we've talked before about, I mean, over time I
expect to see a trade between the loss ratio and the commission ratio.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thanks a lot. And in terms of sort of the overall premiums volume, when we might just
start to see a pickup or the pressure from portfolio mix go away?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

FINAL

So on the third question...

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Sorry.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. So for us, I mean, if you look at what happened last year, I mean, the trend that
we've been on certainly continued. Probably the reduction in commercial slowed down a
bit, so we dropped by, I mean, very low single-digit. The retail portfolio, and I guess you
understand the deﬁnition of retail for us, so it includes SME and the higher volume
commercial type exposures, I mean, that's growing at a level that's, I mean, closer to
double-digit. But we have bought more reinsurance. We talked about it during the course
of last year especially around casualty, so that obviously has some impact to knock back
that higher gross rent premium. At this point, in terms of the last year reinsurance that we
do certainly on quota share basis, I don't expect that we're going to be changing that in
the short-term. So I would expect that this year at ﬂattish. I mean, there's a possibly if we
can ﬁnd the right opportunity on the retail side we will grow. I think the challenge is the
market on commercial, I mean, a bit hard I suppose to imagine today. Just given the
proﬁtability characteristics of that part of the portfolio, it would be a high priority in
Europe.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thanks a lot.

Operator
Next question is on Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi there. First question just on pricing. I just was looking for a bit more granularity mostly
in North America. Some of your competitors have been sort of focusing on rate increases
ex-workers' comp if we accept the workers' comp is soft but the claims environment is
also soft. But ex-workers' comp, I'm interested in what rate you're getting on the problem
lines which continue to be, it seems, a lot of liability lines, particularly commercial auto. So
what kind of rate you're seeing in that and whether that's moderating or still hard.
And the second question on reserves, I note that for this year the group reserve release is
a bit higher than that from the divisions. I'm assuming that is partly to do with the 2017
caps which would be close to group reinsurance level or is it there's something else going

Page 5 of 20

on? And linked to reserves which may be linked to my ﬁrst question, the U.S. – North
America had a fairly weak or weaker PYD in the second half of 2018 versus last year. Was
there some strengthening again of commercial auto in that line? Thanks.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. So on the ﬁrst one, pricing, the pricing dynamic I think we talked
certainly earlier. I mean, we anticipated that things would probably slow down once we
were through the renewal of loss aﬀected accounts. If you look at the U.S. in detail, if you
look at it from the full year perspective, I think we see the U.S. markets' pure rates – we
can come on to loss cost inﬂation in a second – a bit north of 3.5 points powering through
the year. I mean, it was pretty stable through the ﬁrst three quarters. It's dropped oﬀ a bit
on Q4 so we are beneath 3 points in terms of rate increase. Within it, I mean, property has
come down a bit so we are about 2 points.

Bloomberg Transcript

If you look at commercial, so we can take motor, the one that you asked for. So Q2, Q3,
Q4 pretty stable so we're seeing it in the high single-digit range. And as you point out,
workers' comp is a bit soft. So despite the events of last year, workers' comp continues to
be a very proﬁtable line and there is more competition there. But the rate that we see on
commercial also seems okay for us at the moment albeit it still does require some
portfolio adjustment to try and drive the kind of returns that we need.
From a claim perspective and inﬂation perspective which of course is a really important
partner to this, so inﬂation around the commercial auto line is still fairly high, so maybe
not as high as we saw it last year but, I mean, it's still well in the mid-single-digit range. So
the rate at which the margin is expanding is considerably less than maybe the headline
rate would apply and it certainly doesn't make it anything like attractive enough to want to
jump back in with both feet although workers' comp is soft and the inﬂationary stats
around the claim side of workers' comp are still very benign to put it mildly. I mean,
overall picture, things have slowed down a bit which was entirely what we expected just
given the way that portfolio was renewing. And I think as we look forward, the pricing
trend by line of business probably will be quite distinct, so the broad market movement
and response to a bit of the claim expense of 2017 I think at this stage is partially behind
us.
On the reserve topic, so why do you see a group reserve release. So it's a combination of
factors. So for example, things like the EL transaction that we did back in December, we
held some additional reserves around that line of business up top. Obviously, given that
it's going that's no longer required. There was a small diﬀerence between the way the
Group Re were seeing things in some of the countries and we held at a prudential margin.
We've been working on that over the last couple of years and we've reached the level of
comfort that allowed us to remove it. I don't think it's the cat topic. I mean, cat is mainly
embedded in the local business. I don't think we have anything signiﬁcant at all on cat.
U.S. expense in the second half on PYD, I mean, nothing really to point out there. I mean,
probably the only thing we did do in the reserve in the second half of the year around the
U.S., we did a normal detailed review I think around – I think it was already end of Q3, but
of course given we don't have Q3 numbers it would've been visible externally. But the
Page 6 of 20



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2019-02-07

workers' comp business was very strong. By and large, we've taken the opportunity to
strengthen, more recent years, both on workers' comp and on liability more generally. But
I don't recall commercial auto being a particular topic in that regard.

FINAL

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Just to put a round oﬀ, so we're not sort of misinterpreting. I mean, you say, the prudential
margin, I think was the language you used, at the group level, you felt you no longer need
it, but presumably there still is a prudential margin of some kind, is there or...

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yes, absolutely. So to be very speciﬁc, the prudential margin related to that one
(00:20:18).

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Oh, okay.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, the overall group reserve strength, as we assess it, from beginning to end of last year,
they excel at the same percentile.

Hi. Good morning, good afternoon. So, I had three questions, but I'll restrict it to two. But
if you don't answer the ﬁrst one, then, can I ask a replacement?

Oh, well, okay. Keep going then, James.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Well, ﬁrst question I'm just interested in what the absolute combined ratio was in both
crop and workers' comp please for 2017 and 2018. For workers' comp, ideally, I'd like the
workers' comp ex PYD. So, that's my ﬁrst question. Perhaps you could tell me if you're
going to answer that one, if not I'll choose a diﬀerent one.

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

All right. So I'm not just to save you time. I'm happy to give you color around it, but I'm
not get into the very detail where you asked for it. So, I'll give you half a question; I'll give
you half an answer.

FINAL

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

I'll replace with half a question as well then. Go ahead with the color then please. Thank
you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

If you looked all of last year, crop, another strong year for us. I mean, not as strong as it
was in 2017. No player is strong with some of the ﬁgures I've seen from competitor
disclosure. So, I mean maybe we are 6, 7 points better than we would ordinarily expect to
see the business run at. So, I mean, that clearly has beneﬁted the performance, but it's not
at the level that we saw in 2017.

Bloomberg Transcript

Workers' comp, nothing particularly special to point out. I've mentioned in response to
Andrew's question that we did move this out around a bit. The line still seems to throw oﬀ
quite a bit of positive development. And to the extent that it's reasonable, we're trying to
hold that back on the more recent years. So, PYD, I don't actually have a ﬁgure for PYD for
workers' comp in my head. But given what we did, I think you can assume that on a net
basis, there would be some positive point, not very large.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thank you. So, another question is then – on the combined ratio and the kind
of guidance was the upper end of the range, so the 96% in 2020. So, I mean, it looks like
you're normalizing in 2018 around 97.2%, if I give you the beneﬁt of the one-oﬀs for
expenses. So, you got at least 1.2% improvement to come. Expense delivery's about 75%
done. It looks like most of that improvement is set to come from commercial lines, just
given the starting point for resale and other. Can you just elaborate a little bit about your
conﬁdence in achieving that?
We've seen recently rate is slowing. Some of the peers in the U.S. are being quite cautious
about their guidance for next year. You're likely to get some headwinds on workers'
comp. So, perhaps, you could just expand a little bit on where that improvement is
coming from. And I suppose kind of linked to that. Is kind of that top end of that range, is
that including 1.5 points of PYD, or is it including a diﬀerent number, because I think you
only guide to kind of 1% to 2%?
Second question is just really a quick one.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

This is smart.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

FINAL

I just wanted to understand what the potential is for you to do share buybacks, because
you have a Z-ECM range, you have a target range of 100% to 120%. We've seen some
volatility in Q4. That volatility would have reversed. The range you have should allow for
that volatility.
And, obviously, you've got other binding constraints, such as S&P and what have you. So
it does seem as if you're running with a level of capital that is kind of above where you
need to be. You did do a buyback quite recently, but essentially dilutive. Could you just
help us understand a little bit whether 2019 is a possibility for a buyback or whether is it
more of a medium-term question? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you. So that is a complex, multi-nested question. So I'm going to start at high level,
and then maybe we can descend into them on detail. So I think the way that you had
looked at things, so you normalize, you come at around 97.2%. You pointed out that we
have expense delivery anticipated this year, which is absolutely correct.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm not sure that it'd be completely reasonable to assume that it's all going to drop into
commercial. I mean, just given the areas where the expense action is taking place this
year, it's certainly in what I would describe as one of a more retail-heavy regions. So I
would expect you to see expense improvement on both retail and commercial.
Having said that though, the 97.2%, I guess, is connected to the PYD topic. So back at –
and I forget whether it was half year or the Investor Day, we guided that – I mean, just
given the pressures that we see and I mean the positive pressures for the avoidance of
doubt, we would see PYD around the upper end of our guidance. And that's what I
anticipate we'll see in 2019.
So if you're trying to look at underlying, I agree that the 2.3% that we've seen for 2018 is
maybe a touch high, but I wouldn't knock it all the way back to 1.5%. And in fact, just to
keep the math simple for me, I'd probably knock it back to about 2%. If I do that, then I
guess compared to you, I'm ending up somewhere around the 97% for the year. And, of
course, you guys know what we were at the half year, which was roughly 97.5%. So I mean
the calculation of what the second half must have been is not so diﬃcult. So, I mean, I
would see us running as we leave the year somewhere in the mid-96%.
Now, that clearly still requires further delivery to get what we need to get to. Expenses will
be the largest part of that for sure. But as far as the market conditions are concerned, I
mean, from the very beginning, we never planned that the market would be a positive
driver here. I mean, look, just going back to answer I gave Andrew on pricing, if anything,
I mean if there was margin expansion, it's narrowing because of this reduction in the
headline rate and maybe inﬂation picking up slightly in the lowest cost.
But I mean it's just not dependent on – for us, we've demonstrated that we are completely
focused on proﬁtability. We would always like to expand the portfolio, but that's only
Page 9 of 20



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2019-02-07

possible when we can achieve the right returns. And if we can't achieve the right returns,
we've also demonstrated that we're prepared to take capital away where it's required. So I
mean we still have work to do this year, but it's not 97.2% to 96%.

FINAL

That's very helpful. Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On the capital topic and volatility – so you're absolutely right, we see it the same way. The
range that we have already and the target capital range is designed to address volatility.
We've got a bit of it in Q4, a bit more of it than maybe we expected. Some of it is actually
self-inﬂicted. So the piece of it which, of course, is the market which everyone can see, we
actually made a bet on model change and at time, I guess, we felt we were richer that we
ended up being. But I mean we still end up in a very strong place. And I think even if you
were conservative today, you pointed out at least a couple of points back. So capital is
good for us.
So what does that mean? We've obviously just made the decision for the immediate
future around capital. So we're not coming forward with a proposal there. Our priorities
are pretty much unchanged. We have an acquisition, which will close at least, to the best
of our knowledge, at this stage sometime around the middle of the year, so that will be a
piece of it. And we would still prefer to try and use the capital to support organic or
inorganic. But again, if that's not possible, I mean, we will look at alternatives. So I mean
we don't rule anything out or anything in at this stage. But I mean we have some shortterm uses for some of that capital.

Next question comes from the line Michael Huttner, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Fantastic. Thank you very much. I listened also to the lovely Bloomberg video this
morning, and I was struck by two things: the focus on delivery and on cash ﬂow; and
dividends of course. On cash ﬂow, the $3.8 billion, can you maybe walk us through a
potential like waterfall chart? What could it look like? If you normalized sort of various
items that you have in the BOP calculation, the $5 billion, or just to get a feel for where we
might be including the OnePath deal. That would be hugely helpful for 2019?
And then, the other question is on a diﬀerent topic. And I'm probably asking a completely
wrong question, but I noticed, and I may be wrong, but there's a lower nat cat projection
or higher expected nat cat weigh on the solvency ratio by about 2 points. And I wonder

Page 10 of 20



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG

how that squares with your aim to have less volatile earnings and maybe revert to the 3%
in terms of expected nat cats, but – yeah. Thank you.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Michael. So apologies in advance, I can't give you a forecast for 2019 for cash. I
mean, you've seen today that we're well ahead of baseline run rate. We have a number of
items that are one-oﬀ positive, one-oﬀ negative. But I mean in comparison to last year, I
think when we guided people down around cash to maybe around the $3.3 mark, I don't
think I would do that today.
I mean, we've had some – for example, I think people are aware that we have the impact,
at least partially, of the hurricanes in 2018. So that caused down the P&C number. We've
also got some, let's call it, optimization we did around the Life businesses, so the cash
ﬂow there is very strong. But I mean you can assume that worst case, those two things
oﬀset each other. So very strong delivery on cash last year because of the business. What
could it look like this year, if you think of what happens with OnePath.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, OnePath timing of course is really important here. So, if you go back to when we
announced the transaction we were very transparent around returns and around cash
ﬂows. At this point, I mean, again, to the best of our knowledge, it's likely to close around
the middle of the year. But I mean to be completely frankly but not entirely in control of
that, it depends on a relatively complex operation that's taken place on the other side of
the transaction.
And also, one thing that's diﬀerent from what we had before, I mean, previously, we had
the restructuring quarter in the old year, and then we have a clean run in the New Year.
We're going to have a bit of a restructuring at OnePath also this year. So, I mean, I expect
if it does close in the middle of the year, it will be positive, but I wouldn't take the
guidance that we gave back in the Investor Presentation and simply prorate it. I mean,
overall, I'm very happy with where cash is. It's clearly not an issue for – the group has done
a great job on extracting the earnings as cash from all of it.
On a nat cat topic, so, well supported, you're absolutely right. So there's a small a pick-up.
It's not such a small number, I mean turned into capital. We've got a small retail business
that has expanded lately its exposure to nat cat in a particular area. I mean, the amount of
premium volume involved, I think, might surprise you, if I gave it to you.
But I mean, consistent with comments we've made before. I mean, we have bought more
nat cat coverage in 2019. We are not looking to raise our exposure to nat cat. And in fact –
I mean, just given the general pricing trends, I guess, what you hear from players that are
maybe more expert in that area than we might be, I mean, it's still not an area where you
would want to expand capacity. So, I mean, you can assume that through the course of
this year, I mean, we are not looking to grow it and there' still the possibility that we might
shrink the exposure that we have for them.

The next question comes from the line of Farooq Hanif, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. Thanks very much. There's more of an emphasis in your presentation, and
also Mario, on your initial comments on innovation now. So, you talked about Snapsheet
and CoverWallet.
I was just wondering if you take this in a package with the improvements that you want to
make in commercial in the U.S. So, looking beyond 2019 where consensus are already
quite close to a 96%. I'm kind of thinking, I mean, are you sort of happy with the idea that
there are further improvements in proﬁtability that can be achieved from this innovation
and from still moving the mix in the U.S.? So, just qualitatively, can we expect better from
the combined ratio going forward?
And sorry, the second question is, on your reinsurance, looking at slide 38, where you
give the program, I mean, it looks like you've actually made few tweaks as more kind of
out of the money protection. If you could just comment on that, that would be helpful.
Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Look, on innovation, I think we mentioned it, because it is becoming relevant for us, but
not necessarily to improve combined ratio in U.S. But if you look at, for example, CoverMore today, Cover-More came short of CHF 900 million of revenues last year. So it is
becoming sizable, and it keeps on growing, and we're sure that growth will be very strong
in 2019, too. So, we want to put a light on that because this is starting to become visible.
The biggest source of growth that we had in Spain this year was through CoverWallet and
SMEs. And that's why we thought also to extend this into Switzerland starting this year.
And again, this is why we mentioned it, not just – I mean it didn't move the combined
ratio, but it is becoming a relevant source of growth and possibly stronger in 2019.
Snapsheet, we have an agreement with them to use them in Europe. So, we don't plan,
and I don't think we can even use them in U.S. But we're quite interested to see if that can
help improving service and eventually cost of claims in Europe.
So, we mentioned them, because they're becoming relevant for us. And we want you
guys to get familiar with and to start also looking at the progressive numbers that we
achieved on these diﬀerent innovations. But none of them frankly is strictly impacting the
combined ratio in commercial U.S., which is more I think beneﬁting from the portfolio
shifts that we have been making over the last two years.

FINAL

If we look on the reinsurance topics, so you're right, there are some changes. I think in a
very quick way I trailed some of them at the Investor Day. So, I mean, the global cat treaty
stands out we've increased capacity under the global cat treaty. We've actually put a
cover in place. It's an April 1 renewal, but we anticipated the capacity increases a change
already at the end of last year. So, that's obviously connected back to the conversation we
have with Michael earlier on the rise in some of the incoming cat exposure.
But beyond that, I mean, we have a number of things that – I mean, I'm not sure I'm at
certain it's tactical, but we talked before, in fact we now have a pretty signiﬁcant quota
share across the liability book. And the intention is that that'll would be a long-term
relationship. We view it as strategic, and it's not about the performance on that particular
book, it's about the mix that we retain.
We treat a number of other things, so we have a ﬁnancial lanes program in place that
we've tweaked. I think I've talked before that we have an aggregate cover that we put in
place back in early 2016 and that was aimed to try and contain some of the volatility that
we had suﬀered from previously. For a variety of reasons, we've never really come that
close to actually triggering that contract and we've restructured that with a panel of
reinsurers starting this year to try and bring it a bit closer to the money and maybe work a
bit harder for us.

Bloomberg Transcript

General conditions, I mean, the market is – I mean, we're seeing attractive pricing, so risk
adjusted, we are paying the same rates as we've paid before. And, in general, I mean, we
would continue at the margins to buy a bit more reinsurance cover just given what the
market currently oﬀers. That's what we're doing on reinsurance.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

May I just come back – thank you for that. Can I just quickly come back on the ﬁrst point?
Okay. So, I get it. Your initiatives are more about service volume and capability. But in the
U.S. quite apart from innovation, clearly, you carefully set out some quite ambitious
targets for commercial indicatively bringing that combined ratio down by 3 points or so.
So, again, just more generally beyond the 96%, do you think there's more you can do?

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Yes. But remember that the combined ratio still depends on market conditions, right?

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

So is the market going to remain as it is today? Is the market to harden, to soften? Let's
not make combined ratio forecasts for 2021, 2022 today, right. I mean, let's get to the end
of year, see where we are, see where the market is and then where we reassess it. But,
fundamentally, what we have been trying to do in U.S. and also in UK, it's a shift to book
out of the upper end of the global corporate customers and the big exposure to longPage 13 of 20

term liability into the more stable, and usually more proﬁtable and specialty property
business and more towards midmarket in SME. That brings a lower and a better
combined ratio over time.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thank you.

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

And this has to progress and deliver results in two years of that and deﬁnitely not enough
to measure. Although we see movements and improvements in the combined ratio, it's
still too early because the books haven't – no development, and these are long-term
businesses and takes a while to get rid of those.

Next question comes from the line of Nick Holmes, Société Générale. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Nicholas Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Hi there. Thank you very much. I just wanted to come back on the expense ratio to ask,
how concerned are you that softening U.S. P&C pricing is going to make it more diﬃcult
to reduce the expense ratio? And secondly, is the scope to take out more cost because
the expense ratio is I think still pretty high and I'd be interested in your comments on that.
Is that something that you would disagree with? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you. So on the pricing expense ratio interaction. So, I mean, we decided at the start
that we would not set a ratio target because it can lead you to do things that had nothing
to do with expenses. We thought it was clearer for you and for everyone in the company
that we set a level of resource that we're prepared to allocate to what we're doing. If P&C
pricing softens more than we anticipate today. I mean, that may put a bit of pressure on
the ratio but it wouldn't immediately change our expense plans. I mean, we have a plan in
place today across all the businesses, across the corporate center. The number one
priority is to make sure we deliver on that thing that we have absolute control over.
I think just generally on the P&C pricing topic, I gave a fairly detailed answer to Andrew
earlier around the various pricing trends. So, I mean, at this point, I don't see it going
negative in the short term. But I mean, we don't control it and it is possible. But I mean, at
this point, it's not something we assume is going to impact 2019.
On the second comment around, there's a scope to take out more the perspective that
maybe our expense ratio is still high. I think when you look at expense ratio, the thing I
would encourage everyone to do and we do it internally, I mean, we obviously we
Page 14 of 20

compare it to peers and competitors in the diﬀerent markets. Ordinarily, we will break out
the diﬀerent components. So there's an acquisition cost ratio in there that is not traditional
expense per se. There's also – depending on the practice of the company, some things
are at premium tax. Potentially, they include it. Potentially they don't.
And then you have a core part, which I think is generally more comparable, which is in our
case the OUE ratio. I mean, the OUE ratio would suggest, I mean, we still have further
room to drive eﬃciency, but nothing like the extent that the headline expense ratio
number might suggest if you compare it to the headline numbers of peers and
competitors. I mean, we've made a huge step over the course of the last couple of years
with one more year to go.

Q - Nicholas Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Can I just very quickly follow up with the OUE ratio, I think 13% was you
indicated your sort of target. Is that still the case? Presumably, it is.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

We didn't give a target.

Q - Nicholas Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

No. But an indication.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

We got 55 diﬀerent targets that we have to achieve across the entire book. I mean, what
we said today is that if you look at and you allow for the one-oﬀs, we're about 13.8%. I
mean, you guys know how the expense ratio or the eﬃciency beneﬁts typically fall across
the business. And I mean you can relatively rapidly work out where you would expect that
to land. But, I mean, we haven't set a target for expense ratio. We've set targets for cost
reduction and that's what we are focused on this year.

Q - Nicholas Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Next question comes from the line of Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. Please go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much. So one on the Life guidance really because
you remember, George, last year, we were discussing about a mid, right – low to mid or
some mid percentage growth number. And even if I clean up for this 125 (00:46:36) oneoﬀ this year, we ended up very healthy 14%, 15% growth. I mean is there a sort of
conservativeness in there in your thinking about Life or could we have another repeat year

Page 15 of 20



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2019-02-07

of a good or at least better than expected numbers for Life? So that's just on the Life
items.

FINAL

And second question is just on the attrition and loss ratio. I mean, the 2-ish number being
below 63, we'll have to go back quite a few years to get that kind sub-63 attritional. Is
there something that is worth ﬂagging on maybe that just one business had a very good
second half or can we get a bit more excited about this line going forward? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Vinit. So on the Life topic, I'm conscious that I'm not about to talk down
something that I think had a fantastic year, whether you include the one-oﬀs or whether
you don't. The Life business for us has been going great. And, I mean, we did give
guidance around the middle of the year around that underlying number. And of course, at
that stage, we knew already we had some one-oﬀ in the number. In fact, we talked about
it back at the half-year results principally around the foreign exchange eﬀects that we
were seeing in LatAm.

Bloomberg Transcript

Could we have a better number than the one we guided to? It's possible, but I mean,
we're not trying to gain here, we are trying to give you a realistic sense of where we
expect it to land. And I think the – I mean, whether there may be diﬀerences between us
and what people are assuming, I think probably the larger issue is just going to be the
timing of OnePath.
I think I mean we tried to indicate broadly when we expected that to close back at the
Investor Day in December. I mean, today, I don't know anything more around the middle
of this year. If it closes earlier, which I think is unlikely maybe that could have a diﬀerent
impact. I mean, so far, at least that day had been slipping rather than accelerating.
So we're trying to guide you to what we actually expect rather than to give the full sense
of the underlying. And to be honest, I mean, if you look at what will be required for the
Life business to achieve, what we've indicated, that's still pretty strong growth over the
underlying performance of 2018.
On the attritional, I mean, is there something in there that we should get really excited
about or something we should isolate and change? I think, again, I said in relation to – I
forgot it was Andrew's question that I answered earlier. I think it was James when he
talked about how he saw the underlying numbers for the year. I think it's important
because of the connection between some of the elements that we run. So we talked
already of the impact of acquisition costs versus loss. I guess some of you learned today
there was also connection in the expense topic and the loss ratio. I'd look at the whole
thing and around.
If you look at the second half, I guess I gave commentary to James earlier that gives you a
sense of how we see things. I mean, there are certainly elements of that that are better
than we would expect to see continually in the future. Crop would be one example. But at
the same time, there are elements of it that are not as good as I would hope to see them

Page 16 of 20



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2019-02-07

in the very near future. One of those examples would be ﬁnancial lines in one of our key
markets.

FINAL

So I think it's a reasonable starting point as we enter into 2019. Be a bit wary of crop
seasonality, but I mean it's not going to have a big impact on this. We need to continue
on the path that you've seen from us to deliver on that combined ratio topic that we
discussed earlier.

Hi there, thanks. Just one for me. So just on P&C, I mean, we can clearly see the
underwriting improvement coming through now. And I know it's work in progress, I know
there are some good bits, some less good bits. But I just wondered thinking on a longer
term view about how happy are you now with the quality of that U.S. commercial book?
And in your minds, where are you on that re-underwriting journey? I'm not talking about
just on the way to the 2019 targets. I am just thinking big picture, where do you want to
get this business to and basically where are you now? Thank you.

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Look, the way we're looking at U.S is we need to still continue strengthening our
capabilities on mid-market. We did something over the last two years, but we will
continue this in 2019 and the next two years. Also, we are improving the underwriting
strength that we have especially in UK and U.S. By that, I mean, that we are improving the
programs we have for underwriting, the attractiveness that we have for good
underwriting. At the end of the day, in UK, in U.S. we compete for the best underwriters
and we have to be able to stand high in that competition. So it's a journey. We're not
satisﬁed. There's more to come and there's more to do in U.S. also and the team there
knows it very well. And the programs that we have for 2019 and next years reﬂect that.

Hello. Can you hear me? Sorry.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

Yeah. Sorry. Just a couple of quick questions. Just the reserve redundancy that you've
built in ZIC or the Group reinsurance business has been quite substantial over the year.
So, I know that you're talking about the upper end of the range in terms of reserve
release, but are we going to see reserve, you just running down the reserves that you've
built up essentially over time? And how long are we expected to do that? Or will that just
come through your assessment of the reserve strength of the underlying businesses as a
whole? That's the ﬁrst question.
And then the second question is just in terms of M&A. I mean, obviously you've done a lot
of transactions. You ﬁlled in a lot of gaps. Are we coming to a natural conclusion in terms
of the M&A activity that you've been undertaking? And then, I know you've spoken about
capital returns but how does that feed into – if I look at your balance sheet, there is a bit of
balance sheet slack. How will that translate into potentially capital returns to
shareholders?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Johnny. So on the reserve redundancy topic, again, I think it was Andrew's
question from earlier, it would be a bit disturbing if all that we did around PYD is simply
drained the reserve strength of the group. As you can imagine, I mean, not only would I
not want to do that but there's a number of controls in place that even if I did would stop
me. So, for example, this is a topic that we spent a lot of time with the group audit
committee. It's a responsibility of the group's chief actuary. We have a policy around
where we target in terms of percentile and the reserve range, and there's a band around
that and if we wanted to deviate from it, that would require approval.

Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2019-02-07

And I think I've tried to comment both this year and last year trying to fairly frequently
that, I mean, when we see the types of reserve release that we saw last year, that did not
come at the expense of reserve strength. And in fact, I mean this is an internal company
measure, so I appreciate you need to take it with a pinch of salt. But if we try and measure
as objectively as we can the reserve strength at the beginning of the year and the end of
the year with everything and including all of the potential margins that we have, we are in
exactly the same place. So we just do not intend that that PYD comes at the expense of
some additional future risk.
On M&A, I mean, I think it's important to recognize that on M&A, we'd not only ﬁlled in
many gaps, we've also addressed some positions that just didn't make sense for us. So
you've seen us certainly up to the ANZ deal, I mean essentially disposed or released
capital in roughly same amount as we had invested. That's a process that for us is
probably continuous. I mean, we can take a look at the portfolio on a regular basis to ask
whether or not it ﬁts with strategy, whether the market is oﬀering the right types of
returns, we have the right type capabilities in place. And if we don't, you'll see us do what
we've done in the past around, let's say, like Morocco, Taiwan, the annuity business in the
U.S. and the UK.
And I think I mean, you all know from prior conversations that we've had that there are
parts of the capital base that are currently locked up in risks that we don't think are well
remunerated. And this was a topic I highlighted at the Investor Day that this will be a
priority for us in 2019 and not just in the context of legacy or noncore as it's referred to
publicly, but across the entire portfolio. This is another year where we're going to devote
ourselves to looking at the capital allocation and seeing what steps we can take to
improve the overall portfolio. How does that ﬁt into capital return? I can't add more on
that topic beyond the answers I gave to the earlier question to James.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon. Two questions left for me. One on the Z-ECM model changes. Is this
bringing the view closer to the rating view as it's closing the gap between the two. And
therefore, is it a group guide for that at this stage? And secondly, a bit more practical on
the capital gains that come through outside BOP. And given where the AFS reserves have
fallen, what can you tell us to help us getting our heads around the structural part of gains
versus what may have been a bit in excess of normal? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Niccolo. So, answer to the ﬁrst question, no. I wish it was yes but it's no. I think the
– I mean, that was a change that we made to how we look at subordinated debt. I think

the change is justiﬁed. We've been looking at it for some time. It would have been more
convenient to do it when the markets didn't move but the markets moved as we did it. But
we think it's the right thing to do.
On the capital gains outside BOP, I mean, it's tough to tell you in any given year the
number is going to be X because of course it's a function of not just that EFS starting
point, it's a function of how much the portfolio turns over, a function of how the markets
perform in the year. For me what we tend to guide people is that, I mean, from a medium,
longer term perspective, I mean you can assume and we assume that the numbers about
400 maybe slightly higher. That's the level that we typically implying.
