Presentation
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Sanlam Life Insurance Limited 10
months Operational Update. All participants will be in listen-only mode. There will be an
opportunity to ask questions later during the conference. (Operator Instructions) Please
note that this call is being recorded.
I'd now like to turn the conference over to Paul Hanratty. Please go ahead sir.

Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you very much for joining us on this
conference call. I'm joined today by our CFO, Abigail Mukhuba; our Chief Risk Officer, Lotz
Mahlangeni; as well as Patrick Hartnic and Grant Davids from Investor Relations.
We released the results for the 10-month period to October 31, 2020 earlier this
afternoon and I'd like to just make a few comments before we open the lines to
questions.
From a strategic perspective, I'm pleased with our progress in implementing the revised
strategy, which emphasized the technology as a key enabler in meeting strategic goals,

FINAL

putting the customer at the core of everything we do. Our focus on collaboration within
Sanlam and with strategic partners is also progressing well.
In the Sanlam Pan-Africa business, we continue to drive operational execution with the aim
of getting consistent growth and a stable return on capital. India too remains strategically
important for Sanlam. In our announcement, we advise shareholders that the conditions
precedent relating to the sale of a 25% stake in Sanlam Investment Holdings to ARC
Financial Services have been fulfilled and the closing process has now happened on Friday
evening.
From an operational perspective, the group maintained a resilient operational
performance over the 10-month period. It's been a gradual improvement in the operating
environment since June 30, 2020 as governments have eased the level of restrictions to
control the spread of COVID-19. Operating conditions, however, remain challenging in our
largest markets.

Bloomberg Transcript

Lower average market levels increased pressure on asset management margins and
investment-related earnings. Weak equity market performance over the period negatively
impacted investment return on capital, return on the Saham float and market-related fees
of participating products at Glacier. The hedging strategy in place in the South African life
insurance capital portfolio limited the overall adverse impact on net investment return.
Credit markets partially recovered in the third quarter of 2020, which resulted in a
significant portion of the credit spread losses in our Central Credit Manager, reversing
after the June 30.
I would like to highlight the following 3 non-investment market related items that did
impact our earnings after the half year. Firstly, I'm sure you've all seen Santam SENS which
they alerted the market to the fact that they've made an additional provision for
contingent business interruption insurance. It made an additional provision of ZAR1.7 billion
following the Western Cape High Court judgment in the Ma-Afrika Hotels matter. This
brings the full provision and premium relief provisions in the 10-month period to ZAR3.3
billion.
Secondly, we had an explosion in the Beirut Port, which has had an impact of ZAR183
million, inclusive of the exposure in the Lebanese business itself as well as Saham Re and
Santam Re who are reinsurers to the Lebanese business.
And then finally, we have had an increase in COVID-19 claims amounting to some ZAR229
million of claims specifically related to COVID, post June 30. Despite the significant
increase in the COVID-19 related claims, year-to-date risk profits remained strong in the
Life and Saving cluster, supported by a decrease in mortality claims from other causes.
The group pandemic reserve has not been released in any way to date. (inaudible) it will
be considered more fully at year-end, based on the overall risk experience for the year.
Persistency has not deteriorated over the 10 months or indeed after the half year, but we
believe the future experience in this regard remains at risk, due to markedly lower South
African GDP.

FINAL

Some of the salient features of our performance are as follows: new business volumes of
just under ZAR250 billion are 25% up on prior year. Investment business was the key
driver of the 10-month period and life insurance sales in the third quarter recovered to 5%
above those in the first quarter. Net fund inflows of ZAR51 billion are up 17%, and Sanlam
Emerging Markets were the key contributor to the growth, although that must, of course,
draw your attention to the support to Sanlam Emerging Markets numbers from the
currency depreciation.
The net value of new business covered was ZAR1.35 billion, that being 21% down on the
prior year. However, that is better than the 29% decline that we reported at the half year.
The net VNB margin of 2.3%, improved by 24 basis points from net reported at the half
year. The net result from financial services is down 21%. But if we exclude all COVID
impacts, both positive and negative over the prior year, the result would have been 22%
up. And headline earnings and diluted earnings per share are both increased.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm very satisfied with our performance for the 10 months, which does reflect our
resilience and our ability to maintain value creation for shareholders in very difficult times.
And in conclusion, I would say that Sanlam remains very well positioned to weather the
headwinds with a robust balance sheet and strong solvency position, diversification across
many geographies, lines of business and market segments, as well as having a strong
depth of skills in all of our businesses.
It's really important to note that all of our businesses remain strongly cash generative,
although of course, you'll appreciate that at Santam itself, the provisions that have been
made have obviously got a very severe impact on both the profits and the cash out of
that business. We continue to actively manage the consequences of the COVID-19
pandemic and any potential second wave.
Whilst economic activity is gradually recovering, we expect the operating environment to
remain challenging for the balance of this year and certainly throughout next year. New
business growth in the remainder of this year, which is really only 2 months, but it will be
impacted by the high base that we had in the second half of 2019.
The eventual claims experience from COVID-19 remains uncertain, both at Santam with
the CBI claim, as well as in our life insurance operations. The Santam Board has made a
decision to appeal the Ma-Afrika judgment and await the court's permission on the
application to appeal. The potential outcome of the appeal including other relevant court
rulings on these and other Santam policy rulings may materially impact Santam's
assessment of the estimated net effect of the CBI claims.
The overall possible financial impact of Santam CBI exposures will take time to finalize.
Over the medium-to-long term, we remain confident of the growth potential in all of our
markets, including South Africa and we will continue to deliver to our shareholders and
other stakeholders.
Thank you very much. I've made the remarks that I wanted to just to introduce and I now
open up to questions from all of you on the line.

Questions And Answers
Operator

FINAL

(Question And Answer)
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Michael Christelis from
UBS. Please go ahead, Michael.

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody. Can you hear me?

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

We can hear you fine, Michael. Good afternoon.

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

How are you doing, Paul. Are you well?

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Good.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

It's very good to hear your voice. Good. Thank you. Looking forward to the end of the year
there. Four questions, if I can. Firstly, on mortality and then particularly around COVID. You
guys were quite sort of clear in your articulation that you thought COVID was only going to
result in about 17,000 deaths in South Africa as of June when you presented in
September, and that your pandemic reserve could cover you, I think if I remember
correctly, up to about 27,000. I mean can you give us a bit of thinking around your
expected sort of SA debts from COVID as a result of COVID given that we're now well
past the 17,000 deaths that you had previously mentioned. And what exactly would
trigger release of your pandemic reserve? Is it a net negative risk experience, is the
question?
Second question around persistency. If you can maybe give us some clarity or just some
guidance as to what's going on in persistency in products where you either haven't
offered premium relief or premium relief has ended. I'm just trying to understand is there
an underlying deterioration that maybe being masked by premium relief ?
And then the third question is, just your thoughts on maybe, if you can -- the Board's
thoughts on dividends for FY '20. Obviously, not holding you to commit to it now, but just
your ideas about if things stay where they are, if Santam's CBI provision plays out exactly
to be the right number, and your current capital position looks fairly robust, would you be
looking to pay a normal dividend in this sort of environment or not?

Page 4 of 20



Company N ame: Sanlam L td
Company Ticker: SL M SJ Equity
Date: 2020-12-09

And then maybe just lastly, if you can maybe give a bit of color around the ARC potential
deal that's still to come. Sort of what sort of capital do you expect to have to deploy
there? Is it in the billions of rands? Is it in a couple of hundred million, just to get an idea of
what we're talking about there?

FINAL

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Yes. Michael, thanks. Look, I'll have a swing at this, and I'll ask -- Lotz in particular, mortality
was always my least favorite subject, I have to say. So -- but I'll have a swing at it. Look,
you asked about where we think this thing will end up. I mean, you yourself know that the
deaths as of today are 22,000. It's growing very gradually. Where will it end up, who
knows? I think it all depends on whether there is a second wave and what really happens
within that.

Bloomberg Transcript

We can tolerate, as we said previously, a much higher level experience before it becomes
an issue for us. You quoted the number, I think, there of 27,000 or something like that. I
think we can sustain a considerably higher level before we start running into losses. And of
course, the big thing, Michael, as you know is what happens to sort of non-COVID deaths.
So it's very much a function of whether there are lockdowns and so on because those
also have an ameliorating impact. But I really don't see this as a material issue for the
group. As to whether we release the reserve or not, I think this is a matter of judgment
that we're going to have to come to at the year-end. We're going to have to consider
how many COVID deaths we had, and then we're going to have to look -- have to have a
look at that against the total mortality experience.
I think there's no question in my mind that this company certainly can have legitimately
pandemic reserves because this is not going to be the only pandemic that the business
ever faces. So I'm not really going to give you much of an answer other than to say, firstly,
I think the mortality is pretty much not a huge event in the first place. And secondly, we will
look at the overall mortality experience, including a near-term mortality at the end of the
year and make a judgment call on that.
In fact, we had quite an interesting conversation with our auditors recently on this topic,
who actually were saying they'd like to have an established set of rules. And I was trying to
explain to them how actually very difficult -- when we talk about a pandemic, it's by
definition a tail event. And therefore, to write an algorithm, which is what they would like
you to do is actually extremely difficult, and we'll have to exercise some judgment around
that.
On the persistency question, actually, we've had -- it's quite a lot of use, as you know,
early on of premium relief facilities and so on. Actually, 79%, I think, of our people who
took the option to use those facilities have actually started paying again. And so those
facilities are definitely not masking good persistency experience. And in any event, the
numbers involved were really small when you look at the whole base of clients. So I think
we're pretty clear that the persistency we're seeing is actually the persistency that we -it's a real number and we're very happy with that.

FINAL

On the question of dividends, our dividend policy is quite a simple one. Our dividends
follow earnings and we can have a small cover -- cash cover. Most of our earnings aside
from the -- some of the emerging Markets business are turned into cash, they convert to
cash very well. So as I said at half year, if you look at the delta in our operational earnings
to the prior year, that will give you a delta on the cash.
And if the dividend policy remains intact, then that will tell you what the dividend will do.
So you used the word, would we pay a normal dividend. I'm not sure what a normal
dividend is, but certainly, if we stick to the current dividend policy, which, as I understand it,
has been in place for many years, then you would expect to see a dividend that reduces
in line with the earnings of the business.

Bloomberg Transcript

You can understand as well that we are -- when you look at the Santam situation and you
take the context of ZAR3 billion odd provision in a year, and you know what its normal
earnings are, I think the prospects of dividends from that business are not very high. So
that's a factor for us in the equation because it's the other business, of course, where we
don't get cash up equal to earnings. We get a -- obviously, they retain some earnings. But
the dividend is a matter that we will carefully consider after the year-end. As you pointed
out, our capital position is very strong. And again, we're in an extraordinary period of time
and we're going to have to weigh everything up in thinking about the application of our
dividend policy when we get there.
On the ARC transaction, you asked what the quantum would be. It's not in the billions. It -I would -- I think it's -- I probably wouldn't be telling you anything you couldn't work out
with a little bit of effort. It would be less than ZAR1 billion. And actually, very likely not to
put much, if any, call on our capital because of actually how we structure in. So, yes, I hope
that answers that question for you.

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

Very clear. Thanks, Paul.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

But follow up on any of those points, if you want more detail or if I wasn't clear, Michael.

Q - Michael Christelis

Hi, Warwick. (Multiple Speakers) At some point, Warwick, you're going to have to beat
Michael Christelis to the first question.

FINAL

Q - Warwick Bam

{BIO 19921967 <GO>}

Yes, I don't know how he does that. He must start one before it even starts. (Multiple
Speakers). Your commentary around the Retail Mass new business sales, excluding
Capitec, you used the word significantly down for the first 10 months of 2019. How do you
-- what's the outlook considering the extension of the sort of second wave coming
through? And what can you do in the meantime to try and improve sales volumes in that
business. Can we go one question at a time, it should be easier.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, it's absolutely fine. So look, I think there are 2 issues in that market. One is obviously
the -- just the share issue of interacting with your client base has become more difficult.
And as you know, in many cases, it's about work site marketing rather than anything else.
So clearly, if the lockdown persists, that is, continues to be a problem and an issue for us,
but having said that, those guys are pushing really hard. At the end of the day, the people
who serve that market also need to put bread on the table.
So they're extremely motivated. And we've rolled out actually a lot of technology to assist
people. But -- so we're sort of straining every sinew that there is. But firstly, there are
some practical inhibitors. And this is where, of course, the Capitec thing has an advantage
because they've managed to keep branches open, so you can keep interacting with
customers. So that's been really helpful for us. The other thing, of course is, that the sales
in that area will depend a lot upon the impact on people's disposable incomes. So yes, I
think one's also got to just factor that into the whole equation as well. But it is going to be
tough, that segment of the market.

Q - Warwick Bam

{BIO 19921967 <GO>}

Thanks. And then your commentary around new business volumes in East Africa. Table 6
or the table on Page 6 discloses that your Q3 '20 and Q2 volumes were 51% and 37% of
Q1, respectively, for East Africa, but your commentary on Page 7 seems to contradict that,
just looking at life insurance volumes increasing 48% year-over-year, general insurance at
8% year-over-year, and then East Africa investment business has significant influence from
new institutional mandates. Just help me to understand, how page -- the table on Page 6
ties into that commentary?

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Okay. I'm going to have to -- I'm afraid, actually ask Grant whether -- or Abigail whether
they can help you. I'm afraid I cannot as I sit here.

A - Abigail Mukhuba

{BIO 20217730 <GO>}

Patrick, if it's okay with you, Warwick, if we can get back to you. I am also just trying to
follow the recon between the table and the other page.

No problem.

FINAL

A - Patrick Hartnic

{BIO 20482012 <GO>}

Maybe, Abigail, if -- or Warwick, if I can respond. So the table on -- where we say Q3
performance versus Q1, the 51%. In Q1, we actually had very good inflows in the first
quarter, where the -- and that's mostly in the investment business side. In the third
quarter, it wasn't that large. And that's why you can see that as a percentage of Q1, it's
only 51%, but year-to-date, it has been strong in East Africa. But if you want a little bit
more detail, we can get back to you on that as well.

Q - Warwick Bam

{BIO 19921967 <GO>}

Okay. No problem. So last year Q1 story then.

A - Patrick Hartnic

{BIO 20482012 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Warwick Bam

{BIO 19921967 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks. And then just the last one, just on the retail credit provisions in Shriram. I noticed
they've increased 58% since the 30th of June, and I appreciate some of that is currency,
but it looks like there's been a deterioration. If you can add some color to that provision?

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Yes. Look, I think maybe Patrick or Abigail, you can help. But the one snag with those
provisions is that we are working in arrear to them. So we always have a -- so we have a
lag. So what we report now is actually several months behind. I don't know Warwick, if you
can help with that or Abigail.

A - Abigail Mukhuba

{BIO 20217730 <GO>}

And also that in India, if you look at the lockdown profile, there was extended further, it
went into August period, so that's why you would have additional numbers there.

A - Patrick Hartnic

{BIO 20482012 <GO>}

Nothing to add to that.

Q - Warwick Bam

{BIO 19921967 <GO>}

Perfect. Thank you.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Yes. The business, as I understand it, from Heinie there, is actually beginning to trade up
very nicely now. But there is this unfortunate lag between what we show and their
accounting.

Q - Larissa Van Deventer

No worries. I have 2 quick questions, please. The first one is just a clarifying question on
the dividend. Your official policy is 1x cash earnings. For Santam, is it fair to assume that we
should bode in the dividend from Santam rather than the earnings number?

A - Paul Hanratty

Q - Larissa Van Deventer

{BIO 21570130 <GO>}

Thank you. And then you comment on hedging in the life book having provided downside
protection on the mark-to-market. Can you elaborate a little bit about what that hedging
is and what your hedging strategy is going forward?

FINAL

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Yes. Actually, Lotz, do you -- I hate having to answer everything. Do you want to answer
this or would you like me to answer it?

A - Mlondolozi Mahlangeni

{BIO 21927635 <GO>}

Yes. I can answer that, Paul. So in terms of the hedging that we apply for current year
liabilities, so there's a very close matching for those liabilities. So we don't take a lot of
market risk on hedging the current-year liabilities. So that's a one component. The other
component, in terms of our capital portfolio, we still maintain a position of matching our
subordinated debt, which is about ZAR1 billion with cash and near cash instruments. So
there's no market risk exposure there. And the rest of our required capital is backed by
the hedge equities position.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we've continued to maintain that hedge, which is both efficient from a capital
perspective as well as from a tax perspective. So we don't have double gearing of our
capital that's making the required capital of the life balance sheet. So from a market risk
exposure in terms of our current liabilities as well as our capital portfolio, we've
maintained our hedging strategies there.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

There's basically a cap in the color that we're running on the equities. Am I right, Lotz?

A - Unidentified Speaker
That is correct, Paul. That is correct.

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Francois Du Toit from
Renaissance Capital. Please go ahead, Francois.

Q - Francois Du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

Hi, guys, thanks for the chance to ask questions. So first question around the business
interruption plans for Santam and also the Beirut explosion. Assuming that you've correctly
assessed the potential liability for the insurance companies, have you got a sense of what
the reinsurance recovery level will be  I mean have you taken that into account in the
provision? I guess, the outcomes are fairly wide in that regard as well. But let's assume
that your own assessment of the primary insurance claim is accurate, can you give us a
sense of how much you expect will be recovered? And how your provision compares with
that? Have you been conservative, in other words, in the recovery potential that you've
got from reinsurance? That's the first question. Let's go one at time as well.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Francois, it might be just interesting. Did you sit on a call with Heinie now on this subject or
not?

Q - Francois Du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

FINAL

No, I wasn't in that call.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Okay, okay. So maybe just to explain to you that, actually, for what on the surface can
appear to be an unbelievably simple matter, it's actually quite complicated. And it's
complicated because the legal cases are around a number of different aspects on this
business continuity.

Bloomberg Transcript

They're around -- effectively, the first thing which most people focus on is cause. Is there a
legitimate claim or isn't there. And that may seem like quite a simple thing, but what the
courts have ruled, and I'm giving you a very layman's version of it, is that because this is an
infectious disease, insurers should have anticipated that government would take some
form of action. And therefore, the action itself is inseparable or indivisible from the
infection in or near your premises. So that's a very critical thing because it then becomes
very relevant to the reinsurance, because if in fact the lockdown is the cause of the claim
as opposed to the infection, you then have a defined date.
And the way the reinsurance works is it's based on a catastrophe. And a catastrophe is an
event that happens in a 7-day period. So -- but if that legal argument ends up being ruled
in a different way, you can see that -- if the cause has to be an infection in your premises,
then the lockdown is no longer a relevant date. So I'll give you the particular Santam
matter that's being heard, in fact the claim was about the COVID infection at around
about the time of the lockdown. So that particular one is fairly simple, it doesn't really
matter in that instance.
But there's another client and I won't tell you who it is, for example, and they run a game
reserve and that particular business, obviously, came to a halt with the lockdown. But they
were no COVID infections anywhere near that game reserve for a period of 6 weeks. And
then somewhere in the vicinity, there was an infection and so there's a claim. Now the
question is, is it a claim or not? And if you read all the court judgments, it's not clear
whether the courts would regard that as a claim or not, because (inaudible) and then
secondly, from a reinsurance point of view, would they pay up or not? And would this fall
within an aggregation or wouldn't it?
So it's an unbelievably wide, both at the gross and at the net level as to what the claims
can be. And so what the Santam management have done is they have taken a view in
setting up their provision, which is effectively a best estimate of where they think the thing
will land at the end of the day. But there are still numerous court cases, both here and
abroad that will determine both the gross and the net claim. And the net result could be
lower, it could be higher than the provision. But their provision is -- I suppose it's at this -with the knowledge that we have to date, it's a sensible number. If we were to finalize the

accounts today, everything we know today, it would probably be our best guess as to
what the provision would be.

FINAL

Q - Francois Du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

Thank you. Second question just around the change in the provision for (inaudible) in
Santam. That's increased further since 30th of June. I think one of your peers recently
reported and said that they believe the provision was no longer needed, basically it was
reversing the results. Why is it increasing still here? If you can -- is there a specific default
attached to this?

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Are you talking about a ZAR7 million delta from the half year?

Q - Francois Du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

Yes, it's increased -- yes, ZAR7 million increased by about -- is it -- I think the
environment's obviously improved a little bit. And I'm comparing it with your peer that
suggested that the improvement is so much so that there could be a release of that.
Maybe can you comment on what will happen to that at the end of the year, more
importantly?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Yes, within Santam, where you see provisions for doubtful debts and credit defaults,
these are around specific people that we have credit exposures to. So our peers will have
potentially a completely different set of people and each of these will be case-specific
provisions. So a general environment improvement, yes, in theory, could reduce this. My
expectation would not be -- and if I were you, I would be taking up prudency on that, I
would not be assuming that any of that'll reverse on an improvement in the environment.

Q - Francois Du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

Thank you. And similarly, also on the, let's say, North and West Africa investment variances
deteriorated since the 30th of June.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Yes, they did.

Q - Francois Du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

What would -- what market conditions would be needed to reverse that. Maybe give us a
sense of the exposures they -- got to where it is.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Yes, the stock markets actually went south after June. So if you take, for example, the
Moroccan index, it actually went -- it went south from 30th of June, but actually after the

Page 13 of 20

end of October, it has recovered again. So again, that's going to be driven purely by
equity markets in those places.

FINAL

Q - Francois Du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

Float, just separate to that. The float (inaudible) was minus 115, but the investment
variances, specifically in North and West Africa, that's -- the investment variances normally
talk to life insurance, right? And so the (multiple speakers)

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

A similar issue, yes. The float, obviously, is a very significant item the -- in your short-term
business in Morocco and Ivory Coast, whereas for life insurance, as you know, I think we're
all quite happy that these things ride out over a long period of time.

Q - Francois Du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

Okay. So the investment variance should also improving in write outs towards the end of
the year with markets improving?

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. I mean just to give you an idea, the Moroccan free float All Share index has gone up
10% since the end of October. So it's a (technical difficulty) it's a market I don't know, but
it's a thin and small market. So it's -- yes. I mean you'll know what that means.

Q - Francois Du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. Just one more question on your provisions. You note provisions will have a
negative impact I think in the (inaudible) business -- provisions for expenses, rather. I just
wanted to get a sense of why that's necessary given the positive experience given the
positive experience there and just steadily over time in that business? Is there a specific
project that you're embarking on?

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Yes. I think we highlighted at the half year that what happened is that with a very radical
need to digitalize the sales force quickly, there is a huge project to invest in the
digitalization of the front end of the sales force, and that's what that's about.
And it's quite interesting that actually when you talk to that, Warwick asked earlier about
the Retail Mass sales and so on, and I was explaining the difficulty of re-engaging. Actually
what's interesting in the affluent market is that even though they can see clients now, a lot
of them are actually moving to seeing clients and probably in the long-term are going to
start seeing them much more using technology solutions, which is quite interesting. So
mimmicking, in a sense, all the behaviors that we're probably going to adopt as well in our
working lines. So that's -- yes, the long term -- basically in operating model.

You've given us a sense of the release pattern of -- this question in the release of the
pandemic provision. Is it similar in terms of the asset mismatch provision? Or is there
tighter rules around the release there? And I do see that, that, obviously -- part of that
was released first half of the year and some of that release has been reversed.

FINAL

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Yes, if you're talking about the credit spread losses, that is a very mechanistic system that
we set up for that gate -- that we set up for that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, guys, sorry. Just one more from my side on the Nigerian business. I mean there's quite
a lot of commentary around Nigerian bond yields having moved quite significantly. Can
you talk to me, just what does that mean for the valuation of that business in your GEV as
to where we are today relative to perhaps where it was in June? Is this going to be a big
impact, and obviously, relative to what you paid for that business? And then how far are
you down the line of finding a buyer for a stake there?

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Yes. Okay. So Michael, you know me, most things I'm happy to answer. This Nigerian bond,
I tell you what, I don't understand why the bond yields have done what they've done and I
understand even less about the impacts on VNB and embedded value, and so on
because it actually makes -- when you get a set of economic variables that in relation to
each other make no sense whatsoever. So I think we all accept you get inflation, your
bond yield needs to be a bit more and your equity risk premium a bit more and so on.
And so we've all got that kind of mental model. Now this thing comes along and it just
turns everything on its head completely. So I -- with that caveat that I do not understand,
and it has been an absolute nightmare to get on top of it. I'm going to ask Roux. Roux if
you don't understand it either because you've just joined us. I'm sure you do understand it
because you're smarter than me, but are you able to answer that or do we want to take
this offline with Michael.

A - Robert Roux

{BIO 18773329 <GO>}

I can answer a part of it around what has happened to the bond yields in Nigeria. And then
the question -- and then the extent to which that has affected new business volumes in
VNB. But the question on -- the M&A related question on prospects for (Multiple

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

I'll answer the bit about finding a buyer. So that's the easy question. Hard part is explaining
the impact of these bond yields on the embedded value and the value of the new
business and whether the actual mathematical implication of using those numbers actually
is logical or not because I think that's the thing I was trying to allude to Michael is that you
can get an answer, but whether it actually passes a common-sense test, that's another
question altogether. But I don't know if you can help with that technical side, I will answer
the question about the buyer?

A - Robert Roux

{BIO 18773329 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So I guess on the technical side, I mean, the Nigerian bond yields have been
artificially pushed down, and that was driven by excess liquidity in the market, where
nonbank financial institutions or nonbank entities are not allowed to buy debentures from
the Central Bank of Nigeria. So what that meant there was a lot of liquidity in the market
and that ended up finding its way into government bond. So the 10-year yield in the
Nigerian market, so the naira, the local currency market was -- has dropped to about
between 4% and that's in an economy with double-digit inflation. So you've got negative
real bond deals in the Nigerian market. So what that has meant is that for businesses like
the annuity market, it has meant that it's been very difficult to get new business volumes,
given the level of the bond yield.
For some of our savings business in Nigeria, it also meant that because of the reduction in
the long-term prospects for investment returns, if you use the current bond yield as a
base, it has meant that the fees that you add on that type of business for actual valuation
purposes have also been depressed. I mean that's kind of in essence a margin business,
so you get a margin in terms of the expected investment returns that you are earning.
Now in terms where we are now, we know -- we do know that the yields are being
artificially depressed.
So if you were to think that we are to make from a VNB perspective in terms of setting
the actual basis, everything is anchored on a risk-free care, and we know that all -- that's
artificial. So it's -- this is affecting all the market players in Nigeria. So what that has meant
is like in any other business, you've got depressed bond yields like we currently have,
then you get the negative impact on the value of new business and the savings business.
The other element is on the annuity business, there are cut-off requirements that are risk
sensitive. So you have to hold 30% of the value of your liabilities as capital and regardless
of how well managed you are. So that has also meant that for annuity business, not only
the value of your liabilities increase because of the low bond yields, it also means that the
amount of capital that you have to hold to pay those liabilities is also fairly high. So that
also then -- it depresses your embedded value as well as your VNB.
So those are some of aspects, I mean, we have spoken to a few of the market players
and some other banks to kind of look at potential solutions. But that's essentially what's
been happening in the Nigerian market. So Paul, I mean, that's -- I don't know if that
covered everything you wanted me to cover?

Yes, yes. No that's great. Thanks Lotz so much. Yes, Michael, in terms of finding a buyer,
we are optimistic about being able to do that in the new year, so no real concerns on that
front. But I think you'll have got a sense that indeed the group equity value on that
business could be reported as lower, when we eventually get to it. Whether that makes
sense or not, that's a different question.

Thank you. The final question comes (inaudible).

Hi, Paul.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

(inaudible) hi.

Q - Analyst
Hi there, Paul. Just a question -- and coming from a generalist, but just from a clarification
perspective, so you also provide this net result from financial services pre-COVID impacts.
So quite simplistically, if we assume that your provision is accurate and it plays out
accordingly, then let's say the new base in earnings from -- on a financial services
perspective for next year, does that imply we're back at, let's say 18% or whatever growth
from a 2019 perspective or do we start off with this minus 21% that you recorded at the
end of October? Just to get an extent of what the implied bounce back is post these
provisions.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Yes. Look it's a really -- that's a great question. It's definitely not that you can take 2019 at
22% and that's now the base going into the new year, that would be absolutely the wrong

answer. It might be worth us spending a bit of time off-line with you on that. But because I
myself am struggling on the fly to think hard to how to explain it, yes, in a very logical and - because you've asked a very simple and very -- yes, just -- it's a straightforward common
sense question. But I know the answer is not that the base is now going to be up for the
start of next year to 2019 plus 20% odd. It's actually more like going to be 2019 itself is
kind of a good base to think about in fact. And (multiple speakers)

Q - Analyst
Okay. But that implies 18% growth, right?

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Sorry, 18% growth on what?

Q - Analyst
No. I'm just -- if 2019 is the base on 2020, and 2020 is currently like 21% lower than 2019
and that's already a reasonable recovery. And then the assumption -- and then obviously,
the assumptions are, you need to take a view on how the future plays out relative to the
provisions and obviously, investment market spreads, et cetera.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Exactly. So you've had a kind of a V, basically, in this year.

Q - Analyst
Okay. Got you. Okay. Thanks. I'll take this offline with, Grant.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Yes. I think if you've got any doubt, please take it up with Grant because I'd hate to be
20% odd either way, and it's hard on a phone call, it's great with a piece of paper.

Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from (inaudible) Denker Capital. Please go ahead,
Ian.

Q - Analyst
Hi, Paul and Abigail. Thanks for the time. I'm very aware that this question also comes from
a non-actuary and it refers to the pandemic reserve. And just to understand that most of
your peers have made a one-off provision and it covers different time periods, but there
are different elements to those provisions, it's not only claims for life, but it's also some of
them include persistency, some of them include costs in there. And I'm just trying to
understand the reason why you didn't make those provisions is because of the pandemic
reserve. But does that pandemic reserve also apply to persistency and additional costs
over and above simple claims from a life point of view. And if not, why have you not made
provisions for those elements that your peers have?

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. So look, to be absolutely clear, when we set up a pandemic reserve that anticipates
higher mortality, but also morbidity. So I don't want to get too technical here, but -- so it
could cover things like disability as well. It's any -- it's set up specifically for the risk
elements pertaining to an infectious disease of this nature, but it is not designed in any
sense to cover higher expenses or persistency.
So we ourselves dealt separately with persistency. And we made an assumption that the
economic downturn would be such that it would be equivalent over time to 5% of our
policies going off books in one shot. Now in the case of Sanlam, it's a bit technical, but
because of how we do our reserving, that doesn't impact our P&L, but it does impact our
embedded value because you're assuming the 5% of the future profits on those policies
that you're putting through a mass lapse scenario off the books. It also drives up your
assumed unit cost per policy, because you've now only got 95% of the policies that you
had before, so you divide the same expenses by a bigger base.

Bloomberg Transcript

So the -- so we had a pandemic reserve already. So we didn't need anything. We didn't
need to add anything for -- from a risk point of view. And then from a persistency point of
view, we specifically put in the mass lapse, and that happened to also have an impact on
our expenses. But why -- it's very hard always to answer, so why didn't we have -- why
were the impacts different to other people, it's really hard to note. It maybe because their
reserving may have had a little less margin for error in it than ours. That's the only logical
conclusion I can draw.

Q - Analyst
Thanks, Paul. That helps. Thanks a lot.
