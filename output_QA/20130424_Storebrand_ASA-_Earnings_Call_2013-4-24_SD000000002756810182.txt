{BIO 17132188 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Welcome to Storebrand's First Quarter 2013 conference call. My name is
Trond Eriksen, I'm Head of Investor Relations at Storebrand. Together with me I have
Group CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad; Group CFO, Lars Loddesol; and Finance Director
Sigbjorn Birkeland. As we have notiﬁed, the slide presentation will be running on the
webcast available on storebrand.no/ir.
In the presentation today, Odd Arild will ﬁrst give an overall view of the development in
Q1. Lars will take us through the numbers, before Odd Arild will wrap it up. After the
presentation, the operator will open up for questions.
To be able to ask questions, you will need to dial in to the conference call. I will leave the
word to Storebrand CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad. We shall start the slides presentation on
slide number 2.

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by looking at the highlights from the quarter
on slide number 2.
For the past six months, we have talked a great deal about our measures to meet the new
regulatory changes, a low interest rate environment and a pension market in transition.
We have focused our measures around cost programs, increased price increases and
conversion from guaranteed to non-guaranteed products.

FINAL

In this quarter, we see a concrete proof that the measures have delivered eﬀects, both on
the result and on the balance sheet. Income has increased. We have delivered a nominal
cost reduction from last quarter. And increased premiums on non-guaranteed products
by 17% compared to First Quarter 2012.
If you look closer on the result, we see a Group result of NOK552 million. The income is
strengthened by increased administration income, price increases on interest rate
guarantee and growth within DC and unit linked products. And the cost program
proceeds are on schedule.
Within operations, we have completed several actions in the quarter. Among others, we
have sold the NOK1.2 billion guaranteed municipality portfolio in Sweden. In this quarter,
we also have the new mortality tables from the Financial Supervisory Authority in Norway,
in March.
We have estimated a total reservation requirement of NOK11.5 billion, of which NOK4.3
billion already was reserved in 2011 and 2012. The reservation has to be completed within
six years, including this present year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking at the balance sheet, we see a strong growth in assets under management;
NOK12 billion in the quarter. And that is despite a NOK6 billion transfer from public sector
DB, as announced earlier.
A strong growth in the balance sheet, but an even stronger growth in the solvency ratio,
which has grown from 162% to 165% in the quarter.
There is also increase in the buﬀer capital of NOK1.5 billion in the quarter, of which
NOK0.7 billion is available for longevity reservation, leaving us up to a sum of NOK5
billion in reservation for longevity at the end of the quarter.
If we then move to slide number 3, looking at the results from the diﬀerent business
segments, we see that the underlying results are strengthened. In the First Quarter in
2012, there was a strong ﬁnancial market, which results in a very positive result for SPP.
The SPP result in the First Quarter of 2013 is also inﬂuenced by a strong ﬁnancial result,
but not at the same degree as we saw last year.
In this quarter, we see improved administration results in Norway and in Swedish Life
business, combined with increase of fee for interest rate guarantees, which is the main
driver for the positive improvement in the business.
It seems like this element is the explanation why the result is approximately 10%, or
NOK50 million higher than the conservative analysts' estimates. With that said, I will now
give the word to CFO, Lars Loddesol, who will give a bit more insight into the numbers.

FINAL

Thank you, Odd Arild. We show solid results from the Storebrand Life Insurance Group,
with revenue growth from increased administration reserves and reserve growth, as well
as a stabilization of the cost level and, indeed, the cost reduction over the last couple of
quarters. This improves the administration result to NOK55 million, as compared to
NOK20 million last year.
The risk result is weakened in the quarter by the disability insurance related to deﬁned
contribution coverage. What is happening here is that people become disabled pretty
much as expected.
However, we have an estimate and an expectation as to how many people that have left
the working life comes back into working life after a period of time, called reactivation;
and that assumption has been changed, and we have strengthened reserves accordingly
in the order of -- in the magnitude of about NOK40 million. The ﬁnancial result is fairly
strong as a result of good ﬁnancial result in the Company portfolio.
And I'd like to emphasize the proﬁt from risk and interest rate guarantee at NOK178
million is a signiﬁcant improvement from last year and shows that the price increases that
we did last year, both in the public sector and the private sector are guaranteed
portfolios, have come through and improved proﬁtability of this business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Through suﬃcient returns in the diﬀerent portfolios we have managed to build buﬀers, of
which about NOK0.7 billion, or NOK700 million, is going to be available for longevity
reserves at the end of the year. This comes in addition to the NOK4.3 billion we have
already.
Moving over to SPP, the administration result is stable compared to the First Quarter last
year, but is a signiﬁcant improvement over the third and Fourth Quarter, as a result of
income measures and cost program.
Risk result is more at the normalized level after a number of good years in the past. And
the ﬁnancial result is deemed to be strong, although weaker than the First Quarter last
year, as Odd Arild already alluded to.
It seems like the ﬁnancial result is also somewhat stronger than expected by analysts in
their previews, and the explanation for that is, ﬁrst and foremost, credit contraction where
it's diﬃcult to assess from the outside the exact nature of our portfolio.
And we have had a good development in terms of both duration and picking of papers,
which has given a result which is somewhat better than you could have seen from the
outside during the quarter. However, this will ﬂuctuate during the year, so some of it may
be reversed at a later stage.
Worth to notice also is that the indexation fee has been brought to the income statement
by NOK20 million (sic; see slide ﬁve "NOK29 million").

FINAL

As you are familiar with, this is a binary situation that where if we have suﬃcient
consolidation in the end of the Third Quarter we can index the portfolios and take out an
indexation fee. And if the consolidation is insuﬃcient we cannot do it. So far the
consolidation is more than suﬃcient to take out the indexation fee and we have, therefore,
taken out the quarter of the total full-year indexation fee.
Solvency ratio, at 250%, we deem to be strong, has been strengthened during the quarter
by the results in the quarter, as well as a somewhat higher interest rate level in Sweden.
Moving over to Asset Management, the cost program is on plan, the cost, while equal to
what it was in the First Quarter 2012, is signiﬁcantly below the last quarters in 2012. And
the operating revenue is strengthened both by strong sales and by transaction charges or
income.
The sales have been good, especially in Sweden, where SPP funds have sold funds to
other third-party channels and to customers in Sweden, and we've had a good
development there.

Bloomberg Transcript

The net performance fees are negative in the quarter, that's due to periodic eﬀects from
last year. However, there has been a good return in excess of benchmarks, which lays the
foundation for taking out performance fees that we usually do in the -- or that we do in the
Fourth Quarter.
There has also been a good volume growth with assets under management increasing by
NOK12 million -- NOK12 billion to NOK454 billion. And you will remember that we've
moved NOK6 billion in public sector funds out in Norway during the quarter. So despite
that, we still have NOK12 billion in increase on assets under management. However, it
should be said that NOK8 billion of the NOK12 billion is related to a translation eﬀect by -since the Swedish kroner has strengthened during the quarter.
Moving over to the Bank on page number 7, we see an improved net interest margin to
1.28%. We see a reduced cost level. We have one eﬀect that is slightly change, which is
the mark-to-market eﬀect from ﬁxed interest rate loans, which gives a negative eﬀect in
the quarter of NOK12 million.
When we issue mortgages with a ﬁxed rate we hedge them with a swap. Since the swap
is, from an accounting point of view, valued at real value, we also have to value the loans
at real value to get the accounting hedging eﬀect.
When we have increased our spreads, our proﬁtability on these loans by increasing the
ﬁxed rate, indirectly we have lowered the value of the existing loans on the balance sheet.
And the NOK12 million is a net present value of the lesser value of existing loans. In eﬀect,
that means that we will be able to book these NOK12 million back again, in terms of a
higher margin in the quarters and years ahead.

FINAL

Other operating income has also weakened by a reduced activity within corporate loans
and corporate lending, which is according to plan and according to the strategy of
reducing this area.
Moving over to Insurance, we have a 9% premium growth within the Insurance unit. We
have a stable cost level at 19%. And despite the fact that the First Quarter is usually a weak
one in Norway, it's pretty cold and slippery here, we have had a pretty strong seasonal
claims ratio of 68%.
Moving over to page number 9, Storebrand Group operational reporting. I'm not going to
take you through all of these numbers, but I want to give you a heads up that this is the
reporting format that we will use from the Second Quarter onwards, and we presented
this brieﬂy during our Investor and Analyst Update in March.
You see that we split in columns the non-guaranteed savings, the insurance and risk
business, and the guaranteed savings. This way you can see what kind of nature income
and cost relate to, and how we manage the business in order to create values going
forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

If you look at -- on the right-hand side, fee and administration income, up from NOK978
million to NOK1,050 million, that's an increase of 7.4%.
And if you look a little bit further down here at the operational cost level from NOK841
million to NOK844 million, it basically delivers on the promise that we've given you in the
past; that the fee and administration income is going to grow by 2 times to 3 times GDP,
and we will manage the operational cost line where nominal costs will stay ﬂat.
And we will revert with more details on this reporting format in one-to-one meetings
before the Second Quarter. And this will be, as I said, the way we report in the Second
Quarter.
Finally, the key ﬁgures on page number 10. You will see that the result development
continues with a result before proﬁt sharing and loan losses being the main value
contributor, and slowly growing.
Earnings per share, at NOK1.3 in the quarter; here we have a 19% tax charge. However, the
taxes will not be paid -- payable, as we still have a large tax-loss carry forwards.
Solvency ratio and solvency capital have been built in the quarter, as well as customer
buﬀers, both in Norway and Sweden. And with that I give the word back to Odd Arild
Grefstad.

Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Thank you, Lars. And I'd just like to sum up the quarter from our perspective.

Page 5 of 15



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2013-04-24

First of all, we have been able build buﬀers in the quarter, NOK1.5 billion. And the result
and the buﬀers, all together, have led to a situation where we're able to increase the
reservation for longevity with NOK700 million in the quarter.

FINAL

Second, there is a good revenue growth in the quarter, both through increased
administration income, increased prices for interest rate guarantee, and a strong premium
growth within non-guaranteed products.
Third, the measures in the cost program are starting to show also in the IFRS accounts,
with a nominal cost reduction from the Fourth Quarter, 2012.
And ﬁnally, management actions to shift the balance sheet from guaranteed to nonguaranteed products have yield substantial results over the last six months. We have been
able to move NOK6 billion of reserves from Norwegian public sector DB. We have
converted NOK2.6 billion by contracting individual customers in -- contacting individual
customers in Norway and Sweden.
And ﬁnally, we have sold our NOK1.2 billion public sector DB portfolio in Sweden. And all
together that means that we have shifted the balance sheet with NOK10 billion out our
guaranteed business over the last six months. Thank you.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions)

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Peter Eliot, Berenberg Bank. I had three questions, mostly around ﬂows, actually. The ﬁrst
one was on -- I note your comment that you haven't sold any new guaranteed products,
but I know there was a very large APE number of NOK358 million into guaranteed
products. And I wasn't fully -- I didn't fully understand exactly what had caused that, so I
was wondering if you could touch on that?
Secondly, in terms of the net transfers that you're achieving out of individual portfolios,
again you've made good progress. But just looking at the last three months or so, maybe
the rate to transfer has slowed a little bit, and I'm just wondering if you could comment on
whether you've achieved low-hanging fruit, or how much more there is to go there?
Then thirdly, on the Insurance business, again very good growth in premiums looking year
on year; if you look at Q1 on Q4 last year, though, it's down slightly. And I was just

Page 6 of 15



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2013-04-24

wondering if there was any reason for that, and what your outlook for that business is, still
going forward. Thank you very much.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay, if I start with the ﬁrst two; you can maybe take the Insurance afterwards.
First of all, when it comes to guaranteed business, there is an inﬂow of some guaranteed
business in the First Quarters, sold in the Fourth Quarter. It's important to say that we have
been able to price up when we do this, but there is some elements when we do combine
DC/DB transfer to Storebrand. We also have taken on some new guaranteed products.
That is with our other type of pricing, compared to what we have used to see.
And I'll also add that after we have seen the new tables for longevity, with also the equity
portion that needs to be supported into that increase in buﬀers, we have restricted it even
further. So you will not see very much inﬂow of this kind of guarantees, going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

When you come to the net transfer, it's, I would say, that the situation in Norway and
Sweden are a bit diﬀerent. In Norway, we have been taking, as you said, some of the lowhanging fruits in the new portfolio. And there will be a lower increase in that number for
the months to come, before, I would say, we are fully open for converting paid-up policies
into paid-up policy during the investment choice.
That is the large market, and a large opportunity. Going forward, that is important for both
our customers and, of course, for us to transfer. There the law is past, but there is still
waiting for the ﬁnal go from the Minister of Finance before we are open to do that
transfer.
In Sweden there is another situation. There, most of the portfolios already are open for
through transfer, and we expect to see strong transfer numbers in Sweden, also going
forward. Insurance?

A - Lars Aa Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Yes, you are right that there has been a slight lowering of premiums earned in the First
Quarter on insurance, but the trend is quite clear, and continues strong -- continued
growth. And we expect a continued growth throughout this year. We see that there will
be, obviously, not a totally straight line, but it should -- the trend should be clear.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Great, thank you very much.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Matti Ahokas, Handelsbanken. Three questions from my side as well, please.

Page 7 of 15



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2013-04-24

Firstly, on the tax rate you've previously guided on 20% to 25% tax rate, and now Q1 was
20%. Is this the kind of expected run rate we should forecast, going forward? Or was there
something special, and it still should be somewhat higher than 20%?

FINAL

The second question is regarding the movement on the DB and paid-up policies during
the quarter. How much of the NOK4.2 billion decrease in the DB was from the public
sector side, and why were the paid-up policies up by almost NOK3.2 billion on that side?
And the last question is regarding the admin result in Norway; was the highest ever.
Obviously, talk about some of the initiatives, but is this a kind of run rate, or was this just
an exceptionally high in the First Quarter, at NOK55 million? Thanks.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

If I start on the tax rate, we have guided previously on 20% to 25%. As you are aware, the
tax rate in Sweden was lowered last year, and that should mean that we should end up in
the lower end of that range rather than in the upper part of that range.
At the same time, we will continue to do our utmost to optimize the tax situation, and if we
can continue to stay below 20% we will. But I don't think we should change the guiding,
as such.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Aa Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

When it comes to the movement on deﬁned beneﬁt, yes, you're right that what you see
there as in -- I guess you got the numbers from a table on page 16 in the supplementary
information, Matti?

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Exactly.

A - Lars Aa Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

And what you see there are paid-up on the line called, Other, is movements from the DB
skips into paid-up. And also what you see on the Other, on the DB, is both the -- or is
mainly the transfer out of the public sector. And you will also see there on some, or what
you call insurance claims, is the movement from the DB to the paid-up, but it's diﬃcult to
see the exact one-to-one relationship, if you like.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Okay. Then the admin result in Norway.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

The admin result in Norway, what we have said is that we will continue to grow the top
line, and we have a cost program in order to reduce the cost level.

Page 8 of 15



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2013-04-24

And you will see the full eﬀect of the cost program during 2014. And you will see
successively, quarter by quarter, eﬀects in the rest of the business, but with a full eﬀect
2014. So while the number is going to, again, not be a straight line, (will frustrate)
somewhat, I expect this number to grow rather than decrease, as we look forward.

FINAL

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. Thanks.

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

David Andrich, Morgan Stanley. I was just wondering, Odd Arild said some -- you were
giving some guidance for the -- sorry, in Norway, some guidance on the price of interest
rate guarantee and proﬁt risk, on that line going -- coming down, going forward, from the
NOK178 million number.
And I was just wondering if you'd give a bit of color on what's going to be the driver
there? I guess it's mainly going to be the fact that you're having these public plans
leaving, and people reacting to the price increases that have been coming through. And I
was just wondering if we'd see further increases cycle through and oﬀset that volume
somewhat? Or whether it'd be purely the volume driving that down?

Bloomberg Transcript

In Asset Management, I was wondering if the trend that we've been seeing the past
several quarters, towards the lower margin products, if that starts to reverse at all? Or
whether that's been continuing?
Then ﬁnally, in terms of the Bank; the other lending that -- the corporate lending that's in
the other operating income, which comes out as negative NOK16 million, I was just
wondering, is that something -- is that a trend that we can see continuing as you guys shift
away from the corporate lending? Thank you.

A - Lars Aa Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

When it comes to the -- if I will start with the price of the interest rate guarantees, on the
NOK178 million this quarter, it's higher than what we expect next quarter and the
following quarters.
One of the reason for that is that we, in the First Quarter, have had larger reserves than
what we expect, going forward, as some of these funds will have moved out during the
following quarters; amongst others the NOK6 billion in the municipality sector.
It's diﬃcult to be very precise, but we expect this element of (inaudible) to be between
NOK80 million and NOK100 million compared to last year, which means you should see
this ﬁgure coming down maybe NOK10 million/NOK15 million over the next two/three
quarters.

Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

FINAL

And in terms of the pricing, obviously, we will look at -- we price this element during the
late summer and the price is implemented at yearend.
So you should see us continue to optimize prices, depending on market conditions,
interest rate level and other issues during the fall, and with an implementation as of
yearend and then that will set a new level for next year. And our ambition is, obviously, to
continue to make to make some money on this element.

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Great. Thank you.

A - Lars Aa Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

When it comes to the other result in the Bank, of minus NOK16 million in this quarter,
several of those was the mark-to-market eﬀect from ﬁxed interest rate loans. There was
also a small element there from some other mark-to-market eﬀects.

Bloomberg Transcript

But generally, you are right, David, as we are building down the corporate book in the
Bank some of the revenues attached to swaps and issuing new loans will go away. And
hence, we expect lower other operating income in the Bank going forward than what you
have seen in the previous quarters.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

But not minus NOK16 million going forward, more in the range of zero.

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Right, yes, that makes sense.

A - Lars Aa Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

You had one more question on Asset Management?

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Yes, on Asset Management, the trend towards lower margin products that we've seen in
the past several quarters, I was just wondering if that's started to settle or reverse itself at
all, given the recent market experience?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

No. We continue to see that people are switching out of equity mandate into ﬁxed income
mandate and de-risking their portfolios. However, on the other side of the coin, so to say,
we see volume growth and we see eﬀects from the cost program. So we are adapting the

Page 10 of 15



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2013-04-24

business to those changes and we, therefore, expect to be making a lot of money in the
Asset Management business this year than we did last year.

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

FINAL

Great, thank you very much.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

We also see a very strong growth when it comes to fund structures and sales of mutual
funds, especially in the Swedish market; it's been a very good market for that so far this
quarter.

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Great, thank you very much.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Blair Stewart, BofA Merrill Lynch. I've got three questions. Firstly, on the longevity
provisioning, I think you said that you had NOK700 million potential to add to the NOK4.3
billion that was already done, so that you were up at NOK5 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

I just wondered how you think about that NOK700 million. Where is that coming from,
because when I look at your buﬀers, there's signiﬁcantly more than that? So if you'd just
explain how you get to the NOK700 million?
And as well as that, if the -- if markets continue to be healthy and you're able to build
these buﬀers up more quickly, is there any impact on the 20% that we expect the
shareholder cost to be charged, or should we just think of that cost to shareholders as a
hard number that won't change? That's the ﬁrst question.
And the second one is on the disability reserve strengthening, a small number I think,
NOK40 million. I just wondered how conﬁdent are you that that's done and there won't
be any more additions required?
And thirdly, you talked about the opportunity for paid-up transfers as we go through the
year and as the rules get clariﬁed. I just wondered if there was any more thinking on what
the situation needs to be for those paid-up contracts, in terms of the longevity
provisioning. Do the longevity provisions need to be fully up to speed before any transfer
can exist, or can be transacted rather? Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I start with the longevity provisions. You are absolutely right; we have higher building of
buﬀers in this quarter compared to this NOK0.7 billion number. The way we are thinking
about it is that there is a surplus in the book return that gives approximately NOK100
million in the reservation in the ﬁrst place.

Page 11 of 15



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2013-04-24

Then we have an increase in market value adjustment reserve (NOK1.7 billion), but that is
for the whole portfolio. So we estimate that around NOK500 million of that is available for
using for the DB portfolio and the paid-up policy portfolio.

FINAL

And on top of that there is the unallocated result, around couple of hundred million; that
also -- a part of that will be used for longevity reservations. So a combination of these
three elements will then give you approximately NOK0.7 billion in total.
And Blair, you're familiar with the fact that these happen at yearend, so we only make
some indications and we don't book all the return on a quarterly basis; that is done
towards the end of the year so that you can do the yearend allocations in the optimum
way.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

But how should we think -- that's the NOK700 million that was increased to the market
value adjustment reserve, but how should we think about the NOK1 billion that was there
before we started this year?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well of course, all of these buﬀers, as we also said when we was in the Analyst Update
Day, these buﬀers will be available. So if we do realize these buﬀers over the P&L, then
that will increase the book return and will be available to use for buﬀer building. But this
was more to give an insight of the creation of values during this quarter that will and can
be available for building longevity reservation.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. And the guidance on the shareholder cost, still the same?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Well on the shareholder cost, what is important is, of course, what kind of portion of the
reservation that will be taken from the paid-up policy portfolio versus the DB portfolio. If
we are able to create a surplus return area in the paid-up policy portfolio, then it will be
very much a proﬁt sharing that is not booked. That will be a large part of this 20%.
But if we have used really the surplus in the DB portfolio, then it will be more tangible to
(show) as a reduction in the price for interest rate guarantee in the quarter by quarter this
is done. So I would say this ﬂuctuation, or elements between DB and the paid-up policies,
will be important to see how the ﬁnal outcome compared to estimates and expected
return will be, is important.

Sorry to come back on that again, you said, I think, earlier that you would expect roughly
half of the shareholder cost to be met by the paid-up book, so lack of proﬁt sharing, and

half would be attributed to the DB through lower fee income. Are you still guiding
towards that 50/50 split?

FINAL

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I think that is a fair estimate. But we are seeing that DB portfolio is higher than the -- the
paid-up policy portfolio is higher than the DB portfolio, especially with the move out of
the public sector. So in that respect, as we are creating the surplus return in the paid-up
policy, there might be somewhat higher contribution from the paid-up policies. But I
would say the estimate of 50/50 is a good estimate to start with.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay, yes.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And we won't know more before we get the ﬁnal regulations on this. And there are still a
number of things that are uncertain there that could improve the outcome somewhat.

On disability, we are certain that the current statistics that we have have been reﬂected in
the numbers that we've now set aside. However, every quarter we do a new assessment of
what we experience in terms of death, disability and long life. And every quarter, we
update the reserves to reﬂect our best view of the world.
So I cannot say exactly what we are -- if that's going to change in the future, but the
NOK40 million is a one-oﬀ set aside for disability in the deﬁned contribution portfolios in
Norway. And that has been fully set aside now, so there are -- we don't expect to take
anything in addition on that -- for that reserve element in the next quarter.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay; and on the paid up transfers?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yes, on the paid-up transfers it's still we have to wait to see what the regulator gives in
regulations around transfers.
Of course, we are building buﬀers and are in the process where we, of course, are willing
to use of some of this buﬀer building and increased results as a part of that surplus that
we ﬁll up the paid-up policies in a transfer, and to make a transfer even more value
creative for our customers.
But our ability to do that and how this regulation for transfers and the transfer values that
will be ﬁnanced is dependent on the ﬁnal rulings from the regulator, and that is --

Gianandrea Roberti, Carnegie. I have actually two very simple questions, one is referred
to the DC book in Norway. The risk result was minus NOK47 million, but you actually
spoke about it in your presentation; about the need for a reserve strengthening. I'm just
trying to ﬁgure out what we should expect on them numbers going forward?
The second question is just still in Norway; it refers to the DB book. You are letting go
around NOK6 billion of business this year, mostly municipalities. I have understood that
there is another NOK14 billion to go in '14. I just want to double check that information.
Thanks.

On the DC, we expect -- the minus NOK47 million in the quarter, we expect that to be a
slightly positive number for the rest of the year.
However as we've said, in Norway here, we see that over the last couple of years we've
seen a proﬁtability which has been too weak within this product. And we are
implementing price measures in order to improve proﬁtability from this particular
element, so you won't see that in the next -- ﬁrst couple of quarters, but you should see
that coming through in the pricing that we do for the future and, therefore, in the quarters
ahead.
I should also mention that the way disability -- the public disability insurance is written in
Norway is going to change with eﬀect from January 1, 2014. So these products will be
changed so that the occupational additional disability reserves will reﬂect and ﬁll up the
needs over and above what you get from the public -- or the social security scheme, and
that is going to change from 2015 as I said. So there will be changes in this product a year
and a half from now.
When it comes to the DB book and the public sector, you are absolutely right; there is a
NOK6 billion transfer out of the balance sheet First Quarter this year. And there will be
another expected NOK14 billion over the next couple of years. I don't know, Trond Finn, if
we are giving a guidance on how much on 2013 and how much on 2014.

We expect a larger portion to be on tendering this Autumn. So of the remaining NOK14
billion it's fair to say that we expect the most -- the major part of that to move out during
ﬁrst half 2014.

FINAL

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And I think we have just said in the call today, or in the presentation today that just 25% of
the portfolio is expected to be still on the balance sheet in 2014.

Thank you, then I'd like to thank you for joining the call. I'd also like to remind you of the
Analysts Meeting in London tomorrow; please note that the location for this event is at the
Berenberg Bank and not the usual Insurance Hall. So I hope to see some of you there.
And have a good afternoon. Goodbye.
