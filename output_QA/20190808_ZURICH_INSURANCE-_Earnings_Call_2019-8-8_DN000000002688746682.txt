Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Thank you, Richard. Good afternoon to all of you and thank you very much for being on
the call, especially, since we are in the middle of August, almost. And before we get into
the Q&A, let me try to provide a few remarks about our performance and where we stand
today. In '16, as you remember, we set ourselves ambitious targets and we launched a
new bold strategy. The ﬁrst half results show that the strategy has delivered and that we
are on track to exceed all of our targets.
Our BOP has reached the highest level in the past decade, and our BOPAT ROE of 15%,
shows the signiﬁcant value that we're creating for our shareholders. The performance of
our property and casualty business has been very strong, with the business showing
growth in gross premiums and improved underwriting performance with the still very low
volatility.

Bloomberg Transcript

The strong improvement in the accident year combined ratio before natural catastrophes
clearly shows that the actions that we have taken to change the mix of the business and to
improve the quality of the portfolio were the right ones. This is especially the case in our
commercial business, where discipline and focus has driven signiﬁcant improvement in
proﬁtability, in contrast to what many have reported. Looking forward, we see further
opportunities to improve the results and we see the current upturn in US pricing as
supportive of the future performance of our business.
Our Life business has continued to perform well in the ﬁrst half with underlying growth
continuing, and with headline results held back only by the strengthening of the US dollar.
The high quality of our Life portfolio and our long-term focus on protection and unitlinked savings position us as well to manage the ongoing challenge caused by the low
yield environment.
About Farmers, both our own business and the policyholder owned Farmers Exchanges
have continued to grow successfully in the ﬁrst half of the year. Particularly the Exchanges
have continued to build successfully of their presence in the Eastern United States and
they also expanded Toggle, their innovative oﬀering for millennials to over 20 new states.
Our balance sheet remains extremely strong with our solvency at both the top-end of the
target range, despite the impact of falling yields in the absence of the dampening
mechanisms available to peers reporting under Solvency II.
Over the ﬁrst half of 2019, we continue to develop our strategy and we strengthened our
business through the addition of new partnerships, and new and innovative product
oﬀerings across a wide range of our businesses. Our innovation has also gained external
recognition. The Group had won a number of awards over the ﬁrst half of the year, and
this is, of course, quite relevant for all of us. These results and these developments give
me great conﬁdence for the future of the Group and our positioning for the next phase of
our development, which I look forward to presenting to you later this year.

Questions And Answers
FINAL

Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The ﬁrst
question comes from Jon Hocking, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for taking my question. I've got two questions
please. Could you comment on what you're seeing in terms of large loss trends? And if
there's anything that is sort of anticipated [ph] underlying pattern there? That's ﬁrst
question. And then secondly in terms of the trends we are seeing in US pricing, are any of
those suﬃcient yet to change your appetite for particular lines of business over and above
others that you've been, maybe some of the things you've been de-emphasizing? Thank
you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Jon, it's George. You'll probably remember last year that we resisted the temptation to
get too deep into large loss topics because often we hear that as a reason why businesses
haven't achieved the targets they've been given. I mean, I think the good news for us is
that we haven't had that commentary internally. I think though if we do break down the
numbers. I mean, the outcomes that you see in the ﬁrst half of this year aren't driven by an
absence of large loss. We see more of the improvement driven at the smaller end of the
spectrum, so we are still seeing large loss. In fact, if anything, slightly higher than our
current expectation.
On your other question on U.S. pricing, maybe it's good to just mention where we see
U.S. pricing, so that we'll all be on the same page. I mean, if you remember, the
commentary from Q1, I talked about the fact that, I mean, overall, for North America,
where I gave quite a bit of detail, we were slightly north of 2, slightly north of 4 rather, ex
workers comp, we were right at 6, if that's a particular measure you like. Overall, things
are stronger in Q2. We see things getting quite close to 7% for all lines of business, so
with that change of appetite. I mean, starting for us, it's -- I mean it was actually rational
about how we set targets, I mean so for the business, but they see the right levels of
return. They can write the business for sure. And I'm sure that this will take some business
at the margins that previously we would not have written and it would tip into places
where we would write it. I think on portfolio that for me, is a diﬀerent topic. So I mean, we
are trying to shape the portfolio. I think that topic will continue. But certainly, the
improved proﬁtability in the market overall will increase the opportunity for us in
commercial.

The next question comes from Peter Eliot, Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. The ﬁrst question is, the obvious one just revisiting that accident
year combined ratio ex nat cat. I appreciate, George, you don't want to sort of go too
deep or over analyze the large losses. But I was wondering if you could just give us your
view on sort of how much of that improvement is sustainable? And to the extent that has
come from sort of pricing improvements and portfolio actions, I mean, those have been
ongoing, should we expect another similar improvement over the next 12 months? Or is
that certainly bullish?
Secondly, I was wondering if you could just give us a bit more clarity on -- granularity on
the 8%, Z-ECM increase from business proﬁt? Because I guess, that's what 2.5 points
higher than the sum of net income contribution, so that would be great, just to
understand, like the contribution from new business and many other moving parts? Thank
you very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you. So on the ﬁrst one. So sustainability, so maybe I'll deal with high level ﬁrst, and
then I'll go into some of the factors that will drive what we see now or have driven what
we see now, will drive what we see into the future. So the obvious thing that you can
isolate in the ﬁrst half results is the impact of cat. We're about 0.7 points beneath where
we would expect to be, given where we price things and we don't assume that, that is a
structural change. So if you adjust for that, we would see the underlying closer to 96%.
I mean, if you look at what do we expect for the future. So I mean, I'd love to be as
optimistic as the second part. Your ﬁrst comment implied, I think the -- I mean, clearly,
there's a great environment out there, that's going to be -- that looks as though it will
continue to be very constructive. I mean, I mentioned earlier in response to Jon's
question that we've seen acceleration of rate into Q2. And so just to be clear, inﬂation,
loss cost inﬂation, Europe and US were, I mean, deﬁnitely much, most for us in the short
term. We're not seeing any signiﬁcant change. It's slightly higher in the US, but I'm talking
10 basis points. So I mean, overall, that should start -- the rate net of most cost inﬂation
should also continue to feed into the results.
But equally importantly for us, there's a whole shift taking place on terms and conditions,
which I think is much harder to see. But actually, I mean, has the promise of something
that will beneﬁt us for a period that's longer than simply the -- this typical 12 months that
we'll have the contractual relationship than anyone of these individual policies. So I mean,
we see things like attachment points are moving up, line sizes are coming down and more
business through wholesale channels where rate is probably even stronger on
commercial, auto in the US, signiﬁcant changes in deductibles with the continuation of the
rate. I mean, I could go on and on. There's a whole series of factors and features. But I
think they are very helpful from a terms and conditions perspective.

Be aware there are other things will go the other way. So I mean, we have crop in the
second half. Crop is a higher loss ratio business. This will certainly not be as positive a
year for crop as we had last year for the reasons, I think, you all know about from what
you've seen in the ﬁrst half. But I think, I mean -- yeah, I think you've had from the
guidance that we've given already that -- I mean, we've guided you all to expect
something around 96%, something combined for this year given the performance in the
ﬁrst half, given the expectations we have for the second, we expect to be a bit better than
that, so something between 95% and 96%.
On the Z-ECM topic, I mean, there's always a number of moving parts. So I mean, I guess,
you've seen the key features today, so we've got business proﬁt generation of 8%. That's
probably close to a couple of points higher than you would normally expect to see from
us. Dividend accrual of 4%, we now call around 7% for the market movements, and that's
mainly interest rate driven and then a bunch of smaller stuﬀ explain the rest.
I mean, there are always diﬀerences between the reported IFRS proﬁts and the impact
that you see in the economic view, typically, more of those come from areas like Life, but
the picture can be quite diﬀerent in terms of -- I mean, the almost immediate recognition
of new business value versus the spreading forwards of proﬁt under IFRS. But I mean,
equally, some of the things that we did to reduce risk around some of the legacy parts of
the portfolio. I mean, that also has a positive impact. I mean, I can't give you a very
scientiﬁc, very detailed explanation, but I mean, broadly, those are the main drivers.

The next question comes from Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

I wanted to -- a simple one, I think, hopefully, to start with, the OnePath Life contribution, I
think, in the notes to the ﬁnancial accounts, it says $29 million pro forma for the ﬁrst half.
That seems quite low versus the original expectation. Maybe you could just update us on
what's going on there? I guess, there's some noise in relation to OnePath. Are there any
implications of some of the recent legislation that's been passed post the Royal
Commission update, for example, I think, Protect Your Super legislation. Does that have
any impact on the outlook for OnePath?
The second question is, sorry to return to this topic of loss trends. I guess, you are, I think,
actually, the only global commercial lines insurer in the ﬁrst half that's actually achieved an
underlying attritional improvement year-on-year across the US and Europe. Because
everyone else has reﬂected issues of particularly social inﬂation rather than classical loss
cost inﬂation to do with legislation [ph] et cetera. What additional work have you done in
the ﬁrst half in the US, in particular, on looking at issues of social inﬂation in general
liability, commercial auto, professional lines, where there's been many of your peers
adjusting a real step change in claims trends? Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. So on the ﬁrst one I was -- just very frankly I was actually down in
Sydney last week. I met with the team to go through the completion balance sheet and
also to look at the planning for next year. So maybe I'll start with the headline summary. At
this stage, I mean, we anticipate an outcome for 2020, that's at or around the level that we
indicated in the presentation that we published when we announced the OnePath deal
back in December of 2017. And from memory, that was around $200 million. So that's still
our expectation today.
And of course, where we're starting from is a bit diﬀerent, certainly from a position that
was the position then. Certainly, there are DI issues in the local market. I mean, we see it in
our own book on the Zurich site, right. I mean, the key thing here is, I think, when we talk
about the strategic reasons for the OnePath transaction, we point at a number of market
features and factors that we liked. I won't get into all of them on this call, but I think we've
talked about the fact, I mean, we've acted in the past in Australia to address weaknesses
or shortcomings, and we continue to be conﬁdent that we can do the same in this
portfolio and drive the outcome that we committed to when we announced the
transaction.
I mean, there's a whole bunch of issues. I mentioned DI, you mentioned Protect Your
Super, I mean Protect Your Super is absolutely a topic that will impact those that are more
exposed to Group. And I think, as you probably remember, from the -- you might
remember from the December conversation of 18 months ago, OnePath is a bit less
exposed on the Group side of the market. I've said that Protect Your Super will also have
some knock on impact on retail. We don't expect that to be so signiﬁcant, but there is an
impact as trustees get pushed to make sure that you don't have duplicate cover or not in
a forced purchased position that were mainly in group, but it will have some impacts on
retail.
So for us, overall, the ﬁrst six months of this year are not representative for a whole bunch
of reasons. We're still conﬁdent we can drive the level that we're committed to. The other
thing to watch is, it will be a bit lumpy next year because we have to take some action
around the portfolio. And of course, some of that beneﬁt will ﬂow once the action has
taken place. So there'll be a tendency next year for that number to be a bit more backend loaded than front end.
Loss trends; so the -- I mean, it's a -- I think I gave an answer to Peter, some of the things
that we see from a market perspective, taking place. I think overview, I think without being
too arrogant, is that these are not things that we started in the ﬁrst six months, but we see
-- maybe because of the general pressure on the market. There's more people following
the changes that we've made. So I mean, we look carefully at the trends around losses. I
don't see in the data that we have, some of the things that you've heard and the
commentary from the others. And I guess, probably, the main driver of that is that if you
look at the last three years and you look for other ways in which we don't correlate with
the market, probably the presence of growth is the obvious diﬀerence.

FINAL

So you've seen us act relatively early in the cycle to deal with the challenges that we have.
They started with some of the large loss topics that we talked about in 2015, Mario's push
to get to reinvigorate underwriting and our willingness to give up market share, where the
returns just didn't justify the capital allocation. And I think one of the things that we're
happiest about today is the fact that you can really see the beneﬁts of that in the
commercial performance. So I mean, I can't analyze for you in detail, again, why we're not
seeing this step change in social inﬂation that other people point to.

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

By the way, I think we have seen it. The point is that since we shrunk, the impact on us is
reduced, and it doesn't make it as feasible as it was for the others. But we have been
shrinking now since three years ago. And so it's -- everything is much more manageable
for us than, probably, it is for others to grow this, because we see the same trends. But the
impact is completely diﬀerent.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

The next question comes from James Shuck, Citigroup. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon everybody. So my two questions. I just wanted to return to the point
around the attritional loss ratio at H1. So it's ex the PYD and ex the nat cat. If I look at kind
of previous half year periods, there doesn't appear to be any seasonality around that
number? I mean, I appreciate kind of second half of the year, there's more nat cat, but it
doesn't seem to have been the case in the past and perhaps you've grown in crop a little
bit more, so maybe that could be a little bit more of a drag this year. But I am just trying to
get a feel for really the 61.8% attritional in H1, even if that goes up a little bit in H2. Am I
right in kind of interpreting that the improvement in rate and what you're experiencing on
the plain side?
And the point you made about terms and conditions, then that is a pretty reasonable
starting point from which we should expect it to continue to improve as we look forward. I
guess, there's a kind of related point around the net earned premium growth that you talk
about in the presentation, because you're guiding now towards a small reduction for full
year. That was obviously down 5% at H1, so small reduction that to me implies that maybe
we should be up a little bit in the second half of the year. I'm not sure whether that's FXrelated or not. Clearly, that might have an impact on the attritional loss ratio as it runs
through as well. So any help on that would be great?
Second question was around Farmers. The sort of tone of what you're saying with
Farmers, it sort of you seems to be quite pleased with it. I look at the GWP growth though,
it's up 2% on a continuing basis, and that includes the Uber partnership. Policy count is
actually down in H1 versus full year and largely business value, which was kind of actually
Page 7 of 20



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG

Date: 2019-08-08

[ph] a big push around cross-sell, ATE and new business value is also down. So could you
just shed a little bit of light on why you're sort of quite -- a little bit more positive than I am
on Farmers performance in the period, please? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, James. So ﬁrst of all, on the attritional, and so no seasonality. And I think that's
true in terms of outcomes. I think there are some prices that I think as you think about
from a planning perspective or a headcounting [ph] perspective that you would expect
some -- and the two most obvious sources of it. You mentioned crop. So certainly in the
last couple of years, the second half of the year has been a major beneﬁciary of -- in fact, I
think, the last three years, has been a major beneﬁciary of signiﬁcantly bad crop
performance than planned. And I think I talked about that earlier in the year, and I
mentioned the fact that as we planned for this year, you were going to see about a 7 point
change as we moved back to a more normal crop outcome. I think crop will be slightly
worse than that, given the challenges in the ﬁrst half and the issues around planting. I
don't think it will be a big issue, but the beneﬁt we had from crop that one -- that doesn't
noteworthy [ph] to emerge in the second half.
I think the other thing is the presence of the -- probably the peak nat cat scenarios in the
second half. They do cause seasonality, but maybe not the reason you'd expect. I mean,
obviously, we have a lot of reinsurance that's running through to cat protection. I mean,
the nature of that stuﬀ is that if we have signiﬁcant event, and these very signiﬁcant events,
we get coverage and if we have a more normal year, we don't get any. So I mean, the
reinsurance approach would tend to slightly penalize the second half in most years. So I
think, you need to oﬀset those two things against the other things that you mentioned on
the positive side of the spectrum. So the improvement in rate, the terms and conditions.
And I guess, you called that a reasonable starting point, I would be far more bullish than
reasonable.
On the premium side of things, that's mainly FX that you're picking up, so it's been the
headline number that is our underlying view. Of course, the actual outcome will be
determined by -- I mean, how the market develops, so though at this stage might even is
falling as what to shift in the second half. You're not going to see a big impact on the ends
anyway.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Farmers?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Farmers, so why are we pleased with it. So I think the -- so from a management company
ﬁrst. So the fee-based part of the business. I think they still continue to do exactly what we
expected them to do. And exactly, I think we've generally guided all of you guys to
expect. So we did expect to see a bit more rates run through this year. We've had a bit
more cat on the exchange side, so we don't see a signiﬁcant shift again on the combined.
But I mean, if you compare the Farmers' technical proﬁtability today to, I mean, just 18
months, two years ago, it's completely diﬀerent.

Page 8 of 20



FINAL

We do wanted to see them grow the policy count. We do wanted to see them expand
more. It's a topic of discussion between us and them and how we can support them to
achieve that. Let me -- I mean, everyone on this call appreciates the value of Farmers and
between us and the exchange, we're trying to manage this for the best outcome for both
of us. If there's any hint of something we would like to see improved, it would have been
the thing that you commented on last. So on the Life side, there's evidently more work to
be done there. The things that you pointed to, that are strategic priorities for us around
cross-sell and the growth. We haven't seen it, we're not giving up on it. We expect the
team to deliver it, but we haven't seen it yet.

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

But let me add something on this. We started a while ago discussing with Farmers and
Farmers management, all these issues that you raised, plus some others. Things have
started to change. Management has been reinforced. Actions have been changed and
taken actions on the agency structure on the project investments on the cost basis.
They're launching new products. We see these things. And so we're conﬁdent that by
doing the right things, then the numbers will come through. I understand that you haven't
seen yet the numbers as they should be, but we're conﬁdent that they will come, and we
see the actions before they track the numbers, right? It takes always a bit of luck to get
that, especially when you have an agency model and you have a routed business.

The next question comes from Kamran Hossain, RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. Just one question from me. Basically, if price momentum continues in the US, how
does that make you think about reinsurance purchasing and the kind of the actions you've
taken over the last few years? Will you still seek to kind of manage volatility or if pricing
improved considerably, will you then begin to kind of risk taking a little bit more of that
business on your own balance sheet? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Kamran. So, I am going to be very careful what I say though. So I mean,
obviously, we expect to see the price momentum continue. And if I -- I mean, we saw the
price momentum start before the beginning of this year, and we made some changes
already to the reinsurance program at the very start of the year, especially around the
property side of things. If you look at the major programs we have in place, I mean, we
have a cat program, but we have no intention to change that. So I don't think that's a
Page 9 of 20

FINAL

price-driven topic. That's a risk appetite issue. And even if we saw the stuﬀ becomes
fantastically proﬁtable, it's not the kind of risk that we necessarily think we are the best
carrier of.
The other two things, which are part of the -- the most signiﬁcant is we have a very large
question on property. I mean, we've been clear with the market when we placed that. That
was a risk that we seemed to like less than the market did at large. And on the day that
things changed, we would deﬁnitely retain more of it. So we certainly have an option
around that topic coming to retain more.
And then there's another large contract, which again is relatively recent. I think probably,
most of you are aware, we have a very large liability core share. That's more like the cat
cover. So that was intended to be a long-term commitment. It's about the shape of the
portfolio that we have. There's a capital allocation topic in the end, but more from a
longer-term perspective than a short one. And certainly, I mean, if the market continues to
support us in the way it has, I mean, we would not intend to make signiﬁcant shifts there.
But the property topic is certainly one that every -- I know that every time we come
through the planning process and we start to approach the renewal, we have pretty
intense internal conversations about what should be in that core share and this year will
be no diﬀerent.

Thank you very much. I had -- So on cash ﬂow -- and by the way, well done, really well
done, that's amazing what you achieved. And on cash ﬂow, so for the ﬁrst time in a while,
you've given us a ﬁgure at the half year. So it implies that there was $1.7 billion in the ﬁrst
half. Can you just explain which of your large entities have still to pay or have paid to give
us a feeling for any kind of seasonality here?
And the second question, which is really a bit lightweight and apologies for that. Given
where markets are today, so interest rates have dropped a little bit more and you seem to
-- sorry, I changed my question. You kind of indicated that the business operating proﬁt
delivery in terms of solvency is about 2 points ahead where you would normally expect it.
And you alluded a little bit, where it came from. Can you say what it looks like for the

above what you would normally see us. So there's no major model shift taking place
currently. I don't see one planned, so no reason to expect that anything other than the
operating proﬁt and the ability of the life business to generate new business value will be
the drivers of capital generation in the second half.
On the cash ﬂow, so I can say, which -- I will resist the temptation to start this one, I think
the people who will be helping us in the second half of the year, they already know who
we are. I mean, we've talked in the past about the fact that if you look at last year, I mean,
you see this unusual picture between the life side and the P&C side, where P&C was a bit
weaker, Life a little bit stronger. I expect Life to continue to be strong this year, not only
will we see the operating cash generation, but we're still continuing some of those
balance sheet optimization topics that we covered back in February. And you'll see more
of those in the second half very likely. I mean, the reason for giving a number today, which
is unusual for us. It was simply to underline how close we are to the overall goal, given
that probably the conversation switches fairly soon to what does the next three years look
like.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Before that, you have to decide on the dividend. The cash is the dividend, for me, that
was the underlying question, I beg your pardon, I interrupted you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Yes. How they progress on. So the only thing to be careful is that the cash ﬂow is
extremely important, but cash has never been a constraint nor honestly a driver of the
dividend here. It should be about earnings, because that's what deﬁnes sustainability for
us. But I mean, we have a whole system of the Group, which is designed to make sure that
we convert earnings into cash in a disciplined and ideally rapid manner, but that's not the
key factor when it comes to that dividend decision. They'll get made in February of next
year.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi there. Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions. First one is does the fall in
bond yields make you more optimistic about P&C pricing? And I was already surprised
nobody has mentioned it, to be honest, because surely that could be an important
contributor to getting to a properly hard market?
And then the second question is just coming to the expense ratio, it's still a bit high.
Wondered if you could take us through your plans or remind us where you want to go on

that? Thank you very much.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So thanks, Nick.

FINAL

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Yeah. It's an important question. I mean, if you look at the movement in the markets, even
very recently. We're seeing levels that we haven't seen for some time. Although,
interesting, if you compare them to the levels that we based the current share targets on. I
think what you would have seen is just a reminder, the current share targets were struck
based on yields around the middle of 2016. Europe is deﬁnitely lower for sure. It's a bit
less relevant for us in Europe, given the portfolio is typically about shorter duration in
Europe. At US, actually, still a touch higher, not sure that can be true by the end of the
week, but it's somewhat true very recently. But of course, we have had a beneﬁt in the
intervening period from the fact that interest rates have risen.
I think the point you make is important. I think it could well be true that this helps sustain
the price trend that we see for longer. I think the only caution I would signal is that one of
them has given today. The other one we've yet to see. But I think it's certainly helpful and
encouraging the market to underrate in a very disciplined fashion.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. Yeah. Sorry, and expenses?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Expenses, so -- and I mean, you'll hear a bit what you've probably heard from me before.
You need to break apart the expense ratio. We've tried to do in the investor presentation.
I think you see the continuation of the fall. And the -- what we refer to as the OUE, the
other underwriting expense or overhead component, so that's dropped, 13.7% down from
14.1%. That's partly oﬀset by two factors. One is premium taxes, which, of course, we don't
entirely control, but that impact is quite small. And then on the commission topic, I think
the interesting thing you see on commission, it's slightly higher and I think you've heard
today, and you may have read in the press release that we have some new relationships.
We have access to another signiﬁcant group of clients, this time in Europe actually as
opposed to elsewhere.
So the commission ratio or the commission ratio component that's driven actually by
changes in Europe in the ﬁrst six months, whereas in the markets that have generally been
driving it up in more recent times, typically, LatAm and Asia Paciﬁc, their contribution is
actually smaller but there is a net increase, and that's driven by more of that mass
consumer business that is slightly more expensive to acquire, but is typically less volatile,
more predictable. And certainly just helps the overall quality of our portfolio. So as you've
heard before, it's a trade-oﬀ we're happy to make. And the focus of the expenses has to
be in the OUE ratio, and we expect to continue that focus in the second half of this year.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

And thank you, George. Can you give us any sort of quantiﬁcation of those numbers? I
think OUE is meant to be around about 13% is your sort of unoﬃcial target. Is that still
correct and moving the overall expense ratio down to sort of 31% over a period of time?

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So on the two things. So we're looking to bring it down towards 13%. That is if you look at
where the peer group is, we think that's roughly where they are. I think if you look at what
we still to bring in the second half, I am not -- as you get all the way from where we are to
13% in one step. But you'll certainly see a further move in the second half of the year.
On the commission ratio, for the reasons I gave earlier it's a bit tricky to be really hard and
fast on the commission ratio. I mean, all things being equal, if we had done none of the
portfolio change that you've seen from us over the course of the last couple of years, we
would have an overall expense ratio that would be in the high 20s. But we wouldn't have
the outcomes that you squeeze from an underwriting perspective. So the overall expense
ratio, we're probably standing by, whether we get the opportunity to do more of this. And
if we see it at the right levels of return, we would do more. But our focus is mainly OUE.
And we are expected to bring that down further, but probably not all the way to 13% by
the end of the year.

The next question comes from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. Please go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you. So George, one question on P&C, one on Life, please.
On P&C, at the Investor Day last year, we talked about the Life -- the commercial business
in North America targeting, I think, it was 3 percentage of improvement from HY to 2021,
but that was before this whole momentum or tailwind from the pricing and claims attrition
came in. Would you say that they are likely to change something there? Are they trying -will they have a higher, better target? Or does that number already getting somewhere
close given that we've seen a big change in commercial. If you could just comment on the
commercial US, anything you can comment on?
And second question on the Life side. So there's about, give or take $100 million lower
guidance eﬀect to be for '19 now versus previously guided. Is that -- and I understand
from speaking to the IR team, that's mostly FX related. But I mean, if I -- very statistically,
the dollar was also, I mean, all over the place last year, for example, is there anything else
on Life that we should note regarding this guidance and any commentary there?
Thank you very much.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks Vinit. So it's a good point on the ﬁrst one. So Kathleen and the team have slightly
overachieved versus the target we set at the Investor Day. Remember, there's cat in that,
so there's a -- I mean, there is some beneﬁt there, although most of the cat beneﬁts, so to
speak, actually comes in Europe. I won't get into what we did at Investor Day in
November. We need to have a look again, how we performed in the ﬁrst half of the year.
We're in that process currently of preparing the plans and the targets for the next three
years. And we'll come forward with another set of ambitious goals for the Group when we
get to November.
On the Life side, so you're right, I mean we -- I think the -- it is really important to
appreciate that we're happy with what we see in Life. We think the constant FX
performance is pretty much where we ﬁxated to be. So the headline guidance topic is
entirely driven by foreign exchange. There's also a tough comparison to the prior year.
And almost half of the one-oﬀ that we saw last year, are cut in the ﬁrst half of the year. If
you remember, the FX topic around Argentina. There are always positives and moving
parts -- positive and negative moving parts on the business that overall we're happy with
what we're seeing in Life. There are always opportunities to improve, and the team are
focused on those, but the overall outcome is pretty much in line with plan.

The next question comes from Johnny Vo, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you very much. I guess, I guess, it's good that the shape of the business has
changed and it's been typiﬁed by the fact that 50% of your net earned premiums are now
in specialty and property. I guess, does this trend continue to happen? Or do you see
other opportunities in potentially merchant, casualty and shifting the business back
potentially?
The second question just relates to your sensitivity to rates. I've noticed that the sensitivity
to a drop in 100 bps interest rate is very sensitive now as it was compared to the end of
last year, where I think end of last year was about 3 percentage points, and now it's about
14 percentage points. Is it because you're opening up the duration? Or what's going on
with the sensitivity there? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So on the ﬁrst one, the -- I think it was in response to the question earlier around rates.
Apologies, I forget who asked it. I made the comment that the -- that some of the things
we're doing are really about strategic view of the portfolio. I think portfolio mix is one of
those things, so that's something, a bit like almost of the asset allocation, you should
expect to see that change relatively slowly in any given direction over time. I mean, we
Page 14 of 20

FINAL

have priorities that we haven't yet achieved around some of the specialty lines, but I
mean, our view is that the current market conditions are really quite diﬃcult to support
those. So if we see further price move, maybe you'll see a bit more specialty move into
the portfolio. I mean, specialty for us also includes credit. And this doesn't feel at the right
point in the cycle to really push credit. So I mean, think of this more of as a strategic view,
there'll be some tactical movements, but the overall goals for the portfolio remain the
ones that we laid at, I think at least a couple of years ago.
Now on the sensitivities, I mean, I need to go back and look, because I don't recall a
change of that magnitude. I mean, there's a lack of linearity for obvious reasons. So as
interest rates get compressed, you have a risk of developing higher sensitivities, but that
scale of change, which surprised me. So we need to have a look and come back to you.
Sorry, Johnny.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. Good afternoon. Just want just to ask one of Vinit's question in a slightly
diﬀerent way. So going back to the Investor Day, you talked about a potential
convergence of your commercial combined ratio. I think you commented at on 99.5%
commercial combined ratio in the US, with big peers. Can you talk about the relative -how you see your relative positioning in proﬁtability in the US versus those peers and
whether that closed gap is now sustainable, and where it needs to be?
And then secondly, just a very quick question on CoverWallet. I see that you're very happy
with it. And you're going -- you're expanding into Switzerland. Can you just brieﬂy tell us
what the learning has been? I mean, has it given you access to new premium growth? Or
has it been an expense ratio reduction in SME? What is the learning? And how far could
this go throughout your business? Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Farooq. So on the convergence with peers in the US. I think you need to give it a
bit more time to absorb what we've seen of the peer groups. Of course, one of them only
reported last night. I mean, we did a lot of work ahead of Investor Day. So we want that
exercise to get a sense of where we see ourselves relative to others. I mean, for obvious
reasons, we're really happy with the progress, which driven by commercial, driven by the
US, is a great combination. But I think we need a bit more time with the peer information
before I can really draw any conclusion or depth from it. On the...

So they did...

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. I've seen bullets, will come back to you. We'll come back to you. On CoverWallet;
that the CoverWallet is pretty new in Switzerland. I can't say much there. It has been
running in Spain for a bit longer. There's still a level where it's not so material to the
Group. I think most of us have seen what CoverWallet does, works. I mean, for me, having
looked at it, what's impressive is the ability to package something for a buyer in a way that
helps them make sure they protect themselves across all the diﬀerent risks that they may
have without them having to stitch that coverage together for themselves or to ﬁnd an
agent to do it for them. It's a fairly inexpensive system, as you can imagine, ease-of-use to
is really very high. And we have high hopes for it in Switzerland, where we are a bit underpenetrated on the SME side, and we think we have a very signiﬁcant opportunity here, a
bit too early really to draw too many conclusions.

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Yeah. Look, and in general, the SME opportunity is so big that you can pursue it only with
the one solution. So CoverWallet is very interesting, because it allows us to contact the
customers among the SMEs, who are already connected online, and they can be reached
out of the web. But that's a portion of the huge, huge ocean of SME customers in Europe
or in other continents. And so we're also using every other possible distribution mean to

nicely in H1. And CoverWallet is a part of it, but it's not the program altogether.

The next question comes from William Hawkins, KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Thank you very much. And back on those Z-ECM sensitivities, please, George. Is there
any way that you can give us a hint -- an idea of what the absolute interest rate is that
you're plugging in around which the sensitivities are being shown? I appreciate that it's
going to be ﬁendishly complicated and based on curves and that kind of thing, but in the
back of my mind, there's going to come a point when showing a 100 basis point
reduction is implying that you've got signiﬁcantly negative inputs across the curve, which,
at some point, is going to sort of mean that your calculation is technically correct, but
possibly economically kind of meaningless. So I'm just trying to get a sense about what
the absolute rate is, so what you would be at, if you took it down 100 basis points?
And then secondly, could you give us any kind of qualitative or quantitative update on
where your Solvency II ratio equivalent could have moved? Because again, the diﬃculty
with both Z-ECM and the SST is that potentially exaggerating an awful lot of these market
movements, so the divergence with the hints you've given us in the past could have
moved on? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Will. So on the ﬁrst one, I think maybe a topic that the IR team could cover in
more detail with you after the call. On the issue having signiﬁcantly negative rates. I mean,
obviously have the asset side of things, we will have signiﬁcantly negative inputs in some
parts of the model already, especially if you look at Europe, but I appreciate there are
other aspects of the model where you may well ﬂoor things because in the real world,
you're not going to get maybe the same thing you see on the borrowing side, on the
asset side. I mean, please speak to Rich and the team afterwards, and they can walk you
through that in more depth. I don't have an update at the half year around Solvency II or
the potential diﬀerence between -- I mean, where we are now from a Z-ECM or SST
perspective and what you would have seen versus the peer group.
I mean, If you look at us, I think I mentioned in the early part of the call, there's about
certain points of market movement, we see that mainly as the longer interest rate in
Europe, and the impact that that has on some of the very long liabilities we have on the

Page 17 of 20



FINAL

Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2019-08-08

Life side. Again, I don't know to what extent we've seen that quite so much in the peer
group. There would be some impact from the ultimate forward rates in the Solvency II
system that would certainly dampen that more than you would see for us. I think probably
that delta and so on, maybe it's a few points, it's not so signiﬁcant, I think, in the half year
comparison. I think it's the starting point of the basic SST versus Solvency II framework.
And I did talk about the delta, I think, back in the February call, maybe the May call, in the
past and we've highlighted, I mean, deﬁcit of up to 50 points or more between SST and
Solvency II, and we think they're still valid. And in fact, one of the most recent day we've
seen, it would be higher today.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you very much ﬁrst for taking another one. Two more from me. First of all, maybe
just to carry on the life topic. I mean, if I just look a big picture down, then one thing I
noticed was that the costs sort of seems to be increasing a bit on a like-for-like basis. And
that was despite new business being down, so it can't sort of really be attributed to the
acquisition. So I was just wondering if you could sort of comment on that dynamic? And if
we might see any improvement going forward?
And the second thing was, I was interested, you ﬂagged IFRS 17 costs of $50 million to
$100 million in H2. I am just wondering if you could comment any further out or in terms
of total costs? Or if you've done the sort of the analysis and anything you might expect in
the future? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Peter. So on the cost side of it, I mean, you've seen most of the beneﬁt ﬂow
through the P&C side, I mean, there is some beneﬁt that is partly obscured because some
of it gets shared with the policyholders and some of it falls to the shareholder. In the
second half, I mean, I think if you look at it, certainly from a operating proﬁt perspective,
you will see the impact, for example, some of the integration what we're doing in
Australia. We do have a synergy goal there, and that will show up on a like-for-like basis
with the Australian business and the starting point. I mean, otherwise, the main focus for
us, it's really been on the P&C side and trying to drive most of the expense improvement
through there. Although you have seen Life improve, certainly earlier on the time series.
IFRS 17, yes, I'm glad we're only talking about costs and now the project itself. I think -- I
mean, having said that, this probably works giving you a sense of where we are. So, in
fact, today is the ﬁrst delivery day for our Tier 1 entities and our ﬁrst practice run of IFRS 17.
So we are actually having the Company's report up today as we speak. I don't know that
the numbers will make too much sense in the ﬁrst go round for -- we have plenty of time

to perfect them over the course of the next year or two. We haven't given a total cost
number, but I mean, we're running, I mean, between $50 million to $100 million, I mean,
pretty much every year, this project runs currently, which is one of the reasons why we're
keen to see the whole conversation come to an end and for the thing to get adopted, so
that we can start -- or start to understand it together and move on. It's extremely
expensive and unfortunately, well, it does have beneﬁts. I am not sure they will outweigh
the costs.

Unfortunately, Michael, that's not our money. That belongs to the exchange, so that's their
surplus ratio. And that's the -- the one thing I would point out is the exchange has been a
big buyer of reinsurance. I mean, the capital strength means that they can retain more of
it. But in essence, any beneﬁts that ﬂow from the management surplus really will accrue to
