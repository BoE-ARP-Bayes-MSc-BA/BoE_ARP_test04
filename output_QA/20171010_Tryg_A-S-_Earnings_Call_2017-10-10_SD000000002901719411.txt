Presentation
Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. This is Gianandrea Roberti. I'm Head of Investor Relations for
Tryg.
We published our Q3 results this morning. And I have here with me Group CEO Morten
Hubbe and Group CFO Chris Baltzer to discuss the numbers.
So after a few words, over to you, Morten.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Gian. And good morning to all of you from my side as well.
We start on Slide three with the ﬁnancial highlights, where we see our technical result of
some DKK 789 million, which is roughly 6% better year-on-year. And we see an expense
ratio in the course of 13.6, corresponding to the 14.1 year-to-date, some of the lowest
expense ratios we've ever delivered; and with an underlying claims ratio which improved

FINAL

in the quarter 0.6% in private lines. And particularly, we're very pleased to see an
improvement of 0.4% in underlying claims for the group.
Result at pretax for the quarter is somewhat down compared to year-on-year. And of
course, we saw a Third Quarter last year with an extraordinarily high investment income.
There, for instance, global equities were up 4.6% in the Third Quarter last year. Then we're
particularly pleased to pay out DKK 700 million as members bonus to our Danish
customers in September this year for the second time.
If we turn to Slide four brieﬂy. We show an NPS of 22, doubled since our target; and a
transactional NPS of 59. We've mentioned the bonus again this year, 8% returned to the
Danish customers. And particularly important is the improvement we see this quarter on
our 3-plus customers, which is increasing in both Norway and Denmark. Particularly, in
Denmark we've seen strong development. We're now slightly above 60% at 3 plus and
close to the group target of 61% for the full year, 3 plus. Then of course, we mentioned
claims automation, where we've started in Norway. We started with travel insurance and
then moved on to content insurance, where we're now at closer to 3 seconds via straightthrough processing on claims on these products in Norway. And in a few time, we will
start doing the ﬁrst solutions with robotics in Denmark in the same area.
On Slide 5, we elaborate on the technical results. And as I mentioned, some 6% higher
year-on-year. And combined ratio wise, that makes this the best Q3 in more than 10 years
with a combined ratio of 82.6. Clearly, we see an improvement in both the Private and the
Commercial segments. But also Sweden has a good performance, while we clearly see
that the Corporate segment remains under pressure, as proﬁtability is too low in several
areas. And particularly, in the Norwegian market we've seen four years of declining prices
in Corporate, while competitors have very high run-oﬀs. And there's clearly a need to
increase pricing in the Norwegian Corporate segment. And we have started that journey.
If we look at Slide 6. We show a Q3 dividend per share of DKK 1.6 and a 9-month dividend
per share of DKK 4.8. We show again a strong solvency ratio of 211, up from 209 last
quarter. And we continue our strong focus on shareholders remuneration, as Tryg is a
dividend stock.
If we turn to Slide eight and we show a bit of split on the premium growth. There's no
doubt that Tryg will never be a growth-driven company. But at the same time, we would
like to have a top line growth that develops roughly in line with inﬂation. And we see a
satisfactory growth of 1.5% compared to 0% growth year-on-year but clearly with a lot of
variation underneath. The strongest and most healthy development, we see in private
lines Denmark with an organic growth of 2.6% driven by sales in our Tryghedspakken [ph]
or packaging of products which has increased our number of sales -- or number of
products and new sales by 18%; and of course, also supported by the customer bonus.
Commercial, struggling somewhat more, a growth of minus 0.6%, still challenging but still
a signiﬁcant improvement year-on-year and also compared to previous quarters. Bear in
mind in Commercial Norway the OBOS portfolio helps the top line numbers in
Commercial. Corporate is the most challenging area. We see roughly the same level as

FINAL

Q3 last year but a signiﬁcant reduction in Norway of 7.8%. We've seen particularly one
large customer paying more than DKK 100 million leaving our books, as we were losing
money on that portfolio and as we're in the process of securing a more sustainable and
higher price level in the Norwegian Corporate business. We see a ﬂat development in
Denmark. And we see a rather high increase in Corporate Sweden, as we explained last
quarter, mainly due to fronting business which has extremely low risk but ﬂattest at the
[ph] top line.
In Sweden private lines we continued to see a positive premium development, of course
helped by Skandia. But also a positive development underlying.
Very important slide, 9, on average price developments. And as in the previous quarters,
we continued to see an increase in average premium for almost all products, reﬂecting
Tryg's focus on proﬁtability. In this Third Quarter, we are particularly satisﬁed with the
price development in house in Norway, which increases 3.3%; and in motor in Denmark,
which increases 2.8%; all in all, initiatives that will support proﬁtability also going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

On Slide 10, we elaborate on the customer retention rate levels, quite stable and high
levels in private customers in both Denmark and Norway, although we have seen the
Norwegian numbers have some negative impact from the Norwegian economy and a
somewhat elevated level of market share in the last quarters but which seems to have
stabilized more in this quarter. Our commercial lines, we saw an improvements in both
Denmark and Norway compared to Q2 '17, an improvement of 0.4percentage points in
both areas.
And over to you, Christian, on claims.

Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Thank you, Morten.
And on Page 12, as we're looking at the underlying claims ratio. We continue seeing the
improvement that we have communicated before. And we see on group level that the
underlying improvement is 0.4percentage points, as Morten mentioned. And really happy
to and -- pleased that our Private segment is continuing to improve. Here we see the
0.6percentage point quarter-on-quarter. We maintain our overall full year guidance that
the overall full year will be improved compared to 2016.
Turning to Page 13, our motor slide. So to speak. We continue seeing the number of
accident actually and the market statistic increasing over the last couple of months also.
And however, when we look in our own numbers, we are starting to see a little bit of a
tailing oﬀ on the actual frequency. Now for us, the focus is mainly on keeping inﬂation on
our motor book under control, as this is 30% of our portfolio. There has been passed a
new tax legislation in Denmark which has reduced costs, especially for midsize cars. We
do not expect that this will generally change the auto portfolio somewhat. We might see a
little bit of increase in added technology features in the cars going forward, which might

Page 3 of 16



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2017-10-10

just impact our average claims as more technology gets put into these cars. But we will
keep a close eye on this.

FINAL

Turning to Page 14, our components of the underlying claims ratio. We see for the Third
Quarter a somewhat benign quarter for large and weather claims. We had a few rain
showers but still less than normally expected from a Third Quarter. The interest rate has
increased slightly and has impacted our claims ratio about 0.5 [ph] percentage point.
Turning to Page 15, on our expense ratio target of 14. As Morten was saying, year-to-date
we are now trailing at 14.1. And we are seeing a lot of our initiatives that we put through
during 2016 actually giving us the positive impact for '17; especially Norway which is going
from 14.7 in cost ratio to 13.6, which is the area we have seen most restructuring initiatives
reducing back-oﬃce costs and in general a strong cost focus in our Norwegian book.
In Third Quarter's, we do see the number of employees actually increasing a little bit.
Some of this was due to the OBOS acquisition. And some of it was also due to our trainee
program in Denmark, where we are trying to strengthen our common customer and
claims handling functions.

Bloomberg Transcript

Going to Page 17. The asset allocation is virtually unchanged. Bear in mind that our
property exposure on the free portfolio is still below our target level. We expect this to roll
over in the next couple of quarters. So in during ﬁrst half of 2018, to be fully invested in
the property exposures on the free portfolio. But overall our portfolio attitude remains
mostly risk averse.
Looking at the actual performance of the investment book on Page 18, we do see that
we've made DKK 87 million compared to DKK 191 million last quarter. The free portfolio is
the key -- main key driver for the overall performance. The match portfolio is boosted by a
good regulatory deviation, as yields between the Danish and European swap rates was
narrowed. Now bear in mind that, as this might widen again, we will have a regulatory
deviation that will be negative.
Looking on our solvency position for the Third Quarter on Page 19. It is mostly unchanged.
And the SCR is virtually ﬂat. Our own funds is primarily driven by the net proﬁts and the
dividend. But a strong 211 solvency ratio posted for the Third Quarter. And bear in mind
again, with the targeted property exposure rolling in, we should have around DKK 60
million additional SCR as we get fully invested in our property portfolio.
On Page 20, on capital. It is nothing new really on this slide. A stable solvency remains key
for us. And we still have our DKK 1.1 billion Atier 1 capacity, as mentioned in the Second
Quarter.
On Page 21, we again show our sensitivity on the various components and broadly an
unchanged pictures. And we continue to display very low sensitivity on most of the risk
classes there in the portfolio.

So back to you, Morten.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you, Christian.
And just ﬁnally, on targets and outlook that are unchanged. That is a return on equity of at
or above 21% post tax, a combined ratio at or below 87%, cost ratio at or below 14%. Now
bear in mind, on the cost ratio, it is a tight race. We have a very strong quarter with 13.6 in
the Third Quarter and, as we mentioned, 14.1 year-to-date. We will reach our 14% target.
But there are very few insurance companies in the world with a 14% cost ratio. And it is a
tight race to reach it. So don't expect bigger numbers below the 14% mark.
Then of course, ﬁnally, we repeat on our focus on payouts on the last slide, a pleasure to
pay out on a quarterly basis and also knowing that a good proportion of that ﬂows
through to the membership bonus for our customers.
I think, with that, we will take your questions.

Questions And Answers

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Ida Gjosund from
Carnegie.

Q - Ida Melvold Gjosund

{BIO 19788453 <GO>}

Three questions from me, please. Firstly, looking at the Norwegian combined ratio
excluding run-oﬀ gains. It is 5percentage points worse than the year before. Could you
elaborate a bit on the drivers of this negative development, please? And secondly, on the
top line in Norway, adjusting for currency eﬀects and the OBOS acquisition, premiums are
declining by 2% to 3% year-over-year. For how long do you think this development will
continue in Norway? According to some of your competitors, they already see
improvements in the Norwegian market. And third, this quarter, we see the full eﬀect of
the OBOS deal into your numbers. I know that this is at early stage. But could you tell us
something about the proﬁtability of this portfolio compared to the rest of your business
(inaudible)?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Ida, I will start. And then Christian will join me. I think, on the Norwegian combined ratio
excluding run-oﬀs, there's no doubt that, if you look at the portfolio composition, we have
a signiﬁcantly higher weight of Corporate business in our Norwegian business than we
have in Denmark. And there's no doubt that -- both on your question one and two, that
one of our challenges is in the Corporate segment. You can see very good statistics on the
general Norwegian market, where our Corporate and Commercial rates have been down
for the past 3 to four years. And I think most Norwegian and also the Nordic players in
Page 5 of 16

FINAL

Norway have had signiﬁcant run-oﬀ gains. And that has made a total strong proﬁtability.
But there is no doubt that the current underwriting year is not satisfactory and that the
whole market needs higher pricing to secure a combined ratio development which is
healthy.
And as a consequence, we have started increasing rates on Corporate Norway both to
help the combined ratio, as you mentioned. But also on the top line development. There's
no doubt that losing more than 100 million customer in Corporate Norway and also
generally increasing prices in Norwegian Corporate has a large impact. We see in the
quarter Corporate Norway is down 7.8%, which is a very high number in a quarter. If we
look at your question on how long will that be an impact, I would rather exclude
Corporate from the discussion because that is always more volatile. I think, if you look at
the Private and Commercial business, we have a slightly negative top line excluding
OBOS. But if you look at the current developments, we see the early signs of
improvements. In Q3, we see a slightly higher number of customers in private lines
Norway. And we see an slightly, slightly higher number of Commercial customers in
Norway in Q3 as well. And bear in mind it often takes up to two years to get the full
impact of that in the P&L. So that is likely to be the time horizon we are looking at. Then
there was a question on OBOS.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Yes, yes. With respect to the proﬁtability on OBOS, I think you have to bear in mind that
we basically had an acquisition of a commercial book and some private and where we see
most of the growth potential being on the private book which is in line with our
proﬁtability on our overall Private Norwegian book. We kind of have a similar view on the
proﬁtability on the private and commercial books individually compared to OBOS and
Tryg. So there is no, like, signiﬁcant diﬀerence of the proﬁtability in those books.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jakob Brink from Nordea Markets.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Jakob here. I have 3 questions, please. The ﬁrst one is a bit of a maybe unusual question.
But looking at the other ﬁnancial income and expenses, I seem to recall that you have
guided that to be around DKK 50 million per quarter negative. And now it's been quite a
few quarters where it's actually been higher and then DKK 75 million this quarter. So I was
just wondering if something has changed here. The second question is regarding large
claims and weather claims, which seems to be running quite a bit below your sort of
guidance for actually two years now. Should we maybe use a lower ratio here going
forward? Then ﬁnally, Morten, you mentioned on the expense ratio quite clearly that it was
very low in Q3 and also that this is sort of unheard of versus peers. How should we read
that? Are you basically saying that it's currently very diﬃcult to improve it from here? Or
was that not what you meant?

Jakob, I'll try to help you with a couple of these questions. On the other expenses,
nothing has really changed. There is some ﬂuctuation on when we have a -- when we kind
of tried to hedge some of our currency exchange rates and so far. But nothing has really
changed in that line. So you can continue with your expectation that we had before. When
it comes to the weather and large claims, you're right that we've had some good years
where we've been lucky. So to speak. And not have a large weather impact or some really
large claims. But I would say that -- when we do our own internal forecasts, then we use
the similar numbers. So I would kind of not put those now -- down at all. We have
experienced more seasonality in the weather. Some years, they are there. In some years,
they are not. Then Morten, I guess you got a question, an elaboration on expenses.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you. Well I guess, Jakob, I was just trying to make a soft comment that, when we
have a 13.6% in a quarter, I could imagine a risk that people will start to guesstimate cost
ratios well south of 14% as a run rate. And I will just advise against that. I think we're
meeting in November. And in November, we can have a talk about the more longer-term
picture. But I would look at the current run rate as getting to 14% and not get overexcited
by the 13.6% number. That was my mere comment. And in the future, we can discuss in
November.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of AsbjÃ¸rn MÃ¸rk from Danske Bank.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
AsbjÃ¸rn from Danske. If I may go back to the Norwegian business and the top line here
as one of the previous questions were alluding to. So 1.1% lower premiums in local
currencies. The OBOS deal, of course, impacts positively. But then I think you said,
Morten, that you had a single client with premiums around DKK 100 million that left the
books. So could you please just -- if I understood you correctly, could you tell me when
did that customer leave the book? And sort of what was the impact in Q3 from this?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well AsbjÃ¸rn, I think this one customer is out of the book 1st of June...

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
July.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

July, sorry, 1st of July. And I guess that is the main driver. But I think you should also bear
in mind the comment on the need for rate changes in Corporate Norway which applies to
the entire market. And of course, it would be interesting to see how that plays out. And of
course, that could potentially impact the top line for Corporate also in coming quarters.
But of course, we are working hard to secure that we have a stable top line as possible
why -- while putting in place the necessary rate increases in Corporate Norway.

FINAL

All right. Then if I may go to Sweden which looks very solid in Q3, especially year-overyear, could you elaborate a bit on what's going on? Because it seems to me as -- that part
of your explanation for, you can say, the issues in Norway has been lack of scalability or
market share. But I guess that's not really what we're seeing in Sweden which is doing
very well. So what's basically the key diﬀerence right now in Sweden versus Norway?

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

AsbjÃ¸rn, I'm assuming you meaning the Sweden as in the segment and not in the
country. Just to make sure we're on the same treating of that [ph]. But...

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Yes, yes, I do [ph].

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So the segment Sweden, I think, we -- if you kind of turn back time a couple of quarters,
we were talking a lot about some of these extended warranties. We were talking about
some of our yacht portfolio having some adverse development. I think the Swedish
management have done a great job actually getting the claims cost under control,
pushing through price increases on some of the extended warranties and actually getting
the -- putting more help into the proﬁtability of the Swedish book. So that's kind of like
more a going concern that there has been more focus on trying to increase prices in
segments where we have had unproﬁtable development.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Then I guess, in a sense, Sweden, for us, is composed diﬀerently to Norway and Denmark
because we are small from an overall scale point of view. But if you were looking at boat
insurance, for instance, we're the market leader. And if you look at enthusiasts, cars and
motorcycles, again as a niche, we are the market leader. And we now have a sizable
market position in children as well. So it's clear that with the better control of, for instance,
the extended warranty, as Christian mentioned, then these market leader positions are
driving very solid earnings in Sweden. And we are very happy about those positions. I
think, going forward, there's a cross-sales potential which we clearly haven't unfolded yet.
We have very -- a very high number of unique customers in Sweden. But that has only very
few products. So they are very proﬁtable as such. But unlocking the potential of crossselling those will be a focus for Sweden because scale does matter.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Okay. Then on your Danish premiums which were up 0.6% year-over-year in a year where
you have raised prices quite signiﬁcantly. You've had the customer bonus. So what is sort
of dragging down this? And how should we see this going forward where you won't have
this year-over-year, the same beneﬁt from the customer bonus?

I think, clearly, when we look at our Danish top line, AsbjÃ¸rn, I mean, there's a lot of
variation underneath that. I think clearly, for us, private lines Norway with a top line
development of 2.6%, with a very solid bottom line development as well, is extremely
important. And there I think we are performing really well and also better than the general
Danish market. I think Commercial is more sideways, to be honest, from a top line point of
view. I think our main challenge in Denmark from a top line point of view is Commercial
lines. I think it's becoming more and more evident for us that there's a number of areas
where we have invested in products and segmentations and straight-through processing
et cetera in private lines which we haven't invested in, in Commercial lines. We have over
the course of the past 5, six months approved a number of large 2-digit-million projects
on investing in processes improvements et cetera in Commercial lines, where in many
areas we are copying concepts that we can see working in private lines. I think those will
be a prerequisite to becoming eﬃcient enough and being strong enough to drive both
top line and bottom line in Commercial. And I think, to be honest, there will be a sort of 3ish years journey before we see commercial lines Denmark performing at the same level
of private lines Denmark. And it does take a number of investments for us to get there.
But it's positive that we know we can see which concepts in private lines work and steal
from that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Okay. Then a ﬁnal question from my side, on the weather claims. If I understood a
previous communication with you earlier today, it seems like you booked NOK 25 million
or DKK 20 million in weather insurance, weather claims from the cloudburst that we saw in
southern -- in Norway. So if sort of I adjust for this, it seems like weather claims in the
remaining part of your business has been very, very low in the quarter. And I know there
was a question on this topic just earlier. But I was just wondering if -- the impact we're
seeing in weather claims this year, is it coincidental? Or is it -- are you starting to see some
impact from, you can say, initiatives that you've taken to sort of limit weather claims going
forward?

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

I -- AsbjÃ¸rn, this is Christian. I don't think that we are seeing the actual impact of what we
have done to prevent weather claims. I think you have the cloudbursts that we have in
Denmark. You have the windstorms we have in Denmark on the weather side. That has
not really hit the Danish area so much. I think -- if you were to go to the U.S. and say that
weather claims is something that's less important, I think they will very much disagree with
you. So from our point of view, weather is something that will be there once in a while.
And we need to be able to save up money for the days where we actually either get that
big cloudburst -- and hopefully, when we get that big cloudburst, some of the mitigation
that we have done in our policies about raising some of the content you have from the
ﬂoors will make sure the impact won't be as signiﬁcant as it was back in 2011.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think that we are preparing. And we are meeting with the insurers. They will try to drive
an argument that the global price of insuring a natural catastrophe risk is going up. So
which years it hits our geography or not, I think that is more stochastic than anything
systematic.

Our next question comes from the line of Paul De'Ath from RBC.

FINAL

Q - Paul De'Ath
A couple of questions from me, please. And ﬁrstly, looking at the member bonus,
obviously you could see that second year has that -- has been paid now. I was just
wondering whether you're seeing any kind of a change in behavior. Or -- and -- or indeed,
it's just kind of a general view of whether or not it's becoming more well known in the
markets now that you've -- you actually paid out for a second year. That's the ﬁrst
question. Then the second point is just on the automation of the travel claims. So the 20%
of Norwegian claims that now are fully automated. Can you just remind me, how quickly
do you think you can expand that into Denmark? Because you mentioned that that's
coming online soon. And also, is there a limit to how much of that, those kind of claims,
can be fully automated here? And how quickly can you make that 20%, 50%, for example;
and then also move that into home insurance and other areas as well?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Paul, I think, on the membership bonus, we're very pleased to have paid it out for a
second time. We monitor quite closely the awareness and what it does for the business. I
think, on the positive side we've seen that, immediately after the payout, the awareness
amongst current Tryg customers rises from around 40% to around 80%. But the
awareness amongst non-Tryg customers in Denmark is only 16%. And we see a trend
where quite rapidly, after the payout, the awareness falls back to the sort of 40%, 50%
yardstick again. We see that gainfully [ph] after a longer number of years have pushed the
general awareness up to around 90%. So there's still a long, long way to cover. I think, on
-- from a market point of view, we are starting to see, for instance, our bigger partner
aﬃnity groups where we insure all Danish doctors or bigger groups of individuals, there
the awareness is extremely high. And it plays a role in all negotiations in sales and
keeping the customers, whereas for the broad Private and Commercial market the
awareness is still quite low. We are pushing the envelope for the next 3.5 years on
communication and marketing in various forms. And I think there might be a view that we
should increase that even more. But I think it is a sort of 4-year journey to get the
awareness high and get it out to the broader individual audience.

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

And Paul, with respect to the other question, on automation, I think we'll -- it will be a
topic that we'll elaborate much more on when we meet in November because this is
deﬁnitely an area where we see, going over the next 10, 15 years, digitalization. It will be a
huge part of the insurance market.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Okay. Great. I will look forward to that.

Our next question comes from the line of Per GrÃ¸nborg from SEB.

FINAL

Q - Per GrÃ¸nborg
I'm returning to a topic that has been addressed many times today: Norway; and I should
probably call it, the less-impressive performance you have this quarter. You addressed
that you are seeing competitors also meeting to a higher [ph] prices in the commercial
lines. I'm a bit surprised. When I look at Gjensidige's commercial lines, I think they are
doing pretty well even if we take into account that they have some large claims put up
into the parent company. When I look at Sampo's (inaudible), of course, visibility is much
lower. They are also having materially better numbers than you have in Norway. When I
look at your combined ratio, not measuring same big quarters [ph] but doing a 12-month
rolling areas [ph] on your combined ratio in Norway excluding prior year gains, we see
now that, last one half year, you have stabilized at 95%. Now you are talking about Norway
improving at that volume wise. Or is it underwriting wise? I think we need to know
something more to have faith that Norway actually will not stay at the underlying 95%
going forward. I assume that's not your ambition either.

I think -- Per, I think, when we look at the Norwegian numbers, it's quite important whether
you look at Commercial and Corporate or you only look at Commercial. Then secondly, I
think it's very important to say are you looking at combined ratios including run-oﬀs. Or
are you looking at combined ratios for the underwriting year? And I think what we're
saying is that, while -- combined ratio including run-oﬀs have been healthy for the general
industry. Then if you strip out the run-oﬀ gains. That goes, as far as I can see, for all the
players in the market. And you only look at the underwriting year. Then there's very good
public statistics showing what has happened to pricing in the high end of commercial and
in corporate for the past 3, four years. And there you've seen 2 big declines in rates,
which means that in those segments the current underwriting year performance is not
proﬁtable. So that means that the entire market needs to make sure that rates move up so
that the actual underwriting year becomes proﬁtable. Then of course, you can always get
some icing on the cake from run-oﬀ gains.
But I clearly assess that as a market issue. And we're starting to see signs that the general
rates in Corporate Norway is -- that there's an awareness that, that needs to move up. And
we have taken the ﬁrst steps in our business to clearly move up the rates in Corporate
Norway. I think, the improvement signs you asked, I don't know if, Per, I understood the
question. I think what we mentioned was to a question on top line, which I guess is a
diﬀerent topic, where we mentioned that in private lines and commercial lines, not
corporate lines, we've seen a slightly shrinking top line. And what we mentioned there
was the early signs of some improvement in that direction where we've seen an increase
in the number of private lines customers in Norway in Q3. Then we know it takes a rather
long period to get that to become even premium and hit the P&L. Then we also said there
is an ever-so-slight increase in Commercial SME number of customers in Norway in Q3 as
well. But you should hear those as soft indicators of an improvement that was just a lot
more of a longer-term story and not a short-term story. I hope that's slightly clearer.

Our next question comes from the line of Haykon Astrup from DNB Markets.

Q - Haykon Astrup
Haykon from DNB here. You are talking about higher frequency on motor on Slide 13. Is
that the trend that you're seeing in all 3 markets? Also, the comp trail [ph] that -- where
the uptick here in the frequency was particularly strong in Q3.

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

Bloomberg Transcript

Regarding (inaudible) Haykon, this is a trend that we actually speciﬁcally have seen in the
Danish market. When we look at some of the frequency -- and this is on comprehensive
only where actually the frequency in Norway being a little bit more ﬂat than what we have
seen in Denmark. We're kind of struggling to ﬁnd the smoking gun on why this has
happened in Denmark. But there is no doubt that there are more cars on the road. The
economy is better. There is more miles driven in Denmark. Then there is this distracted
driver syndrome that has been going on for the last couple of years. And I think it's a
combination of these diﬀerent aspects that has moved the needle upwards on the
frequency in Denmark. I think, if you zoom out a little bit, there's been a global trend
going on for the last couple of years where more countries both in the U.S. and U.K. have
seen a tick-up in frequency on the comprehensive part of auto.

Q - Haykon Astrup
So you're not seeing the same trend in the Norway and Sweden at the moment.

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

In Norway it has been not as signiﬁcant. So it's been more ﬂat in the frequency on the
comprehensive end-use end [ph]. And the MTPL, we have seen more a slight decrease in
the number of serious injuries for people.

(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Vinit Malhotra from
Mediobanca.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Sorry, if I can ask 3 quick questions, please. Just I know Corporate is not a focus for the
management team. But I would have imagined that the -- given 3Q '16 had that very -- had
a big pickup in midsize claims, sort of polluting the underlying entity one year ago, I was
expecting that maybe there would have been a bit more improvement. And just in line
with this, I mean, it's actually a very good sign that you raised prices so much that a
customer left, I would say, from the underlying proﬁtability point of view. Should this kind
of pricing measure make us a bit more bullish about that area? And I actually appreciate
Page 12 of 16



FINAL

that it's not the focus. But it still has to be part of in the yearly outlook for us. And the
second one is on the run-oﬀs. I mean I've noticed the trend around the court ruling in
Denmark commercial buildings. Is that the real -- is that the single reason why, although
there has been a slight pick-up versus 2Q, this 5.4% is still below a normalized run rate,
would you say? And lastly, just really clarifying back on the motor: If we just look at the
slide that you have very helpfully shown, thank you very much for that, for the number of
accidents, the monthly levels between up to May and then up to August have actually
come down a bit even, maybe volatility monthly. But you still did say that 3Q continued to
be above the month [ph] frequency. I'm just checking if there is a kind of number for the
market. I appreciate. But could you comment just a little bit more on that data, please?

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Vinit, I'll start with the ﬁrst question. If we look at the underlying development, I guess
there is no doubt that, in 2015 and '16, we were struggling seriously with the fact that
underlying claims were increasing. And almost every time we made a new prognosis on a
quarter, it looked slightly worse than anticipated. And of course, that was rather a
nuisance that it has taken us a while to handle that. As a result of that, we have tried to
shapen up -- or shape up our processes of identifying negative claims as early as possible,
reacting as early as possible, doing mitigation and price change as early as possible. And
therefore, we've had a number of quarters where underlying has improved in private lines
but not yet for the group. Then it slightly improved last quarter. And this quarter, it
improved 0.4%. To be honest, we are extremely pleased by the improvement of 0.4%
because that is a sort of 2-year journey that takes us to a positive. And I guess your
question is could that positive be a larger positive. Of course, it could. We would very
much look forward to having a larger positive to -- but to be honest, we are very pleased
with the 0.4%. And bear in mind 0.4% is in a combined ratio of 82.6, which is the best
we've ever had in a Third Quarter. So I don't think -- from the earnings level and
combined ratio level we have, we cannot make drastic movements in any direction. But I
guess, can we make smaller gradual improvements?
That would keep us quite happy. I think, on your question on customers leaving, it's not a
target for us that customers should leave as we increase prices. But it's quite clear that,
when you need higher rates, you need some -- you need to be willing to run the risk that
some customers will leave. And I think we've seen that in the Corporate segment. The
reaction of customers, of course, also depends on what does the rest of the market in
Corporate Norway do. And there we ﬁnd comfort in the fact that it is a broad market
challenge, that rates have been dropping for too long. And hopefully, that will support
our journey to increase prices and also keep also the top line in the process. But we'll see.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Can I just follow up quickly...

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

No, no, just before we change topic: The corporate who left is presumably large. And is it
safe to assume that it's more in the state sector or it's a municipality kind of thing? Or is it
more insulated? Are you able to comment? Because partly [ph] municipalities have been
a problem.

And to your question about these -- the ﬁre and property part of adverse development
and these MGO plates [ph] I think you are referring to, where you will ﬁnd it in our run-oﬀ
split-up is actually on the liability side where we saw the impact is. And when we have
architect and they have given their advice, it's the liability insurance that actually has been
ﬁling some claims on our books. So that's where you can see the impact of these MGO
plates . When it comes to auto or the frequency, I think I actually mentioned in my walkthrough of the slides that we have seen the last couple of quarters a more ﬂattening
frequency for 2017. We will update this graph that we are showing for the next quarter
with full year 2017. So you are right in also the market statistics showing a little bit of a
more of a ﬂat frequency on auto and which we are pleased to see because that means
claims inﬂation is coming a little bit under control.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

And the MGO [ph] eﬀect explaining some of the lower run-oﬀ this quarter. You -- would
you say that? Or...

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

You could argue that, that has an impact on the run-oﬀ level that we've had, an area where
we would need to re-put [ph] up extra reserves, yes.

Our next question comes from the line of Niccolo Dalla-Palma from Exane BNP Paribas.

Q - Niccolo Cornelis Modesto Dalla-Palma
Just a couple of follow-ups again on Slide 13. First, on the new tax registration, apart from
concluding that BMW 7 Series remains extremely expensive in Denmark, is that -- do you
think there is -- that does have an impact on the size of cars sold at all? Or so how relevant
is it to your premium development? And can it change again? And the second question is
on electric vehicles where you -- where Gjensidige has clearly been pointing to some
claims inﬂation speciﬁcally on that type of vehicles in Norway, both on frequency and

average claims. Is it something that you see as well? And have you ﬁgured out why, in
case you see it?

FINAL

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

On the tax side, yes, BMW 7 Series is extremely expensive. I think what we expect the
impact would be is that you'll have more midsize cars in our portfolio. So it could mean
we will see a little bit of a shift from -- away from these very, very small cars to a little bit
more midsize where they have more electronic devices in them and you will have some
better safety. We -- when we run through the numbers and see what do we believe is
going to impact our book, I don't think we expect any, like, huge tick up or tick down
based on this. But it remains to be seen what the behavior of the Danish customers are
once this gets pulled through and we start seeing some of the ﬁrst sales numbers. With
respect to the electrical vehicles, I think it was two years ago where we actually did a fairly
signiﬁcant price increase on electrical vehicles. I think we put more or less a 50-plus-%
increase on prices on electrical vehicles primarily [ph] because we saw some of the trends
that we have mentioned we didn't see, also seen now. Why this is? I think that, if you
would try to ever drive an electrical vehicle, you will ﬁnd the acceleration to be quite
astonishing. I think that surprises a lot of people. But this is personally guessing on why
we might see a little bit more claims on the electrical vehicle side.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

But I think there's -- in addition to that fact. So there is also the facts that we've worked
quite hard on a number of years to make sure that there is top procurement going on in
the repair of the cars. And on ordinary cars, you can have the cars repaired by a vast
number of shops. So there's a lot of market forces on moving the repair costs down. I
think, on some of the repair of electrical cars, for instance Teslas, you can only get them
repaired at very few shops. And the general procurement mechanisms do not really work.
So the repair cost is higher. I think on Teslas, for instance, there is also a mechanism
where, the way the bodywork of a Tesla is structured, a lot of the body parts is glued
together. So there's a bigger risk that you have to shift bigger parts of the bodywork, for
instance. So I think it also has to do with the sort of monopoly status of some players and
a less-eﬃcient repair setup. And particularly in Norway that's an issue because the
number of Tesla's electrical vehicles sold in Norway is dramatically higher than Denmark,
where in Denmark it is really currently the electrical car market has died out again
because taxes have been reintroduced on electrical cars.

Q - Niccolo Cornelis Modesto Dalla-Palma
Okay. And do -- so do you think you need further prices adjustments for that? Or that was
captured with the big price increases two years ago you just mentioned.

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

I think we captured a good, signiﬁcant amount of the trend back two years ago. But as
Morten is saying, there's a lot of moving parts in this. And we continue monitoring the
actual development. And we'll push through necessary both price increases and
procurement initiatives to make sure that electrical vehicles also will be a proﬁtable book
going forward.
