{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to welcome you to our conference call
presenting our results for the first nine months of 2018. As always, I'm joined by our CFO,
Roland Vogel.
The most significant event that had an influence on our results of the Third Quarter were
the recapture charges from our U.S. legacy mortality business, which was a result of our inforce management actions. This resulted in a one-off pretax IFRS loss of USD 260 million,
equal to EUR 218 million. This is very much in line with our reporting that we issued on the
occasion of our half yearly results. After tax, this negative effect is around EUR 170 million.
Considering that despite that, we generated a group net income of EUR 725 million. This
tells you that the performance of our business otherwise was rather satisfactory. In
particular, this relates to our Life & Health business, though the international business
outside North America as well as the U.S. financial solutions business performed fully in
line or even better than our expectations with the Third Quarter performance here, very
much in line with a favorable performance that we have seen in the first half year of 2018.
Our property and casualty business, on the other hand, felt an increase of frequency of
sizable losses below the threshold of our large loss reporting. And thus, the combined
ratio for the first nine months of 96.8% was slightly above our target.

The return on investment from assets under own management again developed very
favorable with 3.2%, well above our benchmark for 2018 of 2.7%. The top line grew
considerably, with the gross written premium increasing by 16.5%, then adjusted for
foreign exchange rate movements, which reflects the increased demand from our clients
for our reinsurance solutions. The bottom line rose sharply compared to 2017, mainly due
to the fact that in 2017, we had suffered the well-known cat losses. However, the EBIT of
EUR 1.15 billion after nine months as well as the group net income of EUR 725 million came
in at a quite acceptable level. This is underlined by the fact that the annualized return on
equity with 11.5% continues to be well above our minimum target of 900 basis points
excess of risk-free rate.
Despite the fact that the book value per share reduced slightly as a result of dividend
payments and interest rates and spread movements, the solvency ratio remained
comfortably above EUR 252 million (sic) (252%) at the end of the half year. And we expect
to be well above our threshold despite the growth of our business also for the 9-month
period.

Bloomberg Transcript

The large loss burden of our P&C business absorbed almost the entire large loss budget
during the Third Quarter. However, if you look at the 9-month period, we are still well
below the budget. Therefore, it can be said that the increased large loss activity during
the Third Quarter was well absorbed within our expected values for large losses.
The premium growth of our Life & Health business of 4.8% adjusted for foreign exchange
rate movement is well in line with our target of growth of 3% to 5%. Also the third -- in the
Third Quarter, our business continued to generate a very positive operating cash flow,
which was the basis for the growth of the assets under own management as well as the
gratifying increase of our ordinary investment income.
On this note, I would hand over to Roland, our CFO, who will explain these numbers in
more detail.

Roland Helmut Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Good morning. And thank you, Uli.
As the nine months result does not include so many one-off effects other than the
recaptures in our Life & Health segment, I will try to keep my comments as brief as
possible.
On the Page #2, we see that the remarkable top line growth of 16.5% adjusted for
currency effect in the first nine months of 2018 is largely driven by our P&C business as we
continue to see ongoing high demand from all clients, especially for structured products.
Net premium earned developed overall in line with the gross premium. The group EBIT
improved significantly, although the individual parts showed a quite mixed picture. P&C
improved remarkably on the basis of a previous year, which was hit hard by the Hurricanes
Harvey, Irma and Maria. On the other hand, L&H is -- or the Life business is impacted by
Page 2 of 18



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE

charges from the recaptures impacting the current year's result negatively to quite some
extent.

FINAL

Finally, even though the year-to-date 2018 development was very satisfactory, investment
income is down because we could not sell our equity portfolio another time, which had
boosted last year's results by more than EUR 220 million pre; as well as after-tax.
On the -- other income and expenses improved mainly due to positive currency effects
and the increase in net income was less pronounced compared to the rise in EBIT,
reflecting a higher tax rate. This is mainly a reflection of the extraordinary tax burden in
connection with the U.S. tax reform in the First Quarter of 2018 and the nearly tax-free
profits from the liquidation of our equity portfolio in the previous year, as already
mentioned.

Bloomberg Transcript

Operating cash flow here on the next page continued to be very positive in the first nine
months, increasing by more than 15% compared to the previous years. And for those who
have been following our Investors Days, I would like to remind you of the impact of the
operating cash flow on the assets under own management as well as the investment
income going forward, which I was trying to make transparent at that occasion.
Looking at the development of our investments and (net) effect from currency translation
and the change in valuation reserve was minus EUR 200 million. Here, the currency
adjustments -- the positive currency adjustments of EUR 500 million were more than
offset by the decrease in valuation reserves due to the rising interest rates and spread
increases, which produced a negative effect of around EUR 700 million. In spite of this and
driven by the positive cash flow, assets under own management increased by 3.5%.
The capital position on the next slide is impacted by the same effects. The dividend
payout is fully covered by the profits from the first nine months of 2018 or the potential
dividend or payout. Rising interest rate in the U.S. and spread increases resulted in a
decrease in unrealized gains, which was only partially offset by positive currency effects,
as already mentioned. Therefore, the overall negative development of the OCI led to a
decrease in shareholders' equity of 2.1%. And here on the left-hand side of the slide, the
picture is nearly unchanged. But let me remind you of the remaining high degree of
flexibility in the Tier 2 bucket, which potentially could be utilized whenever necessary.
P&C gross premium increased by a remarkable 24% on an FX-adjusted basis. The main
driver of this organic growth continues to be new business written by our structured
reinsurance team. Additionally, a few larger transactions in our traditional business lines
contributed to the development, especially in Australia and China.
Net premium developed in line with gross premium. Again, this gross pattern
demonstrates that we do not have a volume problem at all. And this is the basis to stick to
our purely result-driven underwriting approach and that we should only assume business
which lives up to our profitability targets.

FINAL

Following a very benign first half year, we have seen a significant increase in large loss
activity in the Third Quarter, exhausting the budget on a stand-alone basis. However, we
still carry forward the unused budget from the first half as part of our IBNR reserves.
The combined ratio of 96.8% is slightly above the full year maximum target of 96%. This
can be partly explained by the strong increase in our structured reinsurance business,
which naturally comes with a higher combined -- or comes with higher combined ratios of
around 98%, 99% due to the lower risk transfer. As part of the structure of those deals,
the commission is also often slightly higher than the rest of the business. Additionally, we
saw an increased frequency of small and midsized losses in the Third Quarter, which
explains the 98.7% in the stand-alone quarter as such. Overall, the underwriting result is
still rather positive in light of the competitive environment. The runoff of loss reserves in
the first nine months was in line with our expectations overall.
Ordinary investment income increased slightly. And other income expenses also improved
mainly because of positive currency effects. The operating profit increased by 67% due to
the high level of cat losses in the previous year.

Bloomberg Transcript

As mentioned earlier, the increase in the tax ratio is mainly due to the fact that last year's
result benefited from the tax or nearly tax-free disposal of gains and dividends. The
relatively low tax ratio in the Third Quarter is due to a few smaller items adding up to this
positive effect. You might remember that it was exactly the other way around in the
Second Quarter. And therefore, overall, the tax ratio is now in line with expectations yearto-date.
Major losses, on the next slide, were below the expected level and entirely driven by the
very benign first six months of the year. This leaves us with comfortable cushion to absorb
large losses in the Fourth Quarter, including the unused budget carried forward and our
retrocession, which are also nearly fully intact. The large (loss list) is predominantly driven
by the strong storm activity in the Third Quarter both in the Atlantic and the Pacific regions
and particularly in Japan, where a series of typhoons led to widespread destruction and
flooding. The difference between the gross and the net loss illustrates how well our
protection is working. Although, of course, it should be noted that it also includes our
activity in the ILS markets where we are one of the larger players in the collateralized
fronting business. And that also leads to a higher difference in gross and net.
You might ask what we expect from Hurricane Michael. Early in the Fourth Quarter, we
have no concrete calculations available yet. But we would expect Michael to be in the
ballpark of the Florence losses based on the information we have available today.
The next slide shows a little bit of a mixed picture of underwriting profitability by line of
business. Facultative business is affected by large losses. So for instance, also the Ituango
dam in Colombia. Within the U.K. business, we expanded our nonproportional mortal
portfolio, which comes with high initial loss ratio assumptions, well above the 100%. And
marine -- on the other hand, marine aviation credit and surety are significantly below the
MtCR. Most other lines of the portfolio as a whole are close to our target combined ratio.
And on this basis, we would expect to meet our 96% target by the end of this year.

FINAL

On the Life & Health side, here on Life & Health, the gross written premium increased by
4.8%, adjusted for currency effects, which is exactly in line with our expectations for the
entire year. The main driver for this development was gross from U.K. longevity business
and the expansion in China.
Uli has already commented on the development in U.S. mortality. And he will most likely
come back to that as part of the outlook. The very favorable development of our mortality
business outside the U.S. and our financial solutions business in the U.S. as well as around
the world continued in the Third Quarter. Our worldwide morbidity business performed
particularly well with significantly improved profitability. And also, the well-discussed U.S.
mortality business came in better, or to be correct, less negative than expected.
Nevertheless, these positive developments were overshadowed by the recapture effect
we had to reflect in Q3 with an amount of EUR 218 million. Ordinary investment income
increased realized gains. And losses were significantly lower compared to last year's,
partly driven by the increase in interest rates in the U.S. Consequently, net investment
income from assets under own management came down to EUR 232 million. As already
mentioned, we had a one-off effect of about EUR 22 million from the tax reform in Q1
2018. Apart from this, the tax ratio is also somewhat distorted by the quarterly loss in Q3.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking at the investments. The development in the first nine months of 2018 was very
satisfactory, with the investment income remarkably above our return expectations for the
full year. The contribution from private equity and in real estate continued to be quite
attractive. But we've also seen an increase in ordinary income on our fixed income
portfolio.
As presented at our Investor Days, some 3 weeks ago, the reinvestment yields for the
U.S. dollar is currently higher than the maturing yields by quite a margin. And we are
therefore starting to see slightly the benefits of the rising U.S. interest rates in our
numbers and especially the ordinary income.
Realized gains and losses decreased compared to last year, particularly to the sale of our
equity portfolio in 2017. Impairments, depreciations still consist mainly of regular
depreciation for real estate.
Overall, the ROI of 3.3%, if we exclude the effect from our ModCo derivative, which was
minus EUR 4 million after the nine months, the 3.3% is clearly above the full year target.
That means that we will probably see an ROI figure potentially with a 3% also by the end
of the year. But 6 weeks before the end of the year, it didn't make sense to change our
guidance here.
As a result of increased interest rates and widened spreads evaluation, reserves
decreased compared to the year-end 2017. As mentioned at previous occasions, we do
appreciate the slowly growing reinvestment yields and their impact on the ordinary
income. But we also have to get used to a smaller contribution from realized gains.
The next slide shows the usual overview of how the different asset classes contributed to
the ordinary investment income compared to where we are invested. In the course of our
Page 5 of 18

FINAL

portfolio reshuffling, we have reduced our share of high-risk corporates and now -- and
are now investing on a more diversified basis across the rating spectrum again. And we
are also expanding into emerging markets a little bit. Additionally, we have modified the
nature of our government bond holdings and expanded our portfolio instruments with
inflation that coupons and redemption amounts to counteract potentially rising inflation
risks, especially for our P&C reserves.
The left-hand side illustrates the favorable performance of our private equity and the real
estate portfolio. The contribution from the govies is increasing compared to previous
periods, driven by a mix of higher volumes and increasing interest rates, especially in the
U.S., as already mentioned more than once.
I think this concludes my remarks. And as usual, I leave the target matrix and the outlook
to you, Uli.

Ulrich Wallin

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Roland.
Well the target matrix shows most of the targets actually ticked, which demonstrates that
the business performed largely in line with our target. It's fair to say that the earnings
growth is, of course, inflated due to the underperformance of, at the same time in 2017
due to the well-known hurricane losses of last year. But we didn't have to tick it on the
combined ratio, which shows actually what's already mentioned, quite a higher frequency
of losses outside the large losses. But as Roland said, we expect that to come back into
the target level by year-end. Also, I mean, of course, the EBIT growth on Life & Health
would have been there without the recapture. But having the recapture, of course, it's not
there.
That leaves me -- this comes -- we now come to the guidance for the current year, which
we left unchanged from our previous reporting. And I would like to confirm, in particular,
our net income guidance of more than EUR 1 billion, which we expect to achieve, including
the burdens that we have seen from the Third Quarter and expecting for the first -- Fourth
Quarter from our U.S. mortality business due to the already-mentioned recapture. We
have much better clarity of the position on this topic now. And we are expecting a further
negative one-off effect in the Fourth Quarter in the region of EUR 100 million. This burden
should be absorbed by the underlying profitability of the rest of our Life & Health business
so that we do not expect any significant negative result from our Life & Health business
during the Fourth Quarter. As always, our net income guidance is subject to no major
distortions in the capital markets and on the basis that the major losses remains in the
large loss budget. And as the same conditions, we would expect that the dividend payout
should be at least at the level of the previous year of EUR 5 per share.
This then brings me to the development of our P&C business this year. Overall, we
expecting good growth of the premium. That continues on from the first nine months.
And on the profitability, we expect that, overall, we will earn the cost of capital margin. Of
course, here, the very-well diversified portfolio helps to absorb underperforming lines of

Page 6 of 18

FINAL

business, like for example U.K. and Ireland and facultative business this year with other
lines of business that are in line or outperforming the business, such as for example
credit, surety and marine. So despite the continued very competitive market in the P&C
side, we still feel that we are in the position to deliver profitability in line with our target.
Coming to the Life & Health business. We will continue to see, as we have seen in the first
nine months, excellent profitability from our financial solutions business. This is for the
most part a U.S. business. But also our non-U. S. financial solutions business is very
profitable.
Longevity, we see a rather stable development, both bottom and top line. This business is
largely centered on the U.K. business for the time being. But we are working on a number
of very promising opportunities outside the U.K., particularly in countries like Australia,
Canada and -- but also Asia. However, the premium income and profits from those
initiatives would probably only come to fruition in the year 2019 and onwards.

Bloomberg Transcript

Mortality is negative due to the already many times mentioned recaptured-only U.S.
mortality business. It's quite interesting to note that our mortality business outside North
America actually have shown -- I mean, an EBIT margin north of 7%. That has been for
quite some while. And it's also been true for the first nine months. And we also expect
that for the entire year.
On the morbidity business, we have seen clear improvements, both bottom and top line.
So we expect that business will at least earn the cost of capital. However, overall, due to
the loss on -- expected loss on the mortality business, the profitability on our Life & Health
business will be somewhat short of the necessary margin to serve as the cost of capital.
This brings me to the guidance for next year. The guidance for next year, we expect
further growth of our premium income, even though not quite at the same range as in
2018. But well in line with our targets from the target matrix.
Return on investment has been calculated on a bottom-up basis of 2.8%. This was a bit
more than our targets that we had for 2018 and as a result, that just under 50% of our
assets under management are denominated in US dollars. So the ordinary income should
benefit from the significant rise in the interest rates for U.S. dollar investment.
The net income guidance of -- in the region of EUR 1.1 billion is supposed to signal that the
profitability in 2019 will increase as compared to 2018. Because in 2018, of course, the net
income guidance is centering at around a number of EUR 1 billion. Of course, EUR 1.1 billion
is not a point estimate here. It leaves room more ups and down, I would say, from the EUR
1.1 billion. It takes into account that our Life & Health business is expected to be
significantly more profitable in 2019 than it has been in 2018. For our P&C business, the
combined ratio target that we have of 96% or better (would) still hold true for our
expectations and is still the basis for our guidance of 2019. And therefore we feel quite
comfortable with the 1.1 -- with the around EUR 1.1 billion guidance.

FINAL

Dividend payout ratio is unchanged here. However, this -- the growing net income, we
most likely will be in the position to consider an increase in the ordinary dividend which
then most likely will, circumstances allowing, again be boosted by a special dividend.
However, the component of the ordinary dividend should actually increase for 2019. So to
caution you that this is of course all under the same providers that you see in the footnote
of this slide. And of course, I mean, it's relatively (easy) to talk about dividends there for
2019. But the general policy here remains unchanged.
Then this slide that you see here is actually the same I was showing to you on our recent
Investors Day. It should tell you that also in the medium term, we are expecting that our
business model should be capable to grow our profitability of our business based on
outperforming the market on the P&C reinsurance, growing EBIT, EBIT contribution from
our Life & Health business in 2019. But also beyond. And the investment income, of
course, a little bit held back by the reduced valuation reserves as the result of the
increased interest rates and spreads. But these expectations of growing assets under
management gradually would also see increasing bottom line numbers here.
That would end our presentation. And we would be more than happy to answer your
questions. Thank you very much.

Questions And Answers

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of William Hawkins from
KBW.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Uli, in your closing remarks, you just slightly touched on this. But could you be little bit
clearer about how you view the walk from 2018 to 2019 guidance? I mean, it strikes me
that the non-recurrence of the U.S. mortality charges alone should be adding something
like EUR 250 million to next year's performance. Then you've got business growth and
high yields and hopefully an unchanged combined ratio, all of which to me should be
pointing to momentum allowing for a correction of something like EUR 400 million or so.
So I appreciate what you say about conservatism and the rest of it. But could you just be a
little bit clearer? Because to me, EUR 1.1 billion does not seem ambitious if you're going to
achieve EUR 1 billion this year. There must be some negatives I'm missing. So that's
question #1. Then I suppose question #2 is very brief again. You did allude to this. But just
in terms of your commitment to the 96% or better combined ratio, the Slide 17 that you've
repeated from the Investor Day has kind of dropped that number out. And so I'm just
wondering, again, given that you're growing in structured products and the rest of us -and the rest of it, do you want to be pulling back a bit from that 96% or is that still a key
target for you?

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

William, well, I mean, the EUR 250 million improvement you are expecting from the Life &
Health is, of course, a pretax number.
Page 8 of 18



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2018-11-08

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

No. It wasn't, sorry. Sorry, Uli, it wasn't. Because your figure originally is EUR 300 million to
EUR 350 million. And so I tried to take some tax off.

FINAL

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Well I mean, we have EUR 155 million EBIT now. We are expecting at least 0 for the Fourth
Quarter on the Life & Health. So if I add EUR 250 million to that, I arrive at EUR 400 million.
That's probably a fair guess, I would say. Then on the 96% combined here, that is still the
target for 2019, which we expect to reach. We think that the quality of our P&C business
would support that. That is also based on our assumptions that the pricing quality of our
business in 2018 would be at least as good as in -- in 2019 would be at least as good (at if
in) 2018. And well, I mean, if the pricing quality is the same as that, considering that the
large losses remained in the somewhat increased large loss budget to EUR 875 million,
we should reach the 96% or better. So that's all there. Of course, I mean, it's early days
for next year. So we, as we did in previous years, are reasonably cautious. This is our
guidance. You should also take into account that this year. So far, we have a significant
outperformance of our benchmark for our investment income, which will probably remain
until -- for the entire year as well. So that would of course signal a drop in investment
income for next year because the target is 2.8%, which is a bottom-up target. So from
that point of view, I would say we feel comfortable with the -- I mean in the region of EUR
1.1 million (sic) (EUR 1.1 billion). As I said, it's not a point estimate.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Roland Helmut Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Well if I may add one component, Will. I think one of the differences in assumption is here
that you just take out the recaptured charges. We did mention that the mortality business
has been performing better, or I did mention less negative than in the previous years. We
did not assume that for next year already. So we are a little bit more conservative on that
side, which is then -- may also be an explanation for the difference in assumptions.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Just on that final point, Roland. Is there anything for this year in Life & Health that you
would like to highlight that is explicitly one-off in nature beyond that point you just
mentioned? One-off positive in nature?

A - Roland Helmut Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Not really. It was -- we had negative surprises in the past. We had a -- which we were
always wondering should we really write that forward and prolong into the future or is it a
-- statistically a one-off this year. It came in better. Just the mortality came in better. We
didn't have so many large losses with higher sums insured. So we appreciate that this was
the case. But we did not assume this to continue next year and the years going forward to
the full extent.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Yes. It's just one of those years where, in Life & Health, nothing went wrong really outside
the recapture. I mean non-U. S., very strong result. I mean financial solutions (U. S.), very
Page 9 of 18



FINAL

Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2018-11-08

much in line with expectations. That will continue to grow on bottom line next year. And
mortality solutions, I mean, on the old books that we bought from Scottish Re, the
mortality experience was actually quite a bit better than expected and significantly better
than in 2017. We did not assume that, that will also be the same in 2019. So there's quite a
little bit of caution, even though the portfolio has shrunk a lot now there because, I mean,
all the recaptures. And we are currently in the process of evaluating the loss expectations
for the coming years based on this significantly smaller book of business. And -- but that
hasn't been finalized as yet.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Kamran Hossain from RBC.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Two questions. First one is just on, I guess, P&C combined ratio and loss experienced.
Could you -- I mean, a couple of your peers have talked about higher attritional losses in
the quarter. Could you give any comments on that and kind of whether you see this as a
costly blip or something that is around longer term? And the second question, just coming
back to Life. I guess if we net out your (2018) of your EBIT loss, we get to a number which
suggests a higher EBIT than the EUR 400 million, EUR 450 million. Could you talk about
one-offs in this quarter and why we shouldn't take this quarter underlying and then
extrapolate that times 4 for the next few years?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Well I wouldn't say that there are positive one-offs in this quarter. Just nothing went
wrong. I mean that's also a one-off, I would say. And it is obvious something is happening,
in that the EUR 20 million retention per Life, of course, I mean that could also generate
some volatility. No. I mean, it's no positive one-off. I mean it's just, as I said, nothing went
wrong. Of course, if that would be true throughout the entire -- and almost be the truth
throughout the entire 2018 year. But of course, we would think it's rather optimistic to
hope for the same in 2019. So from that point of view, we're obviously a bit cautious there.
I mean losses, losses on the -- underlying losses on the P&C side, particularly in the Third
Quarter, of course, a lot of industry of higher losses. I mean, we had a refinery in Bavaria. I
mean, there was another refinery loss in the Middle East. There was the bridge in Genoa.
Quite a lot of losses. I mean, marine wasn't pristine either. But -- therefore, I mean, we
clearly saw increasing losses. And you can see it in, I mean, in portfolios of large
commercial business with many of our clients. I mean, they have significant losses as well.
And some of them ended up in our books. I mean, I would still say that it's a quarterly
volatility. I wouldn't think that it's a general trend that we can, I mean, assume forward also
in 2019 and to come. But it also reminds us very sharply that there is no room for rate
decreases at the coming renewals.

So the combined ratio at the 98.6% -- or rather, even if it's to nine months, it's 96.8%. To
move towards the fourth -- I know 4Q stand to be sort of in the (90th) range. But just
could you help us understand, I mean, say, either 3Q or nine months, how much is the
effect of the structured solutions or even the large treaties and then this frequency topic
you just mentioned? Just so that -- trying to understand how this can go back to 96% next
year, please. But that's probably my main question.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Thank you, Vinit. Well the financial solutions here, I would say, probably just under one
combined ratio, loss point, percentage point. Why should they move back? I mean, on the
-- we have seen quite a lot of business growth also outside the structured reinsurance.
And I mean, therefore, our rather conservative -- I mean, reserving in the initial
underwriting years plays a major role here. I mean, we have, I mean, combined ratios in
the newest underwriting years valid by the 100 just based on our general conservatism
when we set up our loss reserves. And I mean, we're not expecting to grow to the same
magnitude next year. So the latest underwriting (years) that was subject to that rather
significant growth. Certainly on the shorter to midterm lines, we are expecting to show
some positive development on the loss ratios. That's the main reason why we expect that
to come back. I mean, we still -- of course, we try to keep our buffers on the loss
reserves, which we just had shown you at the occasion of our Investors Day to the extent
possible. I mean, you can see that we didn't have to show a spectacular good combined
ratio on the Third Quarter in order to make up for the recapture. So on the U.S. Life &
Health business, which also shows you that the remaining life business and the investment
income, both actually quite favorable.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

And just for a second follow up on just the Slide 14 please, from today's presentation, the
one which shows the cost of capital by line. And just by virtue of comparison compared to
last quarter, I mean, there's 2 areas which are changing. North America seems to have
gone down in profitability a bit, one notch. And marine seems to have improved. Could
there be a comment from your side on this? Just if I can help link with what we're talking
about anyways?

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Well North America is higher than we would like to see it. That is mainly due to property
losses from the hurricanes. And I mean, marine is -- I mean, on the marine side, we are
actually rather conservatively reserved on the old losses, on -- I mean, on additional claims
reserves. And therefore, we have those coming out at times. And that then makes this
spectacular combined ratio. But the volume is not all that large either. I mean, that is
probably be expected for the entire year, even despite the fact that we have losses like
that German shipyard loss, which is also reasonably sizable despite the fact that we are -our retrocession on (sales works) actually particularly good.

And on these buffers, could you just update us, Uli or Roland, on what is the normalized
sort of normal loss reserve release run rate per annum or per quarter? And is this
changing next year probably? It used to be EUR 50 million a quarter, long ago. But you
updated to EUR 100 million already, I think. And I'm just wondering if it's changing again
next year?

A - Roland Helmut Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Well this is of course difficult to foresee, what's going to happen next year. If we have
business growth and the redundant reserves grow, then of course also the, what we call
the regular runoff should be growing. We haven't been growing the redundancies over
the last years dramatically. So in that regard -- and I think we updated that when we
discussed the extraordinary EUR 800 million last year, that a regular accepted or
expected number should be around EUR 400 million for the year. But also this is, of
course, then -- and not a certain number because it can be impacted, especially also by a
large contract where you sometimes have movements from commissions into losses and
vice versa. But the EUR 400 million would be the ballpark number per year, which we are
expecting, which we also have been seeing in previous years.

Our next question comes from the line of Jonny Urwin from UBS.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jonathan Peter Phillip Urwin

{BIO 6126952 <GO>}

Just two -- two for me, please. So firstly, could you talk us through your thinking behind
increasing the cat budget? Is it just that you've grown a lot for this year? I guess I always
thought your cat budget was always quite plentiful. So no great need to increase it. And
secondly, how do you expect percentage of capital to react to the losses through the
Third Quarter and Fourth Quarter so far, if at all?

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Well the increase in the cat budget is just a factor of the actuaries because you calculate
the expected losses on the natural catastrophe side on an annual basis and with an
increase to -- I mean, to increase underlying exposures, which always happen inflationarydriven and also, I mean, some slightly increased aggregates that we have written on the
cat business that just came out with a high expected loss. We also have more premium as
a result of that. That's the reason -- I mean it hasn't grown significantly. And we kept it
stable for number of years. I mean if you just look at the actual experience, you might say,
well, I mean, EUR 825 million is plenty because in most years, we are not hitting that. But
this is just an actuarially calculated number, which we also use for our planning purposes.
That's on the large loss budget, why we increase it, to reflects just increased exposures
and increased premiums as well. The other question, the losses in the Third Quarter and
the Fourth Quarter. What was that due to the market? I think it should allow us to, I mean,
not give away any of the, I mean, rate increases, not large enough but the rate increases
as we got in 2017. And on the contracts that have suffered losses and our negative
territory as a result, I mean, we would expect further rate increases.

FINAL

Alternative capital, while this is a difficult one to predict, I would say -- I mean the results of
the alternative capital facilities this year have not been brilliant. Of course, it's a mixed
picture. I mean the variety of outcomes from various funds is quite different. But I mean I
would expect that the investors might be a little bit more cautious for 2019 than they have
been for 2018 because some of the expectations on significant rate movements have not
been fulfilled. And I mean, if the investors look at the Guy Carpenter Rate On Line Index,
they would have a very good proxy to -- what to expect.

And our next question comes from the line of Sami Taipalus from Goldman Sachs.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Just to ask a question on pricing, actually. I understand your comments regarding the loss
experience this year and obviously why that should (help) support the pricing in the
following year. But if we just look to one-one purely, which I guess is more Europe-focused
and casualty-focused, could you just provide a more specific outlook for just one-one,
what you expect to see there? And also maybe comment a little bit about what you're
seeing in terms of demand for large P&C transactions. Then my second question is on
investment income. It's just not quite clear to me how much of the ordinary investment
income in this year, year-to-date is extraordinary and how much is -- you consider to be
fully ongoing. So it'd be great to have some more detail there, please.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Well I mean on the pricing, in Europe in particular, I mean, we expect that to be rather
stable because there have been quite a lot of losses in the market. And if you look at the
reportings of the larger reinsurers so far. And look at the combined ratios and compare
that, say, with these reporting sets at the same time in 2016 and in 2015, for argument's
sake, you would see that the combined ratios are remarkably higher now. So that shows
you that there is no room for rate reduction. And also, such as that there are more
programs that are actually in the loss position this year than there have been in previous
years. And that will have an effect on the pricing, I'm pretty sure. Demand for reinsurance
is still, I would say, rising. Particular -- I mean some of the -- of our clients have experienced
significant volatility in their own results. And of course -- particularly on the commercial
lines. And as a result, are quite interested in getting reinsurances in place that uses that
volatility. And as a result, both large and small; to medium-sized transaction, we would
expect to see more demand in the market for that into 2019. On the investment, ordinary
investment, I would, of course, hand over to Roland.

A - Roland Helmut Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Thank you. Sami, we had, especially in the last years, some extraordinary distributions
from larger funds, PE funds as well as high-yield funds. There was, I think, one also this
year. But I would not really see that as an extraordinary ordinary income contribution. So in
that regard, I -- again, there was one. But there could be another one also next year again.
So we should really see that as driven by ordinary, ordinary income and nothing special.
No one-offs included in there.

Our next question comes from the line of Frank Kopfinger from Deutsche Bank.

FINAL

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Actually, I have a follow-up question on Sami's question because I still don't understand
how you get to this 2.8% guidance return on investment for next year. And as after the
first 3 quarters, you had already an ordinary investment yield of 3.3%. And you just said
that this is already the ordinary level. So I still don't see the gap to the 2.8%, which you
have within your guidance. Then secondly, how should we think about the unused major
loss budgets for 2018? Obviously, as of now you have still EUR 460 million unused. There
will be some effects obviously in Q4 and probably to come. But how should we think
about the residual? Are you going to put it into the reserves or are you able to release it
into the result?

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well on the (lay down), I mean I would say this gives us good confidence that the loss ratio
for the entire year will drop below 96% because that is still there. It's -- also at least, on
the cat side, it's highly unlikely this year that the cat losses will be able to exhaust our
budget because of our retrocessional structure. So I think it's quite, quite likely that we will
end up with unused large loss budget also at the end of the year. But just due to the
structure of our retrocessions. And on the 2.8%, that's far too complicated for me.
Roland?

A - Roland Helmut Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

You're right. We had mentioned the 3.3% as ordinary investment income. But that is, of
course, before any depreciation and any expenses. So in that regard, we have to deduct
already this year, if you look at the publication, some 40 basis points. And that would then
result at 2.8% to 2.9%. And we cannot expect really contributions from disposals going
forward. Yes. We -- our evaluation reserves came back from EUR 1.7 billion to EUR 900
billion by the end of the quarter based on what was happening since then. You can
imagine that this number is lower rather than higher today. And the remaining
contributions to the valuation reserves do come from the more illiquid classes like real
estate and private equity and high-yield funds. So in that regard, we just have to expect
that there will be -- and this is the basis of our planning, that there will be no contribution
from realized gains and losses. We might also have to see that disposals and sales of
securities will be still associated with the realization of negative reserves. And from the
bottom-up calculation we did, maturing yields, new investments, the 2.8% is what we
achieve. Could that also be 2.9%? Yes. But again, the contribution from realized gains is
not expected to be as high as in the past. And I think if you look at the publications of also
the industry this year, we've already seen also, not only for us. But also for the industry
that these contributions cannot be taken into account as much any longer. Still, we
appreciate that ordinary investment or reinvestment yields are rising again.

FINAL

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous Research.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

I think, Uli, you suggested there was continued appetite out there for more demand for
structured solutions in the P&C Re business. Is there any sort of natural limit to how much
of this business you want to write? Presumably, more -- there will be a greater earned
effect on the combined ratio in '19 than what we've seen this year in terms of inflating the
combined ratio, I think. Just clarify that's the case. And related to these large deals, what
is the group's current appetite on U.S. casualty? I think it's not for some of the wider
nationwide deals. But maybe just clarify that.

A - Ulrich Wallin

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Yes. I mean, of course -- I mean, from principal point of view, we write the business that
fulfills our margin requirements based on our assessment. From that point of view, of
course, there is no limitation for our colleagues that do these deals. Of course, I mean,
we are looking a little bit more for structures that have a higher, say, EBIT margin based
on the premium. And of course, I mean, it's also a question on the margins which should
depend on the type of deal. But we still have -- continue to have an appetite for this deals
as long as we have a very good return on them on the capital (applied). So you would see
-- probably, growth of that is always a little bit difficult to predict because many of these
are written for 100%. And yes, I mean, we have already month for margin. And if
somebody else is prepared to calculate with a sharper pencil, they will get the business. If
we have a sharper pencil, we get it. So you can see, it's quite price-sensitive business. But
I think that you would see further growth in it. At least, that's set in the business plan for
next year. U.S. casualty, still, we are (enervate), I would say, on the large excess and
umbrella business, where we have hardly any on the books now, particularly U.S. We
continue to do that. I mean, where we write our U.S. casualty, which was just still a sizable
book, is more -- this is more to a medium-sized clients in the U.S. And it's more the many
and more specific contracts than writing single, large contracts on U.S. casualty. That, for
the time being, remains our strategy. We see positive movements in the U.S. casualty
pricing, which we, of course, observe, which slightly increases our appetite. But certainly
not for unsupported large excess and umbrella accounts.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And just to be clear on the -- there is more inflation in the combined ratio from the
structured solutions next year, isn't there? In calendar year -- we haven't -- it hasn't fully
(run) through yet?

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Yes. I mean, the returns on the structured solution business next year should increase
actually remarkably. And the reason for that is that we realized a profitability backloaded
Page 15 of 18

on that. And particular the newer, larger transactions will contribute to the 2019 EBIT, more
-- significantly more favorable or more significant than we have seen in 2018.

FINAL

Our next question comes from the line of Andreas SchÃ¤fer from Bankhaus Lampe.

Q - Andreas SchÃ¤f er
I just want to come back to the issue of Life & Health Re insurance. I mean, you mentioned
that this underlying EBIT of roughly EUR 150 million in Q3 was not really affected by huge
(exceptionals). But looking at your ordinary investment income or looking at your
investment income from own sums, it's almost EUR 100 million and EUR 20 million above
the run rate (of the first) quarters. Is there any part of big realized capital gains in the
earned EBIT of more than EUR 150 million? Or is that really a normal run rate in terms of
investment result?

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

I think, Roland, that's one for you.

A - Roland Helmut Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We have not seen large realized gains or any extraordinary gains on the Life & Health
side. So in that respect, I'm not aware of any one-off here. So we should assume it is a
regular result here. So I think we will have to dig into that a little bit more. But again,
overall, there have not been any extraordinary investment gains on the Life side.

Q - Andreas SchÃ¤f er
I was just pointing to the fact that the, overall, your realized capital gains were, again,
pretty high at almost EUR 50 million. So it's just P&C? Or...

A - Roland Helmut Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Again, as we mentioned before, of course, the contribution from the realized gains, it
didn't -- that also had to do with the restructuring on the Life side. Early this year, we had
to move some investment portfolios from one jurisdiction to the other based on the tax
reform. That came with some realized gains already. And as I mentioned before, we will
not see these realized gains into the future. Still, as the reinvestment deals are rising. And
we see the still positive cash flow increasing the assets under own management, we do
assume that the contribution on the net investment income side should be stable.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

But we also see, I mean, good growth of the profitability, for example, of our Chinese
business. And that refers to both financial solutions as a lot of very traditional business. So
I mean, this kind of growth that we have seen on the Asian business, for example, or the
Australian business, is actually contributing very positively.

Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Fossard from HSBC.

FINAL

Q - Thomas Fossard

Two questions. One, remaining on the story on the investment income. Because looking
at Slide 10, Q3 stand-alone, ordinary investment income is at EUR 360 million. And this
compared to EUR 317 million Q1, EUR 317 million Q2. So still, there seems to be a pretty
significant pickup in the Q3 stand-alone. That would be the first question. Second question
would be relative to the Life business and the -- I mean, the financial solutions business,
which I think a significant part of it is coming in the order income and expenses line. So
actually, you're seeing a deposit accounting treatise generated an EBIT of EUR 144 million
year-to-date. This compared to EUR 139 million last year. So after a significant -- a couple
of years of significant increase, it seems to be that we are more, I will say, reaching now a
kind of plateau, flat EBIT growth on that side of the business. Could you comment a bit
more on what we should expect going into 2019?

A - Ulrich Wallin

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Well of course, I mean, we had a significant increase in the deposit accounted income, I
think in 2017, which was related to a few large transactions. I mean, we still expect this line
to grow further. But of course not at the same pace as we have seen, unless we get a
similarly large transaction, which could be -- it's not that likely because, I mean, a lot of
that, the larger transactions revolves around XXX and AXXX reserving. And of course, this
principle-based reserving is the only older existing blocks of business. And so there's only
opportunities as they get, I mean, reshuffled. And I mean, it has changed in the way, say,
as the collateral debt finance. So I would expect that the deposit accounted income, we
are not dropping the coming years. But the growth of that will not be as pronounced.

A - Roland Helmut Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Let's go back to the ordinary investment income. I think there was not a real structural
change in our portfolio, which would be a reason that we have a remarkable shift here.
And if stand-alone quarters deviate from each other, that might also really be an issue of
when funds or investment managers report what. Still, of course, as reinvestment yields
are rising and the cash flow was positive, one should assume that, over the course of the
year, the contribution to ordinary should be increasing over time just based on higher
reinvestment yields and that -- and the volumes which are accumulated. But that was not
driven by some structural changes in the portfolio. I hope that explains what's going on
here. So again, what you mentioned, this EUR 360 million here being higher than the
previous year and also being higher than the average of the previous stand-alone
quarters, I would not really see that going forward. But again, that this is rising over time,
that is explainable by, again, accumulated volumes and a little bit higher reinvestment
yields over the course of the year. But this is not -- it could also be really that some of the
investment income is accrued in the one month rather than the other month.
