Kevin J. O'Donnell
Thanks, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'll open the call with an overview of our
performance, then Jeff will go over the financial results, and I'll come back on to talk more
about the business and the market.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm pleased to report that we had a solid first quarter with an operating return on equity
of 13%. Our results benefited from strong underwriting, light cat losses, and good
investment returns. There are a couple of significant one-time items in the quarter's
results, which Jeff will take us through shortly.
We closed the acquisition of Platinum on March 2 of this year. We are pleased with our
integration efforts so far and with the reception we're getting in the market. We are
working well as a team and everyone is clear about the roles within the group. The close
of the transaction was the culmination of months of hard work on the part of employees
of both companies. This preparation allowed us from day one to begin facing our clients
and brokers as a single entity with enhanced capabilities and offerings in the casualty and
Specialty Reinsurance arena.
The addition of Platinum's book of business to RenaissanceRe's furthers our reputation as
a highly flexible partner offering a broad suite of products and capital options. The broad
themes we discussed on our recent calls still resonate, with the supply of reinsurance
capacity significantly outstripping demand.
As we've been highlighting, recent entrants into the Catastrophe Reinsurance
marketplace have enjoyed outsized returns for a protracted period of time. This has been
driven in no small part by the lack of a major Hurricane in the U.S. since 2005, resulting in
an abundance of capacity and an under-appreciation by some of the risk being
underwritten. Our team is showing underwriting discipline in this environment and is
demonstrating market leadership, not only by the business we write, but by the business
we do not write.

FINAL

We continue to earn a place as a preferred partner with our customers through our strong
ratings, longstanding relationships built over more than two decades and our
understanding of the market. Our track record of innovation and helping our customers
adjust to market changes continues to position us well for the future.
With the Platinum acquisition behind us, RenaissanceRe remains in great financial shape.
Our capital management strategy remains consistent and we will continue to look for
opportunities to return capital when conditions are right.
Now, let me turn the call over to Jeff.

Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover our results for the first quarter and
then give you an update to our 2015 top line forecast, which now incorporate Platinum's
business.
We had a profitable first quarter, again benefiting from solid underwriting, relatively low
catastrophe losses and strong investment performance. Each of our segments generated
profitable results.

Bloomberg Transcript

Platinum's results for the first time are incorporated in our financials. We elected to
maintain our segment reporting structure of property Catastrophe Reinsurance, Specialty
Reinsurance and Lloyd's to make historical comparisons easier.
There were also some one-time items included in (5:58) more on as I go through in my
remarks. We reported net income of $168 million or $4.14 per diluted share and operating
income of $126 million or $3.10 per diluted share for the first quarter.
The annualized operating ROE was 12.9% for the first quarter. Book value per share grew
5.6% during the quarter, although our tangible book value per share, including change in
accumulated dividends decreased by 0.5%, due to an increase in goodwill and intangibles
related to the Platinum acquisition.
Before I go on to the segment results, let me touch on two unusual items in the quarter,
which we would consider more one-time in nature, but are included in our operating
income. First, our results in the quarter included $40 million of transaction related
expenses for the Platinum acquisition. Of this amount, $28 million was directly tied to
compensation related items for Platinum employees and the remainder to banking, legal
and other consulting fees incurred by RenaissanceRe.
As we look out to the future, we anticipate we are likely to incur an additional $10 million
of compensation related expenses tied to the acquisition. Thus, we anticipate one-time
expenses tied to the Platinum cost synergies we hope to attain will total approximately
$38 million. This compares with our prior guidance of around $30 million.

FINAL

As an offset, we would expect annual cost savings also to slightly exceed our prior target
of $30 million on a full annual run rate basis. All transaction related expenses have been
booked in our corporate expenses line.
The second unusual item in the quarter was an income tax benefit of $48 million,
reflecting a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance that we had against
our U.S. operation. Following the Platinum acquisition, we went through a detailed process
to evaluate future profitability in the U.S. and determined that it was appropriate to take
down the entire valuation allowance that we had in place.
With that, let me shift to the segment results, beginning with Cat and Specialty
Reinsurance and followed by our Lloyd's segment. Since the Platinum acquisition closed
on March 2, our financials only include Platinum's results for the month of March. As a
result, there is very little impact to the top line in the quarter from the acquisition since
most of Platinum's business in the quarter was booked at January 1.

Bloomberg Transcript

In our Cat segment, managed cat gross premiums written declined $73 million or 14.7%
compared with a year ago. Since Platinum's business largely renewed at January 1 and
was not included in our numbers, there was no material impact from its business on the
growth rate of this segment. There were no reinstatement premium adjustments in either
period. The top line decline for cat premiums in the quarter was largely driven by
sustained pricing competition at January 1 and our decision to pull back from business that
did not meet our return hurdle rate. This compares with our full year guidance for a
decline of 10% on a standalone basis for RenaissanceRe.
As a reminder, managed cat includes the business written on our wholly-owned balance
sheets as well as cat premium written by joint ventures, DaVinci, Top Layer Re and
Upsilon.
The first quarter combined ratio for the cat unit of 24.8% benefited from low catastrophe
loss experience. Net favorable reserve development totaled $17 million for the cat unit in
the quarter, reflecting small adjustments to a number of events, including $5 million for
the 2011 tornadoes in the U.S.
In our Specialty segment, gross premiums written decreased by $30 million or 19.4% in
the first quarter compared with a year ago. Specialty premiums include approximately $19
million of gross premiums written from Platinum since the March 2 close date. The
premium decline relates primarily to timing differences or restructuring of select large
credit related transactions. As we've often stated in the past, percentage growth rates for
this segment can be uneven on a quarterly basis, given the size and nature of the
transactions.
Going forward, all of Platinum's non-catastrophe Reinsurance business will be booked in
the Specialty Reinsurance segment. The Specialty combined ratio for the first quarter
came in at 77.5% and favorable reserve development totaled $10 million in the quarter.

FINAL

In our Lloyd's segment, we generated $130 million of premiums in the first quarter, an
increase of 56% compared with the year ago period. This compares with our full year
guidance for premiums to be up over 10%.
Ceded premiums in our Lloyd's operation also increased significantly from a year ago, as
we commenced a ceded quota share transaction for our casualty business late last year.
The Lloyd's unit came in at a combined ratio of 97% for the first quarter, also benefiting
from generally low loss activity. The adverse reserve development of $4 million was
principally driven by higher than expected claims emergence for the 2014 underwriting
year in our crop hail book. Operating expenses were roughly flat compared with a year
ago, but commission expenses were higher.
Turning to investments, we reported net investment income of $40 million in the first
quarter. Our alternative investment portfolio generated a gain of $14 million in the first
quarter, driven by solid results in our private equity portfolio. Recurring investment income
from fixed maturity investments remained under pressure due to low yields on our bond
portfolio and totaled $26 million in the first quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

The total return on the overall investment portfolio was a solid 4.2% on an annualized
basis for the quarter. Investment returns benefited from higher realized and unrealized
gains on the fixed maturity portfolio, due to a decline in interest rates and credit spreads
and strong returns from alternative investments.
Our investment portfolio remains conservatively positioned, primarily in fixed maturity
investments, with a high degree of liquidity and modest credit exposure. The duration of
our portfolio remained relatively short at 2.3 years and has remained roughly flat over the
course of the year. The yield to maturity on fixed income and short-term investments
remained flat at 1.6%.
As we've stated on recent calls, we continue to believe we have capital in excess of our
requirements given our current portfolio and our outlook for business growth. While we
did not repurchase any shares in the quarter, our philosophy around capital management
has not changed. Any decision relating to share repurchases will likely depend on our view
of business opportunities, the profile of our risk portfolio and the valuation of our stock.
We were, however, active in other aspects of the capital structure. In March,
RenaissanceRe executed a $300 million senior note deal with a 10-year maturity, the
proceeds of which were used in the financing of the Platinum acquisition. On the back of
that transaction, DaVinci issued $150 million of 10-year senior notes last week at what we
believe are attractive terms. The goal of the DaVinci debt transaction was really to
optimize its capital structure, while also providing the entity access to the public debt
markets. DaVinci is a unique vehicle that continues to differentiate itself in the
marketplace.
Finally, let me turn to update our top line forecast for 2015. These forecasts include the
financial results of Platinum. However, since the deal closed in early March, as I referenced
earlier, business written by Platinum prior to that date is not included in the premium
Page 5 of 22



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

figures or our guidance. Overall, our expectation is for Platinum's book of business to
decline approximately 10% from 2014, primarily reflecting a more competitive pricing
environment and our decision to cut back on some business.

FINAL

With the acquisition now completed, we have begun to renew the business from both
entities as a single platform with a common brand, so we will not be referring to the
books of business separately going forward.
And thinking about guidance, the following should be gauged against RenaissanceRe
standalone 2014 gross written premiums. For managed cat, we are maintaining our full
year guidance of premiums to be down approximately 10%. We only have about $40
million of Platinum's premiums that are left to be renewed for the rest of this year and so
we prefer to maintain our current guidance at this time.
In Specialty Reinsurance, we would now expect premiums to be up approximately 50%.
This guidance incorporates expectations for our book as well as the renewal of Platinum's
book of business of the remainder of the year. In our Lloyd's unit, we expect premiums to
be up 50% for the year.
Finally, I'd remind everyone that premium estimates of this nature are subject to
considerable risk and uncertainty and our goal in providing them to you is to give you our
best estimates at this point in time.

Bloomberg Transcript

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin.

Kevin J. O'Donnell
Thanks, Jeff. So, let me share some comments on our business, starting with Catastrophe
Reinsurance. Pricing and dynamics overall were as anticipated with abundant capacity and
competitive signings. We are continuing to see broader coverage offered in the market.
Unlike price reductions, which are easier to capture and evaluate, coverage extensions
are often not factored into the market return because they are more difficult to assess.
But price reductions and coverage extensions are two sides of the same coin, both
serving to lower the return on capacity provided.
The April 1 renewal is typically focused on Japan. As has been the case throughout our
business, the Japanese renewal was competitive, where we were able to retain attractive
business, thanks to our longstanding and strong relationships and to the large capacity we
bring. Despite the price reductions in recent years, pricing for Japanese earthquake risk
remains higher than prior to the Tōhoku earthquake in 2011.
As we approach the June 1 renewal, we are optimistic that we will see a rise in demand as
Citizens depopulation continues and the FHCF purchases in the private market for the
first time in its history. We believe this is the right step for Florida. We also believe the
market could provide significantly more capacity in future years, should the FHCF choose
to purchase more.

FINAL

Although we are expecting more demand for Florida capacity, we continue to perceive
pricing pressure at this renewal because supply is still eager for this risk. We have
tremendous access to risk in the Florida market and believe that we can and will construct
a market-leading portfolio at this renewal. However, we will continue to exercise strong
discipline in our assessment of the risk and need to be paid adequately for the risk we are
assuming.
One last thought on Florida. While we are all thankful that Florida has not experienced a
major Hurricane in almost a decade, it is our belief that the risk of an event in Florida has
not changed. Recent good fortune should not alter one's analysis of the risk.
Outside of property reinsurance, our franchising capabilities in casualty and specialty lines
have been significantly enhanced with the Platinum acquisition. We have rebranded
Platinum's U.S. balance sheet as Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. Inc. and expect the
platform to be core to our onshore U.S. strategy.

Bloomberg Transcript

Feedback from brokers and clients has been overwhelmingly positive. Our organic growth
initiatives, strong customer relationships and addition of experienced underwriters to the
team have continued to generate access to profitable risk. Even though the marketplace
remains competitive, we look to grow our business with core clients in areas which we
were able to generate the best returns.
While we hope to see stabilization in ceding commissions, clients are still in the process of
consolidating reinsurance programs. Consolidated structures can be complicated to
underwrite and require additional volatility to be assumed by the reinsurance market.
RenRe has great underwriting capabilities to assess this risk and we have efficient capital
for those structures due to the significant cat component of our portfolio. We are pleased
to accept our customers' volatility as long as we are adequately paid to do so.
Moving to our Lloyd's business now. Our Lloyd's unit had a profitable quarter, achieving
significant growth in target classes. As with other platforms, Lloyd's is reaping the benefit
of relationships we have had in Bermuda for 20 years.
Lloyd's is able to deploy insurance paper to help our reinsurance partners, and we had a
good success in writing some niche insurance lines we have been working on for several
quarters. We have the underwriters and platforms in place to scale this opportunity into
the future. This operation continues to mature into a great franchise and we expect to
see steady progress in this business.
Finally, I'd like to make a couple of last comments on our acquisition of Platinum. As Jeff
highlighted, we have made great progress in our financial integration, but we have also
made great progress in our business integration as well.
At the outset, we outlined the principal drivers of the acquisition, which were to benefit
our clients by expanding our product offering, to accelerate the growth of our U.S.
reinsurance platform and to increase efficiencies in the property portfolio.

I am pleased with the progress we are already making in every regard and I am confident
that we are realizing the value of Platinum as part of our franchise.

FINAL

Going forward, we are uniquely positioned to offer capacity to our clients across our rated
and unrated balance sheets and to bring value-added solutions. We will look for
opportunities to optimize the returns on our book. We will remain innovative and evaluate
all options.
And with that, we're ready for questions. Operator?

Q&A
Operator
And your first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning. A couple of quick questions. Can you explain a little bit about the
non-goodwill intangibles that you picked up on the balance sheet from Platinum?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

We can't, Josh. So I think here'd be my suggestion. I appreciate that there's probably a
number of questions about the details of these, both the fair value adjustments and the
intangibles. We have a very detailed presentation of those in our 10-Q, which we're going
to file later today.
I'd say that for those interested, though, at least qualitatively right now, generally, the
income statement or the impact of the fair value adjustments in the intangible
amortizations roughly offset one another in the income statement. They're obviously
going to flow through different line items. And without reviewing those tables, I think it's
going to be hard to probably have a meaningful dialogue.
So, my suggestion is that we probably take those offline for now. And after you've had a
chance to review the disclosures, we're happy to review them in any level of detail that
you'd like.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

I'll trust you on that one. Okay. And you said that your philosophy around capital return is
unchanged. I'm wondering if we can talk about that philosophy a little bit and how it
relates to ROE.

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Well, the philosophy is unchanged in that we have a belief that if we don't have – if we
don't believe we can use our capital within the business within a reasonable timeframe,
Page 8 of 22



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

we feel it's important to return to our shareholders. We think that is important because it
is – because a critical part of being able to access capital is being a good steward of it and
returning it when you can't use it.

FINAL

So that part has not – that part has really not changed and I don't expect it to change in
any meaningful way going forward.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And given that situation, does it matter what your ROE is? Are you more aggrieve on
buying back your shares at a higher ROE?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Our ROE doesn't – well, the only impact ROE has, and it does play into the calculus of it in
terms of our valuation and our forward-looking valuation, our forward-looking ROEs play
into the valuation at which we find the stock more or less attractive as a purchase, yes.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And so how do you think about – I guess I'm sort of setting it up here and you might say,
look, that's not exactly how we think about it, but at a higher ROE with nothing to do
without capital deployed, you'd be buying back very aggressively. Obviously, the ROE of
the business isn't what it was five years ago. Is it still an attractive ROE that at book value
you think one of the best things you could do if you can't grow the business is to buy back
stock?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Well, there's a lot of factors that come into play and whether or not we buy back stock in
any particular period, including our – the stock of excess capital, our forward look for the
ability to deploy it in the business. But generally speaking, we have tended to be
aggressive repurchasers of our stock, certainly south of 1.2 times book.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
One thing I'd add is, if you look at last year, we repurchased over $500 million of stock
and we deployed another $600 million in cash into Platinum. We've built our franchise I
think in a very constructive way. And the analysis that we'll do to think about repurchases is
exactly – we're deploying capital into business as exactly as to what it was before.
I think there's lots of things that we consider in thinking about how to manage capital,
including what is the price of the shares, what is the liquidity that we have, what is the
excess capital we have, and then also things that are beyond our control is where are we
in the exposure cycle. None of that has changed for 2015 compared to 2014.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

I appreciate the all the color and good luck in the coming year.

FINAL

And your following question comes from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning. First, I have a few question related to the Platinum, like,
acquisition. On the managed cat down 10% full year guidance, does that including the $40
million of Platinum in the rest of the year?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Yeah. Kai, thanks for the question. Let me – again, anticipating a few questions on this,
maybe it'd be helpful to put the full context of the – maybe a little bit more context
around the premium discussion, then I'll let you get to your next question, if you would.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Sure.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

So, as I said in my prepared remarks, as a general statement, we expect the premiums
written on Platinum's book in 2014 will largely be renewed this year, although we expect
the total premium to be down about 10%, mostly reflecting competitive pressures in the
market.
So, at a high-level, we like their book and we expect to renew the vast majority of it. So
that's just kind of a qualitative assessment of their book. For the – if you're trying to look at
the numbers more granularly – let me lay out how we think about the respective books
and the dynamics underlying them.
So, again, just to remind you that any premium booked by Platinum prior to March 2 does
not appear in gross written premiums. So the January 1 renewals for Platinum were a
reasonably large part of their overall book and approximated $195 million prior to March 2.
Of that amount, about $65 million was cat related premium and the remainder, or $130
million, was specialty casualty. Now, that amount is higher than you would see in Platinum's
numbers for last year and that mostly reflects aligning Platinum's accounting policy with
ours for the recognition of gross written premium. They just did it a bit differently than we
did.
So as I noted earlier, we expect our managed cat premiums to be down about 10% versus
RenRe standalone numbers. Obviously, this is going to be different in practice, given the
size of the renewal and the relatively early stage of it. But with only $40 million of Platinum
Page 10 of 22



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

premium yet to be renewed, we thought it was a little bit of false precision to guide much
differently than the down 10% that we previously had.

FINAL

Our Lloyd's guidance is obviously up significantly. This, in our view, reflects the
investments we've made in the platform over the last six years and it's really great to see
this unit gaining traction in the market.
So that leaves the Specialty segment. And as I said earlier, Platinum wrote about $195
million in premiums prior to March 2, so about $130 million in specialty casualty premiums
yet to be renewed over the remaining course of the year.
I would note in the guidance that we gave or in our description of the dynamics, that the
specialty premiums written on RenRe's balance sheet in the first quarter were down
about $69 million owing to a couple of factors. The vast majority of the decline was
related to the fact that last year, we wrote $53 million in a couple of credit deals that were
multiyear in nature, so, are on the books but don't show up in gross written premium. We
anticipated that, but it does impact the numbers over the course of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

The remaining $16 million were just deals that were not renewed in that book. For the
remainder of the year for Platinum, as I said, there are about $40 million in cat premiums
to renew, about $216 million to renew in the specialty casualty book. And as I said, we like
the book and we expect to renew the vast majority of it. And that's kind of how we see
the dynamics of the business going forward. Hopefully, that helps, Kai.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's very detailed. Thank you. And just following up on that is that because you show a
14% decline year-over-year in managed cat in the first quarter, and does it mean if you
maintain your 10%, which means that you expect this – like the second quarter and the
rest of the year will be a little bit better than the full year 10%?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Yes. It does.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. That's good. And then on the integration costs that you said a little bit higher than
the original plan, but also you said the cost savings will be higher than your plan of $30
million. Given the timing, like you already booked $28 million in the comp expense, shall
we expect the cost saving also will flow in quicker?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

On balance, yes. Maybe a bit of – to expand on that one a little bit too, because I could
see there may be some questions about the merger-related expenses as well. In our S-4,
we estimated transaction expenses at about $20 million. Those expenses related to
executing the deal itself and included investment banking, legal and other consulting fees.

Page 11 of 22



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity

FINAL

In the fourth quarter of last year, we booked $6.7 million of expense and $11.5 million in the
first quarter of this year for a total of about $18 million. These expenses are all complete
so ultimately, we came in a little bit below our expectations for transaction related
expenses. The one-time integration related expenses that you're referencing, Kai, mostly
relate to change in control payments, and as you note, are running a little higher than our
original estimate of $30 million.
In the first quarter, we booked total $29 million in one-time expenses; $28 million of which
were related to change in control payments to Platinum employees and a little less than $1
million which relate to other integration consulting fees.
I expect over the next 12 months, we will most likely book another $10 million in one-time
integration related expenses. So in total, these one-time integration related expenses will
be around $39 million. The main source of the delta between our expectation and what
we're actually booking is a fewer than, I guess, originally anticipated number of
employees retained. So, we have a higher level of change in control payments to make as
a result of that.
Also included in the one-time expenses are payments to employees who will be
transitioning out of the company over some period of time between three and 12 months
post-close. Those transition related expenses are the majority of the $10 million we think
we're likely to incur over the next 12 months.

Bloomberg Transcript

So although we may see some of that in the first few months of 2016, I think far and away,
the majority of the $10 million will be expensed in 2015.
As I was alluding to earlier, the other side of retaining fewer employees is that the full run
rate expense savings should be a few million dollars higher than the $30 million we
originally modeled. Hopefully that...

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's great. So we should expect the full run rate savings slightly above $30 million to be
realized in 12 months?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Yes, that's right.

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. That's great. Maybe last question probably for Kevin is a probably bigger picture. If
you look this quarter, relatively low cats or not meaningful catastrophe losses, in the past,
if you look at the first quarter 2013 and the first quarter 2014, though they're similar
environments and in term of catastrophe losses, but the ROE had steadily declined for
the company first quarter 2013 about 23% to first quarter 2014 about 16%, and now this
quarter 13%.

I just wonder what do you see the main driver? I can see two components. One is that
your property cat is less profitable because you write less premiums and the pricing is
coming down. And the second reason might be is just your business mix shifting more
towards the specialty business, which has a higher combined ratio. I just wonder, really the
question is really, going forward, as we see the property cat pricing still continue to come
in down, that will probably continue to hurt your property cat business. On the other hand,
specialty property becoming a more – like a larger component overall. So is that like
basically that trend continue or we will see the ROE potential for your business staying at
a low double-digit level for even going lower from here?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Actually, you did a good job both asking and answering the question. I think looking back
historically, the two drivers are the things you mentioned is, we're receiving less rate,
particularly in the property cat, and our investments in building specialty platforms in
Lloyd's and purchasing Platinum has certainly diversified the risk profile of the company. I
like where we are currently with the risk profile that we have, but our enthusiasm for
writing more cat business is exactly what it has always been. We just think the opportunity
to write more cat businesses is more limited due to the rate environment.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, I think looking at the overall construct of the company, I think the franchise we've built
in specialty and are continuing to build in specialty is permanent. I think the franchise we
have built and are continuing build in Lloyd's is permanent. And our enthusiasm to add
more cat is 100% as robust as it always has been. So, it's really going to be an
opportunity-based future as to what the business mix is, but I would say that you should
always count on having specialty and Lloyd's as a meaning full component of it.

Q - Josh C. Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Hi, guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking the call. So, Kevin, I wanted to talk a little bit
about the Platinum deal or RenRe U.S. I am curious about the underwriting strategy that
you guys are going to apply going forward. And as you have had time to get into their
business, I'm kind of curious what you found about the deals they used to write. Are there
classes or types of deals that you found that you're less inclined to keep after you've had
more time with them or, alternatively, are there accounts and relationships that you want
more of ? And as you're sort of setting aside appetite, I'm just wondering if you can walk
us through a little bit more detail, how you're actually combining the companies'
underwriting and risk management functions? I mean how do you integrate all of these
Page 13 of 22

new risk buckets that Platinum used to write into your REMS system? And then just more

into all these new underwriters?

Q - Josh C. Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

I like John, too.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
No, no, it's John. There's really three platforms that we purchased. One is the Bermuda
platform, the New York platform and the Chicago platform. The Bermuda platform is the
integration is actually quite simple where we – that's where the property cat book was
written. We're able to take that and largely just incorporated to the framework that we
already have in Bermuda. The Chicago book is a different book and a book that we like
quite a bit. It's a small regional book and it's one in which we think with our tools we can
bring additional capabilities and hopefully, find opportunities to grow that business.
Our increased cat appetite compared to the Platinum cat appetite will also provide
opportunities to that book. And one area that is a bit of a surprise and an unexpected
upside is, in talking to the guys in Chicago, they hope that our ventures team can help
some of the smaller companies that they're providing reinsurance to bring other forms of
capital to them and potentially strengthen those relationships.
With New York, we like that book quite a bit. There is some overlap with the book we've
already written, both in Bermuda and in the Connecticut office, but we find that the
underwriters and the book merges well to the platforms we have, and retooling the pure
balance sheet or the Platinum balance sheet to RenaissanceRe.
I think the way we're thinking about it is we are one team. So, we are a fully integrated
company from risk management and underwriting. We're working hard to design the
communication protocols and providing clarity to the underwriters and to the market as to
which lines of business belong on which balance sheets and which offices are the primary
office for that line of business. An example of which could be A&H business, where the
Platinum team has significantly more expertise in A&H than what we had within
RenaissanceRe. And we're going to continue to use the New York office as the primary
point of entry for A&H business to come to the organization. It's a business we like. We're

Page 14 of 22



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity

relying on the expertise that we purchased within Platinum, but it's something with our risk
management system's appetite for more risk we can continue to grow.

FINAL

Q - Josh C. Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

All right. That's really helpful, Kevin. I wonder if I could just ask a big picture question.
When you guys think about the business, what might lead to some relief from some of
the pricing pressure that's been sort of dogging property cat? You spend time with all the
investors. Are rising interest rates potentially a solution? Or do we basically – if you care
about sort of the public companies do this business, should we be basically rooting for
some sort of storm to teach people the downside of taking cat risk?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

I think markets tend to reverse course based on the surprise. I think as rates become and
margins become thinner potentially one can see that the surprise required for a reversal
is smaller.
I think since I'm not forecasting that one thing or another can change the market, I think
the one thing that's often looked at with third-party capital is the fact that it's diversifying
and what that can bring from an expected return. I think rising rates and better
alternatives to allocation to this class of business is a risk for some of that capital. We
wouldn't have built the structures we built here at RenaissanceRe, if we didn't believe
there is a good home for all sorts of capital, whether it's third – what people call thirdparty capital coming from family offices, or pension funds, or it's equity capital. And we
believe what's required is a good underwriting interface between that capital and the risk.
And that's really the role that we're looking to provide. Knowing when the market's going
to change is a difficult task. Building a franchise that can perform in any market and is most
flexible to be successful in any market is really the goal that we have.

Q - Josh C. Stirling

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. A couple of questions. First, on the Lloyd's business, the accident year
loss ratio in that business was significantly lower than where it's been running. Question is,
is that mostly just luck or variability of losses, or was there a business mix change that may
have contributed to that?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

50%.

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

So what changed in the last three months that caused you to pretty significantly alter your
expectations there?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

That's a great question. We are delighted with the growth that we're seeing in Lloyd's and
it's really the culmination of years of work, frankly. It's coming from what I'll say is three
things. First is collaboration with ventures and our Lloyd's team where we're finding ways
in which we can help customers develop new products and platforms and then provide
reinsurance or insurance support from the syndicate. It's continuing to leverage and
successfully writing new business, leveraging the relationships that we've had in Bermuda
for 20 years.
And then the third component, which is probably more insurance growth than reinsurance
growth, is specific accounts that have been targeted by our underwriters, and after
working with those and showing the benefits of working with Renaissance at Lloyd's,
we've been successful getting on those programs over the last – frankly, in the fourth
quarter and the first quarter.

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Got it. That's helpful, Kevin. And if I could squeeze just one more in on the investment
side, it does look like the cash balance short-term investments went up quite a bit.
Obviously, the Platinum deal did that. But are you at a level as of March 31, where that's
just way too much cash and could you redeploy that in longer duration securities?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Yeah. Yes, Jay. That is not a level that we expect to maintain going forward. And I think
what you're seeing there is kind of the process of reallocating their portfolio to be
consistent with our allocation. So it will take a couple of months to fully effect, but we
would expect that over the next two maybe three months we will transition their
investment portfolio to have a set of allocations that look almost identical to ours. As an
example of that, right at the beginning of April, we allocated, I think it was $250 million to
our passive equity strategy, which is part of our own strategy at RenRe. So we're

Page 16 of 22



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

beginning to take their portfolio and moving into the allocation structure that we have.
And when that's completed, I think you'll see that cash balance much lower.

Your following question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones for you. Kevin, just on the Lloyd's business, can
you tell us kind of what areas, what lines of business is the big growth coming from?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yes. Actually, it's a mix of everything, frankly. I would say it's a bigger component of
insurance and reinsurance than what the in-force book has.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
And we've had more success on different casualty lines over property lines. So it's a
pretty broad spectrum.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay, broad insurance casualty, great. And then, second question, I'm just curious. On
Florida, looking at the renewal coming up, I know you said that increased demand. Is there
any possibility here that you see some of the Florida carriers actually decreasing their
reliance on quota share?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I think it's – we're kind of in the early throes of that. I think there is the potential of that,
primarily – it depends really what happens with XOL rates, with excess of loss rates. And if
there's a significant reduction in excess of loss rates and ceding commissions are
reasonably flat, I think there'll be a migration towards those structures. It's a little early to
Page 17 of 22



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

FINAL

tell right now as to kind of what form the risk will be ceded in, but our expectation is it's
not going to be a material shift between XOL and quota share. And the growth that we're
talking about is much more around risk coming out of Citizens. We said before any risk
that comes out of Citizens, it goes to the private insurance market, has more reinsurance
dollars associated with it than the FHCF purchases.

Your following question comes from Ryan Byrnes from Janney.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Good morning, guys. Just had a question. Were there any reserve releases from Platinum
in the quarter? And then maybe just go over how you guys are trying to harmonize the
two books now that they're one company.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Platinum did have in the first quarter about $22 million in favorable reserve development,
but that was all incorporated into the closing balance sheet on March 2.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
As far as integrating the reserves going forward, I'll divide the comments between
property and casualty and specialty. On the property side, I think with our track record and
our expertise, we'll rely much more on our reserving methodology for property. The
casualty, both companies actually have very robust reserving methodologies. And one of
the things that we're having a great internal discussion on is figuring out which
components of each are best and trying to map a course forward to make sure that we're
retaining the best elements of the process that Platinum had in reserving and the best
elements RenaissanceRe had in managing casualty and specialty reserves.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then quickly, just on the Lloyd's growth, obviously, it's pretty impressive
growth going forward. But if I look back in kind of the action year combined ratio of the
business the last couple of years, it's running a little north of 100% combined ratio. And it
does seem like the rates in Lloyd's aren't getting better. So just trying to figure out, is it
possible for you guys to grow that much and also drive down the action in your combined
ratio, I guess, below 100%, is that possible?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Page 18 of 22



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

FINAL

That's the plan. I think the market in Lloyd's is not the same across all lines. We are looking
for lines of business that we are profitable and then finding the best deals within those
lines. We're not trying to find the lone profitable deal in a very competitive market. I think
the other thing to look at is our start-up costs and coming in with a very high expense
ratio. As we continue to build scale on the Lloyd's operation, we hope that the expense
ratio will continue to move south.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Got you. And then quickly, I just want to make sure the last one I have is just the retention
at Lloyd's as well. Obviously, it sounds like you guys bought more quota share reinsurance.
I just wanted to figure – how much of the Lloyd's book is that casualty book? I'm just trying
to figure out what kind of retention we should think about going forward.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
We are buying more ceded within Lloyd's. Our ceded philosophy across the organization
is consistent in that we don't typically have a prescribed program and then write against
the program. We look at the opportunity to build the business and then match the ceded
against its optimized returns. I think, going forward, it's my expectation the insurance
component of the book will continue to increase and the casualty component of the book
will continue to increase, but we're still looking to grow the property and the reinsurance. I
think it's just unlikely to where we're seeing opportunities based on today's environment.

Your next question comes from Seth Canetto with KBW.

Q - Seth J. Canetto

{BIO 20249864 <GO>}

Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just going back to the corporate
expenses, I believe in 4Q 2014, you guys had $7 million related to PTP, and then this
quarter, it was a little over $40 million. Was that $10 million specifically for the corporate
expenses and is that only going to be realized in 2Q, or should we expect it a little broken
out throughout the year?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Yeah. So, you're right. We booked $6.7 million in the fourth quarter and $11.5 million in the
first quarter for a total of $18 million. Those are just transaction related expenses, and as I
said, related to investment banking, legal and other consulting fees. We do expect to
incur about $10 million more in future quarters and I would say most of that $10 million will
be incurred within 2015, a bit perhaps in the first quarter of 2016. And that's almost all
related to transition related expense and other software systems conversions.

Q - Seth J. Canetto

{BIO 20249864 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thanks. And then, this question's on the specialty business. It's sort of
piggybacking off of Jay's from his Lloyd's question. But on your top line forecast, specialty

Page 19 of 22



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

went from 10% to 50% for 2015. Is that solely from the integration of Platinum, or is there
something else going on there that's leading to the increase?

FINAL

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

It's solely related to Platinum. In fact, I would say more than 100% of it is related to
Platinum. As I tried to describe in my comments, the RenRe specialty book is actually
down a bit more in the first quarter than we had anticipated. And so, that up 50% includes
both an assessment of our own book, a legacy RenRe book, as well as the Platinum book
we expect to renew over the course of the year.

Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman with Balyasny.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you. I guess a couple of quick numbers questions and then a Florida question.
Jeff, on the intangible, I know you said some of this will be in the Q, but just if you can help
me reconcile. I believe in the proxy, the intangible estimate was about $150 million and it
came in at $84 million. Just what changed and I guess is there a corresponding offset
somewhere?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. I think, the reason it turned out to be lower is we just had lower negative fair value
adjustments than we had anticipated earlier.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then on the managed cat in the quarter, if I take out the upside on last
year, it looks like you were up call it mid-single digits. And if I break out DaVinci being
down, call it the core Ren balance sheet managed cat was up maybe mid-teens and
obviously pricing was down. So could you talk about where the growth was in actual
exposure in the first quarter?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
We don't really look at it that way. We look at – for the reporting purpose, we look at
managed cat numbers. The balance sheet of the structure we put it on is simply looking
for the most efficient capital. I think I would not categorize any of our balance sheets as
really growing with property cat in the first quarter and I think the vast majority of the
reduction was price pressure.

Yeah. Thank you. Just one really quick question. With the increase in the U.S. operations,
will you actually have some sort of a tax rate going forward from here or is that all taken
into account with the losses in the tax asset that you picked up?

FINAL

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Mark, there is I think a pretty good description of that in the 10-K. We do have significant
net operating losses in the U.S. subsidiary that we can use to offset income going forward.
I believe the total amount of that's about a $65 million figure.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

approximately zero overall.

Your last question is from Ian Gutterman.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Hi. Sorry, I got cut off there before I could ask my last question, if you don't mind. You
brought up the FHCF buying reinsurance earlier. I was hoping you could talk a little bit
about that. I guess what was concerning to me was I don't think of the FHCF as being an
overpriced market, right, for what they charge for the mandatory layer. And then the rate
online that was reported seemed to be even cheaper than what they charge.
So, it seemed like it was a poorly priced program to the reinsurance market and that
didn't seem to stop it from getting done. Is there something unusual about that that I
shouldn't view that as a harbinger for the rest of the renewal season, or should I be a bit
discouraged by how that program went?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
First, I'm actually really encouraged by the fact that they're buying. I think it's a great step
for Florida.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman
