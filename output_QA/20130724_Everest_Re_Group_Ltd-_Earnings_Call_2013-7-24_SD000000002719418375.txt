Operator
Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2013 earnings call of Everest Re
Group. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and
introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of
Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.

Beth Farrell

{BIO 19732216 <GO>}

Thank you, Eric. Good morning. Welcome to Everest Re Group's Second Quarter 2013
earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Joe Taranto, the Company's
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dom Addesso, our President; and Craig Howie, our
Chief Financial Officer.
Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include
extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note
that statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature, such as
statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various
risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or
expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in
connection with such statements.
Now, let me turn the call over to Joe.

FINAL

Thanks, Beth. Good morning. I am extremely pleased with our results for the first six
months of the year. Our net income was $660 million, producing an ROE of 21%. Our
worldwide gross written premium has increased by 25% over 2012. Our worldwide
reinsurance premium has increased by 26% and our insurance premiums have increased
by 22%.
The attritional combined ratio has improved by six points to 80.5%. Our attritional
combined ratio for our insurance operation continues to improve and was 94.8% for the
Second Quarter.
Our investment income was strong through six months at $295 million, only modestly off
last year's $302 million, despite the headwinds generated from today's low interest rate
environment.
Through six months, we grew book value per share, adjusted for dividends, by 5%,
despite falling bond prices and catastrophes.

Bloomberg Transcript

During the quarter, we completed our April 1 Japanese reinsurance renewals, our June 1
Florida reinsurance renewals and our July 1 international reinsurance renewals. I was most
pleased with our overall results, even though we experienced increased competition.
In particular, in Florida, we increased our premiums, but more importantly, we increased
our expected margins and yet did not increase our 1-in-100 PML, as we bought some
industry loss warranty cover to contain this risk.
Much of our increased margin came from writing pro rata reinsurance on homeowners
business. Rate increases on homeowners business and other changes continue to
improve the underlying insurance business, making it more attractive. In addition, the fact
that Cat XOL reinsurance was less costly for homeowners companies made for further
improvement in the net after-reinsurance expected results, as these savings inure to the
benefit of our quota shares.
As always, we continue to optimize our portfolio and move towards the best
opportunities.
Our insurance operation continues to achieve meaningful rate increases in California
workers' comp and other areas. It's too early to predict the crop results, but so far, so
good. The bulk of our crop premiums will be booked in the Third Quarter and Fourth
Quarter given the nature of this business. I am hopeful that we will continue to see quality
improving results as the year progresses in this segment.
I see the current overall reinsurance/insurance marketplace as offering reasonable
opportunities, and where companies that are focused, nimble and disciplined can do very
well. Our client relationships -- our long-term client relationships, well-diversified business

platform and great ratings continue to serve us well. Our focused, nimble culture has
produced great opportunity for us. Everest, by far, has the lowest internal expense ratio in
the market. Our studies indicate that we have a 3 to 7 point expense advantage over our
competitors. This is an enormous advantage.

FINAL

Our flatter organization has benefited us greatly, as it allows us to react to changing
market conditions more rapidly, offer new products and better meet clients' needs.
During the quarter, we saw a spike in interest rates. We had expected rates to rise and
continue to believe that they will rise further, although we do not try to predict when and
by how much. We have positioned our bond portfolio to provide the balance between
yield and duration that is most sensible. Our view on interest-rate increases is that they
are a net positive for us.
Of course, they will initially decrease the market value of the bond portfolio, but since we
tend to hold to maturity, this will, through time, undo itself. More important, future
earnings will rise. In short, given rating agency and regulatory requirements, we will always
have the bulk of our assets in bonds. And we would rather earn more interest on these
bonds than less.

Bloomberg Transcript

In summary, the first six months have gone well and we are looking to continue our good
performance. In those six months, we returned a half billion dollars to shareholders
between dividends and stock repurchase, buying back $450 million of stock, which
represents 7% of the beginning of the year outstanding shares, underscores our
confidence in our future.
Dom will now go through the operational review and then Craig will take you through the
financial highlights. Dom?

Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Thanks, Joe. Good morning. The Second Quarter results were quite favorable despite
storm activity in the period. After-tax operating income was $253 million, providing for an
annualized operating return on equity of 16%. Strong and growing underwriting profitability
and a stable base of investment income continue to provide for these favorable results.
Over the last several quarters, we have talked about the strategies we have deployed to
enhance returns, and their success is borne out by these results. In that context, I would
like to outline our underwriting results and what actions we have taken to reshape and
improve on our portfolio.
Compared to the prior year, underwriting income was $29 million higher at $143 million,
even after Cat losses of $90 million in this year's Second Quarter versus $30 million one
year ago. This year-over-year improvement continues to reflect an improvement in the
underlying attritional combined ratio of more than six points. When adjusted for
reinstatement premium, the attritional combined ratio was at 80.2%.

I will touch on specifics in a moment, but generally the major improvements in the
combined ratios were in US reinsurance and Bermuda, followed by continued
improvement in the insurance segment.

FINAL

The catastrophe losses of $90 million in the quarter added seven points to the combined
ratio. So overall, that ratio stood at a respectable 87.6%.
There were multiple Cat events in the quarter. The details are as follows -- US tornadoes,
$50 million; European floods, $20 million; and Alberta floods, $20 million.
The continuing improving fundamentals are due to a variety of factors. At its core is
underwriting. Changes in the portfolio mix which emphasized excess of loss over pro rata
was a factor as primary rates softened. But other important measures included broader
geographical diversification, new product initiatives, terminating unprofitable relationships,
and finally, a basic disciplined underwriting and pricing approach.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning back to individual segments, I would like to provide some commentary about our
US reinsurance operations. As noted in our press release, premiums were up substantially
in the quarter due to a Florida quota share transaction. The impact of this was material in
the quarter due to an assumption of an incoming portfolio reflected in premiums written.
Last year, we had terminated that deal, which resulted in an outgoing portfolio running
through the premium account.
In comparing year-over-year, this magnifies the percentage of premium growth. Premiums
are up 16% in the segment without the impact of this transaction, as we continue to find
opportunities for growth, and as such, are pleased with the current position of the
portfolio.
During the recent Florida renewals, we saw a mixed pricing environment. Cat excess rates
were down, but underlying primary rates were up. We therefore wrote fewer Cat excessof-loss treaties and redeployed this capacity to writing substantially more quota share
business, which in combination, provided for increased overall margins on this book.
Margin improvement was derived from both the underlying price improvements, but also
from the lower cost of inuring catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance on this business.
As Joe mentioned, we purchased an ILW retro on the Florida book, which reduced peak
event PMLs, while at the same time overall margins increased.
Across the rest of the US property book, we have been authorizing and binding larger
lines. This has enhanced the geographic diversification of our portfolio and provided for
overall margin improvement on the book. Our casualty operation has experienced growth
from both new and renewal business. In addition, new business opportunities, in particular
in credit reinsurance and structured solutions, have further contributed to premium growth
in the quarter.

Page 4 of 18



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2013-07-24

All these activities have reshaped the US reinsurance portfolio and led to a year-to-date
attritional combined ratio of 72% versus 86.5% last year, a 14.5-point improvement.

FINAL

In our Bermuda operations, there was minimal change in premium year-over-year.
However, changes in the portfolio have resulted in a seven-point improvement in the
year-to-date attritional combined ratio.
The international operation also had minimal change to the top line, with continued
growth in our Latin America book offset by Asia, which was slightly down due to the
continued shift from pro rata to excess. Nevertheless, we were successful in growing the
excess book where rates have been stable. Profit remained strong for this operation, with
a 77.2% year-to-date attritional combined ratio.
Now turning to the insurance operations, which is a growing proportion of the total book.
The improving trend we noted in the First Quarter continues to build. The premium
growth of $61 million or 24% was driven by continued rate increases in California workers'
comp, the new nonstandard auto initiative, and, to a lesser extent, rate increases on
casualty business and new business growth in general.

Bloomberg Transcript

This profitable growth, along with the continued strength of our professional liability and
accident and health results, has produced a combined ratio for the quarter of 96.6%,
continuing the improving profit trend for the insurance operation.
The investment income picture for the quarter was also favorable in light of a declining
yield environment. Income was down just slightly over the prior years, as new cash flows
and income from limited partnerships have helped offset declining reinvestment rates.
Capital remains strong, although shareholders' equity was down slightly at 1.6% from yearend due to a significant level of share repurchases and a decline in the value of the bond
portfolio. This capital position enables us to grow our writings, as evidenced in the Second
Quarter, through geographic expansions and new products in both our reinsurance and
insurance operations. As noted, this diversification, which highlights the strength of our
franchise, has been benefiting our operational results. We have every expectation that
this trend will continue.
Thank you, and now I will ask Craig to cover the financial highlights.

Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Thank you, Dom. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report that Everest had
another very strong quarter of earnings, with net income of $275.6 million or $5.56 per
diluted common share. This compares to net income of $214.6 million or $4.08 per share
for the Second Quarter of 2012. Net income includes realized capital gains and losses.
On a year-to-date basis, net income was $660.0 million or $13.09 per share compared to
$519.3 million or $9.79 per share in 2012. The 2013 result represents an annualized return
Page 5 of 18



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2013-07-24

on equity of 21%.

FINAL

Operating income year to date was $554.2 million or $10.99 per share. This represents a
20% increase over operating income of $462.9 million last year. These results were driven
by a $129 million increase in underwriting income, representing a 58% increase year over
year. As you just heard from Dom, there are a number of strategic initiatives that are
driving these improved results.
This increase in underwriting income was partially offset by higher income taxes and
slightly lower net investment income compared to the first half of 2012.
The results reflect the continued improvement in the overall current-year attritional
combined ratio, which has declined more than six points, from 86.6% to 80.5% on a yearto-date basis. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, reinstatement
premiums and prior-period (loss cost).
The total reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 76.5% for the first half of 2013
compared to 83.7% in the prior year. The insurance segment attritional combined ratio
was 96.4% year to date compared to 98.7% in the prior year.

Bloomberg Transcript

All segments reported increases in premium volume for the quarter and year to date, and
all segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter and for the first half of 2013.
Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $134 million for the quarter compared
to a $107 million underwriting gain last year. For the first half of 2013, total reinsurance
reported an underwriting gain of $344 million compared to a $219 million gain last year.
These results reflect $90 million of current-year catastrophe losses in the first half of
2013, all recorded in the Second Quarter. This compares with $60 million of Cats during
the first half of 2012.
The insurance segment reported an underwriting gain of $9 million for the quarter
compared to a gain of $7 million last year. On a year-to-date basis, the insurance segment
reported an underwriting gain of $9 million compared to a gain of $5 million in 2012. The
2013 results reflect a crop loss of $10 million for the year, primarily due to the seasonality
of crop premiums, but also including a $4 million unfavorable true-up from the 2012 crop
year.
The overall underwriting gain for the Group was $143 million for the quarter compared to
an underwriting gain of $114 million for the same period last year. On a year-to-date basis,
the underwriting gain was $353 million compared to a gain of $224 million in 2012.
Our reported combined ratio was 84.2% for the first half of 2013 compared to 89.0% in
2012. The commission ratio of 21.2% for the first half of 2013 is down 3.5 points compared
to the prior year. This lower ratio continues to reflect the shift in reinsurance from pro rata
to excess loss contracts, which generally carry a lower commission. It also reflects the shift
away from program business to direct business in the insurance segment.

FINAL

As for loss reserves, in June, we released our third annual global loss development
triangles for 2012. There were really no major changes since the 2011 release. Our overall
quarterly internal reserving metrics continued to be favorable.
For investments, pretax investment income was $149 million for the quarter and $295
million year to date on our $16 billion investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio
continues to perform well. The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.8%, with a
duration of just over three years.
The first six months reflected $106 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared
to $56 million last year. These gains are mainly attributable to fair value adjustments on
the equity portfolio.
On income taxes, the 12.3% effective tax rate on operating income is in line with our
expected rate for the year. Also recall that the 2012 income tax expense benefited from
favorable one-time adjustments.
Strong cash flow continues, with operating cash flows of $396 million for the first half of
2013 compared to $305 million in 2012. This is despite the high level of loss payments
over the last two years related to catastrophes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to capital management, we completed the redemption of our 6.2% Junior
subordinated debt in May, as we announced on our last-quarter call. We expect interest
expense of approximately $8 million per quarter going forward.
Shareholders' equity at the end of the quarter was $6.6 billion compared to the $6.7 billion
balance at year-end 2012. This is after taking into account a half billion dollars of capital
returned through $450 million of share buybacks and $48 million of dividends paid in the
first half of 2013. It also reflects a $325 million decline in the value of the bond portfolio
due to the rise in interest rates this year.
Book value per share increased to $136.31 from $130.96 at year-end 2012, a 5% increase
after adjusting for dividends. Our continued strong capital balance positions us well for
potential business opportunities as well as continuing share repurchases.
Thank you, and now I will turn it back to Beth for Q&A.

FINAL

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning. I guess two or three quick questions. First of all, just going
back on the discussion on the business mix -- and I know we've talked about this in the
past, on the shift towards XOL -- as you look forward, what percentage would you be
comfortable with in terms of the business mix?

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

I will start with that one, Dom. What we try to do is optimize our portfolio and go to the
best deals available, certainly on the property side, when we are choosing the PMLs that
we are willing to write to.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, we had seen for the last year or two XOL, especially as rates were rising, that we
wanted to write more of that, and that was stacking up better relative to pro rata. I would
say on a worldwide basis, most of the changes that we wanted to make we've made in
the last couple of years. But what we kind of added to the mix was this past June in
Florida, where we had a shift, if you will, within the Florida book, where we did more pro
rata.
I would still kind of guesstimate that where we are at mix-wise today is pretty much where
we will stay on a worldwide basis. But having said that, we will continue to change as the
world changes, XOL rates change as underlying insurance rates change. But I don't expect
the worldwide portfolio to undergo any significant changes as I look out for the next year,
like it has in the past couple of years.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. That's helpful. And where does Mt. Logan, I guess, fit in and start flowing in the
numbers? I guess that would be more so in Q3. Just could you refresh us on that?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

We had initially targeted by the end of the year to raise approximately $250 million in
outside capital in total. We are about halfway there. So we have some capital already
deployed in Mt. Logan, which will be reflected in the Third Quarter. Craig can get into the
details if you like on how that will run through our financials, because perhaps we may
have to consolidate the operation; but that is yet to be determined.
But that capital has already been committed to us, and that will allow us to expand our
writings within the reinsurance operations, and then essentially quota share some
business off to Mt. Logan. But it's not -- as you can see, it's not necessarily a material
amount and it's a slow build.

Q - Amit Kumar

FINAL

Got it. I can take that off-line. And final question on capital management, and you were
talking about some of the numbers. I think buybacks were -- and dividends were 86%, or
something like that, of net income, which is obviously running at a higher trend than what
we have seen in the past.
How do you think about that, I guess, for the remainder of the year? Is that a good metric
to use, the current level, or do you sort of pull back in the wind season, maybe come back
a bit? Or do you wait for 1/1 renewals and then sort of come back in Q1?

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

Well, we are keen to buy, and that's why we've bought $450 million through the first six
months. As I said, that kind of shows the confidence that we have in our portfolio and our
future.
We probably will be a bit more cautious in the coming quarter. We have historically
through wind season been a bit more cautious, and I think we will probably take that same
position. Now, we never forecast, and so don't hold us, because we reserve the right to
change as conditions change. But probably lighter in the Third Quarter, and if that all goes
well, probably back to more in the Fourth Quarter. That would be kind of a guess at this
point.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. That's actually quite helpful. That's all I have. Thanks.

Operator
Joshua Shanker, Deutsche Bank.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yes, I guess for Craig to start, on the bond portfolio, you said I guess mark to markets
were $325 million. Is that correct?

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

That is correct -- on a year-to-date basis, Josh.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Year-to-date, okay. So actually looking at the portfolio, at about $6.5 billion -- $16.5 billion,
that's been fairly resilient. Can we sort of get more granularity? It is certainly better than
the performance your peers have so far reported. Can we (multiple speakers) -- to the
rising interest rate environment and mark to market?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, recall that what we have been doing has been shortening the duration of our
portfolio, so that helps dramatically. And then of course over the last couple of years,
Page 9 of 18



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2013-07-24

FINAL

we've been reallocating some of our portfolio to a larger equity position, which has
obviously helped as rates have been coming down. But obviously, the stock market has
been rising, and that's helped shield some of that result, as well as yield, floating bank
debt and other areas that have kind of protected the portfolio from the times that we
most recently have gone through.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And you've taken some profits I guess on the equity markets?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

We have. Our equity position has not -- in terms of a percentage of our asset base, has
not changed dramatically. But we do -- within our equity portfolios, we will take profits on
certain securities and then reinvest in other opportunities that we think have a better
upside.
There has not been any material change in our allocation to equities.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

No, it looks like it shrank by about $100 million despite the rising equity markets. So I just
thought that maybe you are taking some money off the table.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

In some cases, we are in particular positions. But we are continuing to look for
opportunities in that space. We are not directionally making a major change in our equity
allocation.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And can we talk about the size of the California workers' comp business now compared
to where it was prior to Berkshire's 2007 move in that space? Are you larger than you
were back then or -- as a proportion of the overall insurance business? Where does that
stand?

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

We were once close to $800 million or $900 million in the marketplace. We are nowhere
close to that, but it's growing. We will probably do better than $300 million in the
marketplace this year. We continue to get some very good rate increase, and I would
expect we will probably do more business next year than this year.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

So if we go back to like 2006, almost all the business was workers' comp and now it's a
minority of the business?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}
Page 10 of 18



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2013-07-24

Well, it would still -- it would represent close to 20% to 25%. But yes, we have gotten into
crop, we have done A&H, professional liability, nonstandard auto is now in the mix,
California DIC, as well as our E&S operations. So we have got a well-diversified insurance
platform at this point, just in the last couple of years, which is -- we are quite proud of.

FINAL

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Can we tease out of the strong growth -- rate growth versus unit growth versus I guess
expansion into newer markets?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Can we --? I'm sorry, Josh. Can we [multiple speakers]?

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

I was looking at 36% growth in this quarter; over the last 12 months, probably 30% growth
in the insurance book. Can we divide that into rate versus like exposures growth versus I
guess newer markets and what not?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, at a very, very rough estimate, you can think about rate level increases, particularly in
comp and in our general liability classes, in the 10% to 15% range. So essentially, that
might help you think about the 36% versus that 10% to 15% number.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

No, I'll try and work with it. Thank you, very much.

Operator
Michael Nannizzi, Goldman Sachs.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thank you. Dom, would it be possible to give us a little bit more detail on this Florida
program that you wrote? I was looking back and it looks like even if we compare to like Q2
2011, the gross premiums were still quite a bit higher here. So just wondering if that
difference is because this contract or program got a lot bigger or you took other
exposures in the same area. And then just a quick follow-up on that. Thanks.

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

You are saying that 2013 is higher than just this one transaction?

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Well, no. You said that -- I thought you had said this was a program that you guys did not -that you had participated in historically and then you didn't last year, so the delta between
2012 and 2011 -- or between 2012 and 2013 is really big, but that maybe --. So I just figured
Page 11 of 18



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2013-07-24

maybe the better comparison would be 2011, when I would assume then that contract was
in place, comparing that to 2013.

FINAL

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

That -- I don't have the 2011 numbers at my fingertips, but let's maybe just talk about
2012. So in 2012, for this one particular transaction, we had almost $200 million of a
portfolio out. In 2013, the portfolio in was about $44 million. And in addition, we wrote
some other quota shares in 2013 that is also impacting these results.
I don't know if that gets to your question, but that's about the most I can give you in terms
of details on those transactions.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay, okay. And then in terms of thinking about this contract earning through for the rest
of the year, I assume that's when the majority of the contracts are going to earn through.
First of all, is that right? And second of all how much has earned through already in the
Second Quarter?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

It earns ratably. I mean, there's no unusual earnings pattern to it. It's homeowners
business that earns out over a 12-month period of time.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

Starting June 1.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

So -- starting June 1.

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

It wouldn't get too much earning in this quarter.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. And then just one question maybe for Craig. It looks like the revolver, you
took some out on the revolver in the quarter. Was that just kind of timing or is that
something that you will expect to do, just to take advantage of still low interest rates on
the borrowing side?

That's correct. It was just really timing more so than anything else. And you are right, it is
very low interest rates.

Got it. And then lastly, I guess just thinking about capital deployment. Looking forward,
does this program, this large contract, does this in any way change your outlook in terms
of how much you think or would like to deploy via buybacks relative to how much you are
earning over the foreseeable future? Or should we just consider that to be as it was?

FINAL

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

No, I think our outlook on buybacks is very much the same. It's going to be clearly part of
the mix. It has been a big part of the mix for six months. I think it will continue to be a big
part of the mix going forward.
We told you despite not just this contract, but everything else that was written in Florida,
we really didn't increase the PML at the 1-in-100 and above. So we didn't want that
volatility, which frankly allows us to be more aggressive with regard to buyback. So it
doesn't really change our outlook on that item.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Great. And then just last one, if I might. Can you scope out the nonstandard auto book?
I'm just trying to understand like when we look ahead in that insurance segment, how big
is that, how big should that get, and just what sort of run rate are you thinking about or
should we be thinking about in terms of profitability there? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, the going-in -- our nonstandard auto book was running approximately $30 million a
year for us. And this year, our expectation is that we would be somewhere around $80
million, with expansion and hopes into the next year and beyond. That book of business,
we feel will have at least 10 points of margin in it. So that's kind of where we expect it to
run.

Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to talk a bit about the reserve triangles. This is the quarter
in which you guys have released them. And it seems that there is a cushion that's growing,
and I guess that's our opinion, based on what we can see. The numbers are excellent that
you are reporting; no doubt there. And you are doing it without reserve releases.
So can you comment a bit on how you feel in the reserves, maybe if you can cut across
the different lines where you may feel relatively better or worse? And then can you
perhaps contrast it with the industry, which continues to release a lot, but their positions
seem to be slipping year-over-year.

FINAL

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

This is Craig. So as you've noticed, the position that we've taken over time is to put up a
prudent reserve position. And over time, we have developed some very strong process
that we have in place to develop that on a conservative basis going forward. So as you
see those growing, and you are seeing that across pretty much all lines in those triangles
that we put out, but specifically on the reinsurance side, we are seeing some very
favorable development in our internal metrics that we look at -- for example, actual versus
expected -- that we look at on a regular basis.
But again, the multi-pronged approach that we've taken in the past over the last three
years to set up this reserve position keeps putting us in a better position over time.

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

And Greg, to comment on any specific line or class of business at this point in time, in the
absence of a full reserve review, is a little bit premature for us to get to in the Second
Quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

So what's important for us is the overall reserve position. There are going to be ups and
downs in any particular class of business. I mean, we monitor close to 200 different
reserve buckets, and those move up and down over time. But it's fair to say that as the
industry, you always get a little bit more conservative with respect to the longer-tail lines.
So the longer-tail lines require a little bit more conservative reserve position.
But that doesn't mean that -- so therefore, I guess by definition, you would say that if
there's any particular classes of business that you'd be less comfortable with, it would be
the longer tails. But we still feel that our casualty, comp and all those classes are well
reserved.

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

But I will add to that. As you know, the results that we've put out -- and we are proud of
these results -- do not include any releases, if you will. They are pure results based on this
year, and we are very happy that we have such good results that don't require the benefit
of these releases.
As far as the industry and how much more is left and what's to come, we really won't
comment on that. I don't think that we know any better than anybody else about that. We
will just talk about ourselves.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Okay great. Yes, the numbers are excellent, so congrats on another great quarter. Thanks.

FINAL

Hi. Good afternoon. The first question is on the property cat business. I believe you have
about $1 billion of premiums in there. And we have heard various things about pricing, US
versus the non-US. Curious what portion of that business of yours is US versus non-US,
and how do you see the pricing outlook of that for the future?

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

Well, it is about $1 billion. It has probably grown from about $1 billion in terms of the pure
cat premium that we have on a worldwide basis. And I would tell you that the portfolio
that we have as of the present, after the July 1 renewals, is probably the best portfolio we
have ever had in terms of total expected margin dollars going forward. And the ROE on
the business that we've written we think is excellent.

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, we have seen more competition for the business recently, some of that in Florida,
and you've heard how we've responded to some of that. And we did see some more
beyond Florida in July. Clearly, we have seen more capacity in the marketplace, and I'm
not -- I don't necessarily expect that to go away if there's no big losses.
But really, as I continue to look forward, I expect us to continue to do well. We have dealt
with competition for many years. We will continue to deal with it for many years to come. I
think we have a lot of advantages in terms of our client relationships, the flexibility that we
have in terms of the products that we can put together to meet clients' needs, the
ratings, the ability to move into pro rata or other options if that makes more sense. So
yes, there has been recently more competition and probably that will stay, but we are still
putting together deals that we are very pleased with.

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Currently, our catastrophe, our US catastrophe book represents approximately 50% of
the overall worldwide cat. So that can change, as Joe is describing, depending on where
the opportunities are, plus or minus 5 points, 10 points. But think of it about as
approximately half.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. And just thinking about this philosophically, if pricing does come down
next year, would we see a pullback from you guys or do you think you can manage to still
maintain your market share?

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

To be determined. If the pricing changed dramatically and we were less enthusiastic
about the marketplace, then I would expect that we would do less and probably buy a
whole lot of stock more back. And of course, we would look for other opportunities to
deploy our capital in other lines of business and other business dealings, whether it's
acquisitions or something else. So sure, as the world changes, we will change. That's
always the way it has been, that's always the way it will be.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure, that's helpful. On the primary insurance, are we still on track for a low 90%s
combined ratio?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

FINAL

Right now, we are in the mid-90%s and trending towards that number, yes.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Fine. And then just the last question is on cats. Your cats in the Canadian flood seem to be
very low, just about $20 million, and I know you guys are a big player there. Just wanted to
understand your exposure there and how you had such low cats there. Thanks.

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

In Canada? Is that what you are asking about?

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Yes, correct.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

We are a significant player in the Canadian market. We tend to think of ourselves as
probably the second or third largest reinsurer there. A bigger proportion of our portfolio
relative to maybe some of the others is perhaps more casualty. And also, we have not
been as strong in that region as some others. So we have not put down a lot of capacity
in those regions more heavily exposed to flood.

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

Some of the property pro rata in Canada and the XOL we had cut back in the last couple
of years, as we didn't believe that business was rated as healthy as it should be.

Good morning. A couple questions here for you. The first one, can you tell us what the
actual UEP transfer that came in on that Florida deal was?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

The portfolio in was $44 million.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

$44 million? Great. Thanks. And then just another quick question. On that deal, how
important was securing the ILW for you doing the deal, and how much margin
enhancement was that?

FINAL

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

That was not the factor in that transaction.

A - Joe Taranto

{BIO 1495653 <GO>}

No, the ILW deal was just us managing the overall portfolio. We liked all the deals that we
did. We are very pleased to do them and increase our margin. But when we got done, we
had a PML at the 1-in-100 and above that was over what it was a year ago, and we
decided we didn't want that. So we went to the ILW market and procured a deal that we
are very, very happy with that took it back down.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Can you give us a quick update on what you are seeing as far as demand for
casualty reinsurance out there? Is it still kind of declining? What is kind of the appetite out
there for casualty reinsurance?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then also on that, have you seen any kind of change in terms of conditions, more
multiyear deals, coverages, anything else going on?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, demand on the casualty side is kind of what you are implying in your question, has
been relatively weak. But that has been certainly something we have seen for the last
couple of years.
Nevertheless, we actually have been writing some new accounts, less so on the larger,
national type clients, where in that particular case the trend would be for less purchases
as they increase retentions, and as pricing is going up, maybe a bigger, better appetite
on their end. But we have written some new business in the casualty space, which has
grown our portfolio.
So it's a little difficult to say what's happening with the market overall, but I don't think
there's any significant change from a year ago in terms of buyers' appetite. And again, we
are able to put some new business on the books, which part of our franchise is about
building out the cash of the operation as well, particularly into a market that -- where we
are seeing some rate increase.
In terms of other types of transactions, we are always seeing new and different types of
transactions, different structures, all the time, whether it's on the property or the casualty
side. And I made some slight reference in my remarks about structured solutions, and we

Page 17 of 18

are beginning to see opportunity there. And perhaps there is a slight pickup in what
buyers are looking for in that space, and we are participating in that.
