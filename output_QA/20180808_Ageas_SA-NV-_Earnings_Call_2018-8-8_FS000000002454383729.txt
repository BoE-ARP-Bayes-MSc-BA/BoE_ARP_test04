MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Conference Call for the First Six Months of 2018.
I'm pleased to present Mr. Bart De Smet, Chief Executive Officer; Christophe Boizard,
Chief Financial Officer; and Antonio Cano, Chief Operating Officer.
For the first part of this call, let me remind you that all participants will remain on a listenonly mode, and afterwards, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please also note
that this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to hand over to Mr. Bart De Smet, CEO; and Mr. Christophe Boizard, CFO.
Gentlemen, please go ahead.

Bart Karel De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you all for dialing into this conference
call. And for being with us for the presentation of the half year 2018 results of Ageas.
I'm joined in the room by my colleagues of the Exec Committee, Christophe Boizard, our
CFO; and Antonio Cano, our COO. Emmanuel van Grimbergen, our Group Risk Officer is

replacing Filip Coremans, our Chief Risk Officer, who is excused today. And we have, of
course, our Investor Relations team present in the room.
Ladies and gentlemen, before going into detail of the six month results, I would like to
start with highlighting the important events that occurred over the last couple of weeks.
First of all, we now have clarity on the put option granted to BNP Paribas Fortis, which
expired without it being exercised. We highly valued the long-lasting relationship with BNP
Paribas Fortis Bank as distribution partner and as co-shareholder of AG Insurance.
Secondly, the Group also received authorization from the regulator to operate
reinsurance activities at the holding level, leading to higher fungibility of capital within the
Group. And last but not least, the Fortis settlement has been declared binding, allowing us
to regain full strategic and financial flexibility, and to help Ageas, its stakeholders and all
those involved to draw a line on what has been an uncertain difficult period for everyone.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you have seen in a separate press release issued this morning, the Board of Directors
has also decided to launch a new share buyback program of €200 million that will start
next week. This is the eighth consecutive share buyback program showing our confidence
in the Group's financial strength. By this time next year, we will have returned €1.8 billion in
total to shareholders through share buyback programs.
Let us now go into the six month results. Scope-on-scope, so excluding last year's €7
million contribution from our Italian activities, our net insurance result increased by €38
million to reach €475 million, up 9%, and this despite adverse weather events in Belgium
and UK, which has an impact of €62 million and also €55 million lower support of net
capital gains in the course of the first half of the year. The comparison with last year was
furthermore affected by last year's €32 million change in reserve inflow interest rate in
China, and the €31 million negative impact from Ogden in 2017.
Altogether, this shows an improvement of the underlying result with some €90 million or
24% compared to the same period last year. So it is fair to say that our insurance activities
continue to perform very well. And barring unforeseen circumstances, we should be able
to reach a net insurance result at the higher end of the €750 million (00:03:53) to €850
million range.
With respect to the dividend upstream from our operating companies, €600 million has
already been upstreamed at the end of June, in line with our previous announcement.
And this amount more than covers the dividend paid earlier this year, and the holding
expenses, or in other words, an excess upstream of some €120 million that is added to
our net cash position.
Ladies and gentlemen, I will now hand over to Christophe for more details on the results.

Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Thank you, Bart, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I propose to start with the
Solvency II and III capital generation figures before going into details on the IFRS results of
Page 2 of 21

each segment. So, on slide 7, you will find the Solvency II figures. Let us start with the
Insurance Solvency ratio. The Insurance Solvency ratio stood at 202%, an increase of 6
percentage points.
The good operational half year in the Solvency II scope more than covers the accrual of
the expected dividends related to the IFRS results over the period; and this despite the
negative impact from the weather events in Belgium and the UK. Its improvement was
also supported by 5 percentage point following the increased fungibility of own funds as
a result of obtaining the license to run reinsurance activities at the holding level, as already
mentioned by Bart.
The Group Solvency II ratio increased by 15 percentage point to 211%. This increase was
driven by 10 percentage point of operational impact, more than covering the expected
dividend. Next to this, there was a plus 7 point impact from the expiration of the put
option granted to BNP Paribas Fortis, and minus 2% from the ongoing share buyback
program.

Bloomberg Transcript

Regarding free capital generation, I am on slide 8. The operational free capital generation
over the first six months amounted to €392 million on the Solvency II scope corresponding
to the European entities. This includes €99 million dividend upstream from the nonEuropean NCP's. This leaves us for the European entities with a free capital generation of
€293 million over the first half compared to €112 million at the end of Q1 of this year.
You might recall that last year, we had €511 million operational free capital generation on
our Solvency II scope companies corresponding to an average of €120 million to €130
million a quarter. If you take into account, the management actions and risk mitigations
with a decreasing effect on SCR, and the weather events in Belgium and in the UK
affecting own fund, we can conclude that the underlying performance is well above the
guidance indicated earlier.
I would like to make one additional comment on the effect of the expiration of the put
option on the free capital. As just mentioned, there is an immediate positive impact on
our Group Solvency ratio of 7 percentage points. The impact on free capital is, however,
less straightforward.
Until now, we were obliged to consider from a solvency point of view to be the 100%
owner of AG Insurance. This is no longer the case, and we are therefore, no longer
obliged to cover the 175% of the full SCR on our own.
Let me clarify with some concrete numbers. At 100%, AG Insurance has €6.7 billion of own
funds and €2.9 billion of SCR. Based on our 175% target, this leads to a free capital of €1.7
billion. 25% of these or €0.4 billion is for our co-shareholder. However, Solvency II
regulations require us to deduct €1 billion as non-transferable own funds, but we consider
that the difference, €0.6 billion can now be recognized as free capital.
After these detailed explanations on the solvency and the free capital generation I
propose to come back on the IFRS results.

FINAL

As you can see on slide 10, the net Insurance result for the first six months of 2018
amounted to €475 million, which represents a 9% increase compared to last year scopeon-scope if we exclude our Italian operation, still consolidated last year. The result in the
second quarter amounted to €176 million. The net result of the Life business increased to
€373 million compared to €312 million last year, thanks to strong results in all segments
and in particular an exceptionally high result in Ageas (00:10:51).
The net result of the Non-Life activities decreased to €102 million compared to €133
million last year due to the negative impact of €62 million related to the adverse weather
in Belgium and the UK. Last year's results also included €7 million contributions from
Cargeas, our former Italian operation.

Bloomberg Transcript

Total inflows increased slightly at constant exchange rate and exceeded again the €20
billion threshold with strong inflow growth in Belgium, offsetting lower inflows in the UK. In
Belgium, inflow growth outperformed the market in Non-Life, and in the Belgian Life
activity we reversed the trend observed in previous quarter with strong growth, mainly
thanks to unit-linked inflows considerably up year-on-year and driven by successful sales
campaign. Inflows of the Asian non-consolidated partnership returned to growth at
constant exchange rate during the second quarter, and this was the result of successful
sales campaign and continued channel development.
On the technical side, everything also remains on track as we experience solid operating
results across all our segments with a strong guaranteed and unit-linked margin
respectively at 110 bps and 28 bps. The group combined ratio stood at 97.8%. But as
mentioned before, both in Belgium and in the UK, the first six months of this year were
marked by poor weather impacting the group combined ratio by 4.7 percentage points. In
other words, excluding the weather impact, the combined ratio would have been an
excellent 93.1%.
As usual, I will now give you a bit more details on each segment. In Belgium, slide 11, the
net result stood at €220 million with a strong net result in Life at €181 million. It remained at
the same high level as last year, despite a lower level of net capital gains. This reflects a
strong technical performance with operating margin above target in guaranteed business
and on target in unit-linked with respective value of 108 bps and 43 bps.
The operating result remained in line with last year, marked by a better underwriting
performance and supported by a high investment result. Similar to last year, the
annualized impact of the capital gains is expected to level out over the remainder of the
year. As mentioned, the Non-Life business was impacted by adverse weather in January
and May, June for an amount of €29 million. The underlying performance continues to be
strong, and excluding the weather events, the combined ratio would have been 93.1%
with a lower level of prior year releases compared to last year.
In the UK, slide 12, the situation continues to gradually improve, and despite a negative
€33 million impact from bad weather, the net result amounted to €31 million compared to
€11 million last year, helped by higher prior year releases. In a softening market

Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2018-08-08

environment, we continue to focus on pricing and underwriting discipline, which obviously
weighed on inflows.

FINAL

In Continental Europe, slide 13, our net result went up 3% scope-on-scope, meaning
without our Italian operation in 2017. Our operating performance remained solid in our Life
business despite lower volumes while we delivered a strong performance in our Non-Life
activities with a combined ratio at 91.6%.
Finally, in Asia, slide 14, as mentioned before, we recorded an exceptional performance
with a net result at €170 million compared to €113 million last year. This performance was
driven by an exceptionally high first quarter result in China, which benefited from a
positive evolution in the interest rate, partially offset though by equity impairments
following the negative development of the China equity market during the second
quarter.
The net result of the General Account on slide 16 amounted to €34 million negative
compared to €161 million negative last year, primarily driven by a positive revaluation of
the RPN(I) for €9 million compared to a cost of €122 million last year, so a variance of €131
million from 2017 to 2018. This brings the Group net result to €441 million compared to
€284 million last year. The total liquid assets of the General Account stood at €1.8 billion,
of which €0.9 billion remains ring-fenced for the settlement.

Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to end my comments here and to leave room for
questions.

Q&A
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready now to take your question. The first question comes
from Jason Kalamboussis from KBC Securities. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

The first question is on Asia. If we exclude the realized gains, the result seems to be at a
relatively good level in the second quarter on an underlying basis. And I would like your
thoughts and comments on it, i.e., is it something that we should rely for the second half
because at the end of the day, if we exclude the impairments, we are at above €80
million? And also if you could remind us the realized gains and impairments notable in
China, how does that work and if there is any difference with Ageas?
The second question is on the General Account. Should we expect any legal costs relating
to settlements in the second half ? And what should be a normalized level ex legal costs
that we should use as a guidance for 2019?
And the final question is if you could comment, I mean, rating agencies have given a
positive outlook at Group level. So the three-notch difference with Insurance operation
Page 5 of 21



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2018-08-08

normally should at some point be reduced, notably now that you have put behind the
whole litigation issue. Could you comment on that? When do you expect changes there?
And how would that change? How you are going to run the Group and notably the
reinsurance business? Thank you very much.

FINAL

A - Bart Karel De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Jason, for the questions. The first one, we had indeed in Q2 and it could
be part of the miss towards consensus, the €44 million impairments in China. The reason
is that we use for impairment the Ageas rules which is as soon as it's minus 25% and so
on, whereas local rules are less conservative. So, that also explains if you look through the
local cost accounts of Taiping Group that you will see not the same figures as ours.
So we, of course, cannot predict how the markets in China will evolve in the second half of
the year, but we can, let's say, repeat our guidance that we expect for the Asian entity a
total profit of €250 million plus. There, of course, with respect to China, you have to take
into account that, for instance, the second half of the year is also a period where we
already start preparing the next campaigns for the next year. So there might be some
investments to further increase growth. But we are confident on the results in Asia, having
one caveat and that is, of course, how markets will react and what the impact could be on
the equity portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

Positive also to mention is that where we were far behind our, let's say, last year's figure in
sales mainly in China. That is being fully recovered in the second quarter, and we are
confident that we will further grow for growth in that region.
The second half, yeah, on maybe last point in CTIH, we publish later in August. So you will
have a bit more also view on, for instance, the commercial results of June, July.
The General Account, the normalized cost level, we take and you can count on this
something around €70 million on a yearly basis.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yes. Because there is almost no cost recorded during the first six months regarding
litigations. So it's a clean General Account, I would say. Now the last question, on the rating
implication. So, here, we expect some good news because the ambition is to gain three
notches on the holding. So Ageas SA/NV presently rated by Standard & Poor's at BBB. And
the ambition is to reach a full A level and with the following – for the following reasons.
The first notch is gain through, I would say, the positive expectation on the proposed
settlement and the homologation of the proposed (00:23:23) settlement. This would give
us one notch.
And then on the two additional notches, it relates to the reinsurance activities that we
want to launch. So it means that the holding will become an operational entity, and our
plan is to have the concept of core entity being recognized by Standard & Poor's. And in
that case, the holding would benefit from the core entity rating of the group which is A
like AG and like the UK. So three notches up, and you will guess that the benefits are
Page 6 of 21

Date: 2018-08-08

FINAL

really huge in term of financial flexibility, cost of financing for future financial operation,
emission of sub debt or all these potential things. So the fact that we could reach this full
A is really a key element for the financial flexibility. And if you have read the Standard &
Poor's press releases, it was already preannounced. There was a press release from
Standard & Poor's stating that there was a potential upgrade of three notches. So, that's
not something that we are affirming on our side. This is also taken into account by
Standard & Poor's.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

Many thanks. Just a quick one on Asia, just as a follow-up. Do you find that with things that
have changed in the market, structurally you would expect that the earnings or the
underlying earnings are going to be better? So if I ever look through the second half and I
look to next year, do you find that this is a genuine trend that is helping you and was this
confirmed in the second quarter?

A - Bart Karel De Smet

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Most important change in China already entered in the market beginning of the year with
what you could call kind of a ban on low profitable single premiums. And if we reach at the
end of Q2 almost the same volume as last year, it's, let's say, exclusively regular
premiums and very strong, let's say, renewals where also – where, as I indicated,
profitability is higher. This is good for the market, and we are quite confident that this will
help us in the future profitability of that company. We also reach for the comparable
insurers, in the meantime, a number four position coming from the eighth position some
years ago. So we are growing stronger than the market. We are characterized by a very
efficient sales force that is growing with, let's say, quality of sales that's high so that we
have few lapses. So we are very confident on the future profitability of that market.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

Operator
The next question comes from Bart Jooris from Petercam. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Some more general questions, if I may. Now that with the expiry of
both the Fortis settlement and even maybe, let's say, an increase of your rating, you will
have more free usage of the cash, you have more possibilities regarding growth
investments or shareholder reimbursements. Does it change the way you look at things?
Are you more actively studying certain sectors or certain countries? Could you give us an
idea on that?
And then on the opposite side, there was some rumors, if you may say, of a possible bet
on Ageas by Fosun. Could you give us some insight at what that could mean for the JVs?
Are there change of control clauses and then how do they work?

Page 7 of 21

FINAL

A - Bart Karel De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. With respect to the first part of your question, so I believe we can confirm today
that we are a company that in the first time for the first place is looking to deliver on the
promises which are to go for a strong, stable, increasing dividend with this clear dividend
policy where we also try to go for further growth where, of course, mainly the Asian
market is our growth engine and that we have – let's say, we want to have a stable
solvency level and a cash position that permits us to keep flexibility, be it for further
acquisitions or be it for, let's say, returning to shareholders. It's of course – your question is
more than relevant with the expiry of the put option.
So the potential use of the cash we had or a big part of that for the put option is off the
table. So you could say that is cash that we can now use again for those two goals, M&A
and/or returning to shareholders. And we will have on the 19 of September, let's say, the
update of our strategy or the launch of a new two-year plan. We'll give more clarification
on that. And capital management is, of course, part of that Investor Day.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second part of – and maybe I add also that, okay, the fact that we renewed buyback
is also confirming that, okay, put or no put. Our strategy so far did not change. On the
control clauses, indeed, we have a lot of joint ventures where you have change of control
clauses, but we, for evident reasons, say also because the shareholders' agreements are
not for publication of disclosure. We don't give details on disclosures, but you can, let's
say, note that all of our joint ventures have a number of clauses with respect to change of
control and what are then the consequences if that might happen. But we – okay, sorry for
that, but we don't disclose this.
This also, let's say, related to the rumor that we had earlier or even last week. That also
we can confirm that a rumor is a rumor. In principle, we do not react on rumors and the
only additional comment we have given is that we have not received any concrete
indication of interest from Fosun with respect to Ageas. So, more than that, it's not – we
cannot say.

Q - Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
The next question comes from Matthias de Wit from Kempen. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. First on capital generation, I've
got two questions. The first one is on the minorities. I think you disclosed it separately in
Q1, but I don't think I'd find them again in Q2, so could you provide the share of minorities
in the operational capital generation, please? And then secondly, also on capital
generation, there is again an operational SCR released in Q2. I wondered if you could
provide more details on that one. And then the third question is on liquidity and link to

Page 8 of 21



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2018-08-08

litigation. So now that everything is behind in terms of litigation, is there room to upstream
the excess capital sitting in Belgium to the holding company? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

I'll take your first question on capital generation and the treatment of minority interest. So
I especially mentioned Q1, because in Q1, we were already of the opinion and we guess
that there was a fair chance for the put not to be exercised. And we, I would say, prepare
the ground. And if you go back to the disclosure at the end of Q1, we were still obliged to
disclose a 100% roll forward. And because the free capital generation is backed by
Solvency II where we are seen as owning 100% of AG at the (00:32:23) cost of the value
of the put.
But we isolated the – what belong, if I may say so, to the minority interest. And we tried to
isolate what the Group share would be. And the Group share was precisely this €112
million. So this €112 million correspond to 75% of ownership of AG, which makes it fully
comparable to the figure we are releasing today. And so it's the reason why I especially
mentioned this €112 million as a comparison, but it's a comparison on the same scope. So
it is quite a valid comparison.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then the second part of your question was on the SCR release in Q2. It was – the main
thing was that we took some management actions, and you referred to the €34 million,
which is on slide 59 and also on slide 9, by the way. And so this is due to some reduction
in risk and I'll give you two example. In the UK, there was something done on the balance
sheet on the assets side to reduce the risk on some receivable.
And then on the Intreas side, due to the fact that the weather impact is quite high this
year, the Intreas team decided to buy additional protection during the year. You know that
in the insurance sector, you can buy during the year additional covers with slightly higher
prices. But if you buy additional cover, you suddenly had the impact in the SCR which is
reduced because you are better covered. So the two main things are some protection on
some asset receivable in the UK, and on Intreas, they bought an additional protection visà-vis exceptional events.

A - Bart Karel De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. The second question with liquidity link to litigation and more specifically the request
or the question whether there's more room for upstream cash at the holding level. First of
all, we have our solvency in capital management policy, which determines what dividends
we expect to operate the companies to upstream depending on the solvency level. You
have seen that this year, we already received €600 million. And we also mentioned in the
press release and in the table as a footnote that we expect another €60 million from
Malaysia and there will also still be a dividend going through Intreas. So we will be
definitely above the €600 million which more than covers our dividend and corporate
cost, and you could say that even gives an additional €120 million, €140 million cash to
strengthen the cash position at the holding company level and, okay, what will now
happen also after the reinsurance application, the rating changes and all these things give
us some time to further work on this. But we will keep a strong solvency position in our
operating companies also because we are market leaders in most of the countries where
Page 9 of 21



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2018-08-08

we are, and at the same time, be sure that there is sufficient cash upstream, let's say, to
deliver on our promises with respect to dividend and with respect to buy back if there are
no M&A files.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thanks a lot.

Operator
The next question comes from William Hawkins from KBW. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you for taking my question. Can you just remind us your target of being
better than 97% combined ratio, how are you thinking about weather within that number?
So if we take the, I think, 4.7 points that you have flagged for this half, should we take that
to zero within the 97% or do you have a view about normal weather?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then secondly, could you talk a bit about the outlook for the UK in the second half of
this year and into 2019? I think you talked on the first quarter about becoming a bit more
focused on returning to growth to improve your economies of scale. If you're doing that in
terms of being more price competitive, does that inevitably mean that there's going to
be upside pressure to your combined ratio simply because you'll still be reserving
conservatively with regards to Ogden or is there a compensating factor?
And then lastly, could you just talk briefly about the meaningfulness in your view of the
175% Solvency II ratio. I mean, you set that a few years ago. At that point, it seemed to be
a more realistic target. You're now comfortably above that level. But many companies
themselves kind of moving the goalposts in terms of thinking about that cushions for
market sensitivity and other stuff like that. So, to what extent is the 175% actually a useful
figure for us to take as a gauge? Thank you.

A - Bart Karel De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

The combined ratio, Antonio, you take that.

A - Antonio Cano

{BIO 16483724 <GO>}

Your question, William, was what the impact is on weather on a combined ratio on a
stable basis. I think if you look back, you could expect 2% to 3%, that will be a normal
impact of weather and that's Belgium, UK, and Portugal. Your second question was on the
outlook for the UK. So we are indeed growing again parts of the business. In the total
numbers we showed to you, you will see that because they're part of the business where
we're still kind of in a restructuring mode or coming back to profitability, and outlook for
the UK remains what it was. I think at previous sessions we already indicated that for this
year we aim at a result of about €60 million, 6-0 million euros, so we maintain that. And
growth, there is a bit of growth, but expect that not to be huge certainly not this year,
certainly also given the soft market in the UK.

A - Bart Karel De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

And so the combined ratio of 97% is indeed including a normal expected weather impact
as Antonio said of 2% to 3%.

FINAL

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

So, on the target of 175%. So, first of all, let's not forget that it is still based – the target is
still for the insurance activity. And I would like also to remind you, on the Investor Day of
2015, all that this target has been set up, it is basically to be able to absorb a shock of 1 in
30 (00:39:42) and that we are then still well above the 100% solvency capital
requirement.
Now for the rest, of course, we are very comfortable with the current level of
capitalization at group level, at insurance level, but also certainly within our operating
company. And as already mentioned, in September we have our next Capital Day, and
there we will also give an update on our capital management.

please go ahead.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Thanks very much. Just a quick follow-up and a couple of other questions as well. You
mentioned that your weather impact is 2 to 3 percentage points of your combined ratio
and normalized sort of impact throughout the year. And in the Q2, you had 2.3
percentage points of adverse weather in it. Can you just confirm whether this is within
normal limits, or is this on top of your – in addition to normal kind of 2 to 3 percentage
points of weather?
And then a couple of questions on your operational sort of capital impact. The €293
million, I don't know if you addressed this early, but could you tell me whether this includes
the 25% minority's amount as well, or if it – and if it now excludes this? And then also, on
the €99 million dividend upstreams from your non-European NCP's, can you tell me where
these have come from? Because I can only see China at €62 million and Thailand at €14
million. Thanks very much.

A - Bart Karel De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

I'll take the first question on the combined ratio and clarify that a bit. So the 2% to 3%, that
is a part of our 97% target. So within the 97%, you could expect 2% to 3% coming from
weather events. You referred to that, after six months we're slightly – well, we are above
2%. Bear in mind the reinsurance treaties that there are in place. There are various
Page 11 of 21

FINAL

aggregate treaties in some companies. So as you build up weather-related claims, there
is a point in time when you start (00:42:24) with the retention levels and then you will see
no more net impact from the weather.
Up until the six months, it was mostly within our retentions and there are a few treaties
where we have reached retention levels, but it's not huge. Saying that, going forward for –
certainly for Belgium, if we still would have another big flood or storms or whatever, that
would mean mostly in the reinsurance treaties. I hope that clarifies it a bit.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

So Steven, on your free capital generation question. So on the first one, I can confirm that
the €293 million is indeed after the deduction of the 25%. So it means that it is our share.
After the expiration of the put, we are the owner of 75% of AG. So this figure corresponds
to our holding of AG. So this is after deduction of the 25%.
Then as regard to the NCP at €99 million, the lacking components are Malaysia where we
received €16 million of dividend; and Turkey, €7 million. So you had China and Thailand, but
we have Malaysia and Turkey as well, to be added in that case. If you adapt all these four
numbers, you arrive at €99 million.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

And then on the – it was not precisely your question, but this €293 million relates to the
European entities. And please take into consideration the fact that we have free capital
generation under Asian business as well, and please refer to the footnote material. And
here we can confirm that on the non-controlled participation with JVs from Asia in terms
of free capital generation, we are very well on track with the guidance of around €250
million.

There are no more questions in the queue. We have a question from Farooq Hanif. Sir,
please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Just wanted to know in terms of the improved capital fungibility due to reinsurance. Is this
going to change anything in terms of how you manage group liquidity or upstreams in the
future? So, will we see kind of any immediate impact from that on cash flow?

FINAL

And also, going back to the points made earlier about your improving financial flexibility, I
know you gave some sort of guidance around your debt-raising capability in the past
when we were discussing potentially raising debt for the BNP option. Could you kind of
update us on where you think that is now according to the S&P model, for example?
Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

So on your first question on capital fungibility, so that's internal capital management
because what we call reinsurance is more a financial operation, but based on quota share.
What we will do is that we will take a share of the operation or the controlled entities
within the holding. So it means that the dividend capabilities of the corresponding entities
could be reduced – will be reduced, but we will have to add back what we will recognize
directly within the holding. So all-in-all, there will be no change; no change. It's really an
internal management of the group.
In terms of group financial flexibility, what we have in mind is that there is room for
additional leverage and our assessment is that it is around €1 billion from the – if you take
the regulation about Tier 2 capability, we have additional room for €1 billion.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

So that's based on the Solvency II regulation, presumably?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Because we have limitations imposed by the Solvency II.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

But just – I mean, presumably you...

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

You have the capital credit under Solvency II. If you want to have the capital credit and to
take that into account in your Solvency ratio, you obviously have to follow the Solvency II
rules and you have limitations based on your Tier 1 amount, and this put limits on Tier 2.
And with this, our very rough calculation is that the room we have is around €1 billion.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

But to maintain the upgrade of notches of the holding, presumably you won't go to a full
€1 billion. So I was wondering if there's another constraint that's...

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

No. No. When I told you there is a potential upgrade of three notches, it is based on the
present capital structure. So, this is a potential. If we want to increase the leverage, it's
another discussion with the rating agency. But at this stage, we don't have the intention to
raise this €1 billion of debt. So we will present our fight (00:48:24) to S&P with the present

Page 13 of 21



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

Date: 2018-08-08

balance sheet structure, and it is where based on their capital model, we are, let's say –
we are eligible – theoretically eligible to gain these three notches.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. That's very kind. Thank you very much.

The next question comes from (00:48:48) from JPMorgan. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Hi. This is Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan. I'm just using Kunal's (00:48:55) line. Sorry, I had
a – look, I was on the queue earlier, but missed it somehow. I have a few questions. So
first of all, could you just remind us about your M&A? How do you see M&A at this point? I
mean, in past you have mentioned that you would like to do something in Indonesian NonLife. So, where are we on that? And is there anything happening in Fidea, in Belgium? Is
there something happening in Portugal, because still there is a lot of consolidation
expected in Belgium, Portugal and your aspirations around M&A in Indonesia as well? Any
thoughts on that would be great.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second thing is, you mentioned that it looks like you're still low on capital gains this
year for Belgium compared to what you have done last year. So, shall we be expecting
more cap gains in Belgium in second half or, give or take, you're done for this year in first
half in Belgium?
And the last bit is, I mean you're growing very rapidly in China. I mean, €12 billion flows is a
pretty big number for first half. I mean, if I annualize that it's €20 billion, €25 billion a year.
Do you ever get worried about such growth? I mean, is (00:50:07) relaxing some of the
underlying behavior or they say, (00:50:12) underlying features of the product to deliver
such a massive growth. Any thoughts on that would be great. Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Thank you, Ashik, for the three questions. The first one, M&A. Okay, maybe summarize.
When we look through the mature markets, our core markets, Belgium, Portugal, UK, we
can say in Belgium, yes, we will look to whatever opportunity that permits us to increase
our stake in Non-Life primarily, because we are at 25% plus market share in Life. So that's
not really where we are looking for expansion in organic growth. And if Fidea would be a
file that comes through the market, we will, in any case, have a look at that.
In Portugal, okay, there are also indeed rumors indications that in the coming quarters one
or more files might come to the market, as we have chosen Portugal to become our third
home market after Belgium and UK. And we have been quite advanced in our
transformation plan in Portugal. We also there will, in any case, look to those opportunities
and see whether they can match also there again, primarily in Non-Life because also in
Portugal in Life, we have a market share of more than 20%.

FINAL

The UK, for the evident reasons, we continue, as Antonio said, to first of all finalize the
restructuring, which is really very well-advanced. And we will look how we can take up
again with growth after two years of decline, growth in a smart way. So that's with Europe.
If you then go to Asia, we indeed expressed already a number of years our interest for
Indonesia. We have been looking to multiple files in the past and – or we declined
because they were not fitting our financial criteria, or we sometimes also not withhold
because we don't want to pay the price (00:52:24)
So it's a difficult market to find a target that is giving us enough confidence that we can
become, let's say, a top player in the market and also (00:52:37) conditions. So we
continue to screen the market, but not an easy one. And then there are other countries in
Asia where we are present or not present, where we continuously see how we can
increase our footprint. But we will keep this discipline knowing that, okay, prices, if you
really want to make it jump in the market, you probably have to, from time to time, pay a
strategic premium. But we are, as you, I believe, have all seen in the past, we are not
ready to do (00:53:13) decisions in this perspective.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Belgium, the capital gains, you can see – and it's on slide 25 in the pack, that we
realized so far €79 million compared to €101 million last year. Part of our cap gains and/or a
big part are always real estate. We can never, let's say, plan them in equal part per
quarter. So you could say that compared to last year, you can expect a bit more in the
second half than what we had last year. In the second half last year, we only realized, if I
remember well, €6 million or €7 million in the second half. So I think you can count on a bit
more.
And then the last point on China, rapid growth. Okay, we can confirm that in any case the
intention of our joint ventures, so as well our partner as ourselves to further invest in
growth. So you can expect in the coming period a further increase of sales teams. As I
mentioned earlier in the call, coming from a number eighth position some years ago, I
think last year we were sixth. In the meantime, we're number four in total premium in
commercial, not in new business.
So first of all, we see that our company is – locally there, is very well equipped to recruit
thousands – I would even say, ten thousands of agents in a short period of time to train
them very efficiently and also to be very selective after three and six months to, let's say,
take out those agents that are not productive.
So it's impressive, the growth we make there, as well the number of sales as in premium
income. But I can assure you that it's done in a very, let's say, disciplined and measured
way. So we feel comfortable with that and don't see that as a specific risk.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. That's very clear. Thank you.

The next question comes from Jason Kalamboussis from KBC Securities. Sir, please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Just a quick follow-up on the combined ratio in Belgium. You had – I mean, I can
appreciate that you have lower reserve releases versus last year, but you had in the
second quarter relatively large reserve release, I think above 10%. But you also mentioned
that – and I'm not sure if I understand it well that you had reserve strengthening still in
workers' compensation. So if you could give a bit more color there, that would help.
And the second thing is, there is an – the expense ratio in the UK and Continental Europe
has been increasing over the last year. Are there any main reasons behind it? I know
you're expecting it to be a bit lower as you're going to the second half.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

So I think your first question was on the combined ratio of Belgium and in particular, the
workers' comp, lower releases from previous years. There's nothing really specific there.
It's a business line where there isn't had any (00:56:44) some volatility. And if I remember
well, it was a specific type of contract where we had a review of reserves, but it's nothing
really very, very special. I would say, it's part of the normal volatility.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Okay. But do you still have much larger releases in other businesses presumably, because
you're making up for that, and also it was like a high release – prior-year reserve releases
quarter?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

No, the releases are not really managed in a global way. So (00:57:16) product by product.
So the fact that in one product there is a higher or a lower release, will never impact the
way that the other releases are managed.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

So, there's nothing really – there's no real story behind that. The second question was on
the combined – no, on the expense ratio for Continental Europe and the UK, I believe? I
think for Continental Europe...

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Yes, which increased over the last year or so. How do you see that progressing over the
next 6 months (00:57:50) 12 months?

I think Continental Europe, you are probably comparing a slightly different scope because
last year at Cargeas,...

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

FINAL

Correct.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

...our Italian operations were included there, which was like really a bancassurance type of
operation which typically had lower expense ratios. So now actually you are looking at just
Portugal which still has a higher expense ratio. So their work is ongoing, particularly to
make the business we bought from AXA more and more efficient (00:58:22) potentially
also bancassurance business, that's a very efficient business.
In the UK, the expense ratio is really about to drop in both premium income, so your net
earned premium goes down. And also (00:58:38) other income and commissions or
ancillary income, that would typically kind of correct for in our expenses. So we'd also see
a drop the last two years of this ancillary income and that has also an impact on the
expense ratio. But we're working hard in actually resizing the operations in the UK to fit
the current volume levels (00:59:06) business we want to have in the future.

The next question comes from Bart Jooris from Degroof Petercam. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you for taking some follow up questions. Coming back a little bit on Asia, and
some of these things have been said, the second quarter, you had the impairments, you
also made up for a large part in your gross inflows regarding, okay, the loss of the single
premiums in the first quarter. So, I assume you had quite some more commission
expenses, given that Q2 inherited is a low figure.
If we take Q2 just as a run rate, that is for the following quarters, we already arrive above
your guidance. So, could you give any comments on that? Because despite – in case there
are no, let's say, dramatic stock exchange movements in Asia, you should exceed your
guidance rather easily, I think this year. And then secondly, is there any update on the
Ogden rate discussion in UK?

A - Bart Karel De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. Asia, if you take the Q2 result, which was €46 million, as mentioned, we have
something like €44 million negative on cap gain. So, you could say you are more in
Page 17 of 21



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

FINAL

underlying of €90 million. We keep the €250 million guidance as being, let's say, what we
normally – and I think your words – that maybe easily should achieve. But reminds a
number of elements. First of all, we are not sure what the markets will do in the coming
months. So you have the trade war and the potential consequences on stock exchange.
That's also what partly hit us in Q2.
In a country like Malaysia, our result is already, to a certain extent, impacted by IFRS 9. So
also there, the durations in markets have an impact on the – our IFRS profit. And then you
have what you already commented a bit, the fact that we will have investments and
further growth in China in the coming two quarters, so that will also have a kind of a
dampening effect on the profits.
So, it is – if you look to last year, we were at under €13 million profit in Asia after six
months, and we ended the year in more than €290 million. We are now at €170 million, so
we are indeed very confident that, €250 million is reachable, and with no doubt, not
hesitate to do better. On Ogden, Antonio?

A - Antonio Cano

{BIO 16483724 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

In Ogden, we can be very brief (01:02:15). And so, we hope and support that this gets
resolved as soon as possible. But looking at the legislative calendar of the UK, where we
already said, I think at previous calls that we did not expect any change in 2018, so
definitely not. So, we hope that somewhere in 2019, this might be done. And more than
that, I cannot say. I will just repeat what I said other times, don't hold your breath for now.

Q - Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
The next question comes from Albert Ploegh from ING. Sir, please go ahead?

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, and thank you for still taking my questions in the call. Two from my
end, first of all, on the share buyback, I know you delivered clearly on expectations. But I
guess, it must have been in a way an economically more difficult decision to continue at –
with the same program given simply what the share prices, and if I simply look at metrics
like book value.
So how do you look at that decision in the light of what the share price is? And then
maybe you already alluded to something of new flexibility that has been obtained, and
then what we can expect on the Capital Markets Day in terms of, let's say, special
distributions. Maybe you can already give us some kind of preview there?
And the second question is on the BNP decision not to exercise the put. I remember, you
saying that you tried to start some dialog before June 30. So (01:03:58) been any form of

Page 18 of 21



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2018-08-08

discussion with BNP? And if not, yeah, what do you think the reason simply was for BNP
just to lapse the put, because I still believe, it would have been an excellent way for you
guys to redeploy capital and to use the balance sheet? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Bart Karel De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

With respect to the share buyback, of course, we took the process as we did it in the
past. However, we have the timing in our board with half year results where we present
and discuss our half year results. We come out of management with a (01:04:39) proposal
for a buy back where we look at, of course, the cash position. We look at our solvency
position. We also look through the economic environment then, and in all honesty, there
are maybe a bit more uncertainties in the markets than what we had in previous years. But
we also look to – well I would say that the return on equity of a program. And it's clear that
the return on equity of the program, with the current share price, is lower than what it
was, let's say, the first time or even a number of previous years.

Bloomberg Transcript

And so, all these elements together brought us to a decision to re-launch share buyback,
because it's still considered a much better investment than keeping the cash as such. And
also, let's say, by a lack of immediate M&A files, where we have to put the money on the
table. So, all these elements together brought us to a decision on new buyback of €200
million.
We will, of course, again, and sorry to repeat that, but in our Investor Day, I gave clearance
on our view on this for the coming three years. The put option, first of all, it was an option
that was granted to BNP. So, they had the choice to exercise or not. I think, we always
have been talking with BNP locally, with the headquarters in Paris on a number of topics.
Of course we sometimes (01:06:19) to the put option, but there never have been difficult
or a harsh or even discussions on whether to exercise or not. It was fully up to them to
take a decision. And we were correctly informed at the moment that the expiry date was
there. That they – have not the intention to exercise. And so, I think both parties are happy
with that decision. It clarifies something, so we don't have this uncertain element
anymore, not now, never anymore because there is no kind of renewal of an option.
So, they are a 25% shareholder. They also, by doing that, somewhere showed their belief
in AG Insurance and also believe in the value of distribution agreement, the distribution
agreement that is now, you could say, a kind of a perpetual agreement with a notice
period of two years.
So, the end date of – end of 2020 is not valid anymore because it's every day moving up
for at the earliest three years from the day of the potential decision to cancel the
agreement. But also there, we can confirm that there is no indication at all that our
important distribution partner in Belgium being BNP Paribas Fortis Bank would not be
happy with the way we first of all work together, okay, pay decent commissions for good
products with good service. And I think, you already are invested in a company that has a
good solvency position and pays a nice dividend. So, I would say everybody seems to be
happy.

speakers; Mr. De Bart and Mr. Boizard (01:08:21)?

A - Bart Karel De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your good questions. To end this call, let me
summarize the main conclusions. Over the past couple of weeks, major milestones have
been reached with almost all the legacy stocks (01:08:37). We witnessed also a
commercial turnaround in Asia in particular, in China and returned to growth in Life inflows
in Belgium. The Insurance net result is strong despite adverse weather and substantial
lower support from net capital gains. We showed a continued solid operating
performance across all segments with UK making encouraging progress. The Solvency II
ratio for Insurance and the Group is strong, well-above target. And we also showed a
strong operational free capital generation.

Bloomberg Transcript

And finally, we launched eighth consecutive share buyback program of €200 million. One
last thing, another day to keep in mind is the 19th of September, Wednesday, where we
will host our Investor Day in London. On that occasion, we will update you on our new
strategic plan for the future following the successful completion of our Ambition 2018

Now, with this, I would like to bring this call to an end. Don't hesitate to contact our
