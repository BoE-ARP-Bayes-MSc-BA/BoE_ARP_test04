Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Thank you, Kjetil and good afternoon, everyone. I have presented today our results of
NOK578 billion with the operating proﬁt of NOK474 for the second quarter of 2019. This is
a weak operating proﬁt, but as I will show you on the following slide, the underlying proﬁt
is signiﬁcantly better due to restructuring costs and not least as a consequence of a good
performance in the asset management, resulting in performance fees not booked while
the corresponding performance related costs are fully booked in the quarter. In total, the
performance-related income not booked is calculated to 200 million in the quarter and
166 million year-to-date.

Bloomberg Transcript

We see solid growth within our asset management business with NOK45 billion in growth
so far this year, that's a 6% growth rate. And our Unit Linked business has the annual
growth of 11%. The solvency ratio has weakened 6 percentage points to 167% in the
quarter, with lowest interest rates and temporary adjustments in the asset allocation being
the primary causes for the change, Lars will go into further details later on.
If we then move to Slide number three, THE accounting principles relating to
performance-related income and cost or estimate [ph] reach. The cost has to be booked
quarterly -- quarter-by-quarter, while the corresponding income are to be booked only at
year-end. This causes us the operating proﬁt in the ﬁrst, second and third quarter to be
weakened when they have good performance in the portfolio. In the second quarter, we
have booked cost of NOK44 million in the operating proﬁt in our asset management
business. The corresponding income of NOK100 million is not booked.
In this picture I have adjusted the underlying proﬁt for performance related cost of
NOK44 million, this has been in an equivalent increase in the underlying proﬁt. In
addition, we are taking measures to reduce FTE's in both Norway and Sweden in order to
reduce our permanent cost base. Brings together with some transaction cost reserve in
our one-oﬀ restructuring costs in the quarter of NOK50 million. Adjusted for these the
underlying operating proﬁt is estimated to NOK568 million.
If you then move to slide number four, this is the picture of our strategy, our Q4 strategic
plan, we're focused on actively managing the guaranteed products in our back-book, and
at the same time, achieving strong growth in our front-book of Occupational Unit Linked,
private savings and asset management. As mentioned, we are implementing restructuring
to reduce our cost base. We are committed to delivering ﬂat normina costs through 2020.
In addition, we are working on measures to further strengthen solvency and secure capital
release in accordance with our Capital Market Day communication.
In the following slides, I will further address the growth in our numbers. So let's move to
slide number ﬁve. Our Unit Linked business showed a growth of 11% and the Norwegian
Unit Linked assets reached NOK100 billion in the quarter, while our Swedish Unit Linked
business also surpassed SEK100 billion. The growth is expected to continue and

FINAL

strengthen by Storebrand's ability to sign important contracts for occupational pension in
both Norway and Sweden. I will address the growth in our asset management further in
the following slides. It is also pleasing to see a 2% growth in the insurance business with a
6% growth in the retail segment of P&C insurance.
Moving to slide number six, our asset management has reached NOK750 billion in assets
under management and we've reduced our growth in all segments. On the left side, you
see the development in internal transfers from occupational pension contracts and private
savings year-to-date. While on the right side, which is the development of the institutional
clients and retail savings. So it's internal assets on the left-hand side and more external
assets on the right-hand side.

Bloomberg Transcript

On right, we show that the share of external assets are in strong growth and the share
now of external assets are 34.5% of the total assets under management. We're working on
more speciﬁc invoices of these ﬂows and we will in the following show analysis of ﬂow
from internal transfers in the ﬁrst half of 2019. So let's move to slide seven.
On the left, we see that there is a modest ﬂow of premiums from the guaranteed business
of NOK3.2 billion, primarily from proﬁtable active schemes with low guarantee levels. The
claims transfers from this mature portfolio are substantially as -- are substantial and
amounts to NOK6.8 billion year-to-date. Over time, this will reduce the guaranteed
portfolio. The returns have been solid in the portfolio in the ﬁrst half of 2019, it's well
above the guaranteed interest rate level, meaning that close to half of the returns has
been allocated to building buﬀer capital. Within Unit Linked the situation is quite
diﬀerent. This is a young portfolio where premiums, but are exceeds claims and transfers,
and well a high equity share results in a solid growth so far this year.
Moving to Slide number eight. The public sector pension market is large and growing in
Norway. In terms of premiums, the market is twice the size of the private market of -- for
occupational pension where we are the market leader. The market is today dominated by
long actor KLP, chases to the public sector pension products, droves the market closer to
in -- closer resemblance to the private markets. We will make use our existing platform
and systems to reenter these markets. We strongly believe we will achieve proﬁtable
growth in this market and we'll execute within the communicated cost target.
On Slide nine, we show that we are intensifying digitalization of our business. Both and
with regard to improving eﬃciency and in our processes and with a goal of improving the
digital solutions we provide to our customers. We give four concrete examples of this
journey on this slide.
With that I give the word to Lars for further details and about the numbers.

Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Thank you, Odd. I'm going to give you some of the key ﬁgures with you, starting on Page
10. The operating proﬁt of NOK568 million after adjustment for restructuring cost and
performance related bonuses is somewhat on the weak side. The ﬁgure includes NOK25
Page 3 of 14

Date: 2019-07-12

million in normal stock incentivized cost -- incentives cost for employees that we book in
the second quarter, but not in the other quarters; including this the result is acceptable.

FINAL

Furthermore, if we were to include these earned, but not booked performances, the result
would be good. The graph illustrates strong customer Buﬀers in both Norway and
Sweden, this is further resilience in our risk management.
Moving over to Page 11, the solvency position has followed to 165% and 167% with
transitionals. Model and assumption changes given negative contribution of 1 percentage
points in the quarter. Behind this number, there are some positive elements like increased
volatility adjustment and some negative eﬀects, like increased equity distrust and moral
improvements and corrections. Interest rates have signiﬁcantly in both Norway and
Sweden in the second quarter. In Norway, the new 10-year growth is down 13 basis points,
and in Sweden, the 10-year growth rate is down 32 basis points in the second quarter. This
is the solvency rate by approximately 3 percentage points.
And the business mix and asset allocation, there are three main eﬀects. One, the strong
growth in Unit Linked by more than NOK8 billion is positive for Storeband, but
contributes negatively in the solvency as these products have an embedded Solvency of
approximately 130%, diluting the Group Solvency over 165%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, some large maturities in the bonds at amortized cost portfolio changed to
maturity later in the second quarter. These have already been reinvested in the third
quarter, but we can do Solvency as of the end of the quarter.
And three, good returns and increased Buﬀers have improved our risk-bearing capacity.
We have used this increased risk capacity to purchase equities. The equity investments
weaken the Solvency short-term, an increase expected returns and Solvency creation over
time.
On the M&A side, we have ﬁnalized the previously communicated acquisition of Cubera
and the sale of Nordben. In total, the solvency is weakened by 1 percentage points, but
the transactions will add proﬁtability and Solvency creation going forward. Operating
proﬁt adjusted for dividend reservation contributes positive by 1 percentage point. Proﬁt
after tax and adjusted for amortization strengthen the Solvency by approximately 2
percentage points, but which have to set aside for expected dividends.
Despite the interest rates fall in the quarter, we are seeing outside of the transitional rules
for interest rates and the 2 percentage points are related to equity stress on equity owned
coming into the Solvency II regime. This eﬀect will be phased out during the year.
Turning over to Page 12. The Solvency position is weakened by 6 percentage points in the
quarter. As explained the main drivers are lower interest rates, which is negative, but also
long-term positive elements like growth in Unit Linked and increased risk in the portfolios.
Please notice that if rates fall further, we'll once again get Solvency capital from the
transitional rules and the regulatory and reported Solvency will be strengthened. The

FINAL

sensitivities show a strong resilience to volatility and ﬁnancial market under diﬀerent
scenarios shown.
Storebrand announced on our Capital Markets Day in May 2018 that we expect to reach
180% in Solvency during 2021, and that we envisage to release around 10 billion tied up in
the guaranteed back-book between 2022 to 2028. Despite lower interest rates and
weaker Solvency this quarter, we conﬁrm this ambition. We have numerous tools to secure
and strengthen our Solvency position.
Moving over to the next page, heading to Storebrand Group. In short, we put behind us a
weak quarter in terms of the reported numbers. The growth has slowed and the cost have
increased. Adjusted for restructuring costs and performance-related bonus charges, and
including our earned but not booked performances fees, the results are satisfactory. We
expect increased growth in the coming quarters. The growth will come from several
sources in asset management especially linked to international sales.

Bloomberg Transcript

In private equity, we have -- we already have record commitments in Cubera and
Storebrand sales this year. Skagen performance is good and the transfer balance is
improving. Pension sales are up in Sweden in particular. In Norway, we just won the single
largest contract in the market. Many exciting digital initiatives are expected to improve
eﬃciency and the Group operation and increased sales overall.
Finally, yet importantly, the opening of executive market is promising a few years down
the road. Restructuring cost and performance related bonuses aﬀect the results in the
quarter but laid the foundation for continued cost eﬃciency and increased proﬁtability
going forward. Previously communicated cost ambitions are conﬁrmed. And as I already
said, on the Solvency, our ambition to return excess capital from 2021 or billing of the
Solvency to 180% in 2021 and distributing excess capital from the back-book is conﬁrmed.
Then I think we can go over to Q&A.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The ﬁrst question comes from Peter Eliot from Kepler
Cheuvreux. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. First question, I want to start on earnings. I guess, if you adjust for
the one-oﬀ items then you get a Norwegian Unit Linked results of 76, and a Swedish Unit
Linked results of 58. I guess those numbers are still a little bit below the recent run rate.
I'm just wondering, is that a good view of the current run rate and what we should be
putting into our models? Or are there still other factors there to consider? And maybe
speciﬁcally on Unit Linked Sweden, I mean, I know that it's a consistently reported

Page 5 of 14

FINAL

negative ﬁnancial and risk results. Well, each and -- for the last sort of six quarters or so, I
just wanted if you could explain what's happening there?
And then, secondly, on the Solvency, I think, I understand most of the moving parts after
going through with IR, who are very helpful this morning. Thank you. And -- but I guess if I
could just focus a little bit on exactly how and when you might get the beneﬁts of the
transitionals gain. I mean, Lars, you said, when interest rates -- if interest rates were to fall
then you would get the beneﬁt, but my understanding is, the Unit Linked book is still
growing and might the bar be raised going forward. So if you could talk us through the
moving parts a bit, that would be very helpful.
And the second point, you showed 1 percentage points from ongoing Solvency capital
generation this quarter. I mean, there's probably some rounding and stuﬀ in that. But I'm
just wondering if you could update us on our guidance for what you expect in terms of
ongoing generation and how that depends on the growth rate that you see. Thank you
very much.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. If I start with the earnings on Unit Linked. The -- if you look at the ﬁrst quarter for
Unit Linked Norway and this -- and the second quarter together, there is some volatility
due to some parallelization and some seasonal eﬀect in those numbers. So I would look at
the ﬁrst half numbers seen together and divide that in two to get a good or good guiding
on future proﬁtability. And as you say, you -- we'll have to adjust it for the restructuring
cost in the quarter, which were NOK9 million in Unit Linked in Norway.
In Sweden, the one-oﬀ restructuring charge was NOK16 million in Unit Linked SPP, so
that's the adjustment you will have to make there. And I would also emphasize that there
is very strong growth in the Swedish Unit Linked business. We have very good premium
development there and the cost base is ﬁxed. So you should see increased proﬁtability
from that area as well.

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Hi, Peter. When it comes to -- when we will enter or if a potential -- enter back into the
transitional measures, that's not a straight forward question to answer, because as you say,
you've arrived at increased value from Unit Linked business to be able to postponed fall
in interest rate and then enter back into the traditionals. At the moment, or in this quarter,
there were technical provisions both approximately NOK200 million away from getting
back into transitional measures. So -- and that was approximately a half or in Q1 this was
NOK500 million away from getting back into transitionals. So that's the magnitude that
we're looking at. So there's only the experience a good growth in the front book which is
a good thing. Then we shouldn't get back into transitional measures and that you see a
signiﬁcant drops in the markets.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And Solvency capital generation, as we have previously guided, we expect to generate 10
basis points to 12 basis points -- percentage points per year of which half is allocated to or
Page 6 of 14

reserved for dividend on quarterly basis.

FINAL

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

And I think also when it comes to the research generation on the 1%, you should bear in
mind that we take half of the result outﬂow, that the calculation cost ﬁxed goes to expect
the dividend, so the 2 percentage point increase where one of them increases for
Solvency directly.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay, so it sounds like no change to the ongoing guidance then. And sorry can I just
come back very quickly on the ﬁrst point, the -- in the breakdown, you gave a special
items, you showed NOK16 of the one-oﬀ costs being attributed to Unit Linked Norway
and NOK2 million being attributed to Unit Linked Sweden, it sounded like you quoted
slightly diﬀerent ﬁgures there?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yes, I think Peter, sorry. That's a little mistake on my part. It should be the other way in
special items, the ﬁgures on the online we will update them after the --

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay, sorry could you repeat the numbers then, sorry, I didn't quite catch that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

It's NOK16 on the Swedish Unit Linked business. That as Lars said.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay, that's just invested. Okay, thank you.

Operator
The next question comes from Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please go ahead. Your
line is now open.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon a question ﬁrstly, on the Solvency capital and the return of capital
that Lars you mentioned earlier on the ambitions. When I look at the interest rates
obviously, they've been trending down this year and now recently, we've seen a little bit
of a pickup in Norway. But how much should the 10-year swap rate or could it fall before it
would really start to have an impact on this capital release plan? Or is it just so that if the
interest rate falls enough then the transitionals will kick in, so it really doesn't matter. I'm
just kind of trying to gauge the timing of the plans of the guaranteed pension back book
capital release.

Page 7 of 14



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2019-07-12

And then second question on the insurance business. Could you just remind us what the
issue in the health and group life was then, is that now solved or should we expect that,
that will continue in the coming quarters as well? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

So on Solvency and interest rates fall, you are correct that there is a sensitivity there. But I
also said that we do have a number of diﬀerent tools available to us that we'll have to try
and manage that, as well as we can, but there is some kind of limitation at some stage in
terms of how much rates can pull in Norway. But it's very diﬃcult for me to give you a
ﬁxed answer as there are many tools in the toolbox to conquer that depending on how
dramatic the changes are.
And in terms of insurance and group life, we mentioned in the ﬁrst quarter that we had an
issue with especially one industry contract or our group contract with one particular client
and we also mentioned that we had announced price changes on that contract. However,
there is a 12-months today so those price changes will only take place on January 1st,
2020. So this quarter we also had weak proﬁtability and we strengthened reserves in this
particular -- on this particular contract by NOK58 million in order to ensure that we can
expect a -- around zero result for the year. So while group life and health insurance this
quarter we also had a small negative contribution, we do expect a small positive
contribution for the remainder of the year and then signiﬁcant improvements as these
price increases are come through in the ﬁrst quarter next year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Could you -- Lars just give us a bit more ﬂavor on what exactly are the most important tool
-- tools in this tool box you mentioned to kind of combat the potential decline in interest
rates?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yes, Matti, I can say -- there is -- you can maintain and divide them into three diﬀerent
categories; the ﬁrst is, of course, the asset allocation on the ALF asset. This will always
adjust your risk taking in the portfolios, so that's number one.
Mention number two is, what you can do on the capital side, either by more subordinated
loan capital or you cannot do insurance. And the third, it's what goes on what I should say
internal structures of how we have set up and run the business and how you are making
the model work. So you have at least three diﬀerent main levers. It's also got some levers
to date.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. Thanks a lot.

mention your last name. Your line is now open. Thank you.

FINAL

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Yeah, its Jan Erik from ABG in Oslo. I just wanted to pick up the -- how much cost there
other than the Cubera acquisition from 1st of the April. If it was anything at there at all
because it looks like, does the management cost base went up a little bit on top of
whether you have thus a restructuring cost.
And secondly, there is some negative proﬁt sharing this is technically in the asset
management and then also in the deﬁned beneﬁt for Norway. What is kind of -- what is
that, is that something recovering or it's something particular which you should aware of.
Thank you.

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

All right. There is two things, Erik. The cost base in Cubera, I believe, is somewhere in the
area of NOK7 million, NOK8 million or I can get back to you on that, Erik. But somewhere
in that area for the quarter.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

When it comes to the negative sum in -- in the deﬁned beneﬁt business, this is basically a
technical adjustment where we had small deviation into each of our systems and this will
ﬁxed in the quarter and it led to the charge of NOK21 million.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. In the asset management side, we have also some NOK6.6 million in negative of
being there. I just couldn't understand what else was --

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

These are -- yeah, apologies for (inaudible) that is tied to both the value of the earnout,
which on the balance sheet after we bought Cubera and it was some other ﬁnancial
eﬀects that occurred in the asset management business.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. How much was the earnout in Cubera, if you could remind me?

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. And the other half is from SKAGEN or?

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

FINAL

No, it's just from general ﬁnancial eﬀects in the asset management business, not from
SKAGEN.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Would you say that you are in the -- on the SKAGEN earnout story as well? Or is -how is that pursuing?

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So the SKAGEN business turnaround is really progressing well according to plan.
Performance is very well up this year and all the large funds and also the smaller funds.
The ﬂow in that business has been negative for a while, but that's turning interesting now,
and the operational platform is very much integrated. I think we've already said previously
that we run this business basically for a small proﬁt without performances and
performance-related costs. But at the end of the year, we do expect quite signiﬁcant
performance-related bonuses, which should then contribute signiﬁcantly to the end
result. In terms of the earnout, we have due to lower funds under management during last
year, as well as weak performance last year. The earnout reserve was reduced down and
from what was set aside initially, but this -- so far this year, it's basically stable.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. So it's a fund that you have provided to. So it's not going to be a sort of a big oneoﬀ cost run if that happened. Is that fair to equate?

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Yeah. It's -- so the earnout itself, it's on the balance sheet based on expected level of
earnout.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Based on this.

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

Q - Analyst
Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So, ﬁrstly, just on the business extract
to Solvency II. I apologize if I missed this early, but is there any recurring impacts there,
any color there would be great. And then, secondly, just on the cost side of things, so I
gather, you guys are still committed to ﬂat operating costs, good cost discipline. But just
I've asked you this before but just strategically, given the level of growth that's sort of
there for you guys. How wedded are you to that target, if you could say invest more for
greater growth, particularly given the new products that you're going into. So I guess it's a
balancing act, but any comments there would be great. Thank you.

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Sorry, Jonny. Well, the ﬁrst question. What that is, there was an recurring elements in the
movement on the Solvency.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Now on the business-mixed asset allocation. So basically I can just do it for a short
answers and then ﬁll in from it, if you have anything. So basically we had three factors. So
increased the allocation of equities, that is not anything recurring, that's, of course,
hoping that we adjust our equity export for every now and again, but it's not a recurring
feature on that part of the movement.
The second of all, that we had a little bit shorter duration just on the turn of the quarter.
That is not a recurring feature, we did have strong growth in Unit Linked, which of course,
gives some -- also requires some capital that's Lars alluded to. That is, of course, a
recurring feature, we've then -- much like to see again. So strong growth in Unit Linked is
very good and at (inaudible) that is ﬁne.

Thanks.

FINAL

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

When it comes to the cost levels, try to answer that. I think, ﬁrst of all, the cost discipline
we've then on the ﬂat cost that we have been doing since 2012 actually is a very good way
of running the business and I'm sure that we have a -- well kept this more eﬀective way of
doing the business. And our platform as we have to sit all in all is very scalable and we
have seen of course excluding the strong wealth of this years that it's based on
digitalization and sourcing expenses and et cetera, we have been able to keep their cost
run also at the right level. There [ph] is of course not -- seeing the same, that if we have
good opportunities in the market, we see opportunities for growth as we do -- have done
with acquisition of Skagen and also Cubera, of course, we will go into these type of
solutions and that we've changed the cost levels as such. But we also see that we have the
opportunity to scale our platform as we now do and we going into the public sector
market with the existing systems and people. And believe that we will be able to take all
this huge opportunity without stretching the cost levels further, but to do that within the
cost limits, we have already set forward.

But just to be very clear, Jonny. We are going to be -- it's going to be a very good
proﬁtability opportunity if we were to reach our cost communicated goals, and we would
communicate clearly if that was to be the case. So you should not expect that we just ﬂoat
into higher cost, we will continue to be very, very strict on the cost base, according to
communicated levels.

Got it. Thanks guys.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) We do have another question from Peter Eliot from Kepler
Cheuvreux. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Sorry, I just wanted to follow-up actually on -- I guess my earlier
question, but also Jonny's question. I mean, I know we're talking sort of small numbers
and rounding and rest of it and other tools in the box. But if we just take the numbers that
you've reported now of, you know, 1 points of Solvency capital generation post dividend
and actually when you factor in the business mix change and you hope to get ongoing
growth then actually the net ongoing capital generation looks to have been below 1 point
this quarter. And if you extrapolate that out from 165%, then you've got a lot more than
two years to get to 180%.

I appreciate you've got other tools in the box, which you might use if interest rates were to
fall. But am I just rounding too much there, I mean would you expect the normal run rates
have been higher than this quarter. Sorry, it's a long-winded way of asking a fairly simple
question, so I guess you understand where I'm coming from? Thank you.

I think we're -- I think we're still conﬁdent that around 10% increase in Solvency annually
per dividend. That's the level we are at. I can see in the presentation, there is deﬁnitely
rounding when you look at these diﬀerent factors. So nothing new here really. And also,
we have factored into our capital generation that we will set some capital aside for capital
outlook.

If I can also add on that, I think, because the movement, the oﬃcial one, the capital
generation we show is compared to the ﬁnancials -- to the result explanation. Of course,
we are expecting in a normalized, well, a pickup in some risk premiums in the market. So
there is a -- we are expecting to have markets return above the discount rate until the
Buﬀer capital, which is still lower than capital requirement as well as the -- then the move
towards a lower average interest rate guarantee in the portfolio, which you can also reﬂect
the picture that Odd Arild showed during the presentation, where we see a larger outﬂow
than inﬂow. So I think that you will see that you will also get capital generation from excess
return of all the risk free rate and slightly declined in the guaranteed liabilities or the
capital requirements from the -- guaranteed items ﬁts all the time, as well as to the results
as such.
