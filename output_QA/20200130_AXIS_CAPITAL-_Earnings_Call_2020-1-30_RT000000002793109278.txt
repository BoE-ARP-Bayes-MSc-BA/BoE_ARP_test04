Presentation
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2019 Axis Capital Earnings
Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). Please
note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Rohrmann, Head of Investor
Relations. Please go ahead.

{BIO 15132648 <GO>}

Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm happy to welcome you to
our conference call to discuss our financial results for Axis Capital for the fourth quarter
and year ended December 31, 2019. Our earnings press release and financial supplement
were issued yesterday evening after the market closed. If you'd like copies, please visit
the information section of our website. We set aside an hour for today's call, which is also
available as an audio webcast through the Investor Information section of our website.
With me today are Albert Benchimol, our President and CEO; and Peter Vogt, our CFO.
Before I turn the call over to Albert, I'll remind everyone that the statements made during
this call including the question-and-answer session which are not historical facts may be
forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and
assumptions, actual events or results may differ materially from those projected in the
Page 1 of 19

forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including risk factors set forth in
Axis most recent report on Form 10-K, as well as the additional risks identified in the
cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements in our earnings press release
issued yesterday evening. We take no obligation to update or revise publicly any forwardlooking statements.
In addition, this presentation may contain non-GAAP financial measures. For the purposes
of this call, we believe the best way to discuss our operating results is on ex-PGAAP basis,
which is a better representation of the run rate performance of our business.
Reconciliations are included in our earnings press release and financial supplement.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Albert.

Thank you, Matt. Good morning, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call.
Getting right down to it, we did not deliver the financial results that we planned for this
year. But at the same time, we remain confident that the extensive repositioning of our
portfolios and investments in our talent organization and digital capabilities will shortly
deliver the performance and value creation our team and our shareholders expect of us.
In a few minutes, Pete will speak about the quarter, but my opening comments will focus
on our full year performance and year-over-year trends. Our performance this year
suffered from a busy Japanese typhoon season and poor crop conditions in the United
States. We also received increased loss notices from prior period catastrophes
throughout the year from both Typhoon Jebi as well as the Florida hurricanes.
Additionally, we saw higher than planned losses in our aviation and property lines. The
various loss events were entirely consistent with normal industry volatility for these lines
and our market shares, although we recognize that the growth of our business in Japan
while a good decision for the long term came at a bad time just before the beginning of a
record Japanese typhoon season. Nevertheless, even with all of these headwinds, our
portfolio actions have still delivered meaningful progress with the reduction of 1.1 points to
our current year ex-cat loss ratio, including 1.5 point reduction in insurance and a bit below
point in reinsurance. This brings the reduction in our consolidated ex-cat loss ratio to more
than three points over a two-year period. We've also continued to grow our highly
attractive fee business with our strategic capital partners, generating more than $80
million in fees this year, a 65% increase over the $48 million that we collected in 2018.
Our teams have been diligently managing and repositioning our portfolios to deliver a
stronger more stable underwriting results. And the ex-cat accident year combined ratio
trends are coming down year-over-year with lower intra year volatility. Across our
portfolio, we've been reducing limits, increasing attachment points where appropriate,
canceling unprofitable business and changing mix to focus on the more attractive subsectors of risk classes, as well as reducing PMLs. Where we felt that we could not make
sufficient improvement to our performance quickly enough, we exited businesses. We're
confident that this will lead to lower loss ratios in 2020 and beyond.

We were able to replace most of the premium volume lost in canceled or exited business
with growth in lines with pricing that met or exceeded our target requirements. However,
even with the strong rate increases observed this year, many lines still are not priced at
adequate levels, and we prefer to wait for sufficient pricing before pursuing growth in
those markets. Thus, earned premiums were down modestly this year, and that puts
some pressure on our G&A ratio. Although, we were able to meet our G&A ratio targets
with good expense control, and we continue to look for additional opportunities for cost
savings. We will nevertheless sustain our investments in digital and analytics capabilities.
Our digital capabilities have been much appreciated by our top distribution partners,
leading to new business growth in the desirable small accounts that we're looking to
grow. With all of this work to further remediate our portfolio, we enter 2020 with a
stronger book that is less volatile than in prior years. We are leaner and more digitally
enabled, and we continue to be well positioned in the market that are seeing the most
significant pricing corrections. While we are disappointed in our 2019 financial results, we
have a clear line of sight to stronger earnings. Our teams are aligned, committed and
determined to sustain the improving trends in our portfolio.
I'll now turn the call over to Pete, who'll take us through the financials, and I return with the
review of market conditions before opening the call to Q&A. Pete?

Peter Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Thank you, Albert. And good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we incurred a net
loss attributable to common shareholders of $10 million for an annualized ROE of a
negative 0.8%. On an ex-PGAAP basis, our operating income was $7 million, generating an
ex-PGAAP annualized operating ROE of six tenths of a point.
Our results this quarter were adversely impacted by a number of items, including pre-tax
cat and weather losses net of reinstatement premiums of $140 million. As we recently
announced, these losses were driven by Japanese Typhoon Hagibis, Australian Wildfires
and regional weather events in the United States. An increase in the current accident year
loss ratio ex-cat and weather in the Reinsurance segment due to loss experienced in
agriculture predominantly related to poor weather conditions that impacted our US book
of business. Also negatively impacting us was a decrease in net favorable prior-year
reserve development in the Reinsurance segment, attributable to elevate loss experience
in the '17 and '18 accident years for property and cat lines, including loss creep associated
with Hurricane Irma consistent with industry trends.
And lastly, diluted book value per share decreased by eight tenths of a point in the
quarter to $55.79, this was principally driven by the small operating gain being offset by
investment losses and common dividends. Some positive highlights for the quarter
include a significant improvement in the current accident year loss ratio ex-cat and
weather in the insurance segment, largely due to a decrease in loss experience
associated with almost every line of business. Net investment income of $118 million for
the quarter also helped. With respect to the Novae transaction, in the quarter the net
drag on operating income from PGAAP VOBA DAC adjustments was $3 million after tax,

FINAL

approximately $0.03 per share. As we have previously disclosed, we expect the VOBADAC impact to be minimal from this point moving forward.
As Matt mentioned, we believe the best way to discuss our result is on an ex-PGAAP
basis, which is a better representation of the run-rate performance of our business. This is
relevant for our group results and our insurance segment results this quarter. The impact
of PGAAP on the Reinsurance segment was not material. Accordingly, all my remarks
regarding the quarterly operating performance for group and insurance will be on an exPGAAP basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving into the details. At the group level the current quarter consolidated ex-PGAAP
combined ratio was 107.4, a decrease of 11.2 points from the fourth quarter of 2018. The
cat loss ratio in the quarter was 12.1, largely driven by Japanese Typhoon Hagibis, as I
mentioned earlier. This ratio was down from 22.5 in the prior year, which included
Hurricane Michael and the California Wildfires. The decrease of 3.2 points in the current
accident year loss ratio ex-cat and weather was attributable to the Insurance segment,
while the Reinsurance segment stayed relatively flat compared to 2018, given the results
coming from the U.S. crop business.
The consolidated ex-PGAAP acquisition cost ratio was 22.5 and that is comparable to the
prior year. The consolidated G&A expense ratio of 11.8 increased by half a point compared
to the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in the G&A ratio was driven by the decrease in
net premiums earned. On a normalized basis, the G&A ratio for the quarter was 13.6, the
difference between the reported number and the normalized number is a reduction of
variable comp taken during the quarter. The consolidated G&A expense ratio for the year
was 13.9. This was 14.3 on a normalized basis. The normalized year-to-date ratio was in
line with our previously communicated 2019 target of a mid-14s SG&A ratio.
We remain on track to achieve net savings related to our transformation program of $100
million compared to our 2017 run rate. However, in addition, we continue to drive other
expense actions to improve our G&A ratio, and we continue to focus on achieving a mid13's run rate by the end of 2020 and going into 2021. Fee income from strategic capital
partners was $23 million this quarter compared to $6 million in the prior year quarter. The
fourth quarter of 2018 was impacted by lower profit commission income due to the 2018
catastrophes. This important part of our business continues to grow well, as Albert noted
year-to-date fees aggregated to $80 million this year, up from $48 million last year.
Now, we'll move to the segments. Let's begin with insurance. The Insurance segment
reported an increase in gross premiums written of $41 million in the fourth quarter. We
saw a good new business opportunities in both liability and professional lines, as well as
some growth in marine. The insurance ex-PGAAP combined ratio was 95.2, which is 13.8
points lower than the same period last year. This quarter pre-tax cat and weather related
losses were $20 million, primarily attributable to worldwide weather events, and that
compares to $92 million in the same period of 2018.
The Insurance segment current accident year loss ratio ex-cat and weather decreased by
almost 7.5 points. This was driven by improved loss experience in property and aviation

Page 4 of 19



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2020-01-30

FINAL

lines associated with the repositioning of those portfolios, as well as improved loss
experience in marine and credit and political risk. The ratio was also positively impacted by
rate and trend in the quarter. Although, we did not fully reflect the better rate over trend
and our loss ratios for our liability and professional lines of business.
Lastly, the ratio was negatively impacted by changes in business mix, as property business
now comprises a smaller percentage of our book. Regarding this last point, the positive
offset to that mix impact on the ex-cat and weather loss ratio has been a decrease in the
current accident year cat loss ratio. The Insurance segments ex-PGAAP acquisition cost
ratio was 22.3, which is just over a point increase from the prior period. This was
predominantly driven by an increase in profit commission expense. The G&A ratio
increased by a point compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, driven by the decrease in
net premiums earned due to the repositioning of the portfolio rather than expense
growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now let's move on to the Reinsurance segment. The reinsurance segment reported an
increase in gross premiums written of $48 million in the fourth quarter mainly driven by
new business opportunities in liability and A&H together with some prior period premium
adjustments. The Reinsurance combined ratio was 113.5, which was 10.5 points lower than
the same period last year. Pre-tax cat and weather related losses, net of reinstatement
premiums were $120 million, primarily attributable to Japanese Typhoon Hagibis,
Australian Wildfires and regional weather events in the United States. This compared to
$177 million in the same period of 2018.
The Reinsurance segment current accident year ex-cat and weather loss ratio of 68.9 was
six tenths of a point higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase included
over 5 points related to the loss experience in agriculture predominantly due to poor
weather conditions that impacted the U.S. book of business, partially offset by improved
loss experience in a number of lines particularly in property and the benefit from change
in business mix. The Reinsurance segment acquisition cost ratio of 22.6 was 1.5 points
lower than last year, principally due to adjustments related to loss sensitive features, the
impact of retrocessional contracts and changes in business mix.
The G&A expense ratio decreased by over a point compared to the fourth quarter of
2018 mainly due to additional fees from strategic capital partners. Net investment income
of $118 million was comparable to the fourth quarter of 2018, but had a slight increase in
income from fixed income maturities and an improvement in income from alternative
investments attributable to hedge funds. Our current book yield is 2.8% and our new
money yield is 2.4%. And the duration of our portfolio is approximately 3.2 years.
With respect to capital actions. In December, we issued $425 million of junior
subordinated notes at a favorable rate. In January $225 million of the proceeds were used
to redeem all of our Series D Preferred Shares. We intend to use the remaining proceeds
from the December notes along with the $300 million in proceeds from the notes we
issued in June of last year to repay our $500 million of senior notes maturing in June of
2020. Because we pre-funded the cash required to redeem the $225 million of preferred
shares, as well as repay the $500 million coming due in June, total capital in our year-end
balance sheet was elevated by $725 million. Adjusting the year end balance sheet for the
Page 5 of 19

Date: 2020-01-30

redemption of the preferreds and the repayment of the senior notes, our pro forma year
end debt would be $1.3 billion and our preferred shares would be 550 million, resulting in
a pro forma debt plus preferred to total capital ratio of 28%. That summarizes our fourth
quarter results.

FINAL

And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Albert.

Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you Pete. Let's do a quick overview of market conditions and we'll then open the
call for questions.
In short, we're seeing pricing momentum accelerates across substantially all of our
markets. Let's begin with insurance. The average rate increase on renewed business
across our insurance portfolio was 11% in the fourth quarter, this compares to 8% in the
third, 7% in the second and 5% in the first quarter. For the full year, our consolidated
insurance business averaged rate increases of more than 7% on a gross basis. In the
quarter, our US division was our strongest market with average rate increases of 14%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Excess Casualty achieved a 24% increase, and Primary Casualty was up 11%. And in both
lines, we had strong premium growth on a gross basis, but cautiously maintained our highquota share sessions in the year. E&S property rates were up 16%. Notwithstanding these
strong increases, we actually shrank the book over the year, as we looked to right-size our
property exposures and manage our volatility.
Our US program business, which focuses on homogeneous books of smaller accounts,
achieved a 6% increase. Overall, rates in our U.S. division were up more than 10% on
average for the year. Within our North American Professional Lines division rate increases
continued to accelerate to an average of 7% in the quarter. Rates were strongest in our
Commercial Management Solutions unit with average increases of 17%.
In addition, our Bermuda excess in the Canadian Specialty Insurance businesses both
achieved double-digit rate increases. Our E&O and Cyber lines saw much more modest
pricing action averaging about 1%. Overall, our North American Professional Lines division
achieved average rate increases in excess of 4% for the year. In our London based
International Insurance division rates were up more than 12% on average in the quarter,
and just as in recent past, there was a wide range of increases across the book. The
average rate increase across our renewable energy book was 29% in the quarter. And we
achieved 20% increases in both aviation and global property.
In addition, we saw increases of 15% across our Professional Casualty lines and 11% across
our Marine business. On the other hand, terrorism and political and credit risk were
essentially flat. The average rate increases in the international division for the full year
were 7%. Notwithstanding this strong market conditions, we nevertheless reduced our
international book by 14% in the year. We took meaningful corrective action on
underperforming portfolios, especially in property, as we build a more balanced book.
The reduction in property lines and exited businesses was partially offset by strong
Page 6 of 19

Date: 2020-01-30

FINAL

growth in marine lines and more modest growth in other lines. Overall, across the entire
insurance book, about 92% of the book renewed flat to up this year.
Let's now move to Reinsurance. The fourth quarter is not big for renewals, so we'll focus
on January 1, when we renew approximately half of our annual Reinsurance premium.
Overall, we measured average renewal rate increases in the mid-single digits over the
whole book with more modest increases on average in pro rata business, and high single
digit increases in non-proportional business. However, there was a very wide range of
outcomes based on geography and line of business.
Within our Asia-Pacific Division, excluding the Japanese Market which is renewed primarily
in April 1, recent results were generally good, and thus renewals were soft with average
rates down a couple of points.

Bloomberg Transcript

In our EMEA LatAm division excess of loss contracts were up double digits, driven by
liability and motor business, while proportional business was up closer to the mid-single
digit range, in line such as motor, property, liability and professional lines. Catastrophe and
A&H lines were relatively flat in EMEA, LatAm. Within our North America division, our total
P&C book excluding A&H experienced high single digit increases in excess of loss
business, and mid-single digit increases on pro rata business, with the strongest increases
in property, professional lines and casualty.
Separately, our A&H book was up in the low single digits. In our global markets division,
which includes global specialty lines and Lloyd's, rates generally responded to recent loss
experience. For example, aviation renewals were up more than 40%, and engineering
was up close to 15%, while other lines were in the low-to-mid single digits.
Overall, we maintain a high level of discipline, focusing on profitability and portfolio
balance. As a result, we reduced premiums in all markets other than the U.S. where we
felt pricing was more adequate. When all is said and done, we expect the January one
renewal premiums to come in about 10% below expiring volume, but with an improved
price technical ratio, even as we shrank the property cat portfolio to achieve that better
balance and lower volatility.
Looking forward, we expect the Japanese cat market which renews on April 1 to respond
positively to the high loss activity that we saw in the last two years. In our experience,
Japan has been responsible market. We expect substantial rate increases to reflect an
expectation of greater frequency and severity of events going forward and improved
returns on risk. We intend to manage our exposures and take advantage of improved
pricing to start generating an adequate return on the 2019 investment we've made in this
key market.
As to mid-year Florida renewals, there's still a long way off, but certainly we would expect
double-digit increases with higher rates on treaties that have delivered meaningful
adverse development on prior year losses. In all upcoming renewals, our goals will be the
same, to improve the quality and profitability of our book of business, support the best
accounts and strengthen Axis' risk positioning with clients and brokers.

FINAL

Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2020-01-30

Over the last couple of years, we've clarified our Reinsurance strategy and strengthened
service standards and execution. We're very pleased with the recent improvements in our
customer engagement surveys, and intend to continue advancing our leadership in global
reinsurance. Excuse me. I apologize. So market conditions are highly encouraging. But as I
noted earlier, despite strong increases to date many lines are still not at attractive levels,
and it will take one, two or even more cycles of renewal increases before we see a
uniformly healthy and sustainable market. Thus, we now believe that rate increases will
last through 2020 and very likely longer. That will be excellent for Axis, as we expect we'll
be able to generate strong profitable growth under the anticipated market conditions
given our positioning in our core markets.
Moreover, as the bulk of the required exits of unprofitable business is now behind us, that
new business generation should begin to flow more visibly to our top-line.

Bloomberg Transcript

Before I conclude, I'd like to return to our underwriting performance of this year, and the
path that we must achieve -- we must take to achieve required profitability. As we
discussed with you, we believe, we must deliver combined ratios in the mid-90s to deliver
adequate ROEs. Notwithstanding our full year combined ratio in 2019, we see a clear path
to delivering on this target given all the remediation work that we've carried out in recent
years.
Our financial results in 2019 reflect the portfolio we wrote in 2018, but we're starting 2020
with a very different book of business, better price, smaller limits and more balance, with
much less runoff business and catastrophe exposure. We believe that absent unusual loss
activity, we can deliver accident year ex-cat loss ratios that are 2 to 3 points lower. And our
mean expected cat losses should come in 1 to 2 point lower given the reductions in our
loss curves. We've also eliminated a large amount of high commission business, which
combined with a different mix of business should reduce our average acquisition expense
by 1 to 2 point. We know there are no guarantees in the world of insurance, but everything
we see in our book and in our markets makes us increasingly confident that we can deliver
on our goals, and our team is determined to make it happen.
And with that, let's please open the line for questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). The first
question comes from Amit Kumar of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks -- thanks and good morning. I've got a few questions. It's just starting with the
insurance segment. I know you talked about overall, underlying XX improvement. How
Page 8 of 19



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2020-01-30

should we think about insurance segment underlying XX? And maybe also talk about the
discussion on kind of the medium-sized losses as well as drag from non-renewed
business.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

FINAL

That's fair. Peter, do you want to take us through that?

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Yes,

A - Peter Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. So, Amit, your question was specifically around insurance. And if I think about
insurance, one of the best ways to look at it, might be just to look at the full year. In the full
year 2019, for insurance, the ex-cat loss ratio was at 57 and that full year has what I would
consider to be a pretty good result of mid-sized losses. I know we've talked about that in
the past and to me those are losses that are in the book and they'll be there to go
forward. So if I started at 57, one of the things that we know is hitting that is the amount of
remediation we did in the insurance book that, that 57 includes about two points of hit
from the exited lines of business. So, if I look just year- -- if I look at the year without the
exited businesses, it actually ran at a 55.
We do think the exited businesses will still hurt us by half a point as we go into 2020. So, if
I'm starting at a 57 for insurance, I think that can come down by 1.5 point just from the
exited businesses and then if I look at the positive impact of rate and trend which we got
for the full year there last year and we're continuing to see as we enter 2020, I think that
is at least another 1 point to 1.5 point and then we look at underwriting actions that we've
taken, where we've canceled business especially in our facilities book. That will help the
ex-cat loss ratio as well as the acquisition ratio and so I can see us really getting to the
insurance group running in that mid-50, that mid-50s type ex-cat loss ratio.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. That's actually very helpful. But the second question I had was, Albert, you talked
about the opportunities. And I guess you're faced with an interesting conundrum where
pricing is going to go up materially at 41 and 61, but you're trying to bring down PMLs. How
should we, -- I know it's early days, how should we think about 41 and 61 PMLs versus 11
2019 PMLs?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I want to be clear, Amit. There's no conundrum here. It's all about managing our
exposures down and the business that we're going to keep being more balanced and
more profitable and that's exactly what we're working towards. I think with regard to the
Japanese market, I think it's less of reducing PMLs there, and just making sure that we're
in the right layers of the towers and making sure that we're adequately priced. I think in
Florida, my expectation is that the Florida market will be highly disrupted in the mid years.
As you know, there's a lot of M&A, there's a lot of change, there's a lot of concern. I
Page 9 of 19



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2020-01-30

expect there will be opportunities. And again, it will be important for us to support to the
best accounts. I expect that there will be some business that we will get off from. But at
the end of the day, what I can be sure of is that the July 1 portfolio will be much more
balanced and much better price than it was before.

FINAL

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Okay. Last question and I'll stop. Q1 to-date any thoughts on aviation losses, coronavirus
disruption or any other losses out there which could potentially impact Q1 numbers?
Thanks.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I mean, I'm going to give you my entire risk section of the 10K. I think that we don't have
anything unusual in terms of losses that wouldn't be reasonably expected within our
assumed attritional loss ratios. I know that there are a lot of questions around the
Coronavirus and let me address that right now.

Bloomberg Transcript

We certainly, in our A&H book write a range of business and within that range of business,
most of it would not be exposed to the Coronavirus. There are two places, where that
might be. One is we do write a book across the world of excess mortality. Those are
generally for life companies. Those are generally based on the entire population and
require a meaningful increase above the annual average expectations and those
attachment points are relatively remote. So, we do not believe that, certainly at this point
in time, with the data that we're seeing, that this would be an effective portfolio.
We do have one exposure which we acquired as part of our corporate citizenship. We
own a $10 million World Health Organization pandemic response bond, and that's $10
million, we bought it in 2017. It starts to pay out at 250 fatalities and runs out at 2500
fatalities. So, that's a bond that we've identified. There are currently about 130 fatalities.
So, clearly you're getting close to starting to have a loss on that bond, but at the end of
the day, it's $10 million and it's a limited amount in the context of our overall portfolio. As
of now, we are not aware of any other exposures or any other losses in our portfolio that
would not be reasonably expected in our attritional loss ratios.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. That's very helpful. I'll stop here. Thanks for the answers.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

One more comment. One more comment. One more comment, Amit. I have got my
lawyer in my room. So, I want to be clear. We will not update this on a weekly or daily
basis. I'm just giving you that information now.

The next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes, thanks. So a couple of quick ones here for you all. But I am just curious. Property lines,
obviously, you've been tricking a lot, will that continue to shrink in 2020, your property
exposures? You continue to try to mitigate volatility? Or will you see opportunities there at
some point?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

So the first that I want to do is I want to give a shout-out to our teams because they did an
incredible job over the last two years of changing the book. There is some change, but it's
change that we've already identified. So for example at the 1-1 renewals, there were a
handful of facilities which we notified cancellation and we've already pre-advised that
there are some facilities that are renewing through the first half of the year where we've
already told people that we would not be renewing them.

Bloomberg Transcript

So it's already anticipated, but it's not fully captured in the 2019 numbers that we've given
you. So, I would say that there is still some top-line reduction to be seen in the property
book, but the good news from our perspective is we've identified all of those. We've
already taken action, so we've gotten clear visibility of how we're moving forward on
property.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. And then with respect to your Lloyds business, I just maybe a couple of questions
on that. One, what is your capacity going to look like for 2020? And what do you expect
out of that business? And then also just your perspective on the Lloyd's market? I know
there's been some additional stamp capacity that was given out. Do we expect the same
type of rate and price discipline there through 2020 and maybe to '21?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Right. So let me address our numbers. So, we expect modest growth, not much growth
because that Lloyd's book is where we've had some of the largest corrections, but no
issue there. I think the interesting thing is with regard to the market. The market and the
leadership of the Lloyd's market is very clear, that it is going to continue to push for more
improvements in the market. I don't have to list for you. You know it better than I do. The
number of companies that have shut down, exited facilities, reduced limits. So this is not
one or two people in the market saying we want to improve our book. This is a uniform
approach to improvement in the market, I expect that will continue.
Certainly everything that I hear in the Lloyd's market is that it will continue. There were a
handful of syndicates, absolutely that were granted increased limits, but to be fair those
were the markets that you would want to see growing. Markets that have historically
demonstrated top quartile performance, strong discipline. So to your point Brian, I don't

Page 11 of 19



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td

believe that the increased capacity granted to those syndicates should be viewed as
troubling development in the market.

FINAL

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Thanks and then just one last one for you, I'm just curious. Given all the changes
that we made et cetera, et cetera. What do you think the kind of run rate underlying kind
of return on equity of your company is now given current interest rates?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, we have been targeting for a couple of years now. Minimum double-digit returns in
the 10%, 11 plus range. Admittedly, we haven't reached it. But we think that everything that
we've done, still gives us more confidence today more than ever, that we can reach those
low double-digit returns.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes, but I guess given the pricing environment that we've got right now which two years
ago, I don't think it was anticipated. Wouldn't have been maybe better than that 10%, 11%?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. I was giving you actually more, I was giving you more calendar year estimates. I think if
you look at what pricing is. I would say that the pricing right now. And again, some lines are
good. Some lines are great. Some lines are not good enough. But I would say on average,
it's in the low-teens return on capital from a pricing perspective.

Q - Brian Meredith

The next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. One I guess small ball question. It looks like on a sequential basis, the Japanese
PMLs rose. And I guess I was a little surprised to see that because the primary Cat
renewals are 4-1. So. I was so hoping you could talk about what was going on underneath
there?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

It's a very simple. It's the year-end covers. We changed the re-insurance and retro
numbers that we acquired. So this is just book based on the new Cat reinsurance and
Page 12 of 19



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2020-01-30

retro covers that we have in place.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay, that's helpful. One quick question with regard to first-quarter capacities. Is there still
exposure to Australian losses, the wildfire losses or is that all captured in the fourth
quarter, assuming no new fires.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

No. Our read of those treaties are that many of them include hours clauses. So, there are
new hours periods that are going to be coming in, in the first quarter. So, it's very possible
that the market will experience some bushfire losses in the first quarter. But then I think
it's too early to tell.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, and then I think this was an accounting question, but we've seen rate increases
accelerate over the course of 2019. When we look at the quarterly progression in 2020,
should we assume that the rate trend gap would similarly expand over the course of the
year as those accelerating rate increases are earned in?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Hey, Meyer, this is Peter. Yes. Every time Albert talks about the rate environment, he's
really talking about gross rate written premium in that particular quarter. So, it takes the
following four quarters to see that earn-in, so we should see acceleration through 2020
when we think about that.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, perfect. That sounds great. Thanks so much.

The next question comes from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. My first question goes back to the cat losses for the year. Can
you maybe tell us how much in excess of normalized or expectations they were?

A - Peter Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

First, I'd say, it's good question. We really don't give guidance and so, we really never
shout out what our cat load would be, but the one thing that I would say, even though I'm
not giving guidance. As we look at the portfolio that we have today, especially with all the
changes that we've made even going into this 1-1 and especially when I look at the net
PML reductions, especially in the 105 part of the curve, we actually look at our mean
modeled expected cat loss ratio really improving from what we've seen over the last

Page 13 of 19



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2020-01-30

couple of years and where it's been and you can see that in the net PML. So, I would take
what we saw in '19 and as something that we should see come down as we go forward.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Beyond the 1.1 to 2 points that Albert had called out in the prepared remarks?

A - Peter Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Well, as I look at the cat loss ratio over the last seven years, it was about 9 points. If I look
over a longer period, 7.5 obviously last year, but I do think that as I look into 2020, we
should be coming down from that 7.5 by a good 1 to 2 points. Which would actually be
down materially, from the 9 point that I see over the last seven years as an average.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

You'll understand our reticence to project cat. I mean, it's the most unpredictable of all
line.

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, what we can tell you is that when we look at the cat curves and we report to you a lot
on PMLs, but when we're thinking about a year, where we're thinking more about the
aggregate annual loss curves. And when we look at those, we've taken them down to
several points over the last three years and we've taken it down, just this year alone -- the
AAL curve around the mean and one in five, 1 to 2 points alone just this year. And so, I
think using the five-year average in my own mind is overstating it, because on the one
hand '17 and '18 were horrendous years and they were with very different cat curves.
So I would argue that we're optimistic that we can see meaningful improvement in our cat
results and I would point you to the insurance book this year, with a smaller property book
and that frankly different manage. You're already starting to see some evidence of a
lower cat loss experience in the insurance book. But again, it's impossible to talk about cat
on an annual basis. We're really talking about modeled losses and averages over the year.

A - Peter Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes, and again looking at our PMLs, you can look at the one and 250 PML from the third
quarter to the fourth quarter is down about 30%. And that wasn't just a 1 and 250 move. It
was through the curve.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Right. Okay, and then my next question goes to the reinsurance segments underlying your
accident year loss ratio. So I think it was, what, 69%, you called about 5 points of crop
losses there. So if I compare the 4Q '18, I think you called out like 8 points of extraordinary
items back then and that was kind of 69 as well. So I'm just trying to figure out what the
other 3 to 4 points of maybe headwinds were this quarter or how should I think of the
attritional loss rate in the re-entered segment?

A - Peter Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}
Page 14 of 19



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td

FINAL

Yes, that's a good question. And as Albert said, especially given our business, we really
don't give guidance and I would note that Matt mentioned at the outset, we undertake no
obligation to update or revise publicly these forward-looking statements and these
statements involve risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could be affected by a
bunch of factors.
Having said that, if I look at the full year reinsurance, which is probably the best way to
look at it. That's running at a 64 and when I look at that 64 ex-cat loss ratio, the agriculture
contributed almost 1.5 point to that and I'm not going to do a let's exclude mid-side
losses. So, we'll keep all the losses, mid-size losses in there. But that was really an
extraordinary event on our U.S. crop business. So, if I adjust a little bit for that and then I
know, we also expect to see the benefit from a number of underwriter attack actions
taken in 2019, as Steve Arora came in, brought in a new team and they really reshaped
the book during 2019 and that actually fall onto 1-1 as we saw the -- as we're going to see
a decrease in that GWP. We do think that that 64 should be able to come down to a low
60s type ex-cat loss ratio on a run rate basis.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

The next question comes from Joshua Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yes, good morning everybody. So listen to the prepared commentary, I think Albert you
said that, the new book of business should help to lower the loss ratio by maybe 200 to
300 basis points next year. I don't think that was a forecast. You were just sort of giving
some sense of proportion. But when I listened to the price increases you spoke about,
there were plenty of double-digit rate increases and certainly high single digit rate
increases. It leads me to be concerned about the back book to some extent. Can you talk
a little bit, when we see the 10-K, what the development is going to look like for years
2015 through 2018, particularly excluding the cat elements of the losses?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

So let me -- let me refer to the increases. I think that in many cases, we're making
assumptions. So two things. One, the pricing is on a gross basis, not a net basis. And as I
mentioned earlier, some of those lines, we have a high quota shares. So our average rate
increase on net basis is a little lower. It's not much, but a little lower than the gross basis.
But more importantly, in those lines of business where we are seeing the biggest
increases in terms of property, in terms of liability, and some of the D&O lines, we're
pricing in and reserving in substantial increases in loss trends not because we are
concerned about our back book, but because we recognize like a lot of people in the
industry that there's more uncertainty around a number of these loss trends and we
would rather be more prudent in booking a number in 2020 or 2019.

Page 15 of 19

FINAL

And if it turns out that we -- that it's better, we will be very happy to release reserves as
we have in the past. We just don't believe that we should be overly aggressive or
optimistic in setting these loss estimates as we go forward. But if your answer is given
that your loss -- that your pricing increases appear so strong and that your projected
improvement in loss ratio is more modest, does that mean that you're taking the cautious
approach to reserving going forward? The answer is yes, we're absolutely taking a
cautious approach going forward, just as we have in the past.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And can you give any descriptors around how the 2015 to 2018 liability reserves will look
when we see the triangles?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Look, we give you some information on a quarterly basis. I hope you'll understand that,
the first triangle will be in the 10K. There'll be other triangles more detailed in '18. We have
a process whereby the 10-K gets reviewed and gets approved, that has not happened
yet and I'm reticent to provide guidance on what the 10-K will say prior to having it
reviewed through our normal processes. But that should come out shortly and you'll have
the information.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, and given where the stock currently trades, can you talk a little bit about the
balance between market opportunity and putting capital to work in growth versus
repurchasing your own stock?

A - Peter Wilson

{BIO 4267902 <GO>}

Hey, Josh, this is Peter, I'll take that. First thing I'd say is our capital position at the end of
the year is very strong. We feel very confident about our capital position. I know there's
been some questions, we come out of '17 with HIMM, the purchase of Novae and where
we sit at year-end 2019, we feel really good about where our capital position is. Having
said that, where we're seeing the markets today and where we're seeing opportunity?
We really are looking at putting most of our capital right now towards organic growth for
good opportunity. If that doesn't materialize and we don't see good market opportunities.
Obviously, we'll look at the other aspects we can do for capital management. But right
now we feel very solid balance sheet at year end and we're looking forward to growing in
some good markets as we head into 2020.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

The next question comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. My first question -- Thanks. Hi, Albert is going back to, Albert, some of
your commentary. When you were talking about some of your insurance line, you said that
you did not fully reflect price exceeding trends for some of your liability lines. Can you just
give us a sense of where you're booking trend to? And where you see it? And I guess, it
goes back to Josh's question. When you're thinking about the two to three points of
improvement. How you kind of see loss trend developing for some of those longer tail
liability lines, like what you booked that in the fourth quarter and kind of an outlook for
2020?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

No, when you look at our longer tail lines, I mean the trends can be anywhere from 4% to
7%. And so that's generally it. But again, I think from a reserving perspective, I don't think
that we would be reflecting the net price increase versus the loss trends, I think that. No, I
don't think, I know that we will be booking, more of an uncertainty factor in the loss ratios
as we go forward and then with a little bit more visibility. Obviously, our actuaries will have
more comfort. But you are hearing everything that we're hearing and we think it's
inappropriate to assume the most optimistic assumptions. But back to your earlier
question, our long tail lines trends are anywhere from 4% to 7%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, and then you mentioned some good pricing momentum in the reinsurance market
at January 1, and seems like you also think that will continue as we go to mid-year. In terms
of Axis's own out bounds reinsurance purchasing. Have you guys changed any -- how
you're purchasing your reinsurance in 2020 in response to higher pricing that you would
have to pay on that coverage?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That's a very good question. Do you want to start with here? So I think that we have a
number of contracts that we renew, across the entire year. Obviously, you -- we spoke
earlier in this call about some of our regional PMLs being affected by differences in
contract structures that we did in our retro book. So for example, we found aggregate
coverage to be much more expensive this year. So, we decided to change the structure
to include more regional structures, more top and drops. Other things so that we could
be more efficient in the purchase of our reinsurance.
As we go through each of our major renewals, we have a big property -- insurance
property, property cat buy in May. We are currently reviewing all of that and what I will say
is in the last couple of years, I've been incredibly impressed with our risk funding and
seated re-people, they've been -- the analytics that they've brought to the game. The vis
-- the transparency, the engagement with the actuaries with the underwriters. We will be
watching this literally to the last minute, evaluating all options and then making sure that
we select and execute on the best option for the company.

Page 17 of 19



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity

FINAL

So we -- all I can tell you is, we were very open-minded about making changes as we go
at every renewal to make sure that we optimize the book at every point in time. I will say
that there are going to have to be some changes, because the book is different and I
think that as we reflect a different book, our needs are going to be different. And, so we
fully expect to keep our ceded re-people very busy, but we're very optimistic that we will
get great terms or at least as good a term, as we could get in the market in the upcoming
renewals.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful and one just quick number question relative to the $100 million of
saves. Where do you guys stand at the end of 2019, so we can think about what's left for
2020?

A - Peter Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes, so at least. We're well tasked to get that. So we actually had $73 million in run rate by
the end of 2019. However, I would say that my commentary where I talked about where
we think we have to guide our G&A ratio for the next couple of years is really important. I
think when we set out even our target of saving the $100 million, 2 years ago, we were
not anticipating as much remediation in our books as we did do.

Bloomberg Transcript

So our premiums are a bit lower than we thought at that time, yet we're still committed to
those G&A ratios. So while I don't anticipate any major programs or anything, we continue
to look at every way we can to bring down our cost through other efficiencies that we're
getting throughout the organization.
