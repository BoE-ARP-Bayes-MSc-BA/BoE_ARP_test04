{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to MAPFRE's first-half 2011
results presentation. As usual, I'll give an overview of the results and the main business
development and later Mr. Lubeli will explain the financials in greater detail and present
the European embedded value figures for 2010. Finally, we will take your questions.
Please move to slide three. MAPFRE was once again capable of delivering growth
continuous [ph] funds under management and profits in an environment that is clearly
quite complex. Premiums and revenues grew above 6%, funds under management grew
nearly 15%, the combined ratio was broadly stable despite substantial catastrophe claims
and the net result grew nearly 9%, while earnings per share went up nearly 6%.
Moving on to next slide, here you can see the highlights of the first half. In Non-Life an
excellent development of the international business and success of the sales initiatives
implemented in Spain in the Second Quarter. In Life a growth of the international business
and noteworthy improvement in Spain in the Second Quarter.
Excellent trend in the loss experience, which has mitigated the impact of the natural
catastrophes in Asia, the USA, Australia and New Zealand. As we informed you in the First
Quarter, we formalized the agreement with Caja Madrid Cibeles for the transfer of Banco
de Servicios Financieros Caja Madrid-MAPFRE and the acquisition of the 12.5%
shareholding in MAPFRE International by MAPFRE.

FINAL

Finally, this last month we have start up the joint venture with Banco do Brasil and during
the period we have registered an increase in equity of nearly EUR1.2b, which means a 15%
increase during the first half due to the results, the scrip dividend plan and the agreement
with Banco do Brasil, together with a new decrease in debt levels.
In slide five you can see our strategic alliance during this period. The Brazilian supervisory
body granted the approval for the establishment of the joint venture with Banco do Brasil.
At June of 2011 Seguros Participacoes and Group Segurador MAPFRE started to operate
jointly under the name Grupo Segurador Do Brasil & MAPFRE (sic; see presentation).
In the Second Quarter MAPFRE and Euler Hermes have signed a memorandum of
understanding for the establishment of a strategic alliance aimed to jointly developing
their credit and surety insurance business in Spain, Portugal and Latin America.
As a result of this alliance both groups will hold a 50% shareholding in a joint venture
which will integrate their existing businesses in the aforementioned markets. The resulting
company will have a premium volume of approximately EUR200m, according to 2010
figures. Then this means ranking first or second in most of the markets covered by the
agreement. This joint venture is expected to start operating by the end of 2011, subject to
the completion of the required regulatory approvals.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the next slide is a breakdown of the number (inaudible) items in 2010 and 2011. The
results of the insurance business grew over 11%. In both years they contained large
earthquake losses to financial gains. Even adjusting for these they continued to grow
nearly 10%, underscoring the resilience our insurance business.
Non-insurance losses have decreased almost to zero, providing evidence of our stated
intention to focus on our insurance operations. Taking into account all non-recurring items
the results are slightly lower than those of the previous year, a performance that can be
viewed as satisfactory in the present business environment. The decrease in earnings per
share reflects these, as well as being part of the capital increases derived from the
reinvestment of dividends.
On slide number seven there a some breakdown of the main figures. As we mentioned
before, debt levels have fallen again and are now below EUR2b, while equity has
increased. Total equity including minority interest has grown considerably after the
transaction with Banco do Brasil. Therefore, our leverage ratios have decreased
substantially and are quite comfortable for our rating levels.
I will now hand it over to Mr. Lubeli who will comment on our financials in detail.

Luigi Lubeli
Thank you, Esteban. Good afternoon, to all those following us today on this conference
call. With no further delay let us move to slide number nine, where we find a customary
breakdown of premiums and profits by region.

FINAL

As was to be expected on account of the growth differentials, the weight of the foreign
business continued to go up and now stands at about 60% of total aggregated
premiums. The merge [ph] happens in terms of insurance profits, where Spain contributes
60% of the total result, as was the case in March.
On the following slide, number 10, we have the summary of business growth and the
inter-annual change in premiums. The picture is broadly the same as it was in March.
Growth has come primarily from Latin America, with increases of 19% in Non-Life and 22%
in Life. Brazil remained the main contributor and brought in 14% of MAPFRE's total
consolidated premiums.
Among the main drivers of such growth are the first-time consolidation of the JV with
Banco do Brasil as well as the growth of the motor, general insurance and life lines as a
result of new sales initiatives and distribution agreements.

Bloomberg Transcript

Growth was also remarkable at MAPFRE ASISTENCIA, thanks to the travel insurance
business written through INSUREANDGO and organic growth in Latin America and Turkey.
MAPFRE RE also grew, reflecting a successful renewal campaign and new business in
Europe and LatAm. And MAPFRE GLOBAL RISKS, on the back of strong growth in the
property and fire lines, saw growth [ph], especially in Latin America.
MAPFRE INTERNACIONAL, conversely, which was growing about 8% in March, showed a
small decrease due mainly to the depreciation of the US dollar and the slowdown of sales
through FINIBANCO in Portugal. MAPFRE VIDA, although still decreasing, turned in a much
better performance than in March. Let us move on to the following slide to see that in
greater detail.
Here we have the breakdown of premiums by distribution channel in Spain. Agent sales
performed quite well in the Life business, recording a volume in line with the First Quarter
as sales targets were achieved. The comparison with 2010 is flatter by the fact that in the
Second Quarter of last year some sales campaigns were cancelled due to competition by
banks through deposit rates.
In the Non-Life business agent sales show a slight fall, pretty much in line with what we
saw in March, coming mainly from the Motor and Commercial lines. Nevertheless, it must
be said that Motor sales were up 0.1%, which is not much but compares against the 1.7%
fall for the market at large, which means that our market share has continued to grow.
Household sales also were up way above market average, about twice as much. And on a
quarterly comparison Commercial insurance sales were up against 2010.
Life Bancassurance sales also grew in the Second Quarter against the same period of
2010, reducing considerably the year-on-year fall compared to what we saw in March.
Non-Life Bancassurance sales accelerated their growth compared to the First Quarter,
thanks to an increasing contribution from CatalunyaCaixa, which brought in premiums
from -- for EUR18.5m.

FINAL

On the next slide we can see the development of technical results. The combined ratio is
broadly in line with the figure for the same period of 2010; it's just slightly higher. More
specifically, if -- I'll make an aggregate comment on the total figures, give you an
explanation by Company. The loss ratio deceased at all direct insurance and global
business subsidiaries and that compensated for the impact of catastrophe and weatherrelated claims in MAPFRE RE and MAPFRE INTERCIONAL.
The expense ratio went up because of the impact of distribution network reorganization
costs, (inaudible) and the rising VAT at MAPFRE FAMILIAR in Spain and high acquisition
expenses of MAPFRE AMERICA, MAPFRE GLOBAL RISKS and MAPFRE RE and MAPFRE
ASISTENCIA.
If we compare it to the figures of at March the expense ratio has gone up at MAPFRE
AMERICA due to expenses connected to the start up of the JV with Banco do Brasil. And
MAPFRE INTERNACIONAL, due to the expansion of the network and higher acquisition
costs in Turkey, as well as expenses arising from weather-related claims in the US.
MAPFRE GLOBAL RISKS, MAPFRE RE and MAPFRE ASISTENCIA also saw their expense
ratios go up due to higher acquisition costs.

Bloomberg Transcript

The loss to ratio has gone up at MAPFRE FAMILIAR, especially in the Property and Burial
lines, where it was exceptionally low in the First Quarter. And in MAPFRE GLOBAL RISKS,
due to a higher frequency of non-catastrophic claims. Such increases were more than
compensated for by the lower incidence of weather-related and catastrophe claims at
MAPFRE INTERNACIONAL and MAPFRE RE.
On the next slide we find the Non-Life account. As I already mentioned in previous slides,
premium growth reflects the development of the international and reinsurance
businesses and the difficult environment in Spain where, nonetheless, MAPFRE's market
share continues to grow in Motor and Home insurance. I've already commented upon the
loss and expense ratio in detail. So we'll skip that.
Clearly, the figures reflect the consolidation of INSUREANDGO and Banco do Brasil
Seguros, BB Seguros. And compared to last year we see a fall in the net financial and
other non-technical income due mainly to lower realization gains, basically, less than half
of what they were a year ago.
On the next slide we find the Life account. Here the premiums development mainly
reflects different schedules for sales campaigns in Spain compared to 2010, offset by a
very good performance of the agents channel in the Second Quarter and, as I said, also
the Bancassurance channel performed better in this period. And this was complemented
by business growth in Latin America.
Generation of the underwriting and financial result reflects this, affected clearly by the
EUR139 million recognized upon the establishment of the JV with Banco do Brasil. Here
also the figures are affected by a strategic transaction. In this case it is the inclusion of
insurance operations of CatalunyaCaixa and, once again, BB Seguros in Brazil.

FINAL

On slide 15 we have the results from other business activities. Here the operating
revenues and expenses show a fall. That's due to the fact that MAPFRE QUAVITAE was
reclassified as an activity held for sale.
The net financial income, as was the case in March, includes a loss of EUR40.8 million as a
result of the sale of our shareholding in Banco de Servicios Financieros Caja MadridMAPFRE. And this small amount that we see in minority interests also is what is left from
Banco de Servicios Financieros Caja Madrid-MAPFRE and that was the same figure -- that
is the same figure as in March 2011.
On slide 16 we have the development of net results by subsidiary. The picture is pretty
much in line with what we saw in March. MAPFRE AMERICA clearly stands out because of
the gains recognized after the granting of the authorization to create the joint venture
with Banco do Brasil. The contraction in MAPFRE FAMILIAR is mainly due to the larger
elevation gains which were recorded in 2010. If we exclude them -- if we were to exclude
them in both years net income would grow about EUR25m, which is around a 14%
increase.

Bloomberg Transcript

The significant fall in MAPFRE INTERNACIONAL is due to weather-related and catastrophe
claims in the US. MAPFRE RE also suffered a fall due to earthquake-related claims primarily
in Japan and New Zealand. And on the other hand, MAPFRE GLOBAL RISKS, which in 2010
was strongly affected by the Chilean earthquake, shows a strong improvement in 2011
and that's basically by virtue of comparison. MAPFRE EMPRESAS has a very strong
performance this year and that's due to lower claims frequency and severity as well as
cost containment.
On slide 17 we have the bottom line. Mr. Tejera already commented upon the
development of results. Results include the signing of the agreement with Banco do Brasil
in the Second Quarter, which has an impact on pre-tax results, on the tax rate and on
minority interests. We also have the impact of the restatement of financial accounts in
Venezuela, as we've been seeing for a few quarters now. And on the amount of taxes we
also have a positive impact from the sale of the shareholding in Banco de Servicios
Financieros. That's the same as it was in March.
Slide 18 we find the balance sheet, where we have a clear increase of the figures, both
compared to June of the previous year and to December. And that's due to the
consolidation of the joint venture with Banco do Brasil, of the insurance operations of
CatalunyaCaixa and of INSUREANDGO. There are other noteworthy developments.
The impact of the depreciation of the US dollar and most of the Latin American
currencies, which reduces the value of the assets there. We see, as was the case in
March, lower cash balances that's basically because we have invested part of those
balances in longer-dated assets. And clearly that will be known to everyone on the call;
we've had a negative impact of risk premia on the market value of the investments. After
the close, on July 12, we have retired the bonds that were issued in 2001 for their full
amount.

FINAL

On slide 19 we have the changes in equity. There's a large increase compared to the
close of 2010 and it's much larger than what we saw in March. That includes the result for
the first half, the negative impact, as I was mentioning before, of the volatility of financial
markets and risk premia on the value of the investments which, as usual, is partly offset by
shadow accounting.
As I was mentioning before, we have the depreciation of US dollars -- the US dollar and
Latin American currencies and that leads to negative translation differences. We paid a
dividend. But that was mostly offset, to a large extent I would say, by the Easter
investments through a scrip dividend plan.
And then we have, as a positive element, about EUR1.2 billion coming from the minorities
of Banco do Brasil and that more than compensated for the reduction in minorities
stemming from the purchase of this share of Caja Madrid Cibeles in MAPFRE
INTERNACIONAL.
That on my side concludes the results presentation and I now invite you to open the
European Embedded Value presentation on page three of that document.

Bloomberg Transcript

Overall, the value of the In-Force business grew nearly 16% against 2009. This increase
primarily reflects the inclusion of the Life and Pensions business of CatalunyaCaixa. We
also, for your convenience, provide the figures without such inclusion because, clearly, it
has a strong impact on the variations. Without CatalunyaCaixa the value of the In-Force
and the European embedded value grew 1% and 3% respectively and were driven
primarily by the value of new business.
We see a comparatively faster growth of the EEV3 against 1% and that is as a result of the
fact that changes in assumptions and deviations from estimates, which this year have a
negative impact, tend to have a proportionally higher impact on the value of In-Force than
they do on the ANAV.
The return on embedded value decreased significantly, mainly due to the fact that in
2009 this return was stabled by a significant drop in the cost of the time value of financial
options and guarantees, which then added 16 -- EUR67.3m. This year, on the other hand, it
was negatively affected by higher lapse and lower financial return assumptions.
The present value of new business income fell, due to the focus on Life-Protection
business in 2010 and the competition from banks in savings products. I must say that
2009 was exceptionally good in the agents' channel. As a matter of fact, this year when
we are not yet repeating that figure. There was a slight fall in the value of new business,
which reflected lower sales volumes, higher acquisition expenses and a comparatively
higher weight of unit-linked products, whose effect was mitigated to a large extent by the
greater volume of the Life-Protection business.
It must be noted that, precisely because of the latter of the Life-Protection business, the
value added by new business fell comparatively less than the present value of new

FINAL

business income. And, as can be expected from what I just said, the growth in margin was
driven as well by the Life-Protection business.
On slide number five we have the variation of the main components of the European
embedded value 2010. Here, once again, a distinction must be made between figures
with and without CatalunyaCaixa. If we see figures as they are, as we see them here, the
main driver behind the variations in the ANAV, the present value of the In-Force and the
cost of capital, is the inclusion of the Life and Pensions business of CatalunyaCaixa.
Excluding this, the variations of the present value of the In-Force and the cost of capital
are not material, while the ANAV would show a growth of EUR51m, driven mainly by the
expected return and around EUR100 million in dividends and donations.
The change in the time value of financial options and guarantees is significant in%age
terms. But it is immaterial over the total EEV figure. Nevertheless, this variation was mainly
due to a relaxing in our realized gains in the Banking portfolio and to a fall in interest rates.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide number six we have the breakdown of the 2010 European embedded value by
business line and distribution channel. I've just commented upon the changes on the
ANAV and the time value of financial options and guarantees. So I will not repeat that. The
growth of the present value of the In-Force of the Life business was driven mainly by the
inclusion, once again, of CatalunyaCaixa, as well as by the growing sales of Life-Protection
business in the Bancassurance channel.
Conversely, it fell in the agents' channel as the impact of the changes in assumptions I
referred to previously affected mainly the portfolios of this channel. The fall in the present
value of the In-Force of the Mutual Funds was mainly due to outflows, while the increase in
the case of Pension Funds reflected, once again, the inclusion of the business of
CatalunyaCaixa and the value added by new business.
On the next slide, number seven, we show you the European embedded value figures
net of minority interests. These interests increase about EUR160 million if we compare
them to last year's figure and, clearly, once again, this is strongly affected by the inclusion
of the Life and Pensions business of CatalunyaCaixa.
On slide number eight we find the customary roll forward, which breaks down the change
in European embedded value into its main components. We see changes in the model of
EUR41.2m, which are due to the positive impact of the update in the databases that are
used for the valuation of the Life Assurance business. We see large additions and
variation in intangible assets and there should be no surprise that comes from
CatalunyaCaixa, which leads us to -- with the restated business figure for this year.
We have EUR81.2 million negative in changes in assumptions, which are due to the falling
interest rate, which added about EUR41 million as a result of the application of lower
discount rate, a negative amount of about EUR18 million due to the adjustment of
expected investment returns for credit risk, a change in the financial assumptions to
reflect a scenario with lower capital gains and interest rates at which cash flows are

FINAL

invested, with a negative impact of about EUR29m, a positive impact from a better
performance of expenses of about EUR14 million and the use of more severe lapse rate
assumptions, which amounted to a negative effect of EUR80m.
The expected return was EUR80 million and that includes primarily the impact of the
unwinding of the discounts rate, which was EUR39m. And the actual after-tax investment
return on the adjusted net asset value at the beginning of the year net of the cost of
capital, about EUR42m. We have a negative deviation of actual value from expectations
due to a slightly lower than expected profit -- accounting profit and higher than expected
lapse rates.
And, finally, I already spoke about the variation in the time value of financial options and
guarantees and that's increased slightly, which has a negative impact, as a result of the fall
in interest rates and lower capital gains in asset portfolios.
Let us now move to slide number 11 and here we show you the variation in the amount of
margins of the new business written in the year.Â As was explained on slide number
three, the value added by the new business written in the year. As was explained on slide
number three, the value added by the new business grows due to the inclusion of the Life
and Pensions business of CatalunyaCaixa.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we were to exclude this the figure shows a fall, reflecting lower sales volumes, higher
acquisition expenses and a comparatively higher weight of unit-linked products, whose
effect was mitigated it to a large extent by the larger sales of the Life-Protection business.
Once again, the growth in margins was driven by Life-Protection business.
On slide 12, we have the sensitivities; no big changes here. As was the case for many
years, both the value of In-Force and the value added by new business, which is on the
following slide, are most the sensitive to the variations in interest rates and the lapse rate.
Probably no surprise that we've added a new sensitivity to increases in the probability of
default of the fixed income portfolio, which is there for your information.
And that, on my side, I am now handing back the call to Mr. Tejera for the Q&A.

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

{BIO 5933123 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Good afternoon to everybody. I have three questions; one refers on your Life
financial income. I saw that it's a bit volatile quarter by quarter and there was a significant
decrease in the Second Quarter compared to the first one, maybe, I guess, also due to
the less favorable ForEx compared to the First Quarter. But I wonder if there are other
elements and if you can explain us.
Second question regarding -- regards the Baremo. I would like to know if there is a
possibility that the Spanish authority could change composition table in the next future.
And a third question regards your joint venture in Brazil. I would like to know what could be
the impact on a yearly basis of the new joint venture, because I think that you didn't
provide any update since the announcement of the deal in late 2009. Thank you.

A - Luigi Lubeli
Good afternoon, Atanasio, this is Luigi speaking. I may be wrong. But I think that the
decrease -- the volatility you see is due to the fact that in the First Quarter we included
the gain outstanding from the JV with Banco do Brasil. If you exclude that I don't think
there are --

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

{BIO 5933123 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, I don't think it, because this was included in the net other technical reinsurance [ph]
cost in the Life insurance.

A - Luigi Lubeli
You're right. But, actually, you have to understand one thing. And thanks for asking,
because this is a process which we are through. We are progressively updating the
account as we advance in the transaction and we actually reclassified it in financial gains
here. So it's there. It's the EUR139 million are in the EUR319.6 million figure.

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

{BIO 5933123 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Luigi Lubeli
Does it answer your question, Atanasio, on financial income I mean?

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

{BIO 5933123 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Luigi Lubeli
Then, Baremo, I'm afraid no news to report. There is nothing we actually know about
Baremo to tell you at this moment. I know it's something that is -- I think is mostly spoken
about in London these days. But we actually have no news on this side.

And we have given no forecast or outlook on the insights on a yearly basis of Banco do
Brasil. However, if you go to the presentation. And I'll tell you where, on slide 34, you will
find the figures for the first month in terms of premiums and pre-tax results of the JV with
Banco do Brasil. And that's actually the actual figures recognized in the accounts.

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

Thank you. Your next question comes from Federico Salerno. Please ask your question.

Q - Federico Salerno

{BIO 2565091 <GO>}

Yes, good day, everyone. I just want the debt levels. I was curious to know whether you
plan to reduce the debt to assets or debt to equity further from these levels, or what your
policy's going to be like.

A - Luigi Lubeli
Hi, Federico. Well, actually, the policy has been quite consistent through time, I would say.
As we have been in the position of paying down debt, we've done so. This time actually it
was a scheduled maturity. The debt matured and we decided to retire it. As you may
imagine, this is not an ideal movement to issue that if you're a Spanish institution. So we
actually thought we -- it would be best to retire it. And as cash becomes available that
possibly be most likely a course of action that we'll take. Am I answering your question,
Federico?

Thank you. You next question comes from Juan Canovas. Please ask your question.

Q - Juan Canovas

{BIO 15915647 <GO>}

Hi, Luigi. I have a couple of questions. One, could you quantify the launch costs of VERTI
and also the ones you have mentioned on the joint venture with Banco do Brasil?
And also, on the joint venture with Banco do Brasil, I don't exactly follow. You report the
EUR139 million gain, used to be EUR180m. Is there a compensation effect in the Second
Quarter?
And, finally, the Euler Hermes transaction. Could we expect any adjustment gains? Last
time you reported premiums on pre-insurance [ph], you had EUR125m. I don't know
whether that has come down. But it appears that your business in that region is a bit
larger than that of Euler Hermes. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Luigi Lubeli
Hi, Juan. Let's see. I can only partly answer your first question because the figures for
Banco do Brasil are not public. I can tell you that a large extent of the increase that you've
seen -- to a large extent the increase that you've seen in the expense ratio in this quarter
comes from that. And that's the most I can tell you. Those of VERTI should be provided on
slide 23. And we give them together with the expenses of the organization of the
distribution network. And they are EUR24 million in total.
Going to your second question, that was actually part of my answer to the previous
question --

Q - Juan Canovas

{BIO 15915647 <GO>}

I'm sorry.

A - Luigi Lubeli
-- by Atanasio Pantarrotas. No, it's all right, it's all right.
This is a very complex transaction which involves many companies and many portfolios
and many assets. And in addition to that we found ourselves with the introduction of IFRSs
in Brazil for the first time. The most honest way of putting it is that we are making way, in
the sense we first recognized the items -- based on the available information on the First
Quarter we recognized the transaction, what we could recognize of the transaction at that
time. Then the JV has actually gone live.

Page 11 of 16



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2011-07-22

And then -- and that has involved a large number of accounting movements. And they
have led to, for instance, the reduction in these realized gains. IFRSs themselves allow for
a certain number of adjustments during the first year after a JV is originally recognized in
the accounts. I wonder if this answers your question.

FINAL

Q - Juan Canovas

{BIO 15915647 <GO>}

Yes, fantastic. Yes.

A - Luigi Lubeli
And then can you please repeat your last question, because I'm not sure I actually
understood it?

Q - Juan Canovas

{BIO 15915647 <GO>}

My question was whether we could expect any capital gain on the Euler Hermes joint
venture, given that the last time you reported premiums in grade insurance you had
EUR125 million premiums, which appears to be more than half of the combined premiums
you reported.

A - Luigi Lubeli

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, I'll -- Jesus will take that call -- that question, because he seems to be more
conversant than me in this.

A - Jesus Amadori Carrillo

{BIO 17699282 <GO>}

Hi, Juan, this is Jesus. This transaction has just been announced and it involves, as is the
case when you have many, many companies in Latin America, several corporate
transactions in many countries. So we cannot comment on that at this stage.

Yes, sorry. I was just wondering if you can elaborate a bit about the information that has
come in rumor. You have invested close to EUR300 million in bank [ph]. And I wanted to
know if that has been done through the -- at the holding level or at the subsidiaries level?

Okay, thank you. That's all the information I needed, thank you.

A - Luigi Lubeli
Sorry. But just a clarification. When you say (inaudible), I'm sorry, it's not actually right.
Because they mention MAPFRE as having invested EUR300m. But the fact is that MAPFRE
SA, which is the Company that we represent, has only invested EUR160m. And the rest
has been invested by the foundation through (inaudible).

Hi, afternoon. I think it's a very simple question. I'm just struggling, to be honest, with
some of these moving parts in the embedded value. I think all I'd be interested in hearing
is, for CatalunyaCaixa, how much of that year-end embedded value relates to
CatalunyaCaixa?

A - Luigi Lubeli

Bloomberg Transcript

All right, Michael, let me see. Good afternoon, first. If you -- by difference is about
EUR466m.

Q - Michael Broom

{BIO 1868182 <GO>}

So 400 -- so that item on slide eight, the EUR466m, that is the impact on the year-end
embedded value from CatalunyaCaixa. So I don't have to -- I guess my problem -because I didn't quite understand what the EUR350.2 million negative [ph] --

A - Luigi Lubeli
It's goodwill.

Q - Michael Broom

{BIO 1868182 <GO>}

-- was.

A - Luigi Lubeli
It's goodwill, net of liabilities.

Q - Michael Broom

{BIO 1868182 <GO>}

On CatalunyaCaixa?

A - Luigi Lubeli
Indeed.

FINAL

Okay. Maybe I'll take this offline -- yes, okay, I'm not sure I quite understand what's going
on there. Because the net effect of those two numbers is obviously EUR116 million and
that would seem to be, from the description on -- on the description slide nine you
attribute both of those items to CatalunyaCaixa. So I was wondering whether the
difference between the two was what ends up in the EUR2,490 million at the end of the
year. But from the sounds of it, not.

A - Luigi Lubeli
I actually believe it is, yes. Those you see, the --

Q - Michael Broom

{BIO 1868182 <GO>}

The net of the two amounts ends up in the EUR2,490m.

A - Luigi Lubeli
Exactly.

Q - Michael Broom

{BIO 1868182 <GO>}

Sorry?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Luigi Lubeli
If you take EUR2,309.2m, you add the EUR41.2m, EUR466.6 million and deduct the
EUR350.2m. And that is your starting base. But of course that implicitly means that they
are included in the EUR2,490.5m.

Q - Michael Broom

{BIO 1868182 <GO>}

Yes. Does that not imply that the EUR2,490.5 million includes EUR116.4 million related to
CatalunyaCaixa, rather than EUR466.6m?

A - Luigi Lubeli
Yes, indeed, it includes the net, the net of the two.

Q - Michael Broom

{BIO 1868182 <GO>}

And the 100 and -- let me write that, EUR116.4 million relating to CatalunyaCaixa is -- just
to be clear, that is the amount that appears in the year-end embedded value? Or is that
the amount that was theoretically taken into the embedded value at the date at which you
did the deal?

A - Luigi Lubeli
Yes, it was the intake -- that's why it's a restatement of the (inaudible) figure, because
that's the starting point.

Q - Michael Broom

{BIO 1868182 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. And just to -- so I understand this. So if the contribution to the EV is EUR116m,
CatalunyaCaixa, how does that compare with the payment schedule that you announced
back in whenever it was? Was it early 2010? Off the top of my head I vaguely remember
you paying something like EUR450m. Is that right? Is that EUR450 million payment
comparable with the EUR116 million EV?

A - Luigi Lubeli
Yes, because it's in -- the EUR350 million you see is the goodwill minus precisely the
amounts owed to CatalunyaCaixa. It's like the gross goodwill minus the funding liabilities
that we have.

Q - Michael Broom

{BIO 1868182 <GO>}

Okay. Okay, I think that's clear. Thanks very much.

A - Luigi Lubeli
You're very welcome.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Francisco Riquel. Please ask your question.

Q - Francisco Riquel

{BIO 3050316 <GO>}

Yes, hello. I would like to ask if you can give us an indication of the sensitivity of your
shareholders' equity to the sovereign risk volatility we are observing in July. If you can give
us an update of your sovereign risk portion [ph] to European peripheral countries as of
June. And do you expect any type of impairments in this portfolio following the summit of
the European Union yesterday?

A - Luigi Lubeli
Hi, Paco. Well, the first answer to your question would be sensitivity to the sovereign crisis
on what day of the month of July? Because that's -- I'm afraid that's a difficult answer to
give. I think, the jokes aside. And forgive me for that, I think that the -- really the cleanest
answer we can give you is what we have in the equity at the end of June. Because,
honestly, it really would be depending on what day of the month you're asking that
question. It's difficult to say. We don't know if it's re-trenching, if it's not re-trenching and
that's not at all clear to me.
Regarding the exposure, you actually find it today where we have released the CNMV
filings with the quarterly accounts, which come with their footnote. And then actually in the
management report you will find, with the balance sheet, a breakdown of the exposure to
all the countries that we think matter and a few more and. So, we have the exposure by
country there. The actual accounts also tell you in the footnote what was the loss that we

recorded in our equity from Greece, which was EUR102m. That's in the footnotes to the
quarterly accounts.
And your last question was -- the impact --?
