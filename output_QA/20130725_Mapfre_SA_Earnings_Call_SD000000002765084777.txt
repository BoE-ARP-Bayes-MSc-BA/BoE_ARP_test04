Presentation
Operator
Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the first half results, 2013, conference call. At this
time all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation, followed by a
question and answer session. (Operator Instructions)
I must advise you that this conference is being recorded today, on Thursday, July 25, 2013.
I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Mr. Tejera.
Please go ahead, sir.

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen; welcome to MAPFRE's first half 2013 results
presentation. As usual, I'll read an overview of the results and the main business
developments, and later, Mr. Lubelli will explain the financials in greater detail, and present
the European embedded value figures for 2012. Finally, we will take your questions.
Please move to slide number 3.

The underlying trends were positive in the first half. Revenues and premiums grew at a
much faster pace, reflecting a pickup in sales in Spanish Life, Latin America, Global Risks
and Re. Adjusting for the sale of the Argentina subsidiaries, announced in 2012, premiums
increased 6.5% and revenues 6%.

FINAL

Funds under management also grew, reflecting primarily Life and mutual fund sales, along
with positive mark-to-market adjustments in Spain.
The combined ratio remains 50 basis point lower than in 2012, as was the case in March.
In this regard, I must note the strong improvement in Latin America, whose combined
ratio decreased nearly 6percentage points.
The return on equity also went up, compared to the First Quarter, to 9.1%. Profits and
earnings per share are up 5%, year on year. Please move on to the next slide.
The environment continues to be challenging, but we have reached again to grow in this
challenging environment. Thanks to the benefit of the geographical diversification, which
offset the impact of premiums and results of the depreciation of the Brazilian real, and
the decline in the demand in Spain.

Bloomberg Transcript

The improvement of the Non-Life underwriting results, with a significant decrease in the
combined ratio of international business, and the remain of the -- an excellent combined
ratio in Spain, despite of the tough conditions.
The recovery in growth in Life Assurance, thanks to the international insurance business,
and in this quarter, we have had an excellent performance on the agents' channel in Spain.
In this quarter, we have registered a lower financial income, as a result of the decrease in
interest rates, and negative mark-to-market of the trading portfolio in Brazil.
In page 5, you can see that the reported attributable result is up 5% year on year, as I
mentioned before. The recurring results fell, reflecting a series of development.
The fall in demand and higher combined ratios in Spain, with other related losses in Spain,
in the US, and several countries in Latin America, especially in Argentina and in Mexico; the
appreciation of the euro, which is the most important driver of the results of the quarter;
and the lower recurrent financial income due to a decrease in interest rates in Europe and
the USA, and an increase in interest rates in Brazil.
The environment remains challenging, even if we have received today good news in
Spain, where the figures of unemployment have improved, we can report now a decrease
of the unemployed people of 225 people during the last quarter. It is the third month in a
row of the decrease in figures of unemployment, which is very good news, even if the
rate of unemployment remains very, very high, at a level of 26%.

In this environment, we are taking initiatives to raise business volumes and increase
profitability, and we trust we will bear fruit in the remaining of the year, and we'll be able
(to) reverse this trend.

FINAL

Already in the Second Quarter, we saw the pickup in sales I just referred to, and a
continuation of the significant improvement in combined ratios in Latin America.
On page 6, you have a summary of the changes in our equity story in the last two years.
We are now, as you know well, the leading insurer in Spain and Latin America. We have a
more diversified Company with more than two-thirds of the business outside of Spain.
And we have, when you compare with last year, a more clear financial horizon.
On slide 7, you can see how MAPFRE is benefiting from diversification into world markets,
as well as markets with a comparatively better economical look, such as the US. This is
helping it withstand the prolonged contraction in the Spanish market.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you can see on page 8, where we have a presence in countries which, according to the
IM forecast, are markets with more possibilities for growth than Spain in the coming years.
And with possibilities of improving the sales to insure people in a bigger proportion than
the growth of the countries themselves.
As you know very well, there is a positive elasticity of insurance demand to the growth of
GDP, and this should support, over the next year, the strong growth that we expect
coming from our diversification, as we are observing during the last years in our figures
coming from Latin America.
On page 9, you can see the details of the new credit facility we have signed at the end of
June. This is a new facility of EUR750 million. It's a revolving facility with a maturity date in
five years, that is in 2018, which replaces the EUR500 million revolving credit facility
maturing in June 2014 we have cancelled in advance, with better conditions from the point
of view of prices, and with a very, very, high participation of the Spanish and foreign banks.
We have a syndicate of five Spanish banks and seven foreign banks, and this facility is fully
undrawn at this moment. This gives us the possibility of having a clear horizon from the
point of view of the funding during the next years.
I will now hand the call to Mr. Lubelli, who will comment, as usual, our financials in greater
detail.

Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Thank you, Esteban. Good afternoon, to all those following this conference call today.
Please turn to slide number 11. Here we see a continuation of the trend that we have been
observing for years now. The weight of business activities abroad continues to rise. The
contribution to premiums stands at 69%, compared to 66% a year ago, while contribution
to profit, if we adjust for the non-recurring items we had in the first half of 2012, went
Page 3 of 25



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2013-07-25

from 49% to 53%. As Mr. Tejera just highlighted, the strength should continue, based on
the prospective macroeconomic situation of the countries we operate in.

FINAL

Compared to March, we see a considerable jump in the contribution to premiums. That is
due to the significant pickup in issuance at MAPFRE America, MAPFRE RE, and MAPFRE
Global Risks.
On the next slide, number 12, we see the contribution to premiums and insurance result
by business areas. If we compare June to March, we see that the contraction in premiums
in Spain halved, and that was thanks to a strong development of the Life business. If we
look at the rate of the total premiums we will, however, see a fall, and that's because the
growth abroad was even stronger, as I mentioned in the previous slide.
In terms of profits, if we compare to March, the picture, however, has changed. Spain has
reversed its contraction, and now contributes the same it did a year ago, that is 47.2%.
A year ago, we recorded significant writedowns, which drove down the contribution of
Spain to total profits. This year we have no writedowns. Actually, we even have EUR20
million of pretax gains, but we have lower volumes and a larger combined ratio. So the
drivers have changed, and in both years they lead to the same percentage contribution.

Bloomberg Transcript

Brazil continues its upward strength, driven by larger business volumes, a hotter market
and substantially lower combined ratios, as well as a more mature operational structure.
These improvements offset the negative impact of the appreciation of the euro.
The rest of Latin America shows a fall both year on year and quarter on quarter, which
reflects several reasons. One is the appreciation of the euro, as I already mentioned, then
we have lower realization gains, and which is significant on figures, the transfer of Puerto
Rico under MAPFRE International.
If we bear all of this in mind, the Second Quarter was actually okay, and was broadly in line
with the same period of 2012. Overall, if we look at the performance, it is much stronger
at an underlying level than it was a year ago, in spite even of currency depreciation.
MAPFRE USA improved its contribution compared to the First Quarter, but remains below
the previous year, and this is because of a worse technical result. Also it must be said that,
being below the previous year in both quarters, it was considerably better in the Second
Quarter of this year, despite weather-related losses.
MAPFRE Global Risks was affected in the Second Quarter by foreign exchange losses.
Overall it was up, thanks mainly to a much better combined ratio and a EUR13 million gain
from the creation of Solunion.
And finally, MAPFRE RE shows a decrease compared to the previous quarter, due to a
higher combined ratio. Year on year, however, it increased its contribution, thanks to larger
foreign exchange gains and the absence of writedowns.

FINAL

On the following slide, we go deeper into the Non-Life accounts. Here, the trends are
broadly in line with what we saw in the First Quarter.
In Spain, premiums widened their fall and that's because the market continues to contract.
We have seen a deterioration in sales in the market at large, and especially in the Motor
business. And that is due to the purchase of cheaper covers, both because people have
less money to spend, and also because the car fleet is aging. The sales of new cars has
fallen considerably.
A higher loss ratio, along with lower net premiums earned, led to a decrease in the
underwriting results. Nonetheless, the combined ratio remains at exceptionally low levels,
and it has to be seen that its gap over the previous year has narrowed in the Second
Quarter.
Brazil grew, thanks from the reclassification from Life to Non-Life of some lines of
business we told you about in the last quarter of 2012, as well as to organic growth and to
a hardening market. The underwriting result improved notably, thanks to this
reclassification, as well as to a decrease in the expense ratio and, as I said, to the
hardening, to an increase in prices.

Bloomberg Transcript

The rest of MAPFRE America appears to fall, but that is due to the sale of the Argentine
subsidiaries and the transfer of the Puerto Rican business, which was compounded by the
appreciation of the euro.
If we adjust for that, the increase year on year is 5.5%, thanks to growth across the board
and especially in Venezuela, Colombia and Chile. The underwriting result reflects the sale
of the Argentine business, which had a poor combined ratio, and several initiatives to
improve underwriting and risk selection.
MAPFRE RE shows premium growth. As we told you in the First Quarter that's due to the
formalization of reinsurance operations with Group companies. If we exclude that,
premiums grow 6%, which is actually a quite good result.
The combined ratio increased, if we compare it to the previous quarter, due to larger
charges for profit sharing, which were partly offset by lower frequency.
MAPFRE USA shows growth, and that's due to rate increases in all states and to the
appreciation of the dollar. The loss ratio was affected by snowstorms in the First Quarter
and rainstorms in the second.
MAPFRE Global Risks perhaps shows the most significant change in trend, compared to
the First Quarter. Premiums went up, reflecting growth in Latin America, especially in fire
and transport, which more than offset the impact of the deconsolidation of Solunion,
which is now accounted for by the equity method.

FINAL

In MAPFRE (Global Risks) now, the premiums issued outside of Spain and its subsidiary
make up over 60% of its overall business. The combined ratio improved, thanks to a
better loss experience on the back of a lower frequency. Moreover, if we look at the
combined ratio in the same period of the previous year, June 2012, at that time it was
negatively affected by exchange rate differences, which magnifies the improvement year
on year.
Finally, MAPFRE Asistencia recorded organic growth in Europe and Asia, as well as the
positive impact on its US business of two developments which took place in the second
half of 2012, a large roadside assistance contract and the acquisition of Century. The
combined ratio improved, reflecting the impact of the exchange rate on technical
reserves, which was negative a year ago and positive this year.
On slide 14, we have the remainder of the Non-Life account. I already talked about
premiums and technical results. Financial income includes a realization gain of EUR95
million, of which EUR22.2 million came from the sale of the headquarters in Istanbul, and
EUR12.9 from the asset transfer to Solunion.

Bloomberg Transcript

This compares with basically EUR140 million of writedowns in the same period of last year.
If we adjust for that, we see that the financial income falls year on year, and that is due to
lower yield basically across the board and also to the fact that we have negative mark-tomarket adjustments in Brazil in this year. Last year they were positive, so it's a change in
sign in amounts year on year, which magnifies the fall also in this case.
In this account, we also have EUR20 million US gains on dollar-denominated assets
recorded in Venezuela and coming from the devaluation of the bolivar.
On slide 15, we have the Life account. The Life account changes a bit, compared to the
First Quarter. Spain improved notably, thanks to strong campaigns in the agents' channel
and above market average sales in life protection.
The technical financial result improved considerably year on year, thanks to the absence
of writedowns, while on a quarterly basis, if we look at it quarter on quarter, it doesn't
show any significant variation.
As I said before, Brazil last year reclassified some business from Life into Non-Life, and
this is the reason behind its growth, which is only modest. Nonetheless, the earnings
growth improved. Second quarter sales tend to be stronger.
The technical financial result is very much in line with the figures we saw for the First
Quarter of this year, and reflects a fall due to the reclassification I've talked about already
a few times, and to negative mark-to-market adjustments.
The remainder of MAPFRE America's Life business goes up strongly and that comes
primarily from Colombia. The fall in the technical financial result is due to the fact that, a

FINAL

year ago, we recorded a gain of EUR18.3 million in Panama. If we adjust for that, the
underlying growth is 7%.
MAPFRE RE's premiums decreased because of a different issuance calendar in 2013.
However, if you compare it to the previous quarter, the contraction was much smaller
because the cessions for the European clients went up on a comparative basis. We had
profit in the technical and financial result in the Second Quarter, compared to losses in the
first, thanks to a much better loss experience.
And finally, Middlesea continues to benefit, we saw that already in the First Quarter, from
very good growth in the sailing business. Compared to the First Quarter, we see a
contraction in the technical financial result, and that also in this case is due to mark-tomarket losses.
There's not much more to say on the Life accounts, so I'll skip slide 16 and move to slide
17 directly. Here, we have the other Non-Life activities. We see the development in
revenues and expenses, which comes from the growth of the services business at
MAPFRE Asistencia and the consolidation of Funespana, the listed company in which we
acquired a majority stake.

Bloomberg Transcript

The net financial income remains negative, because of the interest payments. We have
interest payments at the consolidated level. And we have also realized capital losses of
EUR2 million. Last year, they were EUR19 million for the impairment of the shareholding in
Cattolica.
If we compare to the First Quarter, we see a decrease in the growth rate of expenses
and revenues. And this is due to the fact that, in the same period of the previous year, we
reclassified some lines into other business activities, and that led to a strong increase in
figures a year ago. So of course, on a year-on-year basis, that depresses the growth rate.
On slide number 18, we have the bottom line. If we compare to the First Quarter, we see
a clear trend reversal, with profit growth driven on a comparative basis by the absence of
writedowns which you will recall in 2012. We see that the share of minorities goes up, and
that's due to profit growth in Brazil.
On slide 19, we have the balance sheet. We see variations in assets and liabilities. That
basically reflects two drivers; the depreciation of the US dollar and the Brazilian real. Then,
we had the recovery of values in the financial markets, especially when it comes to assets
in Spain and the USA and, of course, business growth, which we have seen in the previous
slide.
As usual, on a half-yearly basis, we have a more detailed breakdown of our investment
portfolio, which we begin to cover on slide 20. We have a breakdown of the investment
portfolio at the close of the first half. No significant variations, except for a slightly larger
weight of government paper, and a slightly smaller weight of corporate bonds.

FINAL

On slide 21, we have the breakdown of the fixed income portfolio. We see an increase in
the weight of government paper. That is due to both mark-to-market and also to new
purchases.
On slide 22, we have the breakdown by rating, but it's only a small migration from A to
BBB, due to basically to downgrades on some of the paper we had. Then we have the
breakdown of assets with reserves. About 40% of the fixed income portfolio matches
Spanish Life Assurance technical reserves.
Finally, on slide 23, we have the changes in equity. We have a recovery in the market value
of investments here. As you know, usually, the shadow accounting is about half the
change, but this year they have the same amount, and that's due to the fact that the
assets which have the shadow accounting are in Spain, they increased considerably more
than that. But we had, as I mentioned before, negative mark-to-market adjustments in the
assets outside of Spain. So we have this deviation from normal figures.
We did have a major change in translation adjustments, which reduced, if you compare to
the end of the year, about EUR450 million, the consolidated equity. The rest is dividends,
and that was something known which we also had in the First Quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

With this, we conclude the results presentation. I will now give you a few seconds to move
on to slide number 3 of the European Embedded Value presentation.
On this slide, we have a summary of the main figures in our EEV. If we compare to 2011,
we see a decrease, which is reflecting lower new business volumes, due to lower sales
through the bancassurance channel, which were partly offset by strong sales at the
agents' channel.
Then we have a change in the composition of business. In 2012, we had a greater weight
of life savings products, at the expense of life protection, which translated into a
comparatively lower margin on new business, and then we had higher lapse rates.
As a note, throughout the document, compared to the previous years, we now separate
more clearly the parts that correspond to shareholders and minority interests.
On slide number 4, we have the main changes in the EEV. The ANAV barely grows year on
year. It actually decreases in minorities, and that is simply due, as we will see on the
rollover, to a higher dividend payout.
The present value of the in-force shows a decrease. I already explained that, that it was
due to high lapsation and which also, as we will see, affects the negative change in
assumptions, and to lower new business volumes, especially in the Protection business.
The cost of capital increased. That was due to the application of a lower discount rate. We
see that the weight of the time value of financial options and guarantees fell slightly, and

Page 8 of 25



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2013-07-25

that was due to a lower duration of the with-profits portfolio that offset the negative
impact of lower interest rates.

FINAL

On slide number 5, we show the breakdown of the EEV by business line and distribution
channel. As I explained on the previous slide, the present value of the in-force of the
Insurance business fell, primarily due to higher lapse rates and lower new business
volumes.
We can see on the slide that the impact of lapsations affected especially the agents'
channel. And that explains the fact that the decrease was concentrated in such channel.
The cost of capital increased in Life Assurance, due to the application of a lower discount
rate, but you'll see that it falls in pension funds. And that is because of a reduction in the
regulatory capital requirements applicable to this business, which will equalize to those of
the mutual funds.
On slide number 6, we show how the in-force breaks down between minorities and
shareholders. The figures fall compared to 2011, for the reasons I've mentioned already a
few times; that is higher lapse rates and lower business volumes.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide number 7, we have the roll forward, which breaks down the changes in the main
components. As each of these changes is explained on the following slides, I'll move
directly to slide number 8.
I already mentioned that we have broken down the minority interests, and that's, basically,
a presentation item. We see changes in the model. That's, basically, due to the -- it's a
small amount, it's only (EUR15 million), if I'm not wrong. And that's due to the usual
improvements that are introduced every year.
We have changes in assumptions, as I said before. The main one that is left out is the
lapse rate, because then we have a higher credit risk, which is, basically, completely offset
by the impact of the lower discount rates.
The expected return is the usual story. It's the unwind of the discount rate, about EUR33
million, and then, the after-tax return on the ANAV at the beginning of the year, net of the
cost of capital.
We see a negative deviation of the actual value from the expectations. And that was due
to the fact that we reported a profit that was lower than expected, and once again, to
higher lapsation.
As I already explained, the time value of financial options and guarantees improved. It's a
favorable impact on the value of in-force, because of the lower duration of the with-profit
portfolios.

FINAL

Slide number 10, we have the value added of the business and the margin. The margin
has, basically, fallen back to the levels of 2010. In 2010, we had 5.4%, now we have 5.3%,
after a spike in 2011, driven, basically, by the Protection business. This year, as I said on the
previous slide, on the business mix, we had a higher weight of Savings business, which
brings in lower margins than the Protection business, as well as higher lapse rates.
Finally, slide 11, we have the main sensitivities. As usual, the drivers and directions of
sensitivities are basically the same in direction between the in-force and the value in the
business, so I'll just explain it on this slide. And as usual, also, as in previous years, our
figures are most sensitive to the variations in interest rates and to the lapse rates.
The sensitivity to increases in the probability of default of the Spanish fixed income
portfolio, falls compared to a year ago, when it was EUR197.5 million. And that basically
reflects a lower duration of the portfolio.
And that's all on my side. I'll now give the call back to Mr. Tejera for the Q&A session.

Esteban Tejera

Thank you, Luigi. That finishes our presentation of the results. Now, we are available for
your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Niccolo Dalla Palma, Exane BNP Paribas.

Q - Niccolo Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

I would have two questions, if possible. So the first one is on your growth rate in Spain. I
wanted to ask you a bit more color on the difference in growth between yourself and the
sector, and especially if I look at the three main lines of business, Motor, Health and
Home.
So in Motor, you're decreasing 3 points more than the sector, at 9.5% versus 6.5% for the
sector. In Health, you're also decreasing the top line 1.5% versus some growth of 1.5% of
the sector. And while in Home it's the opposite, so you're growing more than the sector.
So could you maybe give me a bit more color, is someone behaving irrationally on the
Motor and Health business lines? How do you expect this, going forward?
And the second question is on LatAm, and in particular, the Brazilian combined ratio, which
was exceptionally strong in this first half. Could you maybe say something about the
sustainability of this combined ratio, and what drove the 9 point improvement in the
expense ratio in Brazil? Thank you.

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi, Niccolo, thanks for your questions. In Motor, look, this is a trend we saw in the First
Quarter as well. The market is going where it is going. We had other years, other periods
in which we had a comparatively worse performance than the market. We had quarters
with a better performance.
I think the long and short is that we are the largest ones, and we are comparatively more
attacked than other groups; that's part of the game. I wouldn't say it's anything to worry
too much about. It's a tendency in this area.
You said irrational behavior; there clearly are companies that are being very aggressive on
prices and that, in the short term, may have an impact, for sure.
On Health, we also explained this in the First Quarter. There has been a change in our
accounting. We brought forward the cancellations that we would have recorded normally
during the year. And that continues to affect us negatively in terms of comparison. And
also here, of course, there is competition, as you rightly are saying.
In Household, I didn't understand your question exactly. The reality in Household, we
actually (multiple speakers) -- we are doing better than the market.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Niccolo Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Yes, you are doing better than the market, so just wondering if there was some specific
expansion that you're undergoing in some areas, or what's driving this?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

No, not really, it's just sales efforts. But yes, we're doing -- the figure is small, but we are
doing comparatively better; that's absolutely true.

Q - Niccolo Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

And just out of curiosity, before you answer the other question, on the Motor part, you
have a very strong position outside some of the main cities in Spain. Do you see some
changes of efforts made by competitors also there, or is it still too difficult to compete
with your very dense network, which -- are you seeing differences in competition in big
cities and outside the big cities, where you're historically very strong?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Look, I don't have figures by province now, in order to answer your question precisely and
numerically speaking. From a qualitative standpoint, I would say that continues to be the
case.
Also because, let's say that the most aggressive and most visible competitors normally
focus their efforts on the larger metropolitan areas where they can get more bang for

Page 11 of 25



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2013-07-25

their buck. Clearly, they need less sales effort in order to reap a greater increase. So I
would say that logically, that seems to be an accurate assessment.

FINAL

In terms of sustainability in LatAm; really when you say LatAm, these days it's more and
more Brazil and there, we do have a change. Because a year ago, as you remember, we
were still in the transition from the previous business structure to the present one.
That's why, in my previous comments, I said that improvement in Brazil owes a good part
to a greater operational stability, because now the structure is much more defined than it
used to be a year ago.
There's been several trends. Last year, we had expenses from the switch from
Sulamerica, which used to support Banco do Brasil to MAPFRE, and that led us to incur
some, let's call them, one-off expenses. Then we have had rate rises in Brazil market
wide, and that is benefiting the technical result.
We ourselves have introduced several initiatives in order to control, much better, the
amount of claims, and especially to combat fraud. Then there's a general, let's say, quote,
unquote, better behavior due to more effective policing in the country.

Bloomberg Transcript

So it's a combination of reasons which, I would say, make it comparatively more
sustainable than it used to be, yes. This ratio reflects more the reality of the Company
than the one we saw a year ago. I'm wondering if I'm answering your question.

Q - Niccolo Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Yes. I'm particularly curious, though, about the expense ratio, because clearly 9 points
improvement is massive. Is that all due to the one-off costs? So could we say the 34%
expense ratio is a more normal expense ratio? And maybe (multiple speakers) --

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

I cannot tell you exactly the figure. What we hear from our management is that this result,
this combined ratio, reflects much better, much more accurately the reality of the
business and what we had a year ago. I cannot pinpoint specifically the amount of
expenses but, let's say, this is a more reliable picture.

Q - Niccolo Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks very much.

Three things that I want to check. First of all, on your investment result in Non-Life and the
performance there, Q2 I think has been affected again by mark-to-market negative
impact from your Brazilian bond portfolio. Can you quantify the impact on Q2 specifically?
Or otherwise, can you confirm that the impact is around 50% higher than you've seen in
Q1? That's question number one.
Question number two is, again, on Brazil. Your Non-Life premium growth in Q2 seemed to
have accelerated a fair bit, compared with Q1. Can you talk us through the drivers for that?
Then finally, you show on one of the slides how your shareholders' equity and your
liabilities have grown in the quarter and, amongst others, you cite currency impacts. I think
that your equity went up 1%, your liabilities went up 30%. That suggests that there has
been a negative impact on your solvency ratio. Can you talk about the development in
your solvency ratio Q2 versus Q1, and how much of that is due to currency moves? Thank
you.

Hi, Michael. Let's see, first question. We didn't give an exact figure, but you can take, as a
rough rule of thumb, the mark-to-market would equal more or less 10% of the pre-tax
profit of Brazil. So let's say, in rough terms, the pre-tax profit of Brazil would have grown
twice as much as it did had we not had the negative mark-to-market, as a rough rule of
thumb.
The acceleration of premiums growth in Brazil in the Second Quarter is basically the way it
works. You have to understand that somehow the holiday season in Brazil is more skewed
towards what -- it is winter for us. The business activities tend to accelerate in the second
and Third Quarter, unlike here. So that's basically a seasonal impact; it happens every year.
The valuation in equity compared to provisions is due to the fact that it is in -- let's see,
we've had several mark-to-markets. Those mark-to-markets were positive in Spain, which
benefits the technical provisions which, of course, they're the only ones adjusted for that.
And it was comparatively negative outside of Spain and the USA and rather Latin America.
So the negative adjustment goes on to the equity, and that is why the equity grows less
than the technical reserves.
Solvency wise, I wouldn't worry too much because it may be a quarterly negative variation
but, year on year, you will see that the equity is about EUR0.5 billion larger than it was a
year ago. So in terms of the actual amount of capital available, the Group is developing
okay.
Does that answer your question on solvency, or does it not?

Q - Michael van Wegen

{BIO 6435238 <GO>}

Yes, I guess so. Maybe going back to the second question, though, on premium growth in
Brazil where you indicate that Q2 is always strong because of seasonal impacts; I was
talking about growth rates year over year. So that should capture, or should neutralize that
Page 13 of 25

seasonal impact, I would say. So still wondering why Q2 saw an acceleration in growth.
Thank you.

Just on the commercial portfolio in Spain now, the Motor book has been showing some
pressure, and it was expected probably. But the commercial line has also contracted quite
sharply. Is there something that was a one-off large contract, or is there a trend there? So
that's the first question.
And the second thing is that on this entire Brazilian mark-to-market, I think slide 20, as was
pointed out to me, has EUR2.2 billion of the fair value to P&L. I just wanted to clarify,
because this question had come up in the last months, as you can imagine.
The annual report did have a fair value to P&L BBB bond level of only EUR100 million. So
was this EUR2.1 billion reclassified, or was it something that we should have known which I
did not? So I apologize; I just need a clarification. Thank you.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Okay. I will almost start from your last question. So what you are saying is that we have
(fine) EUR2.2 billion of fair value through P&L in Brazil, and you are comparing that with the
figure of BBB bonds?

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

And what is it that it does not check?

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Maybe I'll take it off line, if -- I just want to see if there's any -- because the number on the
annual report was rather small, EUR100 million or so, on the fair value line. And probably,
Page 14 of 25

that is -- again, I apologize; I can ask IR off line as well.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Okay. No. That's no problem at all. No. It's just because it's going to be a bit tedious to go

You were saying why commercial insurance, you were talking about MAPFRE Empresas,
right?

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

And you were referring to the top line or the technical result? That escaped me.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Top line. So in today's presentation, it's on slide --

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

The top line, if you look at the entire sector in Spain, as of June, it is falling 8%, 8.2%. So
I'm afraid there's a decline in the market at large and we are the largest player in the
market, so it does affect us as well.
Then, we have an agricultural pool in which we operate in Spain of which we recognize the
premiums in the First Quarter. Then, on a quarterly basis, it depresses the comparison.

Page 15 of 25



Company N ame: M apfre SA

And there is a decline also in third-party liability. Competition is especially intense in thirdparty liability in Spain.

Operator
Maciej Wasilewicz, Morgan Stanley.

Q - Maciej Wasilewicz

{BIO 16462204 <GO>}

So I have essentially one question, but it might be a bit of a long one. In terms of -- if I'm
looking at slide 25 of your presentation at the Non-Life combined ratio in Spain, year on
year, the movement is from 89.7% to 91.5%. Most of that, in fact all of it, is in the loss ratio.
You did flag that there were catastrophes in the quarter in Spain, particularly flooding. So I
wanted to see whether or not you can give us an idea of how much of that deterioration
in the loss ratio, that 2.1% deterioration, how much of that is just from the flooding?

Bloomberg Transcript

And depending on how you answer that, I'd like to also know on page 27, we can see a
nice breakdown of your entire portfolio. It looks ostensibly that you've held back business
in order to be able to keep your margins, if you look at the premiums versus where the
combined ratios have gone. But the combined ratios in pretty much every single line have
deteriorated nonetheless.
So I'm wondering, are any of these lines -- I guess some of these lines wouldn't have
been impacted by the catastrophes, and is that a genuine reflection of the current
conditions in the market and we should flow that forward if nothing changes from here?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

That's a pretty articulate question, Maciej. Let's see; I cannot tell you exactly. That is not a
figure we have given, and now I would have trouble telling you exactly how much money
we have lost owing to floods and rain.
On a quarterly basis, it is evident on the loss ratio in the -- let me just grab the figures -on the Households, we've gone up 2.3percentage points. So as of March, we were going
up 4percentage points year on year, and now here we're going up basically
5.3percentage points.
So as a guesstimate, something like 1.5 to 2percentage points could be attributed to that,
but this is a rough estimate on the spot.
I just want to draw your attention on the fact that on a quarterly base actually the
combined ratio did improve quite significantly in Motor. It was pretty good, so it's not all

Page 16 of 25



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2013-07-25

bad news. In Motor, we perhaps may have deteriorated on the growth side, but not on
the underwriting side.

FINAL

As of March, we had 94.6% combined and we've fallen 3percentage points to 91.5%.
We've actually improved also overall as of MAPFRE Spain, we have a narrower gap in the
combined ratio year on year as of June than we did as of March.
So actually -- I mean my recall, my impression is on the underwriting side that we actually
did better in the Second Quarter than we did in the first one. In the first one, we were
2.6percentage points up year on year, and now we are about 1.8percentage points up
year on year, so we're actually doing better.

Q - Maciej Wasilewicz

{BIO 16462204 <GO>}

Okay. That's clear. So that you 're up 1.8percentage points, and included within that
1.8percentage points for Spain as a whole is some kind of a weather loss which --?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

All right, (that's it) exactly.

Q - Maciej Wasilewicz

{BIO 16462204 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay fair enough. That's very helpful.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

And that's because Motor has improved quite a bit quarter on quarter.

Q - Maciej Wasilewicz

{BIO 16462204 <GO>}

And is that Motor trend you pulling back from the market or is it a market-wide trend, is it
frequency, is there any color on what drove that improvement?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Honestly no clue, I don't have figures for the market as of June. I would be surprised if the
market improved because of the competition level we have on pricing. But this is on my
smell test; really I don't have any figures to back it up.

Q - Maciej Wasilewicz

{BIO 16462204 <GO>}

FINAL

My first question is more macro in nature; we are seeing a tough market condition
economic environment in Spain; we are seeing growth slowing down in Latin America; and
in USA we are seeing a kind of a slowing down of increase in primary P&C rate as well as
kind of negative movement in reinsurance rates.
So I would be more concerned at how do you see your profitable growth over the next
one to two years, from where the growth is going to come? And so this is my first
question.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Right, yes, your question on macro, well, Mr. Tejera commented in his section of the
presentation about the projections. As you know, we lost our crystal ball a long time ago,
so it is difficult to tell you exactly what the trends will be.
We can only tell you what we see, and as far as forecasts are concerned we can only base
ourselves on those carried out by more qualified people than us, which is the IMF.

Bloomberg Transcript

There are several -- this is a longstanding question, we receive this question many times
by investors and analysts alike. It's impossible to tell you exactly what the growth of the
countries will be and how they will develop. However, there do seem to be strong
reasons for which the countries in which we are based should maintain a positive gap
compared to our home country, which is Spain.
So that is what we're seeing. Then, even though the deceleration on an economic front is
taking place, we are not seeing that in insurance sales. That might be a bit disconcerting,
but especially in the case of places like Turkey and Brazil it is due to the fact that the GDP
per capita and the development of the middle class have reached the point in which there
is not a massive, but certainly some disconnects between the GDP and the growth in
insurance.

Q - Avinash Singh

{BIO 20134511 <GO>}

Yes, my question was more on your growth rather than -- I just kind of outlined the
economic environment, because for the last few years your bottom line has been kind of
constant due to various different reasons, not just for one reason.
So I was more concerned to talk of where do you see -- if I see that's the case in western
markets are going to be stable over, say, this year and next, from where do you see profit
increase? Because for the last few years your bottom line has been kind of constant.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Right, but we do not only have emerging markets in our profit base, we also have Spain.
So we have two drivers in our bottom line. Precisely the element of strength that we have
shown in MAPFRE over this year was the fact that, thanks to the development abroad, we
could actually offset the negative impact on the economic crisis in Spain that was so
pronounced.
Page 18 of 25



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2013-07-25

So actually, the fact that the bottom line is, as you refer to, stable, it's actually a really
good achievement compared to other listed companies in Spain. I'm afraid that's where
things stand.

FINAL

However, as I say, also in Spain in terms of profitability, the technical profitability in NonLife, as I was saying in Spain, in this quarter actually improved, and Life certainly did much
better, compared to what it was a year ago.
In Latin America, I think that the important element we bring into this results presentation
for the first half is the fact that we not only have top line, but what is much more
important, we have a technical profitability that has improved considerably. And that does
give a shock absorber, even in terms of a supposedly falling top line. As we're seeing the
case in Spain; Spain was doing well because in the face of falling premiums, we continue
to maintain a very strong technical result.

Sami Taipalus, Berenberg.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

First of all, and it's a slightly longwinded question I'm afraid, has there been a significant
change in your cash position in the holding company and the Spanish Non-Life company?
The reason I'm asking is because in Q1 you gave as one of the reasons for the
formalization of the reinsurance contract that you wanted to improve the cash position in
the Non-Life company.
And the second reason is that you increased your credit facilities in the Second Quarter,
although, if I remember correctly, you said in the past that you actually wanted to reduce
requirements on these, going forward.
And the second question, I'm afraid, goes back to the Spanish Non-Life business. There
seems to have been very little money made outside the Motor line in Q2, and in particular
the burial line seems to have been quite weak. Is there anything particular that's driving
the combined ratio upwards there?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Okay, Sami, let's see. On the first two questions, I think there might be a bit of confusion.
There wasn't a cash need, per se, at the Non-Life company. Or, let's see, there was a
cash need in the sense that there was a need to fund the growth of the new operation of
the company. So instead of deploying the cash that was in the accounts of the company,
we used reinsurance to use capital more efficiently within the Group.

Page 19 of 25



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2013-07-25

But it wasn't actually any movement in the cash. Now I don't have the figure for cash at
large. The most I can do is to compare the investment figure for MAPFRE Familiar quarter
on quarter, but that has several things; it's investments in cash and there's a reduction of
EUR40 million, a 1% reduction quarter on quarter which can be due to anything.

FINAL

So it wasn't a matter of cash availability, it was just a way in which capital was deployed
and cash was used, but nothing more than that.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Okay. And on the credit facility?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Yes, I was going there. Well the credit facility, really is an exercise, I would say, in liability
management that is stemming from a strategic decision. If you can recall, when we
released the results for the Third Quarter of 2012 our Board decided that it was
appropriate for MAPFRE to be more liquid, and so we started working on both our
liabilities and cash.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you know, we have, on one hand, slightly reduced the dividend, the dividend payment,
and then we worked on our liabilities. We issued a bond, a EUR1 billion bond in November,
which matures in 2015. Then we had two syndicated facilities; both were repaid with the
bond. One was canceled immediately, and then the remaining one we have decided to
replace with this one, obtaining a significant extension in terms, because the previous
facility matures in 2014 and this one matures in 2018, and it is also for a larger amount.
So we have a greater financial flexibility, and we also have spread out our financial
obligations. The redemption of our financial obligations much further out in the future. It
really is a financial liability management exercise.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

And if I'm not wrong, you are talking about the other line in Spain, correct?

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Well that one too, but I guess I was specifically referring to the burial line where I think the
combined ratio actually deteriorated in the Second Quarter.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Right. What happens there, this line of business is a bit peculiar, not only for its name. The
way it works is that results are updated at the beginning of the year, so what happened
was that -- and then it's, in turn, linked to interest rates. So last year, we had interest rates

Page 20 of 25



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2013-07-25

FINAL

(natural) recalculation of reserves and of falling reserves, which was a positive impact on
the loss ratio.
This year, the revision of rates has not produced the same impact, so it's not actually as if
we had a -- this is classified as Non-Life, but this really behaves as Life Protection. So last
year, we had a fall in reserves, positive impact on claims. This year, there wasn't really any
need to change the amount of reserves that much. So when I compare these (bases), it
looks as if the claims ratio has gone up, but that wasn't the case.

Okay. Thank you.

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

{BIO 5933123 <GO>}

I have four questions. The first one refers, if you can quantify what was the impact on
mark-to-market on the Brazilian bonds in your portfolio which affected negatively the
results, especially the Non-Life financial income?

Bloomberg Transcript

The second question is a clarification about the positive factor of around EUR20 million
due to the currency. Is that some hedging that you put in place to hedge your income
against the volatility of the LatAm currency?
The third question is on capital and dividend. If you can give us an update on how
confident you are on your capital position currently, and if we can expect to see a better
interim dividend compared to the past year in the next quarters?
And finally, if you can quantify what was the impact on the change in LatAm of some
business which was reclassified out of Life into Non-Life, the positive impact on combined
ratio? So I just wonder if there is some positive effect on your very good results in terms
of combined ratio in LatAm. Thank you.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Atanasio, let's see, I'll take three questions. One will be taken Mr. Tejera. We do not give
precisely the figure, but just to guide you, the MTM in Brazil was roughly 10% of the pretax profit. So the pre-tax profit, let's say, instead of growing 10% would have grown 20%
year on year without that.
The second question I didn't really understand. I think you're referring to the EUR20 million
that shows up in the Non-Life account. Is it so?

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

{BIO 5933123 <GO>}

Page 21 of 25



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2013-07-25

Yes, because you mentioned in the presentation there was a positive factor due to the
currency, and I --

FINAL

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Yes, correct. So that's something that unfortunately -- and I say unfortunately because the
country regularly suffers devaluations; it is something that we had in Venezuela. Venezuela
has dollar-denominated assets. So you are right; they work as a hedge. Whenever the
currency devalues, this Company records gains through the P&L. Then when they go to
equity, they basically balance out the negative impact of the devaluation.
So the impact this year because of that was about EUR20 million, and that's entirely
recognized in the Non-Life account. That's something that, let's say, has happened in
previous years.
I cannot tell you exactly what the impact of the reclassification on the combined ratio of
Brazil because, as I said, and you may not have heard it, as I said before, the combined
ratio does not respond only to that in Brazil. It also responds to higher tariffs. Tariffs are
going up in the country, generally speaking.

Bloomberg Transcript

It also responds more to that than to other reasons, to the fact that last year we did not
yet have a mature operational structure. We had to withstand expenses in four different
regions. This company used to be managed by Sulamerica and the management of the
company switched to MAPFRE and we had to incur some expenses this year which we do
not have this year -- last year that we don't have this year.
Then we also introduced improvements in the handling of claims which has benefited us.
So there's many reasons going into that. Of course, in addition to the fact that the
business that was transferred was quite profitable.
So I don't have any precise -- to tell you exactly how much came from there, I cannot.
On capital and dividend, Mr. Tejera will take your question.

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Hi, Atanasio. The capital and dividend it is still very early in the year to know something will
happen in the (remainder) year. I think that's how our procedure now is more and more
comfortable from the point of view of capital and liquidity position and financial flexibility
now than a year ago, before.
We continue in (this way); we continue with our traditional policy of having the priority of
maintaining our solvency and our capital position as comfortable; return to shareholders
the amounts will come within this policy according to the profitability of the business that
this year I think will be better than the year before.

Page 22 of 25



Company N ame: M apfre SA

It's the only thing I can tell you because, as you know, these are decisions that are taken in
a meeting with the Board that they usually make these decisions in the last quarter of the
year for the interim dividend. But my feeling is, as I mentioned, very positive according to
the evolution of the year until now.

{BIO 5317770 <GO>}

My first question is regarding if you could give us some light about which will be the tax
rate for the rest of the year?
And the second question is regarding about minorities. I have seen that has increased
something like 16%. I'm not sure where the increase comes from as the pre-tax profit
increase is something like 5.1%. So if you could give us some light about this please, I
would appreciate it.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Right, thanks, Javier. Let's see, tax rate, a bit difficult to make a forecast on that. On main
rates, those that most of (our) accounts, 30% in Spain, 37%, if I'm not wrong, in the US,
and 40% in Brazil. So depending on the relative weight of these profits, they will drive our
accounts. This will be somehow diminished, but it won't be a material effect by the fact
that we now have some companies that could account it, such as Solunion, but that is not
material.
So depending on how these profits pan out, clearly we have a comparatively with faster
growth in Brazil, so we may have maybe 1percentage point, 2percentage points addition
to the tax rate, but really it's a guess in the dark. The tax is based on so many elements,
deductions and calculations, that really only when a precise calculation is made by the
specialist we can give you the rate. It's impossible almost to forecast.
And minorities are going up because of Brazil, because the profit in Brazil is growing, and
it's growing especially strongly in the business where Banco do Brasil has a 75% stake.
And that is why the minorities grow much faster than the net profit before minorities.
