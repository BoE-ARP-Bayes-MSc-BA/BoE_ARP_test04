Thank you for joining us. We are extremely pleased with our results for the Third Quarter
and first nine months. For the Third Quarter, operating income per share was $2.06, the
second best quarterly operating EPS in the history of Chubb. For the first nine months,
operating income per share was $5.97 and net income was $6.80; both all-time records
for Chubb.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our combined ratio for the Third Quarter was an excellent 85.7%, reflecting the impact of
higher rates, strong underwriting performance in all of our business units. During the
quarter, the market tone in the US remained firm in both our standard commercial and
Professional Liability lines, where we achieved high single-digit average renewal rate
increases and improved retention levels.
In personal lines, we continue to secure renewal change increases averaging in the midsingle digits. Third-quarter operating income per share increased 4% over last year and
resulted in an annualized operating ROE of 14.8%. Net income per share for the Third
Quarter was $2.10, and annualized ROE for the quarter was 13.9%. GAAP book value per
share at September 30, 2013 was $62.04, as the 3% increase since year-end 2012 and a
2% increase since September 30 a year ago.
Our capital position is excellent, and we continue to make good progress on our share
repurchase program. Net written premiums for the Third Quarter were up 4%, reflecting
growth in all three business units.
In light of our performance in the first nine months of the year and our outlook for the
Fourth Quarter, we've increased our guidance for the full-year 2013 operating income per
share to a range of $7.90 to $8.00, from its $7.30 to $7.50 range we provided in our July
2013 guidance. Ricky will discuss the increased guidance in greater detail.
And now for more details on our operating performance, we'll start with Paul.

FINAL

Thanks, John. Chubb Commercial Insurance and Chubb Specialty Insurance both had
outstanding performance in the Third Quarter. At CCI, net written premiums were up 4%
to $1.3 billion. The combined ratio was 85.2%, compared to 87.2% in the Third Quarter of
2012. The impact of catastrophe losses accounted for 1.4 point, with a combined ratio in
the Third Quarter this year, compared to 0.2 points in the corresponding year-ago quarter.
Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI's Third Quarter combined ratio improved 3.2
points to 83.8% from 87% in the Third Quarter of 2012.
CCI secured renewal rate increases on 90% of our US book during the Third Quarter, and
it was the 10th consecutive quarter of rate increases.
CCI's average US renewal rates in the Third Quarter increased 7%, compared to the 8%
increase we secured in the Second Quarter of this year, while retention was up 2 points
from 83% to 85% over the same two quarters.
While this retention and rate movement quarter to quarter is relatively minor, it reflects
directionally the progress we have made with differentiated rate taking and calling over
the past few years. As indicated on previous calls, this has been done using a
performance ranking system that segments customers based on our assessment of rate
adequacy.

Bloomberg Transcript

The bottom line is that we now have less premium volume in our lowest-performing
groups, where rate increases were the highest; and we have more premium buying in our
volume in our better-performing groups, where the rate increases were lower.
For example, for the customer segments within CCI in the US with the greatest rate need,
the premium volume was 28% lower in the Third Quarter of 2013 versus the Third Quarter
of 2012, with this bottom group now comprising less than 20% of the portfolio.
This dynamic occurred because some of the segments graduated to our betterperforming groups due to earlier rounds of rate action, while others saw their premium
volume decline as a result of our aggressive culling actions.
The obvious result is an improved book from a loss experience standpoint. But one where
somewhat lower average rate increases would be expected.
CCI achieved US renewal rate increases in each line of business in the Third Quarter of
2013. The rate increases were led by general liability, which averaged low double-digit
increases, followed by workers' compensation, monoline property, package, auto, excess
umbrella, marine, and boiler.
In CCI markets outside of the US, average renewal rate increases were in the low single
digits in Canada, Europe, and Latin America. Average renewal rates in Asia-Pacific were
flat. These rate increases are very consistent with what we've obtained in recent quarters.
As noted earlier, CCI's Third Quarter US renewal retention was 85%, a 2 point

Page 3 of 24

Date: 2013-10-24

improvement over the Second Quarter. Continued strong renewal rate increases and
retention contributed to CCI's premium growth.

FINAL

CCI's new-to-loss business ratio in the US was 0.9-to-1, up from 0.7-to-1 in the Second
Quarter. This ratio was aided by the improved renewal retention. Renewal exposure
change for the Third Quarter was slightly negative.
Turning now to Chubb Specialty Insurance, we were very pleased with CSI's results in the
Third Quarter. Net written premiums increased 5% to $670 million; and our combined ratio
was 82.3%, an improvement of 9.6 points compared to 91.9% in the year-earlier Third
Quarter. In the Professional Liability portion of CSI, net written premiums for the quarter
were $594 million, up 5% from the Third Quarter of last year, our largest percentage
increase in eight years. Our combined ratio was 87.6%, a 9.4 point improvement over the
Third Quarter of 2012 and our best combined ratio in Professional Liability in more than
two years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Average renewal rates for Professional Liability in the US in the Third Quarter increased by
8%, making it the eighth consecutive quarter of rate increases. This 8% average renewal
rate increase compares to 9% obtained in the Second Quarter of this year and 8%
achieved in the Third Quarter of 2012.
During the past quarter, 85% of our Professional Liability policies in the US renewed with
rate increases. We secured renewal rate increases in every Professional Liability line of
business. Byline rate changes were led by EPL, private company D&O, and not-for-profit
D&O. These three business lines average renewal rate increases in the low double digits
and were followed by crime, E&O, public company D&O, and fiduciary.
In markets outside of the US, average renewal rates for Professional Liability in the Third
Quarter increased by low single digits, with small variations by territory. Like CCI, these
rate increases outside the United States are very consistent with what we've achieved in
recent quarters.
Renewal premium retention for Professional Liability in the Third Quarter was 86% in the
United States, a 2 point improvement over the Second Quarter and a 5 point
improvement over the First Quarter of this year. The new to lost business ratio in the US
was 0.8-to-1, up from 0.7-to-1 in the Second Quarter.
With respect to the overall pricing environment for Professional Liability in the US, the
dynamic parallels what we've experienced in CCI. As rate increases and the impact of
calling poor performers take hold, the quality of our book improves and we want to retain
more accounts. Likewise, we have fewer customers that require material rate
improvements.
Similar to CCI Professional Liability uses a ranking or tiering system to inform individual
account pricing decisions. The average rate increase by performance tier in the Third
Quarter was similar to what we have been obtaining in recent quarters. However, because

Page 4 of 24



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2013-10-24

our aggressive underwriting actions have produced a shift in premium volume to the
better-performing tears, the resulting overall average rate increase is one point lower.

FINAL

To further enhance the quality of the portfolio, we are writing a disproportionately large
share of new customers in the lines and market segments with the most attractive pricing
to projected margins. And the same can be said for CCI's new business writing.
We believe that all of these ongoing aggressive underwriting actions are producing a
stronger overall book with better profit potential. Regarding the surety portion of CCI, net
written premiums in the Third Quarter were up 4% to $76 million, and the combined ratio
was an outstanding 41.3%.
With that, I will turn it over to Dino who will review our personal lines results as well as
corporate wide claims. Dino?

Thanks, Paul. Chubb Personal Insurance had another great quarter. Net written premiums
were $1.1 billion, an increase of 4%, the same growth rate as in the Second Quarter. CPI
produced a combined ratio of 88.3% including 7 points of catastrophe losses, compared
to 82.8% in the corresponding quarter last year, which included an unusually low
catastrophe toll of 1.5 points.
On a X-CAT[ph] basis, CPI's combined ratio was 81.3% in the Third Quarter of this year,
the same as in the Third Quarter of 2012, reflecting continued strong underwriting
performance across all product lines.
Homeowner premiums grew 4% for the quarter, and the combined ratio was 84.3%,
compared to 76.2% in the corresponding quarter last year. CAT losses accounted for 11.1
points of the homeowners combined ratio in the Third Quarter of 2013, compared to only
2.4 points in the Third Quarter of 2012. Excluding CAT, the Third Quarter homeowners
combined ratio improved to 73.2% in 2013 from 73.8% in the same period a year ago.
Personal auto premiums increased 9%, reflecting strong growth both in the US and
outside the US. The combined ratio of 95.8% for personal auto was similar to the 95.3%
we had in the Second Quarter but higher than the particularly strong 92% in the Third
Quarter a year ago.
In other personal lines, premiums were flat, reflecting growth in personal excess, offset
primarily by the loss of a large accident program in Latin America. The combined ratio for
other personal improved to 94.9% from 95.5% in the Third Quarter a year ago.
In the Third Quarter of 2013, we experienced continued growth in US policy count for both
homeowners and personal auto, which were up 1% and 3%, respectively. Quality retention
for homeowners in the US was 90%, which is down less than 1 point from the same period

Page 5 of 24

a year ago. That is a strong result, given the multiple price increases we have
implemented over the past three years.

FINAL

US policy retention for personal auto was 89% and has remained consistent over the last
six quarters.
Turning now to claims corporate-wide. In the Third Quarter of 2013, the impact of
catastrophe losses was $92 million before tax, accounting for three points of the
combined ratio and evenly split between CAT losses in the US and outside the US. The
Third Quarter a year ago, we had CAT losses of $17 million before tax, accounting for
0.6percentage points of the combined ratio. For the first nine months of 2013,
catastrophe losses were $347 million before tax, or 3.9 points of the combined ratio. This
compares with $264 million, or 3 points in the first nine months of 2012.
Now I'll turn it over to Ricky, who will review our financial results in more detail.

Ricky Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Dino. Looking first at our operating results, we had strong underwriting income of
$443 million in the quarter. Property and casualty investment income after tax was down
6% to $280 million due to lower reinvestment rates in both our domestic and international
fixed maturity portfolios.
Net income was slightly higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized
investment gains before tax of $18 million, or $0.04 after tax. Net realized investment
gains included $0.06 per share of net realized gain from our alternative investments.
For comparison, in the Third Quarter of 2012, net income was the same as operating
income, as net unrealized gains from the sales of securities were offset by $0.12 per share
of net realized losses from our alternative investments.
Unrealized appreciation before tax at September 30, 2013 was $2 billion, which was
unchanged from the amount of the end of the Second Quarter. The total carrying value of
our consolidated investment portfolio was $43 billion as of September 30, 2013. The
composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter, and the
average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 3.9 years and the average credit rating
is AA3.
We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At September 30, 2013,
our holding company portfolio had $1.9 billion of investments, including approximately
$660 million of short-term investments.
Book value per share under GAAP at September 30 was $62.04, compared to $60.45 at
year-end 2012 and $60.99 a year ago. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate
was available for sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was $58.52, compared to $53.80
at 2012 year end and $53.96 a year ago.

FINAL

As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the Third
Quarter of 2013, our prior-year reserves by SBU as follows. In CPI, we had about $20
million, CTI had about $100 million, CSI had about $70 million, and reinsurance assumes
had an insignificant amount, bringing our total favorable development to about $190
million for the quarter.
This represents a favorable impact on the Third Quarter combined ratio of about 6 points
overall, including slightly less than half a point from catastrophes. For comparison, in the
Third Quarter of 2012, we had about $145 million of favorable development for the
Company overall, including $25 million in CPI, $70 million in CCI, $35 million in CSI, and $15
million in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the Third
Quarter of 2012 was about 5 points overall with no impact from catastrophes.
For the Third Quarter of 2013, our X-CAT accident-year combined ratio was 88.6%,
compared to 90.6% in last year's Third Quarter, an improvement of 2 points.

Bloomberg Transcript

During the Third Quarter, our loss reserves decreased by $79 million, including a decrease
of $68 million for the insurance business and a decrease of $11 million for the reinsurance
assumed business, which is in runoff. The overall decrease in reserves reflects a decrease
of about $60 million related to catastrophes, and the impact of currency translation of loss
reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $75 million.
Turning to capital management, during the Third Quarter, we repurchased approximately
3.8 million shares at an aggregate cost of $326 million. The average cost of our
repurchases in the quarter was $86.17 per share. The end of the Third Quarter, we had
$433 million available for share repurchases under our current authorization. And as we
said previously, we expect to complete this program by the end of January 2014.
Let me conclude with a few comments on the revised guidance we announced in today's
press release.
As John mentioned, based on our nine-month results and our outlook for the Fourth
Quarter, we are revising our 2013 full-year operating income-per-share guidance to a
range of $7.90 to $8.00 from the previous guidance range of $7.30 to $7.50. This revised
guidance is based on operating income per share of $5.97 in the first nine months and an
estimated range of $1.93 to $2.03 for the Fourth Quarter. The revised guidance assumes
2percentage points of tax for the Fourth Quarter, which would result in 3.4 points of CATs
for the calendar year. This compares to the full-year CAT assumption of 4.6 points
included in our previous guidance, the decrease being due to the lower-than-expected
CATs in the Third Quarter. The effect on 2013 operating income per share of each point
of CATs for the full year is approximately $0.30. The impact on Fourth Quarter operating
income per share of each point of Fourth Quarter CAT is approximately $0.08. The
revised guidance is also based on an assumption of 259 million average diluted shares
outstanding for the full-year, unchanged from our previous guidance.
And now I'll turn it back to John.

FINAL

Thanks, Ricky. Let me summarize a few of the key highlights of the Third Quarter. We had
operating income of $529 million, or $2.06 per share. Our annualized ROE was 13.9% and
annualized operating ROE was 14.8%. We produced an X-CAT combined ratio 82.7%, a 3
point improvement over the year-earlier Third Quarter.
Our X-CAT accident year combined ratio was 88.6%, a 2 point improvement over the
Third Quarter last year. We continue to secure rate increases in all three business units.
CAT book value per share at September 30, 2013 was $62.04, up 2% from a year earlier
and up 3% from year-end 2012.
And we returned a total of $440 million to shareholders for share repurchases and
dividends. For the first nine months of 2013, operating income totaled $1.6 billion. On a
per-share basis, operating income for the first nine months was $5.97 per share, an 18%
increase over last year and the highest nine-month operating income per share in Chubb
history.

Bloomberg Transcript

Annualized operating ROE for the first nine months was 14.7% and annualized ROE was
15%. The combined ratio for the first nine months was 86.4%, and the X-CAT combined
ratio was 82.5%. And during the first nine months, we returned a total of $1.3 billion to
shareholders, including $975 million in share repurchases plus $342 million in dividends.
Our strong performance in the first nine months of the year has enabled us to increase
our 2013 operating income per share guidance to a range of $7.90 to $8.00. The midpoint
of our revised guidance is $0.55 higher than the midpoint of our prior guidance of $7.30 to
$7.50. In summary, we had a great Third Quarter, and we continue to be encouraged by
firm rate trends in the market.
Before opening it up to your questions, I want to take a moment to discuss the
management-related decisions that we announced today. First, our Board has decided to
waive Chubb's mandatory retirement policy that would have required that I retire at the
end of 2014 and have asked me to remain as Chairman, President, and CEO until
December 31, 2016. I've agreed to do so. I appreciate the Board's high level of
satisfaction with Chubb's performance during my tenure, and I remain committed to
working with the Board and our strong management team to continue to produce
superior results going forward.
Second, with respect to my management team to broaden the experience of the top
three members -- namely Paul Krump, Dino Robusto, and Ricky Spiro -- and to further
enhance their[ph] ability to contribute to the leadership of the Company in the future,
we're making the following changes effective January 1, 2014.
Paul, who is currently President of commercial and specialty lines, will become president of
personal lines and claims and will retain responsibility for our accident and health business.

Page 8 of 24

Dino, who is currently President of personal lines and claims, will become President of
commercial and specialty lines and will retain responsibility for information technology.

FINAL

Ricky will remain Chief Financial Officer and will assume responsibility for corporate
development.
Paul, Dino, and Ricky have all contributed greatly to Chubb's success, and I'm sure they will
contribute even more in these new roles. They are a key part of the strong management
team at Chubb, which is one of the reasons I agreed to stay on a Chubb for the coming
years. And now we'll be glad to take your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Amit Kumar, Macquarie Capital.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Congrats on the announcement that you'll be staying 'til 2016. I think the real reason is
that you enjoy these conference calls too much with us. So that (inaudible).
But very quickly moving on, the first question is on pricing in CCI. If I understand this
correctly, when you talked about the different buckets, all else being equal, as the quality
of the book has improved, it is likely that the headline pricing number will directionally
move downwards going forward. Is that fair?

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

I think that's fair within reason. I mean the order of magnitude's not going to take it from
(inaudible) it's going to take it from 8 to zero or anything like that. But certainly the more -you get a little bit higher retention because you have a higher-quality book, you have less
rate needs. And you're not getting the big increases in the lower-quality book, where you
were losing a lot of business and, therefore, you see that we have lower volume in that
book. It's not a bad thing -- a higher-quality book, it's obviously a good thing. But you
expect some creep down with them[ph].

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Do you have some sense of an early view as to what you might have seen in October?

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

I'll let Paul answer that.

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

Sure. Amit, thanks for the question. I would say that in October the data is not yet
conclusive, obviously, because we're only -- we haven't ended the month yet. But we do
Page 9 of 24



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2013-10-24

FINAL

get preliminary data, and we obviously get a lot of anecdotal input from our field staff. At
this point, I would say that most of the lines are quite firm. We have sensed that monoline
property is coming under a little bit more of competition in the month of October. That
said, I don't want to give you any impression that it is falling off the cliff. It's clearly still
running comfortably above lost cost trend, but we did sense a little bit more competition
on the monoline property book.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. The only other question, and I will stop, is in terms of lost cost trends, specifically
could you just broadly address has there been any change in the lost cause trends in
either Professional Liability or in workers comp over the past few months? Thanks.

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Are you talking longer-term lost cost trends?

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

The answer is -- the short answer, Amit, is no. There's been no change there. You can
think broadly of across all of the Professional Liability lines around 4%, 4.5% for lost cost.
Workers' compensation obviously varies a bit by state, but we haven't changed any of our
lost cost trends over the last couple of months. And, clearly, we take a longer-term view
whenever we think about lost cost trends.

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

I would say that while trends vary in frequency, which would make many which are
microeconomic or a change that quickly, we have obviously been running actual losses
below trends and actual losses below expectation. And some of it has to do with luck.
We've talked in the past about large fire losses and non-CAT related weather. Some of it
has to do with all of the underwriting and the calling we've done where we have much
more -- much better new-business book and a much better book overall.
So trend is one part of cost as you look forward. But you also ought to take into account
underwriting strategies and initiatives, too.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. Okay, that's -- I'll stop here. Thanks for the answers.

FINAL

First question is regards to Chubb International operations, which I guess I haven't talked
about as much. Any areas of particular focus or rates maybe on adequate or scale hasn't
been achieved? And maybe you can also just touch on quickly the competitive
environment within accident and health. Thanks.

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

Sure. Why don't I take a stab with that. You know, taking the latter part, accident and
health, our -- globally, our two main competitors are AIG and ACE. We've been growing
our book of business overseas very nicely. This past quarter, we did lose one large
account due to an acquisition down in Latin America that Dino mentioned. But aside from
that, it's been growing quite nicely, and that market is growing nicely.
As respects, the rates overseas -- they been very consistent for the last couple of
quarters in the commercial space. I think the UK is probably -- and Canada are the more
firm marketplaces. Australia came down a little bit in this past quarter. But you have to
recognize after the number of catastrophes they had in the past couple of years, we got
a lot of cumulative rate increase there.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our book in Asia and Latin America, frankly, is so different because it's so specialized. I
don't think we're a great bellwether to look at those markets in their entirety. But the type
of rate increases we've been getting, the low single-digit numbers, are very consistent
with what has been running in the last couple of quarters.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. Lastly, $433 million left under the current repurchase authorization,
should we expect a new announcement in January within an 8-K?

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

You know, as always, we expect that our Board will review our future buyback plans in
January, so beyond that I really can't comment.

there was every reason to continue to work at it. So I'm more than happy.

FINAL

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

All right. I mean, I guess what I'm getting at is it's been pretty clear who the potential
internal front runners are for the CEO succession addition, and I'm just trying to -- given
that there's three individuals who been in place for quite some time, I'm just trying to
understand why extend it out another two years as opposed to making that change at the
end of 2014?

A - John Finnegan

I don't think the executive committee members have been in their job an untoward long
period of time. As you remember, John (inaudible) was Chief Operating Officer only three
years ago. But I don't think you'd be asking the question if we happen to be -- we didn't
happen to be one of the very rare companies that have a mandatory retirement age. I
think the Board took a clean-sheet approach and they decided they have the discretion to
waive it or not, what was in the best interest of shareholders. And they believe that the
continuity of the current leadership team with me as CEO was in the best interest of
shareholders. It's not a referendum on the capabilities of the executive committee
members.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Of course not. Okay, thanks for clarifying that. Have there been any changes in Chubb's
reinsurance buying strategy?

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

No. Again, it's (inaudible) we don't buy all that much reinsurance. We tend to be more of a
gross-line underwriter. Our CAT program and most of our other major property programs
don't come up for renewal until April 1, and so no changes to speak of.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Okay. And then last issue, with Chubb on track this year in terms of share buybacks plus
dividends to turn around $1.3 billion in capital, and the Company also on track to generate
probably at least $1.7 billion in retained earnings, I'm just wondering why the share
buyback phase isn't a little more significant compared to, say, the $2 billion that Chubb
was doing back in 2010.

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Again, you know we -- when we announced our program back in January, we did say that,
as a guide, the size of the program was roughly equal to at the time what we thought our
projected 2013 operating income less shareholder dividends was going to be. However,
the size of the program is not intended to simply adjust automatically based on our
quarterly results or our earnings expectations change.

In fact, our expectation for earnings is only one of the factors that we take into
consideration when we set the size of the share buyback at the beginning of the year.
Other things we think about include our capital position, our valuation for the prevailing
insurance market environment, and portfolio investment opportunity cost. And so for
example, as you know, the recent rise in interest rates (inaudible) come off a little bit
recently have negatively impacted our excess capital position by reducing the size of the
unrealized appreciation of our bond portfolio. Although this is partially offset by the
positive impact of higher rates on our reserve discount.
So, putting all those pieces together, as a result, we believe that our current program is a
sizable program which appropriately balances all these considerations, including the
economic opportunities we see in the market with the retention of a strong capital
position. And, as I mentioned earlier, we would expect that our Board will review our
future buyback plans again in January.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

The first question is on the competitive environment. Just curious as to what that is on the
commercial line side. And curious about whether you think you have achieved adequate
rate on your entire book. And so, will you be pushing for rate in excess of lost cost trends
next year?

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

As I mentioned -- Vinay, this is Paul. Why don't I talk a little bit about rate adequacy and
then touch on the competitive environment a little bit. But as I mentioned earlier, we've
been working very hard to improve the overall quality of our book of business and move it
closer to being rate-adequate. This has entailed all of that differentiated renewal rate
increases, disproportionately non-renewing worst performers, trying to retain more of the
better performers, and finally writing the bulk of new business in the segment scenarios
where we believe the rates are at or close to being adequate.
You know, however, given the current catastrophe loads, we're not just talking about Third
Quarter. You've got to really look at the last five or six years and what's going on out there
as it respects to the weather. I would suggest that, given those CAT loads as well as
today's low reinvestment yields, it really shouldn't be surprising to anyone that the overall
book is still not currently at adequate rate levels to achieve our long-run ROE targets,
again, using new-money yields. Even when we achieve our long-run target, Vinay, we
touched on this before. You know, we've got that lost cost trend out there so we're going
to be pushing very hard.

FINAL

So we feel good about all the improvements in the overall book of business. We think the
market environment has certainly helped us a lot in the last couple of years. We think the
market environment continues to be quite good, certainly very good in the Professional
Liability line. But we're going to keep driving for rate increases across the board, but
we're going to differentiate them and do them on a granular account-by-account basis.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure, fair enough. That's helpful. The second question is on the personal (inaudible) side.
You guys had very strong growth this quarter on the personal auto side. Could you help
me understand what's happening there, please? Thanks.

A - Dino Robusto

{BIO 15021398 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, hi -- Dino. Obviously, quite pleased with our progress in growing auto. And, more
specifically, really cross-selling to our homeowners customer in the US, which has been a
strategy of ours so that now we're getting both growth internationally, which we had been
getting for several years, and also domestically. It's really -- it's a function of the continued
investment we make in our sophisticated segmented auto-pricing tool that I'd referenced
before called Panorama. It's really allowing us to bring a high-quality product and service
offering at a competitive-enough price level that's attractive to our targeted niche, which
is the high net worth, a very specific niche. Given that today, we only have roughly a third
of our Chubb homeowner customers have auto coverage with us, we have a lot more
opportunity and so we're going to continue to push that strategy going forward and
continue to invest in our sophisticated analytics.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thank you, very much. Just kind of running some quick numbers and please let me know if
these are wrong. But it looks like if you don't include development, the ROE is probably
somewhere in the 11%-ish range. And then if we adjust for new-money yields, we're
probably closer to the high single digits, maybe very low double digits. I'm just wondering
like, in terms of now being an opportunity to grow, is it that you see the ability to -- as
maybe Paul was mentioning before, to adjust the profitability in the book from here so
that on the forward, that ROE starts to gradually improve? Or how should we think about
lining those up? And again, let me of my math is wrong because it certainly could be.

A - Ricky Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

It's Ricky. Let me just put the math in perspective. If you take the X-CAT accident year ROE
that we had in the quarter of 88.6, add on top of that a normalized CAT load whatever
that is -- and you know what we've generally assumed for CATs as we put out our
Page 14 of 24



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2013-10-24

FINAL

guidance at the beginning of the year, as an example. You do get to an accident year ROE
on the business we're writing today that is high single-digit, low double-digit. And to put
that in perspective, we have an ROE target of 10% plus the cost of inflation over time. So,
generally, we think of that ROE target as being higher than that number, and that's the
reason, as Paul mentioned earlier, that we're still pushing hard on the rate side because
we are not at rate adequacy.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

Got it, got it. And then so as far as Professional Liability book is concerned in particular, I
think that one is one where you've done a great job getting rate and certainly the profile
of the book has improved significantly. But that one in particular you're growing now. And
it looks like if all of that development in that segment is in Professional Liability, you're still
right at around 100%. So is that -- now, I'm guessing that the good business that you are
writing and keeping and then the bad business that you are -- or the less good business, I
should say -- that you're taking a lot of rate on and maybe losing some of is going to allow
you to bring that number down more rapidly than it's come down so far? Is that fair?

A - John Finnegan

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Let me talk. This a little nuanced. I mean, the fact is that we did have some positive
development assurities[ph] to begin with. So probably running high 90s[ph] accident year
combined ratio right now. But you shouldn't compare that to the first two quarters; it's a
little bit better, but a lot of that is seasonal and expenses, and there's a point here, point
there. But it's not going to prove during the current year because we don't get enough
feedback. We established it based on what we think rate will be, what we think loss trends
will be. We get very little data on the current accident year. So it's kind of what it is; it's
running 98[ph] now.
Now, if I look at it compared to last year, our loss ratio is about 4 points better than the
same quarter last year. So that's an improvement. I look at the rates we're getting, and
what we see is very manageable -- all of a sudden much more manageable lost cost
trends. And I think that we're talking about -- we're hoping that by next year, we'll be in
the mid-90s on an accident year basis in Professional Liability. Now, time will tell; if we get
the kind of rate increases we're getting this year, we should definitely be there. That's a
pretty significant improvement.
And while we'd like to be in the low 90s[ph], this is a line that we try to reserve
appropriately for and precisely for, but it is a line. For seven years, we've run pretty
substantial favorable development in this line. So one could argue we do end up -- we're
a pretty conservative Company.
In terms of growth, I wouldn't get overwhelmed. Growth was 4% in the Third Quarter; it's
been 2% year to date. That's hardly a heckuva lot of growth. When you -- what you're
talking about is we'll get 8 points of rate. So 8 points of rate and 2 points of growth is not
growing a lot. Now, to be fair, we're not getting 8 points of rate worldwide; we're
probably getting 6. But it's still a lot more than the 4% growth, even. And so we're not
really -- this isn't growing that much. And we've gone through a number of years, it was
negative growth.
Page 15 of 24

FINAL

So the answer is we hope to grow it a little bit more, we think that this business will
perform better than maybe we're booking it at. You won't see that on the current
accident year. You've seen some improvement in the current versus last accident year,
and I think you'll see some fairly significant improvement going forward next year in our
accident year combined ratios and Professional Liability.

Thank you for taking the call. And congratulations. Obviously, a good quarter and
(inaudible) strong results from a lot of hard work. The question is you were just(inaudible)
moreso the -- sort of the transition, I think, from -- it sounds like it has been sort of
(inaudible) but particularly notable sort of profit take -- sorry -- rate-taking at the expense
of volume over the past couple of years. You are starting to (inaudible) obviously. You're
still shrinking units. The new business ratio is coming back up. It sounds like maybe you're
going to be a bit more balanced in the rate-taking. Should we think about you guys
actually maintaining flat units or actually having a chance to grow more in CCI and CSI next
year for 2014?

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

This is Paul, Josh. Why don't I take a stab it at that. First of all, when we talk about the
improvement in the new-to-loss ratios, I want to be fair and point out candid here that
some of that improvement is definitely coming from the increase in retention. Clearly, as
the renewable book is improved and we've done all that calling, we see in need -- a
desire to be able to hang onto a lot more business. So that certainly is something that we
are mindful of.
That said, I don't want to put too much emphasis on that because in any given month or
even a quarter when you start talking about Professional Liability or CCI lines[ph], you
could lose a deal or a couple of large deals and that can move your number a little bit.
But, clearly, as the markets continue to improve, and they are, there are more
opportunities for us to be able to find good business.
When you look at workers' compensation as an example within CCI, half of the new
business that we wrote came from accounts that we already had the package and auto
and comp on. So we're able to round out as workers' compensation rates move up. The
other half, obviously, is coming from the rate increases on the rentals. But, clearly, the
market and some lines coming closer to what we think is good pricing, solid pricing, and
we'll take advantage of that whenever we can.

Q - Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

That's helpful. I wonder if we could also just follow up on the point I think John made
earlier about pricing isn't going to go from 8% to zero. One of the dynamics I've been
interested in is simply just the Fourth Quarter is the first time that customers have started
getting rate increases of any material size in the Third Quarter -- the Fourth Quarter of
2011. This will be the third time you'd have to have some sort of rate increase. And I'm
wondering how you're communicating around that issue with your underwriters and in
conversations with brokers, how you're sort of trying to keep everybody focused on
driving pricing while hitting these sort of mid to high single-digit levels that have been
down for some time.

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Let me clarify my comment. I didn't mean rates aren't going from 8% to zero. I don't think
they are, but I think (inaudible) in answer to the question as, would we expect to see
lower rate increases (inaudible) of the improved quality of our book. And I'd say yes, we
would expect directionally to see them. I said, but you know, the quality of the book only is
going to bear a certain burden in that area. You're not going to see rates go from 8% to
zero just because you have an improved quality of the book. That would take a significant
swing in the market.
And I'll turn it over to Paul for the second part of the question.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

Yes, Josh I spend a lot of time with clients and brokers out there, and clearly this is a topic
of gee, now we're going into whatever the third round of rate increases or something.
Not to sound glib, but I don't remember that conversation ever happening after seven
rounds of rate decreases in the past. So that's the first thing that I'd kind of to toss out
there.
But, again, better underwriters are really doing a lot of segmentation of their book of
business, and they're looking back at the history of the account. You walk into a client and
you -- and an agent, and you explain to them what the history of their customer has been,
where their price decreases have been over the years, where the price increases have
been, what's actually happened. And then you start talking to people honestly about lost
cause trend.
And maybe you'd be in California and talking to people about their workers' comp and
pointing out to them that their lost cost trend there is in the high single digits. So they
know what's happening in the marketplace. They know what's happening with the
weather. They know about low interest rates. So you try to build on the fact that you're
being logical and you are trying to be fair in what you're asking for.
I would say overwhelmingly our producers and agents support us, a lot of the clients
obviously support us, and -- you know, but you don't win them all.

Good evening and congrats on an excellent quarter. Wanted to just ask about the
guidance today relative to January. As I look at it, you guys are -- the midpoint of your
current range is $1.35 above the midpoint of the January range, maybe 30-something
cents is due to catastrophes coming in lower than you thought. So perhaps that's some
degree of luck. But really there is a buck[ph] or so where you guys are just beating
numbers. And it doesn't seem to be in share count and net investment income, it's just
underwriting. And so my question is what -- relative to what you thought the world would
be in January, what has broken so demonstrably better in the projection versus today?
And then, obviously, what does that mean to 2014? How do we think about 2014 then as
well?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

I think in broad terms, we've got a benefit from (inaudible), you're right. We achieved rate
-- we weren't as certain going into the year we get the kind of we got. And that was an
improvement, so margin expansion continued. Also though, as we said on a number of
calls, we've benefited from some good fortune in the terms of losses being below trend
lines, whether it be non-cash related weather; fire losses, especially in -- you see that in
homeowners to some degree. You've seen a terrific year in terms of large losses in the
property line. We just had a substantial benefit. So some of that is luck.
And also you've seen a lot of development -- development at last year's levels, which you
probably wouldn't have -- we definitely didn't anticipate coming into the year. (multiple
speakers) 2014, I think you got to make your own judgments. You guys can project out
margin expansion, although you only have half of the puzzle. You have this year's rates,
half of which will go into 2014. You have to anticipate what 2014 rates will be to come up
with a margin expansion idea.
You probably have to believe that there's going to be some reversion to the norm in
terms of large losses and good fortune. And you can make your own judgment on where
favorable development should be. I assume 2014 will be a good year, but I can't -- other
than directionally, I really -- we've had a lot of good things happen this year and don't
know if they'll all happen again next year. But the baseline trend, the longer-term trend, is
positive, at least in today's market with the rate we're getting.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Right. The biggest thing, John, I'm trying to get is just the sizing of the non-CAT large
losses that you mentioned. Any kind of sense year to date how much better that's been in
terms of combined ratio points?

FINAL

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

No, it hasn't been inconsequential. It depends if you add homeowners and things like that.
Probably a point, I'd say. I'm just -- maybe a point.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Okay. And, again, so you have your normal CAT load; you have your point there. And then
you start to build it off of that for next year. Okay. That makes sense.
Next would be maybe for Ricky, just on net investment income. It's kind of coming into
where you said it was going to be. You know, at what point can we actually see the net
investment income decline to begin to abate? Just how does the roll work from what's
coming off versus what's going in?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Ricky Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

Yes, it's obviously -- it's a little complicated because there are a lot of other pieces to the
puzzle than just the reinvestment yield. You have cash flows, you have buyback; and things
impact that. And without giving you specifics, I think as we look out, I think certainly we
would expect that over the next year and maybe the next two years, you will see a
decline still on investment income, but it will be at a much smaller percentage decline than
it was this year. As the portfolio has been rolling over the last few years and the overall
book yield has been coming down as it relates to the fact that we been reinvesting for
two or three years now at lower rates.
So you will still see a bit of a decline, but it should be a smaller decline than what we've
seen this year.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Okay, very clear. And then last is just -- on the buyback, is there any level at which you
wouldn't buy back your stock? I mean, the shares look to be at about 1.5 times book or so,
and continued evaluation keeps rising.

A - Ricky Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

Yes, always a good thing that the evaluation keeps rising. We have no bright lines
regarding valuation, and there's no single price or multiple that currently makes us
uncomfortable. In our view, the intrinsic value of our shares, which ultimately impacts our
share repurchase decisions, is a moving target as macroeconomic industry and certainly
Company-specific dynamics continue to evolve. And as good stewards of our balance
sheet, we constantly review our alternative investment opportunities and other uses for
excess capital. And we understand that at some share price level, it may theoretically

Page 19 of 24



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2013-10-24

make more sense to pursue other capital management options. At this time, however, we
remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders, and we still perceive
attractive economic opportunities in repurchasing our shares at the current stock price. So
the answer is we don't see that point where we sit today.

FINAL

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Okay, so steady as she goes there. But you mentioned other things you can do sort of to
my mind as a special dividend. What are some of the other things you could do with
excess capital if the valuation went to some insane level?

A - Ricky Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

Well, obviously, you mentioned that. Clearly, the number-one priority for us and anyone
running a business would be to reinvest in the business if we saw significant growth
opportunities.

Bloomberg Transcript

We happen to be in a position today where we think we have enough excess capital to
support any growth in the business as well as continue our buyback programs. But should
we find ourselves in a period where we see significant growth opportunities, we would
certainly be willing to reinvest. Now, bear in mind, we went through the whole rate
adequacy discussion earlier, so where we are today, there's certainly (inaudible) maybe
some growth opportunities on the margin, we certainly don't see that significant growth
opportunity.
And then lastly, one that John has talked about in the past, mergers and acquisitions,
that's not something that's high on our priority list. So our priorities would be to invest in
the business and then return any excess capital to shareholders.

of the financial statements of insurance companies, and we continue to hold that same
position. And we are concerned about the possible loss of usability and transparency that

Thank you. A couple of questions. John, you have talked about for the nine months that
obviously was a bit of luck with non-CAT weather or large fire losses. Did that aid this
quarter's results at all, or was this quarter more in line with what you would have thought?

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

I would say in the homeowners business, the GAAP closed a little bit in the Third Quarter
so it wasn't unusually low either in non-CAT related weather or fire. It's a little bit better
year to date, but property and marine still benefited from low large losses.

but we can't take credit for all of it.

FINAL

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

No, fair enough. And then the other question was -- on the favorable reserve
development, I'm wondering if you could give us a bit more color as far as what lines of
business and what accident years that was coming from.

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Our overall favorable development is pretty easy -- it was brought the favorable across all
the accident years this quarter and actually for the nine months too, including the nine
months of strong contribution for accident year 2012 driven by much better than expected
results in commercial property.

A - Ricky Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And Jay, if you want a little more color behind each of the business units in CPI, all three of
our lines were favorable in the quarter. In CCI, all four lines contributed some favorable
development, and most of the favorable development was in the property, marine, and
package area including some favorable CAT development. In CSI, both Professional
Liability and surety were favorable, and the favorable development in Professional Liability
was driven by D&O and fiduciary. And as I mentioned, in our reinsurance assume business,
it was an insignificant amount this quarter.

Just one or two quick ones here. First, Paul, just wondering the casualty combined ratio
has been kind of ticking up the last couple of quarters and is at kind of highest level it's
been in it looks like in a couple of years. Anything going on there?

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

Let me start by pointing out that the year-ago Third Quarter result of 89.2 in casualty was
unusually good compared to the surrounding quarters. So we've got tough comps there.
And that was good due to the substantial amount of favorable development in the excess
umbrella class. We saw some continued favorable development in excess umbrella in this
year's Third Quarter, but just not as much.

In addition, in this quarter we did see some largely offsetting adverse development in the
other portions of casualty, and that was really driven particularly by the general liability
class where we had one claim with some large unexpected development on it. So that's
really what's behind all that.

Great. Thanks. And just want to go over the personal lines. On homeowners insurance, I'm
just curious, are we getting close to where kind of rate adequacy and are -- have we seen
any kind of policies (inaudible) growth there or is that kind of been flattish declining? And
are we at a position where we might start see that grow again?

A - Ricky Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

Yes, so as I indicated, our policy enforced growth continues, right? It was up on
homeowners -- went up on 3 points. In terms of rate adequacy, we're going to continue
to file an average about mid-single-digit increases for homeowners, about low single
digits for auto, and obviously these vary granularly by geography. That's really just a
function of the fact that we've had a lot of increased weather in catastrophe activity, and
as Paul indicated earlier, every year you've got your lost cost trend above 4 points running
on homeowners.

So we're going to continue to push that forward. Our retention, as I indicated in our
opening comments, holding up really well in auto and even on homeowners really over
the course of multiple years of price increases. It's really only moved down less than a
point.
So, we think in the face of our rate increases, we're holding our own really effectively and
we'll keep pushing it.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Has the competitive landscape increased at all in that area? Like (inaudible) out there is a
bunch of guys.

A - Ricky Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

There's been a couple of new entrants in the high net worth space over the last few
years. And it's clearly generating a little bit more competition. Having said that, I think it's
important to realize that the high net worth business is really -- the majority of it is not with
a small number of high net worth specialists including us. Rather, it's with a lot of even
direct writers more likely simply driven by the fact of their sheer size. So, we focus on
delivering our superior product and service really across its broader competitive
landscape rather than focusing on any one competitor. And we've been very pleased with
our strong performance, notwithstanding really any change in the competitive landscape.
So, steady as she goes.

Great, thank you.
