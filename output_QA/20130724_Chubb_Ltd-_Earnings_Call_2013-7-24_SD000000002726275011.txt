Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. ACE produced record quarterly earnings that were driven by
excellent underwriting and investment results. P&C premium revenue growth was
particularly strong and all divisions of the Company contributed to the good financial
performance.
After-tax operating income for the quarter was $790 million, up 6.3%, or $2.29 per share,
both records for the Company. Our operating return on equity was 12.3%, and in the first
six months of the year we have produced over $1.5 billion in after-tax operating income
with an ROE that is north of 12%.
Book value in the quarter declined 2.3% due to the rise in interest rates which reduced the
unrealized gains in our investment portfolio. Given we are fundamentally buy-and-hold
fixed income investors, this is in essence an accelerated recognition of a loss that would
have amortized in over time anyway as our bonds mature. The flipside, of course, is that
our reinvestment rate has improved by about 60 basis points for a portfolio of similar
distribution, and this will benefit our income over years to come.
Tangible book value was additionally impacted by our two Mexican acquisitions which
closed during the quarter. We are excited about our prospects in Mexico and our teams
are actively engaged in bringing our vision to reality. Phil will have more to say about our
book and tangible book value and the impact of rates on our investment portfolio.

FINAL

Our underwriting results in the quarter were again simply excellent. We produced $434
million of P&C underwriting income, up nearly 16%, with a combined ratio of 87.9%.
The end of the quarter was active in terms of natural catastrophes with the tornadoes in
the US and the floods in Europe and Canada. Total pre; and after-tax cat losses this
quarter were $81 million and $66 million, respectively. Though following the end of the
quarter, we have had preliminary indications of additional losses that could add about $10
million pretax of development on these cats and this will show up in our Third Quarter
results.
Positive prior-period reserve development was up modestly from last year and, again, Phil
will provide more details on these items.
Similar to the First Quarter, current accident year underwriting was a substantial
contributor to our overall calendar year underwriting results. Current accident year
underwriting income, excluding catastrophes, was up 21% over prior year with a combined
ratio of 89.2%. This was a 1.2 points better than the Second Quarter last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

In fact, on a current accident year ex-cat basis operating income was $2.17 per share
versus $2.01 per share last year. The current accident year results reflect the excellent
underlying health of our current business, including global growth in earned premium with
continued margin improvement in North America as a result of better pricing and mix of
business and margin improvement internationally as a result of product and geographic
mix.
P&C net premiums in the quarter grew over 8.5% on a constant dollar basis with foreign
exchange negatively impacting that number by 1.5 points on a published basis. Growth
came broadly from all regions of the world, but with particularly strong results from North
America, Asia, and Latin America.
In North America, retail, commercial, and specialty P&C net premiums were up nearly 12%
while our wholesale specialty business was up over 6%. Net premiums for our agriculture
business were down, in line with our expectations, due primarily to an increase in the
amount of crop reinsurance we purchased. We estimate full-year crop insurance net
premiums to be down about $315 million from prior year and again in line with our
expectations.
Internationally, commercial P&C premiums in ACE International, our retail business, were
up 9%. We saw growth in commercial P&C in every territory except the continent of
Europe, which was flat. Latin America led with net premium growth of 25% followed by the
UK at 10% and Asia at 6%.
Premiums in our London-based excess and surplus lines business were down 4% where
competition has increased steadily in the last few quarters, particularly in property and
professional lines related businesses.

FINAL

In our global A&H business net premiums were up over 6% in the quarter in constant
dollars, reflecting improved growth as we predicted. Growth was driven by our ACE
International business, which was up 11%, led by Latin America, Asia, and Europe.
Strong growth in our global personal lines business continued in the quarter. In the US
premiums in ACE Private Risk Services, our high net worth personal lines business, were
up over 10%, whereas internationally personal lines premiums were up 70%, reflecting the
contributions from our acquisitions in Mexico. Excluding these, we had growth of over
20%.
International life insurance revenue was up 29% on a constant dollar basis with the strong
growth coming mainly from our operations in Asia.
Finally, our Global Re business was down about 5%. As you know, the reinsurance market
is quite competitive with an abundance of capacity, particularly in cat, and cat pricing is
down about 5% internationally and 10% to 15% in the US. We expect these trends to
continue for the foreseeable future.

Bloomberg Transcript

I want to say a few words about the current market environment. Our commercial P&C
business in the US continued to benefit from an improved pricing environment with
another quarter of rate-on-rate increases. Overall, North American pricing was up about
4%. While the rate of increase for property-related pricing is moderating, casualty-related
pricing, in fact, accelerated modestly in the quarter with many lines experiencing their
strongest level of rate increase yet.
In ACE USA, our retail business, property rates were up 4% while casualty-related pricing
was up over 4.5%. New business writings grew 5% year on year and that is after growing
new business 44% in the Second Quarter last year. Exposure growth added just over 3%
to our premium growth rate due to increased economic activity and our renewal retention
rate, as measured by premium, was a very good 90% in the quarter.
On the US Wholesale side of our business, rates were up over 4.5% overall with property
rates up about 3% and casualty-related lines up over 7.5%.
Internationally, the retail commercial P&C rate environment remains competitive but
stable with rate growth flat in the quarter overall. Competition constrains our growth as
we strive to maintain portfolio pricing. Rates internationally varied by class and by territory,
but were mostly up or down 1% to 2%.
My colleagues and I can provide further color on market conditions and pricing trends.
As I said earlier in the quarter, we completed our acquisition of ABA Seguros, Mexico's
fourth-largest personal lines company, and as we announced on last quarter's call, we also
completed Mexican surety company Fianzas Monterrey. Both acquisitions are on track, and
as I already noted, are beginning to contribute to premium growth. An example, in the

Page 4 of 25

Company Ticker: ACE AB Equity
Date: 2013-07-24

quarter about half of ACE International's 18% net premium growth came from these
acquisitions.

FINAL

In summary, we had a great quarter and a strong six month's performance. We fired on all
cylinders and as things stand now we expect a continued strong result for the balance of
the year. With that, I will turn the call over to Phil and we will come back and take your
questions.

Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Thank you, Evan. As Evan mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with record operating
results. Cash flow was strong at $895 million. Based on our strong sustained financial
performance, S&P and A.M. Best recently affirmed all of our core ratings and changed
their outlook on ACE to positive. Fitch upgraded us from AA; to AA.
Investment income was $534 million for the quarter, higher than our expected run rate,
primarily due to higher-than-expected private equity distributions. Net realized and
unrealized losses were $1.4 billion pretax and [ph] after-tax for the quarter, resulting
primarily from the effect of higher yields on our fixed income portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

As the fed signaled a potential end in sight to their quantitative easing program, high
grade bonds that benefited from the program were the most significantly impacted by
this shift in rates. Our blended market yield rose 60 basis points during the quarter and
our portfolio movements were in line with market conditions. We remain at an unrealized
gain position of $1.3 billion after-tax.
Future net investment income will be positively impacted as new cash flow and portfolio
turnover will be invested at these higher rates. Current new money rates are 2.9% if we
invested in a similar distribution to our existing portfolio and our current book yield is 3.7%.
We estimate that the current quarterly investment income run rate will be approximately
$525 million, which is subject to variability in portfolio rates, private equity distributions,
and FX.
Our book value per share and our tangible book value per share declined 2.3% and 4.9%,
respectively. Tangible book value was also affected by the impact of goodwill and
intangibles arising from our Mexican acquisitions. Tangible book value per share would
have declined 2.7% excluding these transactions.
The net impact of the mark-to-market change for the variable annuity reinsurance book
was a realized gain of $35 million. This comprised a gross realized gain of about $200
million, primarily related to rising interest rates and increasing equity values, offset by
hedge losses, falling credit spreads, and rising equity market volatilities -- all of which
reduced the gain by approximately $135 million.
An additional $30 million of the gain was reduced by the timing effect, which we describe
in our disclosures as the increase in fair value liability when the VA book continues to run

FINAL

off as we collect premiums and get closer to annuitization claims. The VA result was in line
with our expectations and with our published sensitivities.
During the quarter we had positive prior-period development of $128 million pretax and
$109 million after-tax, with about one-third coming from long-tail and two-thirds from
short-tail lines. Our net loss reserves are up $350 million for the quarter and our paid-toincurred ratio was 83%. Our cat losses were $81 million pretax for the quarter,
approximately half related to the Canadian floods and the remainder related principally to
severe weather events in the US and the European floods.
Our effective tax rate fluctuates based on where our earnings emerge. In this quarter the
effective tax rate is low relative to other quarters, primarily because a greater percentage
of our income was produced in lower tax jurisdictions. In addition, we had a one-off
adjustment to prior-year tax accruals that lowered the rate by 1.5 points.
The Company is issuing updated guidance for full-year 2013 to account for the first-half
positive prior-period reserve development, lower-than-planned catastrophe losses
realized in the first half, better first half current accident year results excluding catastrophe
losses, and higher net investment income in the Second Quarter and expected for the
second half of the year. The range is $7.65 to $8.05 per share in after-tax operating
income for the year. This includes estimated catastrophe losses of $260 million after tax
for the second half of the year. Guidance for the balance of the year is for the current
accident year only.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning and thanks for taking my questions. My first question relates to
pricing; that color was very helpful.
Over the past few days investor focus has been on the sustainability of pricing
improvement in US commercial lines. Evan, what would be very helpful is your view on the
pricing momentum going forward from here.

I don't hold a crystal ball that can predict the future. I can tell you that July pricing was
similar to the Second Quarter pricing. That we have seen the same strong trend we have
been seeing in casualty, which is flood based, continue in July.

FINAL

That is encouraging to us. Beyond that, I simply can't produce -- can't predict the market,
but I am very comfortable about ACE's ability to perform and outperform in any market.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

And any sort of distinction between retail and wholesale going forward?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

There is some distinction. Do you want more specific granularity around that?

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Yes, that would help.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Then I'm going to turn it to John Lupica, who maybe will give you -- because I said it
is broad based. So we will pick five or six lines, seven lines and give you a sense in both
the retail and the wholesale so you will see a little distinction. Casualty pricing in the
wholesale side is a little stronger than the retail side.

A - John Lupica

{BIO 4213297 <GO>}

Sure. Thanks, Evan. I will give you just a little deeper dive into the rate that we are seeing
and also a little bit of the growth that we are seeing in both US retail and the E&S market.
I would like to remind you this is our 27th month in North America that we have been able
to get rate -- it's our ninth quarter and our fifth quarter of rate on rate, so it has been a
healthy, healthy drive for rate in North America. It has been the best that I have seen in
this cycle.
When I look at North America in our larger (inaudible) business, in the quarter we grew the
business 16% with the rate that was up 5.8%. On a year-to-date basis we were able to get
4.5 points of rate. In our professional lines businesses in aggregate we saw 3 points of
growth, 5.7 points of rate in the quarter, and about 5 points of rate for the full year.
If you look at our medical business and other specialty businesses, we saw the growth of
12%, our quarter was up 3%, and the year was up 1.5%. In the general casualty market, the
excess casualties, we saw growth of 13%, the rate of 6.3% in the quarter, and the full-year
rate of 5.3%. Environmental and other casualty specialty line was up 12% in growth, rate
was up 4%, and on a full-year basis it was up 2.9%.
In our property market, where again the rate has been terrifically healthy in the past and
we have currently seen our property retail growth of 26%, the quarter was 3.3% of rate
Page 7 of 25



Company N ame: Chubb Arabia Cooperative I nsurance Co
Company Ticker: ACE AB Equity
Date: 2013-07-24

FINAL

and the year we have seen 3.7% of rate. In our E&S businesses, in our E&S Property we
saw growth of 10%, our rate in the quarter was 3.3%, and our year-to-date rate was 4.7%.
And in our general casualty portfolio we saw growth of 3% in the quarter with a rate of 8%
and a year-to-date rate of 8.5%.
I would like to echo what Evan had noted about July. We are seeing generally the same
trends in our retail casualty market and property market in terms of rate. Risk
management early days, but we have seen it up 6.5%, excess up 5%, and the property
market up 3%. But, again, it certainly is early days and early trades in July.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

So that gives you a better sense of both growth and also sort of the broadness of rate
and that you can see the rate in the Second Quarter is better than the year-to-date rate.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

That is actually quite helpful. The only other quick question I have is on capital deployment.
You talked about the recent acquisitions.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the past you have spent some time talking about I guess a 1.5% drag on ROE. How
should we think about the pipeline, I guess, of potential candidates versus the rate
commentary which you have mentioned? Does that change in any way or is that
completely independent somewhat of the strong pricing you are seeing?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

The pipeline of potential opportunities from an acquisition point of view are completely
independent of anything to do with pricing, number one. Number two, remember
generally the analyst community, and I mean this in a positive way, you have no visibility on
what could be potential out there. There is over 50,000 insurance companies in the world
and it is a big world, and there is a vast amount of opportunity.
If it meets our strategy, advances what we are doing organically in a line or a territory, and
it meets our financial hurdles and return to investors, then we will pull the trigger. It is all
opportunistic. Beyond that I won't really comment except that we are vigilant and we are
paying attention and we are constantly looking.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it, okay. That is quite helpful, thanks for the answers. I will stop here. Thanks.

Company N ame: Chubb Arabia Cooperative I nsurance Co
Company Ticker: ACE AB Equity
Date: 2013-07-24

Good morning. My first question is in regards to ACE's dividend philosophy. So, Evan, you
have said in the past ACE is a growth company. The dividend was raised 4% this past May,
which I guess according to consensus earnings estimate implies a declining payout ratio.

FINAL

So should we be thinking it was raised by 4% because free cash flow growth will be
subdued in the near term? Or maybe we just simply shouldn't be thinking in terms of
managing to a higher payout ratio over time? Then I have a follow-up, thanks.

A - Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

If you look at the history of our dividend, we have increased it about 46% since January of
2012, so a pretty substantial increase. And we think that those increases have enhanced
the returns to the shareholders in a sustained period of low interest rates and it has
enabled us to keep considerable capital flexibility. So --.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

And, no, it signals nothing about cash flow. In fact, as you can see, our cash flow is quite
strong. We are very liquid. And the payout ratio will bounce around a little bit, but it will
average in the similar range over a period of time.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, got it. That is helpful. A numbers question, maybe for Phil.
I noticed the expense ratio in North America insurance, excluding agriculture, declined by
over 150 basis points versus 2Q 2012 levels. Is there a lower expense run rate dynamic
taking place that we should be aware of ?

A - Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

I don't think -- no, I wouldn't count on a lower -- there was a couple of one-off adjustments
to accruals and I wouldn't expect that to be part of the --.

A - John Lupica

{BIO 4213297 <GO>}

If I could add just a little more detail, it really is -- it's the growth in our net earned
premium outpacing our expense dollars so it really is historical in our premium growth.
There is nothing material in the detail.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay, so more it sounds like (multiple speakers)

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Consensus is growing lower than premium.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

(multiple speakers) operating leverage.

FINAL

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

And then it bounces around a little bit by mix of business because some business attracts
a higher commission line than others. So when you grow your very large account business
you are generally going to pay a lower commission than when you are growing your flow
business, and that with the acquisition ratio will bounce around quarter to quarter a little.
Underlying operating expense ratio is very comfortably under control.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Got the mix of the two?

Bloomberg Transcript

Jay Gelb, Barclays.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning. I wanted to touch base first on the underlying combined ratio
in North America P&C and overseas general. We have continued to see year-over-year
improvement in the first half and the results were pretty consistent between First Quarter
and Second Quarter of this year.
So I am just trying to get a read on whether you feel we are at the right baseline now and
whether you feel that result can continue to improve in those two major segments as
earned pricing continues to come through.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, Jay, we will see how the future -- I am not going to predict the future because shorttail business can have -- it will have some variability around the mean to it. I don't know
what you mean by have we hit, are we at a place where we are just comfortable.
We are constantly striving to grow the business and do it at pricing that we think achieves
an adequate rate of return. And as you know, we are willing to make that trade-off in any
line of business where it doesn't meet our hurdle rates or what we think is a reasonable
rate of return given this environment. And that is what the combined ratios represent.

Page 10 of 25



Company N ame: Chubb Arabia Cooperative I nsurance Co
Company Ticker: ACE AB Equity
Date: 2013-07-24

FINAL

Where we see opportunity to write business at what we think is decent enough pricing to
earn a reasonable underwriting margin we are going to keep doing that. The mix will
change a little bit quarter to quarter and that can change the accident year combined ratio
a bit. But the more you get rate and if inflation stays subdued and you keep growing the
business this way then you ought to -- that is only benefits margin.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

That makes sense, okay. Then for Phil, with the run rate of investment income of $525
million we saw that favorable uptick in investment yield on the portfolio. I am wondering if
we kind of roll this foreword should we expect investment income growth in the coming
years as opposed to seeing a slight drag on that metric as a result of low rates.

A - Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

As you can see, our book yield still is above our market yield. So as the portfolio turns
over into the yielding market rates, if market rates were to stay where they are, we think
investment income would say flat on that basis because new money would offset the
decline in investment income that would result as the portfolio moves into the lower rate.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

So that also --?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

I was just going to say we are predicting -- or at least internally -- interest rates will rise,
but that will be seen.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Is this also taking into account growth in the portfolio?

A - Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Yes, that is what I mean. Growth in the portfolio through new cash flow tends to offset
almost directly the degradation in investment income because the portfolio rolls into a
lower yielding rate environment.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Okay. Then one last numbers question. You gave us the impact on the net for agriculture
for the full year. What would that be on a gross basis?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

It will be about flat.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

So around $1.1 billion?

You were trying to catch me, I know.

Operator
Thomas Mitchell, Miller Tabak.

Q - Thomas Mitchell

{BIO 22121384 <GO>}

I was wondering if in the United States in particular, in North America more generally, what
the outlook is for growth in exposures. It looks like your premium growth exceeds your
average pricing increases so that either exposures are growing in the market or you are
taking market share, or maybe a little bit of both. But I am just wondering what the outlook
looks like to you, let's say, today versus six months ago.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, exposure growth and that is a good way to think about it. We got exposure growth
two ways. As I said in the commentary, 3 points of the growth came from exposure
growth on our in-force portfolio, and that is economic activity related, so that speaks to a
firming economy that is reasonably broad based.
The balance came from us growing share in classes of business where we think the
pricing allows us to produce a reasonable underwriting profit. And that is informed by our
portfolio management that, as you know, is quite granular, quite mature, and that we just
focus relentlessly on in here.
It is our decades-long effort to just get more and more insightful about -- in a more
granular way about particular pockets of business that behave differently than other
cohorts where we see an opportunity. And it is there that we grow exposure. So when we
like the pricing to exposure, we will grow exposure. We have the capital and the balance
sheet to do it, and we know our minds and we will not hesitate.

Q - Thomas Mitchell

{BIO 22121384 <GO>}

That is a very good answer. Thank you, very much.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

You are welcome.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Good morning. Just wanted to ask about the acquisitions and the impact in the quarter.
Was any of the increase in guidance related to the acquisitions? In other words, are they
accretive day one and coming through more than we had thought before?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No, not coming through more than we thought and they are not really particularly
contributing towards these revised guidance estimate. And, remember, the revised
guidance we did not increase our estimate for the balance of the year current accident
year. We revised our guidance based on the year-to-date results -- current accident year,
cat, investment income, prior period development -- and then we rolled forward the
investment income. Other than that, for the balance of the year we did not increase.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Okay, good. So no impact to the deals and the guidance, great.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then can you remind us about how impactful these deals will be, maybe in the out-years?
I thought you talked a bit about them in previous quarters as to accretion dilution and
when they will help.

I did a little bit and so this is what -- I will make a couple of comments about them. First, I
do refer you to our annual report shareholder letter that speaks to how the acquisitions
we have made over the last five or seven years have performed in aggregate and how
they have looked versus other means of capital deployment on a return basis. So I return
analysts to that to begin with.
Number two, these acquisitions over a reasonable period of time on an ROE basis, and
when I say reasonable looking out three years, will meet or exceed our hurdle rate, our
ROE hurdle rate. And that is pretty good. In the early period you always have purchase
accounting that weighs on ROE. And on an ROI basis, which is the underlying health of it,
they are extremely accretive and doing quite well.
It is early days on Mexico, but everything we see it's on track, and if anything, it is going to
perform better than we expected at this moment, from what we can tell.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Okay. Then can you just remind us where does the amortization from the deals come
through in the reported P&L? And how much is that now or how much was that in the
quarter?

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thank you. So just wanted to follow up, Evan, if I could on you provided some growth
metrics in the different businesses. Would it be possible to notionally size out wholesale
retail personal lines in North America? Just obviously personal lines has been growing a
bunch; I'm just trying to get an idea of what the business footprint kind of looks like today.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes, we don't typically -- we don't disclose it on a quarterly basis. I believe that we put on
the website we put -- at the end of last year when we did investor dinners we published a
piece that we put out and it breaks down the revenue on an annual basis by division within
North America. I think we have that and you can get that.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. I will go back in (multiple speakers)

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I don't have that in my head, but US retail is the largest. Then after that you have
wholesale business and then after that you have private risk services.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Great. Okay, that helps. Thank you. Then in thinking about (multiple speakers)

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

You can go get it. You can go get the breakdown and it hasn't changed much between
what we showed at year-end and what we run now.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Great, thank you very much. Then in thinking about retail, is that an area we should
assume that you're taking down the whole risk, whereas maybe in the wholesale business
Page 14 of 25



Company N ame: Chubb Arabia Cooperative I nsurance Co
Company Ticker: ACE AB Equity
Date: 2013-07-24

that is where you would write more syndicated programs? Or is that breakdown not
exactly right?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

FINAL

No, Mike, you are not thinking of it right.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Syndicated -- I think of syndicated, to me, is much more of a London where there is a line
slip -- there is a slip that goes around and everybody takes a share. That is a syndicated. In
this case, though, of taking down whole risk, in the small and middle market commercial
business one carrier will generally take down the whole risk.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the large account in the upper middle market business -- and this varies by line of
business and so it is hard to paint a broad brush. But in the upper middle market and large
account it is usually a layered approach and so you will participate in certain layers. But the
guy who takes the primary, puts out the paper, controls the claims and the engineering
and the global servicing that is where the real action is to me.
That is where you are a real franchise versus just capital in a box. And ACE is a lead player
in that regard. They come to us; not simply for the capacity, but for all those services.
Then there may be others behind us who will participate in layers and that is the capital in
a box.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

I see. Are you seeing any -- in terms of those, pardon my nomenclature, I guess
syndicated is definitely more of a London term, but in terms of retail or wholesale are you
seeing divergence in some of those trends that you talked about? Or whether it is in the
layers of which I understand you don't participate so much in, or in the primary placements
on the wholesale side, whether it is from new entrants or new capital kind of spilling out
and over into these areas, are you seeing any divergence on that basis or not really?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No, not really. Where I see divergence it's not in -- the trends are the same in wholesale
and retail. The wholesale side of the business naturally is the more -- that is the E&S
business. Though you will write E&S also, we write plenty of it on the retail side also.
And that is where it will be the more difficult to place or tougher classes and so,
therefore, you might see -- as we said, we saw over 7.5% growth in casualty rate on the
E&S side, whereas it was more modest on the retail side. Same trends and that reflects
the nature of the risk and its need for rate. But we are not seeing -- we are seeing the

Page 15 of 25

Date: 2013-07-24

same trend and we are not seeing stupid competition that is somehow breaking that
trend in either.

FINAL

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Great. Thank you, very much. Just last one quickly; could you elaborate a bit on your
comments on the reinsurance markets? You talked a little bit about additional competition
there in new capital.
I mean is there anything that you think could happen over the next 12 months or so that
would cause you to consider really pursuing growth on the reinsurance side, or is that just
kind of out of the picture for now? Thank you, very much for all your answers.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Sure. Look, there is more capital chasing to some degree less business on the
reinsurance side. You always come back in any market economy. Any industry it is that old
supply/demand thing and that is what you have got going on.

Bloomberg Transcript

And so you see, particularly -- what is a lot of visibility to investors is the cat re side,
though remember of the overall reinsurance market it is a small thing that casts a big
shadow. There you see alternate capital coming in, capital markets, in addition to
traditional players. And so -- and you don't see exposures growing that much and so you
have got that pond with more drinking out of it.
But in the broader reinsurance market of casualty, property, marine the primary players
have retained more business. On one hand, there is plenty of capital in reinsurance
because the results have been good so their balance sheets have grown. And reinsurers
are hungry.
As many will profess underlying discipline but they chase market share, and for many of
them their standards are not the same as ours. For many it is all they do for a living and so
they feel compelled, and that sets the table.
Reinsurance is softening. How much will it soften, will low interest rates maintain and put a
floor under discipline remains to be seen. But the way I look at it is kind of the market you
have got is the market you should expect to have, and so we will continue to play it as we
do. If we like the trade, we will write it. If not -- you have seen what our track record is.
We will shrink businesses and have no problem doing that. We are so well spread in so
many lines and so many geographies I am not concerned about that for a moment.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. Evan, when you were running through your prepared remarks
on growth you gave a lot of percentages. I am wondering if we can pin down the premium
volume from the acquisitions in the overseas segment.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No, you cannot.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

No we cannot. Okay. Then can we get a little --?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Because they become part of the Company and we don't just start, well, Malaysia is this
big or Thailand is this big on organic. And then when we make an acquisition we don't
start distinguishing those in that regard.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

No, no, that wasn't my interest. I just wanted to get an organic growth number for
overseas general.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Sure. I gave you an ACE International growth number which was 18% in the quarter and
half of it was from the acquisitions. So 9% organic in ACE International and 9% from the
acquisitions. AOG is made up of ACE International, ACE Global Markets, and the overseas
business of combined insurance.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

I will see what I can do to tease that out. Can we get some disclosure on the $38 million
of other? I mean Phil said there was $20 million of negative amortization expense
associated with the acquisitions. What else is in there this quarter?

A - Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Josh, I read your note and I think you have the sine wrong. That is actually a $38 million
expense.

Operator
Paul Newsome, Sandler O'Neill.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. I would like your perspective on the linkages between the
insurance markets. There is a lot of talk about the market impact of Berkshire getting into
the E&S market, of the soft reinsurance market. Historically, these segments have moved
first in the cycle and they drove change in the overall market.

Bloomberg Transcript

I guess yesterday Travelers was talking about auto, which is a little bit different. But I guess
my question is do you think this is still the case that some of these markets just ordinarily
lead the other markets? Do you think the linkages have strengthened or weakened from
past cycles?
Because I think your perspective might be quite unique in that you write a lot of these
businesses, you do it globally, so you may be in a better position than others to kind of
see how one market will affect another.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

In past cycles before this one, typically it's the reinsurance market that led the primary.
This time around in this cycle the primary market led, and in fact, the reinsurance market
stayed stable and hardly followed. And so I don't see that same linkage that way and I
don't believe that the reinsurance market is a leading indicator of where the primary
market is going to go.
One of the reasons is the size of balance sheets on the primary side of the large players.
There are much better data over the years than last cycle because of math and computer
power, and technology has changed it that way. Given their insight, they are making
different kinds of decisions about how to hold the retentions, how to think about
exposure. They retain much more, many do, than they did in the past and that is what
creates some of that de-linkage between the two.
And so I don't expect that somehow -- I am not spooked that somehow the reinsurance
market portends the insurance market. I don't see that in front of me.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

What about the excess and surplus market? That also tended to be kind of a leading
indicator of the overall market, at least historically.

FINAL

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I don't think that is right either. Usually the E&S market expands or contracts with market
cycles as in a softer part of a cycle the E&S market shrinks because the traditional insurers
on the retail side they expand their appetite. They tend to write business that they have
no business writing because all of a sudden they think, man, that price looks good relative
to what I normally write. I will write a lot of habitational business.
They don't realize that that business that -- they are writing it at a loss. When they then
get disciplined because the losses role in then they shrink their appetite and the E&S
market expands, and so the E&S market usually follows along that way. It doesn't lead it.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Hello. Good morning. The first question is on the international growth. I believe you
mentioned that there was about a 9% organic growth. We have been hearing some
rumblings about some sort of growth slowdown internationally, so if you could help us
understand are you seeing that or are you not seeing that in your business?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, I am confused, Vinay. Help me with the question a little more because we just
published 9% growth organically and 18% without it. So do you mean the economic
slowdown?

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Yes, yes. I mean we have seen or we have heard about a slowdown in growth in the
emerging markets. Have you really seen it in your numbers as yet, because it doesn't
seem that you have seen that? And do you think that is going to negatively impact you in
the future?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, I can't really predict the future but, first of all, you do see a slowdown in major
emerging markets right now. China, Brazil as two in particular. When China slows down
that lead generally most natural resource-based countries will slow down.

Page 19 of 25

FINAL

In China, where an awful lot of assemblage for export takes place, those that are doing
component manufacturing, so throughout Southeast Asia, etc., they will slow down. And
as China's own consumption, if it slows down, then that will impact many other countries in
Asia and to some degree in Latin America.
We see economic slowdown. It has obviously slowed down dramatically in Brazil, as an
example, and our business has slowed down in that country. But we got Mexico,
Colombia, Chile, the Andean countries have been doing quite well.
When I look at Asia Pacific, China, which we don't consolidate as you know because we
own a minority position in Southeast Asia, I don't see that in our business and I don't see
the economic slowdown. I was just in Indonesia and Malaysia and those countries are
doing quite well.
Will they moderate do I believe? Will they ameliorate in terms of growth? Yes. But
particularly because, as I say, China casts such a big shadow, but I think it will still be
relative to the developed world. It will still be robust, relatively robust growth.
At any one time these markets are volatile and at any one time any one country or two
countries can slow down and that can have some impact on us. But on the overall I don't
see it yet. I don't see in front of me at this moment.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay, that is helpful. Then two quick numbers questions for Phil maybe. The first one is
the amortization of intangibles. Phil, I think you mentioned it was $20 million.
What number do you see for the next sort of one year? And does that slow down after 12
months, because most of the amortization happens in the first 12 months?

A - Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Yes, 12 to 18 months, and what we are going to do is put a schedule in the 10-K or 10-Q
that will lay out our expectation for the rest of the year.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

So that would be great. Just the next question is under normalized tax rate do you have a
number for that normalized?

A - Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Prospectively you mean? I would say if you looked at current accident year, ex cats, I would
use a number in the neighborhood of 15%.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay, that is it for me. Thank you.

FINAL

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Thank you, a couple questions. First, on the investment income. It seemed that the good
performance in the first half largely related to private equity gains, yet you upped your
expectations for the second half. Did that increase represent continued positive outlook
for private equity or was it the higher interest rates we are seeing?

A - Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

It is principally the positive interest rates. As we said, the portfolio market rate was up 60
basis points in the quarter and we see that having a positive impact for the next two
quarters, at least.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Jay, the other thing you have is mortgage -- things like mortgage redemptions have
slowed down, so to a degree portfolio turnover has slowed down a little bit and that
benefits it.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

That is helpful. Second question was on the favorable reserve development. I'm
wondering if you could give us a bit more color as far as what classes you are seeing that
development in and what accident years it is coming from?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

For the long tail it is predominantly, overwhelmingly, 2007 and prior, and for the short tail it
is more recent years. And, Sean, do you have any more color you want to add?

A - Sean Ringsted

{BIO 4168540 <GO>}

Sure. I can -- as Phil said, it is two-thirds short tail, one-third long tail. In the short tail
nothing unusual there. It's just plain coming in better than expectations.
And on the long-tail side reviewed North America and Tempest this quarter, and as Evan
said, it's predominantly 2007 and prior. We did have some -- you will see this in the Q -we did have some favorable release on more recent years, but this is attributable to our
shorter-tail exposure on multi-claim industrial accident and our workers comp book. But
the theme is 2007 and prior and better than expectations.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Is it fair to assume, Sean, that the claims environment on the long-tail side remains fairly
unchanged? Are you seeing any, on the margin, any changes in that claims environment?

{BIO 4168540 <GO>}

FINAL

We are not seeing what I would call any systemic changes in claim frequency or severity.
We do see some frequency changes in our longer tail lines, but I would call these portfolio
specific, and really driven by business mix as we take -- Evan mentioned portfolio
management. And as we take underwriting actions to come in and out of lines and
moderate our exposures with deductibles and SIRs and so on.
I would call these changes portfolio specific, reflective of our ability to execute on
portfolio management and also monitor. So we have got a feedback loop; we are now
starting to see these changes in frequencies come through. So I think that is the important
aspect of this.
It's portfolio specific, you see it in the US and non-US, but nothing systemic. These
portfolio changes are really in line with our expectations as we execute on underwriting.

Meyer Shields, KBW.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

I just want to continue on that last thought about changes in the reserve environment. Are
there any leading indicators (multiple speakers) I'm trying to get a sense, are there any
leading indicators that would suggest that the current environment isn't changing but it
might two or three years from now?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Wow, Meyer, that is the Holy Grail. You know, look, no, there is no indicators. It is relatively
benign. I remind you that CPI is not the indicator of insurance-related inflation.
Medical inflation, while it is down, still runs around 4%. You have legal inflation that
continues. And by the way, on the short-tail side you have more inflation around
construction materials and you get some hourly rate and all of that, particularly as housing
starts, etc., pick up. So you always have an underlying trend and you got to know that, but
it has been pretty steady.
We choose not to change long-term inflation factors for casualty, and if it turns out to be
better, it shows up ultimately in our earnings in prior period. But we run a business
conservatively. Anyone who has been in the casualty business for any reasonable length
of time; it is not a business for optimists and you understand that the good news comes
early and the bad news comes late. And so we continue to play it conservatively that way
because you don't know two or three years out.

Page 22 of 25



Company N ame: Chubb Arabia Cooperative I nsurance Co

If economic activity picks up that is what will drive inflation. We know it is holding inflation
down. It is demand side, not supply side.

That is very helpful, I appreciate it. I guess I have to look for the Holy Grail. On an
unrelated topic --

A - Evan Greenberg

Well, when you find it you send it on in here. We'll be very interested.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, look at the Court of Appeals. Are you seeing any increased submission activity
reflecting sort of the discussion about the major brokers looking to consolidate their
placement among fewer carriers? Is that a relevant factor at all?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

You know, that has been a slow-moving trend for a bunch of years now. That is not new.
When you talk to the majors, as I know you do, they will talk to you about the thousands.
The inefficiency is they see it in their own system and thousands of carriers that they deal
with or many hundreds and how that is not the most efficient for both client or for
themselves; it's how they do business.
And for many reasons that occurs, but it all comes down to human and their desire to
over time rationalize and consolidate that. You see it show up in different activities and
actions on the parts of brokers over time. That has been going on and my sense is that
will continue to a degree. There is nothing -- it is not event related and it is not startling
and I haven't seen anything new.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate it.

Thanks. Two quick questions here. First, Phil, corporate admin expenses looked elevated
in the quarter. Was there any kind of one-time items related to the closed acquisitions that
don't repeat themselves?

A - Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

It really wasn't related to acquisitions, but we did have some accrual changes related to
some work we were doing around the stock compensation area. But nothing that I would
take as an ongoing trend.

Q - Brian Meredith

Then, second, I wonder if you could talk about any kind of notable changes in terms and
