And now I turn the call over to your hosts for today, Dinos Iordanou and Mark Lyons.
Gentlemen, you may begin.

Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Thank you, Francis. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had
another excellent quarter with all of our units performing well from an underwriting
perspective. Earnings were solid and were driven by excellent reported underwriting
results. Our premium revenue grew by 2.5% on a net basis for the third quarter 2014 over
the same period in 2013. Growth in insurance and mortgage business more than offset a
decline in reinsurance net writings.

Bloomberg Transcript

On an operating basis, we earned $1.05 per share for the quarter, which produced an
annualized return on equity of approximately 10% for the 2014 third quarter versus a 12%
return on an operating basis in the third quarter of 2013. On a net income basis, Arch
earned $1.64 per share this quarter, which corresponds to an annualized return of 15%, as
foreign exchange and realized gains enhance our net results.
Our reported underwriting results in the third quarter were excellent as reflected by a
combined ratio of 88% and were aided by a low level of catastrophic losses and favorable
prior year loss reserve development. Net investment income per share on a sequential
basis was flat in the quarter at $0.53 per share. Our operating cash flow for the quarter
was $319 million comparing very favorably to $238 million in the same period last year.
The total return of the investment portfolio was a negative 51 basis points for the quarter,
inclusive of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and 21 basis points in local currency
terms.
Our book value per common share at September 30, 2014 was essentially flat at $44.04
per share, increasing by 0.7% sequentially and 15% relative to the third quarter of 2013. In
the quarter, we reinstituted our open market share repurchases and spent $252 million in
the third quarter. In addition, we have spent an additional $89 million from October 1
through October 29 for a total of $341 million for the last four months.
The insurance segment's gross written premium grew by 6.4% and net written premium
grew by 7.4%. The growth emanated from the following divisions: programs, travel and
accident, E&S binding authority and construction and national accounts business. Most of
our organic growth is coming from small accounts with low limits, which should have lower
volatility. On the other hand, competitive conditions in the property sector had negatively
affected primary property rates and accordingly, our premium volume in those lines. In the
primary markets, in which our Insurance Group participates, we continue to obtain rate
increases in most lines of business, albeit slightly below the levels that we observed last
quarter. Mark will give you more color on this later on.

FINAL

On the reinsurance side of the business, we have seen a continuation of softening in
terms and conditions that we noted in prior quarters. From a production point of view, net
written premium was down 16% in the quarter for the reinsurance group, primarily as a
result of a non-recurring large unearned premium portfolio, which, as we described in the
prior call, was booked in the third quarter of 2013, and is not recurring in 2014.
Gross premiums rose in the reinsurance segment by nearly 5% with the growth in the
segment arising from business we produced for Watford Re. Adjusting for the reduction
of the unearned premium portfolio from last year and the business produced for Watford
Re, reinsurance premiums would have declined by approximately 6% in the quarter if you
compare like quarter-to-quarter.
Our mortgage segment includes primary mortgage insurance written through Arch MI in
the United States and reinsurance treaties covering mortgage risk, which is written
globally, including the U.S, as well as other risk-sharing and structure mortgage
businesses. As you may recall, our mortgage insurance business in the U.S. serves two
major markets, credit unions and banks and other mortgage lenders. Net written premium
for the third quarter of 2014 was approximately $58 million, of which $32 million was
written by Arch MI U.S. who tenders to the credit unions, banks and other mortgage
lenders.

Bloomberg Transcript

As we discussed in prior calls, Arch MI has a dominant position in the credit union sector
and is in the process of building out its client base with bank lenders. This past quarter, a
substantial amount of the growth came from single paid premiums. These are loans
where the mortgage insurance premium is paid up-front.
As of today, we have approved more than 400 master policy applications from banks,
and more than 100 of these banks have submitted loans for our approval. Of these
approvals, 29 represent national accounts and the balance are regional banks. We define
national accounts as the top 100 producers of mortgages. Of the top 25 originators, we
have approvals from 15 of them.
Group-wide, on an expected basis, we believe the ROE on the business we underwrote
this year will produce an underwriting year ROE in the range of 10% to 12%. As on a
present value basis, improvements in the Insurance Group and the addition of the
mortgage segment were more than offset by lower expected returns in the reinsurance
segment.
Before I turn it over to Mark, I would like to discuss our PMLs. As usual, I would like to point
out that our cap PML aggregates reflect business bound through October 1, while the
premium numbers included in our financial statements are through September 30, and
that the PMLs are reflected net of all reinsurance and retrocessions.
As of October 1, 2014, our largest 250-year PMLs for a single event decreased slightly in
the Northeast to $658 million, or 11% of common shareholders' equity, while Gulf PMLs
also decreased slightly to $608 million. Our Florida Tri-County PML now stands at $451

million. I will now turn it over to Mark to comment further on our financial results and as
customary, after Mark concludes his remarks, we will take your questions. Mark?

FINAL

Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Great. Thank you, Dinos, and good morning. Before we get started, I'd like to just say a
few words to define how I'm going to speak about things for the balance of the call, so
just bear with me on this.
First, as a reminder, the financial supplement shows consolidated financial statements that
include our other segments, which is Watford Re, as well as providing other financials that
excludes the other segment, and those are footnoted as such on each page of the
supplement.
Furthermore, within the segment information of the supplement, we have provided a
subtotal of Arch's core segments, that is insurance, reinsurance and mortgage without
Watford Re, and have also separately provided Watford Re's results posted alongside in
order to arrive at an Arch consolidated segments income statement view. The investment
information section of the supplement, however, is completely shown excluding the other
segment.

Bloomberg Transcript

So my comments to follow today are on a pure Arch basis, which excludes the other
segment unless otherwise noted. For further clarity, although today's discussion will
exclude Watford result as a segment, however, when Watford is used as a reinsurer by
any one of our core segments, those cessions are reflected in Arch's underwriting results.
Furthermore, since the definition of the word consolidated includes the results of Watford,
I will not be using that term, the term consolidated. Instead, just be aware that my
comments refer to our core segments of business, insurance, reinsurance and mortgage
combined as just discussed. This permits an apples-to-apples comparison with Arch's
results a year ago.
Okay. Moving on with that defined, the combined ratio for this quarter was 88.5% with 1.6
points of current accident year cat-related events net of reinsurance and reinstatement
premiums compared to the 2013 third quarter combined ratio of 86.1%, which reflected
2.5 points of cat-related events.
Losses from 2014 catastrophic events net of reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement
premiums totaled $14.2 million, primarily emanating from European storm Ella and
Midwestern U.S. tornado activity. The 2014 third quarter combined ratio also reflected 8
points even of prior year net favorable development, net of reinsurance and related
acquisition expenses compared to 8.2 points of prior period favorable development on
the same basis in the 2013 third quarter. This results in a 94.9% current accident year
combined ratio, excluding cats, for the third quarter of 2014 compared to 91.8% accident
quarter combined ratio in the third quarter of 2013.

FINAL

In the insurance segment, the 2014 accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats, was
98% even compared to an accident quarter combined ratio of 97.1% a year ago. This
increase was primarily attributable to certain larger attritional losses emanating from our
European operations and in particular, mostly from the aviation war line of business. These
large attritional losses account for 170 basis points more of net earned premiums in the
third quarter of 2014, than a large attritional losses in the corresponding quarter of 2013.
The reinsurance segment 2014 accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats, was
90.6% compared to 94.8% in the 2013 third quarter but represents a sequential
improvement from the 92.1% combined ratio last quarter. As noted in prior quarters, the
reinsurance segment's results reflect changes in the mix of premiums earned, including
lower contributions from property catastrophe business.

Bloomberg Transcript

The insurance segment accounts this quarter for roughly 16% of the total favorable
development, excluding the associated impact on the acquisition expenses, and this was
primarily driven by shorter-tailed lines from the 2006 through 2012 accident years. The
reinsurance segment accounts for approximately 83% of the total favorable development
in the 2014 third quarter, again, also excluding the associated impact of acquisition
expenses. With approximately 40% of that due to net favorable development on shortertailed lines concentrated in the more recent underwriting years, roughly 8% was
attributable to medium-tailed lines based throughout many underwriting years and about
49% due to net favorable development of longer-tailed lines, primarily from the 2002
through 2010 underwriting years.
The mortgage segment accounted for approximately 1% of the total favorable
development in the quarter, stemming mainly from our U.S. primary operations
concentrated in 2009 and prior. As has been consistent in the past, approximately 69% of
our core $7.2 billion of total net reserves for losses and LAE, our IBNR or additional case
reserves, which as I've mentioned has been consistent across time and across the main
reinsurance and insurance segments.
The expense ratio for the third quarter of 2014 was 33.5% versus the prior year's
comparative quarter expense ratio of 32.4%. The increase in the operating expense ratio
reflects the addition of our U.S. mortgage insurance operations, which is operating at a
higher expense ratio until business hits a steady state as well as the effect of incremental
expense due to certain platform expansions in both our reinsurance and insurance
businesses.
The insurance segment improved to a 31.7% expense ratio compared to 33.1% a year
ago, primarily reflecting a lower net acquisition ratio driven mostly by materially improved
treaty ceding commissions. The reinsurance segment expense ratio increased from
30.7% in the third quarter of 2013 to 32.6% this quarter, primarily due to a higher level of
operating expenses and by higher ceding commissions incurred.
Our U.S. insurance operations achieved a positive 2.6% effective renewal rate increase
this quarter net of reinsurance. A key point that can get lost in the averages is how
different the pricing environment is for short-tailed versus longer-tailed lines. Our short-

FINAL

tailed lines of business had an effective 3.5% renewal rate decrease for the quarter
compared to a 4% effective renewal rate increase for the longer-tailed lines both on a net
of reinsurance basis. These longer-tailed line rate increases continued to be above our
view of weighted loss cost trends. Looking more deeply, some lines incurred rate
reduction, such as nearly 8% in property and 4% in high capacity D&O and others enjoyed
healthy increases such as plus 10% in our lower capacity D&O lines, 7.5% increase in
contract binding and nearly 6.5% increase in excess workers' compensation.
Also certain lines continued their momentum of achieving strong cumulative increases. For
example, our admitted loss sensitive businesses as well as our lower capacity D&O lines
have achieved 13 consecutive quarters of rate increases. The private not-for-profit D&O
unit has in fact, secured double-digit increases for nine of those 13 consecutive quarters.
The ratio of net premium to gross premium in the quarter was 75.5% versus 80.9% a year
ago. The insurance segment had a 74.2% ratio compared to 73.5% a year earlier. This
quarter's insurance segment net to gross become 76% when the impact of the Sparta
renewal rights transaction discussed on last quarter's call is removed. This continues to
show the insurance segment's emphasis on writing smaller lesser volatile business and
keeping more of it net as a result.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the reinsurance segment, the net-to-gross ratio was 75.8% in the 2014 third quarter
compared to 94.6% a year ago, primarily reflecting sessions to Watford Re as a reinsurer
and other third-party retro purchases protecting the property book.
The mortgage segment posted an 86.6% combined ratio for the quarter. The expense
ratio, as expected and as indicated earlier, continues to be high as the operating ratio
relating to our U.S. primary operations will remain elevated until proper scale is achieved.
The net written premium of $58.5 million in the quarter is driven, as Dinos noted, by $32
million from our U.S. primary operations and $26.5 million of net written premium from our
reinsurance mortgage operations, which includes the 100% quota share of PMI's 2009,
2011 underwriting years as part of the acquisition of the CMG companies and the PMI
platform. At September 30, 2014, our risk-in-force of $10.1 billion includes $5.5 billion from
our U.S. mortgage insurance operation, $4.5 billion through worldwide reinsurance
operations and $136 million through our risk-sharing transactions.
It's important to note that U.S. operations utilize policy-specific covered ratios to
determine risk-in-force from insurance in-force figures. As you may recall, insurance inforce represents the aggregate amount of the individual loans insured, while risk-in-force
incorporates the insurance coverage percentage. Outside the U.S., we followed market
practice to estimate risk-in-force on a similar basis, while for risk-sharing transactions, riskin-force reflects our percentage participations within bound layers, as well as the impact
of contract limits. That is, risk-in-force on risk-sharing transactions does not exceed the
contractual limits of liability involved.
Our primary U.S. mortgage insurance operation down just shy of $2 billion of new
insurance written during the quarter, which represent the aggregate of original principal
balances of all loans receiving coverage during the quarter. The weighted average FICO
score for the U.S. primary portfolio remains strong at 733 and the weighted average loanto-value ratio held steady at 93.4%.

FINAL

No state's risk-in-force represents more than 10% of the portfolio and our U.S. primary
mortgage insurance company is operating at an estimated 9.1:1 risk-to-capital ratio as of
September 30, 2014. The other segment i.e., Watford Re, reported a 100.2% combined
ratio for the quarter on nearly $100 million of net written premium and $34.8 million of net
earned premiums. As a reminder, these premiums reflect 100% of the business assumed,
rather than simply Arch's approximate 11% common share interest due to the variable
interest entity accounting election.
Our joint venture Gulf Re produced a $7.8 million loss for the quarter due to an unusually
high frequency of large technical risk losses stemming from the Middle East. This is
reflected on the income statement within the other income line. The total return on our
investment portfolio, as Dinos noted, was a reported negative 51 bps in the 2014 third
quarter, reflecting negative returns in our fixed income and equity sectors along with the
impact of the strength in U.S. dollar on our foreign denominated investments, while our
alternative investment portfolio continued to perform well.

Bloomberg Transcript

Excluding foreign exchange, total return was a positive 21 bps in the 2014 third quarter. On
a trailing 12-month basis ending September 30, the total return has been a positive 3.30%
and excluding foreign exchange, the return has been a positive 3.76%. Our embedded
pre-tax book yield before expenses was 2.21% as of September 30, 2014 compared to
2.175% serially at June 30, while the duration of the portfolio lengthened slightly to 3.28
years from last quarter's 3.14 years.
Fixed income duration can fluctuate due to tactical investment decisions as opposed to
long-term strategic shifts. The current duration continues to reflect our conservative
decision on interest rates in the current yield environment. Reported net investment
income in the 2014 third quarter was $72.2 million or $0.53 per share versus $72.5 million in
the 2014, second quarter, which was also $0.53 per share and $66.1 million or $0.49 per
share in the corresponding quarter in 2013.
As always, we evaluate investment performance on a total return basis and not merely by
the geography of net investment income. Interest expense for the quarter was $4.2
million, which is a significant reduction from the last two quarters. This reduction is due to
a favorable adjustment involving a certain loss portfolio transfer entered into effective
January 2013. This deposit accounting transaction had a downward reevaluation in the
quarter of the underlying ultimate loss, which resulted in an $8.2 million reduction in
interest expense. The run rate interest expense, which includes approximately $12 million
from Arch's senior notes and a variable amount of Arch's revolving credit borrowings and
some other items is expected to be approximately $13 million per quarter for the
foreseeable future. However, reevaluation of the underlying ultimate loss attributable to
this (24:26 – 25:38)
needs to give us significant financial flexibility. We also continue to estimate having capital
in excess of our targeted capital position. Book value per share, as Dinos noted, was
$44.04, up 0.7% relative to June 30, up 10.6% relative to year-end 2013, and up nearly
15% relative to one year ago at September 30, 2013. This change in book value per share
this quarter primarily reflects the company's continued strong underwriting performance
offset by unrealized losses on investments.

So with these introductory comments, we are now pleased to take your questions.

Constantine P. Iordanou

FINAL

Francis, we are ready.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Please stand by for your first question. That question will come from the line of
Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Good morning and thank you for taking my call. First question is on buyback. Looks like you
started buying back actually in a big way in more than a year. I just wonder what changes
your thought process on that? Is that less opportunity for organic growth or acquisition
growth, or you found your stock prices more attractive now?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, it's a good question. Let me give you the flavor and the decision-making process
that we go through.
Our excess capital was building rapidly and at the same time because of the environment
we have in the property cat area with additional capital coming in et cetera, it caused us
to reduce our exposure into that sector. Usually, we don't buy shares back in the third
quarter because of the potential storm activity but with $450 million PML in Florida, that
risk was a lot more manageable for us. So it cleared the way for us to look at our excess
capital and also look at the prospects of us deploying the capital in the business. We are
not as optimistic in finding transactions for us that are reasonable for our shareholders.
We had a few that we attempted and we were in the mix. None of them materialized
being conservative in our approach of acquiring business. And if I'm not able to deploy the
capital into the business, then the next option is to returning to shareholders, and that's
the thought process we went through, and we decided to initiate the buybacks even in
the third quarter, which is not a normal activity for us for the reasons that I just mentioned.
Plus we felt the price that we were buying the shares, it was pretty attractive in reinvesting
in our business.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

And I would just add to that Kai. Following up on Dinos' very last point, from a valuation
and attractiveness standpoint, we bought these back at 145% of book value. And you
heard Dinos earlier in his comments talk about our forward look of our underwriting years,
accounting years but underwriting years being 10% to 12%, so the arithmetic works.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}
Page 8 of 23



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td

And so if the current condition persists, in terms of both of your stock price as well as the
prospects of the business, would you fear to say that you can return 100% of your
operating earnings? And would that be a catch-up in the fourth quarter, in particular to
match up the first half of the year?

FINAL

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

Yeah. That is not an unreasonable assumption.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. That's great. Then I just want to struggle with this question. If you look back last 10
years, your combined ratio averaged about 91%. Yet, your ROE is about 16%, and this
year, your combined ratio is actually pretty good 87%, yet, ROE is low double digits. I just
wonder – I mean, investment probably play an important part of that but just – is the
current environment even with this pretty solid combined ratio, that you will be able to
only achieve like a low double-digit ROE. Is that the prospects at least in the near term?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

No. You're doing comparisons without making adjustments for the E. There is periods of
time that our shareholders equity is in the right place, so in essence, we don't have much
excess capital and there is periods of time for different reasons that the equity we have is
about or what we need to run the business. Of course, when you have that, it affects your
– the ROE because the R is the same and the E is a larger number. It is going to give you a
smaller percentage on that. It's management's responsibility, and I'll take that one as my
responsibility, as the CEO to make sure that we have a good balance between capital
needed, the protection we need to have excess capital for various reasons that we
explained in many of our prior calls and take the excess, excess capital and return it. And
that was the activity you saw in the third quarter potentially continuing in the fourth
quarter, et cetera. So when you look at ROE, you also got to look at the capital at the
same time, and then you can make those comparisons about the quality of the business
that we generate. We're happy with the quality of the business that we generate.
Unfortunately, in a competitive market environment, especially in the reinsurance side, we
don't think we're going to have as much of it as we would like.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

So just clarify on that? Is that your 10% to 12% current ROE expect -- sort of expectation, is
that on allocated capital or on the sort of your – sort of what's currently (32:18)?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It is on allocated capital.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay.

may begin.

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Great, thank you. Just a few questions on the MI business. Can you talk a little bit about
how much of that NIW, the $1 billion that didn't come through the credit union was filed
through the bank flow channel?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

There was quite a bit for the bank channel, but it was on what we call prepaid single
premium revenue, and you're focusing just on the U.S. primary MI or the global?

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Yes. I'm sorry to interrupt. No. I was thinking U.S. MI primary business, how much of that,
the $1 billion that isn't the credit union business would fall into that sort of flow business,
flow bank channel?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

The flow bank channel is still at its infancy. It was about, I would say, 10%, 15% of the total.
The other 85%, it was single premium prepaid MI.

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Great. Thank you for the clarification. And then as far as that bank channel is
concerned, I mean as you continue to sort of scale up and you've mentioned that you
have relations with the large banks, how do you see that progressing? And when you think
about like a target market share and kind of where you are now, what sort of glide path
do you anticipate to get there?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

FINAL

If I have one. And again, I apologize. Just I can't hear. In terms of capital that you've
allocated to that business do you anticipate sending more capital down to the MI, or do
you feel like at this point with that 9.1:1 that you're at a comfortable place to pace the
growth that you expect for the foreseeable future? Thanks. And apologies for the line.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Okay. At 9.1 we're probably the most conservative from a capital point of view from any
one of our competitors in that space, and I don't anticipate sending more capital to MI
until it's needed. We're not going to get through the steady-state with PMIers for quite a
bit of time. Mark, do you want to elaborate on that?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yes. It's – the wildcard is the PMIers and that market place is dynamic too – similar to the
P&C side. It depends what the demand turns out to be, and we'll do it at that time but it
could be that we need to put some additional capital over the next few years, but we
have to see what materializes here.

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Hi, Vinay. How are you?

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Good. How are you? First question is on the reinsurance side. Looking at the accident year
loss ratio, it stands at about 58% for the reinsurance division. That's lower than the 60%,
61% you got in the first half of the year. Is the business mix change, that's the removal of
the Tower's reinsurance premium is having a positive impact on your loss ratios?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes, and yes. But I'll give it to Mark who'll give you more details. Yes. We did book that at a
higher loss ratio and the mix is changing, but the mix change is actually goes a little bit of
against us because we're not having as much cat business, which usually the expected

Page 11 of 23

loss ratio, it's in the 40%s. You have less of that, so there is a mix change. But Mark, do
you want to add more color to it.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

FINAL

Sure. Vinay, I assume you're talking on an accident quarter basis?

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Yes. Correct, correct.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well, other than to reiterate, I think you've heard us talk about mix every quarter and how
mix can affect things, and I think this is a great quarter of how mix has done that, not just
by line of businesses but by the operations within the reinsurance group. We always talk
about the treaty side and the property cat side, but we have a very profitable property
facultative side, that really had outstanding results this quarter and helped with that loss
ratio.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

So we would shouldn't take this quarter's number as a new run rate for the future?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

It's coming down to mix. I hate to do the forecasts that you're asking for. So it'll depend
on what materializes, and the reason I say that is because the property facultative book is
not cat-dependent. They don't lead with cat. They pick it up some all-risks, but they're
really looking for attritional underwriting, which they're very good at. So their results are
not going to be impacted by what you're reading in headlines on cat business.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay, fair enough. And on the primary insurance, both a similar question. Now was the –
large losses about 1.7 points, did I hear that correctly?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, the large losses emanate from the world risk book. You know what they are. You got
the unlucky Malaysian Airlines hit twice and then you have Tripoli. And now for that specific
book, it was much more a loss ratio points, but for the entire insurance group, I think the
effect was how much, Mark?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yeah, in total it was about 3.3 loss ratio points of worldwide premium.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Right.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

And Vinay it was 1.6 at the corresponding quarter last time was similarly valued attritional
loss sizes. So the difference between the two is 170 basis points of net earned premium
that I referred to in my comments.

FINAL

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

And you can never tell, but these things happen. I mean you get unusual losses
occasionally. We don't view these recurring but 'who the hell knows in the world.' If they
continue to recall, we're going to reevaluate our underwriting posture.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Taken from 10,000 feet up. I mean, this is a clear example to me of a large attritional loss.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Man-made.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yes. Smoothing, if you will, because this is a cat cover at the end of the day, and you're
going to go 10 years of 5% and 6% loss ratios and there's going to be a 500% loss ratio
moment that is going to return back to 5% or 6% loss ratio point. So take it from that
perspective, you don't really view that as a recurring item.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Right. Fair enough. So if I take that out of the numbers, the accident year loss ratio ex-cat
and the P&C primary insurance business, orders sit on 64.6 this quarter. And looking at the
year ago quarter, it was 64.0. So you're seeing a slight uptick in the loss ratio? Was that
business mix? Because I thought that there was some margin improvement coming
through the book.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yes, there is a business mix, but we don't evaluate our businesses. Our loss ratio alone
and then look independently at expense ratio, and then look independent at the duration
aspect and the investment income side. It's all in totality. That's what return is. So you can't
really look at a loss ratio without looking at the outstanding improvement that they've
gotten on ceding commissions, which finds its way through the net acquisition ratio, and
by the way, it earns its way in. So that's on a forward sense, because that's already baked
and written, those ceding commission improvements are going to continue to be baked
in firstly. And secondly is, not every treaty renews at the same time. Those treaties are
renewed at periodic points throughout the year, so additional gains are possible.

FINAL

And of course, the duration of liabilities and investment income associate is part of the
mix when we make a total return determination. And you're not going to view high excess
workers' comp with very, very long duration the same way you're going to do E&S
property who has no durations.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. And this quarter, the acquisition expense ratio went down in the primary insurance
division. Was it because of ceding commissions? And should we expect that to continue
for the future?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

That's the point I was really making. You can't see it but the direct commissions paid upfront really didn't change appreciably at all, so the whole balance is mostly, I can't say
exclusively, mostly driven by the increase in the ceding commissions.

Q - Vinay Misquith

Q - Jay H. Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thank you. I just want to follow-up on the buyback. It's a nice surprise to see the buybacks
coming in the quarter and then falling through the fourth quarter. I believe there's a
comment saying that buybacks could be equivalent to annual operating earnings, but I just
want to make sure, before people start filling that into their models that – I just wanted to
confirm whether that's sensitive to things like valuation, market opportunities and anything
else?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It's all in the mix, Jay. I mean, I think we can chew gum and walk at the same time. So we
don't make a decision and that decision is permanent without looking at the environment.
We look at our share price, we look at prospects where we can deploy capital, we look at
the business opportunities, et cetera. We look at our excess capital and how big that
amount is, and then we make judgments. And beyond that, we make also a judgment in
not only how much we need to return to our shareholders but in what form we want to
return it. So it's not only share buybacks. If our share price gets to where it's appropriately

And your next question will come from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America. You
may begin.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. Question on the mortgage business. You guys suggested that a lot of the
premium, some of the premium came from the single premium transactions. I'm just not
as familiar with the mortgage business. So can you describe what exactly those are? And
will the accounting and earned bases be different because they were single premium
transactions?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yes, Jay. For clarification, yes, that will be the case. To the extent that they are single
bullet, they will be earned over the ratable life. Think of it that way. And to the extent that
they are monthly, they'll come in and as written and earned really...

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

On a monthly basis.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

On a monthly basis. So you're going to build up on a premium reserve on the single
bullets.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Do you guys care which form it comes in? Does it matter to you?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes, and no. It depends on the price at the end of the day. Single premium usually is not
as attractive to us because it's competitively bid, et cetera. On the other hand, depending
where the mortgage cycle is and interest rates, if you get a reduction in mortgage rates
and you have a significant amount of refinancing going, then that's an attractive product
because (46:39 – 48:04)

Please proceed with your question. And next question in line comes from the line of Ryan
Byrnes from Janney. You may begin.

FINAL

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Okay. Good afternoon, guys. I'm sorry. The call has been kind of breaking up a bunch, so
I'm not quite sure what we were just talking about. I was wondering if we could get, it also
broke up earlier when we were talking about interest expense, the pressure from the loss
portfolio transfer from January 2013. I just wanted to see how we should think about that
going forward. I think you may have answered it but the call broke up.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Okay. Mark will take it.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Actually Ryan, we really – there hadn't been a question on that, so you didn't miss
anything. The $8.2 million that we reflected in our comments and in the earnings release is
a portfolio transfer that was effective January 2013 on basically losses from 2000 to 2012.
It was reevaluated subsequent to that, and it was a reduction in the ultimate losses, and
the accounting requires that you go back and retrospectively look at it as if it has always
had that view. So you should think of the $8.2 million since it was recorded as a reduction.
This interest expense as an outlier and that piece is not recurrent, unless we decide in the
future to have another valuation, which changes the ultimate liability. Assuming that
there's no future changes to it, all you're going to see in future income statements is the
accretion associated with that liability over its expected payout period.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Okay. And how often do you do a deep dive on that piece?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

It's periodic. It could change, it could be semi-annual, it could be – it depends on what
we're observing in the underlying information and the data.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then I apologize if this has been discussed as well, but the growth at
Watford was very strong in the quarter, probably better than that most of us were
anticipating. Just wanted to get your thoughts there on how close were you guys getting
to a run rate there.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, we don't really know, because I can't predict the future. There has been a lot of
interest on the facility and the facility competes in the marketplace. And at the end of the

Page 16 of 23

day, we've been pleasantly surprised about its acceptance so far. If it continues, if it
continues, we can get to a steady state within two years instead of three years.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

FINAL

And again, just remind us what kind of underwriting leverage that vehicle can get,
obviously thinking that it gets a little more aggressive on the investment portfolio side?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, I think it's a question you got to ask them, but I'll give you my flavor. I think on a
company with $1.2 billion of unencumbered capital, you can go into the $500 million, $600
million worth of premium written 0.5 to 1, and be extremely safe, and pretty conservative
with that. And that's what I would call steady state. And it might take a couple of years to
get there.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Great. I appreciate that. Thanks, Dinos.

Your next question will come from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. You may
begin.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Thank you for taking my question late in the call. Hope everyone is well. Don has already
castigated me a little better but I don't know my accounting very well. I wonder if you can
help me understand how the Watford non-controlling dividends and that contributions
work at the bottom of the P&L.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Sure, sure. It's a good question because it gets a little murky. I mean you can tell by my
opening comments that we got to phrase things in a certain way. Here's what I think
you're missing, Josh, is that in any company, the common shareholders are going to be
basically subsidizing the preferred costs. So they're always deducted before, you have
net income available to common shareholders. So think of it as – we're looking at it as
what's available to Watford's common shareholders and then you got to make the next
step on what's available to Arch's common shareholders. So you're effectively going to
have at the 100% level down because of consolidation what's their net income, round
one.
Round two, then is the further deduction for the preferreds. Okay. And then you're at the
point where you're taking the controlling interest into new account, which is roughly 11% to
89%. So we need to take out 89% so that we're left with the 11%. But since you already
subtracted the preferreds to begin with, you're implicitly doing at 11%, 89% on these
preferreds when you make that adjustment. I know this sounds a little confusing but

Page 17 of 23



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2014-10-30

suffice it to say, there was adjustments, the $10.3 million that's there is the combination of
the preferred costs and the net income split back 11%-89%.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

FINAL

So the preferred dividend of $4.9 million is included in the $10.3 million?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay. Or is it net of the $10.3 million, or net of ? So was there an Arch's share of Watford...

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Arithmetically, forget conceptual for a minute. Arithmetically, the $6.6 million, which was
the net income at the 100% level in combination with the $4.9 million on the preferred that
lump together. If you take 89% of that, comes to the $10.3 million, which is a sign reversal
because we're undoing it. So you're left with $1.2 million of net income available to Arch
after taking out non-controlling interest.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. I think that – after I think about it for 20 minutes, I'll understand it perfectly.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

It took me 20 minutes. So, don't worry about it.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

I think the other thing that I've done wrong apparently is I've also miscalculated the
operating tax rate. It seems to me that you add about $158 million of pre-tax operating
income before dividends, and after I make those adjustments for the preferred dividend,
the dividends to Watford and Arch's stake in Watford, I'm still at about $158 million but
operating income was $142 million after-tax, which seems like you had a big tax bill on the
operating side of the P&L, but maybe I'm wrong about that.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yes. I can't figure out how you got there, quite frankly, right as I said.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

But we know what our tax rate is.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

We know what our tax rate is. We are at 2.5% on pre-tax operating.

For operating tax rate versus group tax rate?

FINAL

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yes. That real differential is the difference between 2.5 and 2.8 on net income versus pretax operating. So maybe we could have a side call, but I guess, but I'm kind of – I don't
know what you did.

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

FINAL

All right. Good luck with that. I think some of the ghosts and goblins have haunted the
audio on the calls today in revenge. But I guess my first one Mark, do you have the split of
how much of the Watford gross premium in the quarter was essentially Arch's source
business you did to them versus third-party business from (57:18)?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

We really never talk about that explicitly. What I can tell you is that it continues to build
momentum, and we're happy with where it is. And this vehicle, it's really set up to be
third-party reinsurance. So over time this is going to continue to be growing towards
being Watford dominant.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Got it.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

I think I figured it out. But I just wanted (57:57).

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

may not be true in the future, but I'll wait for a future quarter for that one.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

All right, all right. The other question on that is there is picked up somewhere, I can't
remember if it was the Insider or someplace else, suggesting that they are going to hit –
Watford is going to hit $400 million by the end of the year. Do you have any comment on
that or ?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I believe what the article said it was that on an underwriting year basis there is $400
million. So that doesn't mean by the end of the year or another quarter. But it points to
you that it's going to be approximately $100 million a quarter for four quarters.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

Okay. Great. Any thoughts on the satellite – the NASA loss the other day? Is that an
industry event, or is that not have much?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

It's $200 million or something, the only thing I know, I'm not on it, so I'm okay.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Perfect. Perfect. Then my last one this is where the audio cut out a little bit so I might have
missed part of this. Back to the single premium MI, I guess, just to understand that a little
bit. Is that, essentially is that kind of like bulk business, and not GSE bulk, but is it
essentially book from the banks, or is this stuff you are writing (59:31)?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It's an originator where we'll take maybe one weeks or two weeks of production and put
it out, and he says give me a price for you to write the mortgage insurance on this block.
Here is all the underlying loans that we have. And we're going to prepay it up front. Single
premium instead of month. And a lot of this sometimes is paid by the borrower because
they include it into the price of the mortgage, and sometimes it is paid by the lender.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay. And is this just sort of something that makes sense given where you are building
out the company that it's a good way sort to get premiums on the books quickly to offset
some of the expenses, and some way over time as you get more flow or is this?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

No, no we don't think it as such. The way we think about the mortgage business is that
you have flow business, you have this single premium business, you have other
transactions we're doing in the reinsurance, the stacker and transactions, etcetera. So
we're not trying to – we look at the entire marketplace, and if we like a transaction we go
after it. And we don't have a preconceived notion we have to have three of this and two
of that and five of this. That's not the way we operate. You know us better than that.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay. Just checking. Then just my last clarification on that topic is, Mark, I think when there
was a question about how this flows through the accounting, I understand the earned part
obviously, but on the written it sounds like you said this still flows over 12 months? I guess I
would have thought if it was I think that's single premium written, the written would have
all hit this quarter to be earned over 12 months?

Well, I don't know if it is different. So you have your personnel. You got your underwriters,
you got a fixed base of expenses. So at the end of the day, it is what it is. If you write it
and you book it up front, you still have to service it over six years or seven years. So I
haven't thought of it as, is expense ratio different between a flow business versus that.

Okay. And coming back to the insurance segment, I think if you started talking about some
of the small account business where you are growing, being less volatile, does that cost
anything in terms of the anticipated underwriting margin?

Actually, no. I mean it's not that, it's lesser volatile, as Dinos pointed out before. As a
general rule it comes with a lower loss ratio and a higher acquisition cost.

Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much, guys.
