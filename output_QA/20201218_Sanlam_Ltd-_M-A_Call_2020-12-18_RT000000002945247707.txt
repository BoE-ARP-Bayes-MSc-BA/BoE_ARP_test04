Thanks very much, Claudia. And good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and thank you very
much for joining us on this conference call right towards the end of December, when I
know you all want to be on a leave. I'm joined today on the call by Abigail Mukhuba,
Mlondolozi Mahlangeni and Grant Davids. Abigail is our CFO; Lotz, our Chief Actuary and
Chief Risk Officer; and Grands Davids, the Head of Investor Relations at Sanlam.
Today we announced that agreement has reached with African Rainbow Capital Financial
Services, short ARCFS, whereby Sanlam would acquire a 25% non-controlling minority
shareholding in a wholly-owned subsidiary of ARC Financial Services known as ARC
Financial Services SubCo subject to the fulfillment of certain substantive conditions.
Today's announcement follows a circular to shareholders in November 2018 where it was
envisaged that ARC Financial Services would assist Sanlam in the execution of its South
African strategy to enhancing empowerment in the financial services sector and in its own
operations. In addition, it was agreed that ARC Financial Services would amongst other
things, hold strategic investments funded by way of the Ubuntu-Botho preference share
facility.
Through this investment now, Sanlam will share in the value creation within the underlying
ARC Financial Services SubCo investments. A short summary of the transaction is as

follows. Firstly, there's the creation ARC Financial Services SubCo into which ARC Financial
Services will transfer its investments in financial services other than those interest it has in
banking-related investments, namely TymeBank, AI Fund and Ooba. Definitely, Sanlam will
acquire 25% minority shareholding in ARC Financial Services SubCo through a combination
of a subscription for new shares in ARC Financial Services SubCo and the acquisition of
shares from ARC Financial Services.
And finally, any amount drawn down under the ZAR2 billion preference share facility
approved by Sanlam shareholders to be given to Ubuntu-Botho investments are also
being transferred from ARC Financial Services to ARC Financial Services SubCo While the
necessary security remains in place for this preference share facility. More detail on the
transaction value was given in our SENS announcement.
Transaction is funded from Sanlam Life's existing cash resources. Proposed transaction is
categorized as a small related party transaction. Accordingly, the Sanlam Board appointed
BDO Corporate Finance as independent expert to provide the Board with a Fairness
Opinion. BDO has provided a Fairness Opinion to Sanlam Board confirming that the terms
of the proposed transactions are fair to Sanlam shareholders. This opinion has been
provided to the JSE and will be available for inspection upon request.

Bloomberg Transcript

In summary, this transaction strengthens Sanlam's long-term strategic partnership with
Ubuntu-Botho and creates the opportunity for further growth in South Africa. Sanlam is
very well positioned to serve a wide range of clients and through our partnership with
Ubuntu-Botho, we are continuing to create tremendous value for a very broad set of
stakeholders across South African society.
I'm now going to open the call for questions and I'll direct them to whichever my
colleagues is best able to handle them. Claudia, if you wouldn't mind opening the line
now to call.

Q - Sarine Barnard

{BIO 6259120 <GO>}

You're keeping us busy.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

FINAL

You should be on holiday now.

Q - Sarine Barnard

{BIO 6259120 <GO>}

Unfortunately not. So I just wanted to ask about the asset outperformance participation
amount. So can you maybe just expand a bit on that. So the ranges aren't quite wide. And
is there specific hurdle rate and a specific participation fee the investment or how does
that work?

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

No, it's on the whole portfolio, Sarine. So I suppose you can think of it as a sort of
performance fee you might see in an investment fund. So basically if the return on this is
above risk free plus 3% over a three-year period then the participation begins at the rate
of 4%. And then once the performance gets above risk free plus 8% that performance
fee goes up to 25%. And we basically have a three-year period. And at the end of 9
years, the arrangement comes to an end. And so, obviously, the objective is to grow the
fund at above the hurdle rate.

Q - Sarine Barnard

{BIO 6259120 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. And is that performance fee similar to the ARC performance fee?

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

It's similar in deposit, it's very different in terms of its range and detail, but the principle is
very similar. There's also quite a big difference in the fact that there is -- each one is a
three-year period. So if you have a look at the exact details, it's actually quite a lot
different and it's not nearly as you know if you model it out through a whole stochastic
range of potential returns, it's not nearly as generous as the ARC one.

Q - Sarine Barnard

{BIO 6259120 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then just maybe on the discount. So for the listed assets they're
basically, it's at market because you've got the facility to deal with the liquidity premium.
But so for the unlisted assets, so that value, does that include the 25% minority and
liquidity discount that ARC would carry at -- in their business?

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Yes. And then we've applied a discount to that.

Q - Sarine Barnard

{BIO 6259120 <GO>}

Another 10% discount to that. Okay, great. Understood. Thanks.

Thank you. The next question comes from Asanda Notshe from Mazi Asset Management.
Please go ahead, Asanda.

FINAL

Q - Asanda Notshe

{BIO 19227857 <GO>}

Thanks and good afternoon. I hope you're all well. Just two questions from my side.
Maybe to follow on from the question on the performance fee. Maybe just rationale
behind it. I mean Sanlam Life is paying for the stake, I would imagine that you're paying, I
guess, full value for that. And so I just want to understand the rationale and perhaps how
also you arrived at the ranges for the hurdles maybe that compared to, let's say, Sanlam
Life's cost of capital or any sort of measure like that? So just related. And then also the
second question is, why exclude the banking assets in the mix? Thank you.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. No problem (inaudible) Asanda. Yes, look very simply, this is not just a passive
portfolio of investments. It's a very carefully-constructed portfolio of investments.
Obviously, a portfolio that can have more assets added to it and grow over time. And
actually ARC are performing a -- effectively a very active role in developing these assets.
So it's quite different to managing a basket of, let's say, listed assets. It's a very active
approach, A, to finding the assets. B, to working with each of these companies to help
them grow and develop their business and grow the value. And so from our point of view,
it's extremely valuable if we can from Sanlam benefit from outperformance from these
assets then that's tremendous for us.
So basically, we started out looking we've, as you would know, think about our own sort of
hurdle rates that around about traditionally risk free plus 4%, although, we think that in the
next couple of years that's likely to be somewhat lower and I guess most people are now
anticipating post-COVID slightly lower returns over the next couple of years. And so we
developed a -- and negotiated a scale of fees here where if there is really very high
outperformance, we are very happy to give out a proportion of that outperformance. And
so this is going to be an actively-managed portfolio of assets. So that's really the logic and
how we got to it.
And then you asked the question about why exclude the banking assets. I mean Sanlam is
actually very focused on insurance and asset management and sort of related financial
services. We're not at all having any appetite for banking type of assets. You probably
know that we have a number of relationships with different banks. Probably our biggest
and best-known one would be Capitec. And so we don't want to get involved in directly in
the banking industry. Hope that answers your questions.

Q - Asanda Notshe

{BIO 19227857 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.
