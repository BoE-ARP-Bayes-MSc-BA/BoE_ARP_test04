Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all for dialing into this conference call
and for being with us for the presentation of the first half 2015 results of Ageas. As usual,
I'm joined in the room by my colleagues of the Executive Committee, Christophe Boizard,
the CFO; Filip Coremans, our CRO; and also by Antonio Cano, who is currently the CEO

of AG Insurance, but will become, as of the 1st of October, the Chief Operating Officer of
Ageas. Our Investor Relations team is of course also assisting today's call.

FINAL

Ladies and gentlemen, in May, I was pleased to announce to you a good start of the year,
and today, I am even more pleased to report another strong quarter resulting in an
excellent first half results for the group.
Part of this result, as you will have read in the meantime, is rather exceptional, and we
have also been helped by favorable currency rate evolution. But there is also a clear
improvement of the operating performance which is reflected in the figures. And clearly,
AG again has been the main contributor to the growing inflows and the strong results.
The main result headlines announced today, and I'm on slide 1 of the presentation, are the
following. The net Insurance profit for the first half amounted to €, million, which is an
increase of 48% compared to last year and largely above the analyst expectation.
Whereas we already announced last week our Chinese operations contributed
exceptional investment results of around €100 million, which largely explains the
difference.

Bloomberg Transcript

At the same time, the results were also supported by an overall operating performance
which remains very good. And this is illustrated by our group combined ratio being at
95.2%, and our Life Guaranteed operating margin being at 90 basis points.
The group inflows including the non-consolidated partnerships at 100% continue to grow
especially in Asia. The total inflows amounted to €16.6 billion or an increase of 21%. Similar
to the previous years, we have recorded very strong sales in the first half in Asia with
inflows close to €10 billion year-to-date.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we look at the importance of Asia within Ageas, it accounts
today in the first half for about 40% of our total inflows at our stake and a bit more than
40% of the total net Insurance profits.
The outstanding Asian performance is a result of our continued drive to change the profit
mix towards more regular premium business, which has resulted over time in a higher
portion of renewals and has had an almost automatic positive impact on our results.
Hence, one can say that Asia is a real growth engine of Ageas and the reward of 15 years
of close cooperation and efforts.
Notwithstanding this, I'm pleased that all our segments have had positive contribution to
our results in line with our expectations, and this in an environment which is often
challenging and very competitive.
The group net results increased significantly year-on-year to €469 million despite the
negative net result in the General Account in the second quarter as a result of an
increased valuation of the RPN(I) liability. You will remember that, last year, we booked the

Page 2 of 25

Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2015-08-05

end of June a provision of €130 million in General Account in the context of the
FortisEffect legal case.

FINAL

And lastly, on the key issues and topics, the shareholders' equity increased to almost
€0.52 per share or €11.1 billion. The unrealized gain from our investment portfolio
amounted to almost €3 billion or €12.9 per share.
Solvency ratio of our Insurance activities solidified to 234%, among others, driven by the
strong first year – half year results while our net cash position remained close to stable at
€1.5 billion, to be increased with €300 million liquid assets of more than one year that we
have in the portfolio of General Account.
Before handing over to Christophe, I would like to briefly touch upon two strategic files
which also illustrate our constant drive to selectively grow and develop our group
structure. First, we announced end of May the establishment of a new joint venture, this
time in the Philippines, with EastWest Bank. You'll find it on slide 2.

Bloomberg Transcript

This should not be a surprise as we already indicated several times our willingness to
expand in a number of selected Asian markets which have a lot of growth potential going
forward. Like in the other Asian countries, the focus will be on the Life business, and it
represents an investment at first instance of some €60 million, which could somewhat
increase depending on the growth of the company going forward.
Ageas will hold 50% plus one share stake, and the company will be reported as an equity
associate. This transaction also evidences our capacity to conclude on new partnerships
whereby our past successes in the region have definitely helped to convince our new
partner to go along with Ageas.
Our local management team is meanwhile up and running and setting up the company.
Operations are planned to start before the year-end, meaning that the first inflows can
be expected as of next year.
Secondly, I'm now on slide 3. Ageas has recently obtained its Non-Life license to operate
an internal reinsurance company out of the Netherlands called Intreas. This represents an
investment of some €100 million and the ambition is to optimize the group reinsurance
program of Ageas by harmonizing risk profiles among our entities and to further improve
capital management within the group.
And lastly, the board of Ageas has decided to launch a new share buyback program of
€250 million. You will find all the modalities in our separate press release issued this
morning. This proves again our willingness to deploy our cash in a disciplined way.
And I would like to give now the floor to Christophe. I will come back to you for the Q&A
and some closing remarks.

FINAL

Thank you, Bart. So, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I can only confirm that today we are
reporting a very strong set of figures. Let's see them in details now and, as usual, I will
take first the operating results by Insurance segment and then the General Account.
So, first, our Insurance operations. As Bart already mentioned, the net result progressed
substantially to €504 million compared to €340 million last year. As we already announced
last week following the statement on China Insurance Taiping Holdings, our Chinese Life
joint venture Taiping Life to benefit from the favorable equity markets in the first half of
the year to realize part of their investment portfolio and to make quite substantial capital
gains.
Calculated back in euro, this represented around €100 million at Ageas share. In addition,
we benefited from a favorable currency rate evolution which overall explained €24 million
of the positive variance.
Adjusting for these two elements, we still note an intrinsic improvement of €40 million in
the net result of 12% compared to last year. This is mainly driven by the strong growth and
a better product mix in Asia and also by the very good technical Non-Life results in
Belgium.

Bloomberg Transcript

So overall, both the net profit of our Life on the one hand, and Non-Life & Other on the
other hand, substantially improved by 34% and 122%, respectively to €382 million and
€122 million.
But let's follow the traditional order of the segments. I am on slide six of the presentation.
Our Belgian operations reported a net profit of €197 million, slightly up on last year and
marked by lower Life results more than offset by better Non-Life results.
The Life results declined by 24%, mainly because of a lower amount of realized capital
gains compared to last year and a higher tax rate. I remind you that last year, we
benefited from a rather exceptional sale of bonds following some arbitrage and from the
release of the deferred tax liability.
This also explains why the operating margin on Guaranteed products came down, but
remained stable compared to Q1 at 81 basis point, while it increased for Unit-Linked to 43
basis points. We expect to catch up in the second part of the year and to be back in our
85 bps to 90 bps target range.
In the Non-Life result, the Non-Life result continued on the pace of the first quarter with
results marked by a good operating performance. Overall, the combined ratio in the
second quarter amounted to 93.5% after the 95.8% in the first quarter and resulting in a
satisfactory 94.6% for the first six months.
The positive evolution of the prior year claims result and improved performance in third
party liability and benign weather explains the improved ratio. All the efforts to improve
the Non-Life technical results are now starting to pay off.

FINAL

Life inflows remain under pressure especially in the banking products as a result of the
persistent low interest rates. The technical liabilities did not substantially move if we
exclude the change in the shadow accounting liabilities, which is an accounting entry, not
the commercial one.
In the UK now – sorry, I'm on slide seven of the presentation. The net result amount to
€40 million, compared to €32 million last year with good result in household and other
lines and benefiting like in Belgium from better weather conditions. You will remember
that we had that storm and floodings in Q1 of last year in the UK.
The motor market remained as always challenging in the first six months, but market
benchmarks are showing first signs of an upward trend. Overall, our inflows in AIL fell at
constant exchange rates by 6% and in Tesco Underwriting by 10%.
The AIL combined ratio improved to 98.3%, mainly because of the very strong combined
ratio in household, 91.8%. The combined ratio of Tesco Underwriting improved also to
102.5%, but stayed above 100% as you can see, suffering from adverse motor
performances.

Bloomberg Transcript

The net result for Ageas Retail came down to €5 million compared to the €7.5 million last
year and including project cost related to the renewed Retail strategy. Substantial
progress in this respect has been made, resulting among others in a few new
partnerships.
In Continental Europe, slide eight, the net result increased to €55 million with better
results both in Life and Non-Life. For Life, net profit improved by 22% to €34 million with
good results in all entities, but especially benefiting from the higher results in
Luxembourg.
Inflows year-to-date came 5% down marked by a lower second quarter especially in
Luxembourg where management has decided to limit the activity on Guaranteed
products. The operating margin on Guaranteed products improved to 105 bps, while the
margin on Unit-Linked came down to 7 bps.
In Non-Life, the net result was substantially up to €22 million supported by an excellent
combined ratio at 85.8%.
And lastly, Asia, slide nine, as already commented marked by an excellent result of €212
million. And you will appreciate the fact that for this half year closing, Asia is the main
contributor to the group insurance result.
Coming back on this €212 million result, it includes around €100 million exceptional result in
China plus another €90 million positive currency impact. Furthermore, the improved
profitability also originated from better insurance operation with growing volumes.

So Life inflows, Life inflows at constant exchange rates were up 23% to €9.3 billion, growth
comes especially from Thailand and from China. Within the new business, we note a
growing portion of regular premium business, while renewal premium also increased
significantly and represented almost half of the business.

FINAL

Non-Life inflow were up 8% at constant exchange rate, growing both in Malaysia and
Thailand.
This brings me to the general account on slide 10. The positive result in the first quarter
turned into a negative result in the second quarter as a result of the increased RPN(I)
liabilities.
For CASHES, indicative price went indeed up, following the announcement of the
agreement between BNP Paribas and Ageas to further unwind this legacy. Over the first
six months, the RPN(I) value increased to €491 million, up €24 million with the price of the
CASHES up to 80.27%. No new settlements took place in Q2 on Royal Park Investments
for the proceedings in the U.S.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net interest income remain rather stable, while staff and other expenses went up
because of higher legacy related cost and higher cost related to share plan. The net cash
position decreased by €100 million to €1.5 billion and this decrease is explained by the
investments in Intreas, the new internal reinsurance vehicle, Bart already mentioned that in
his comment.
The upstream cash amounted to €366 million. You can find this on slide 13. More dividend
will come in the second half of the year and dividend payment to Ageas shareholder plus
the holding cost will be comfortably covered for the year 2015. Slide 11 and 12 respectively
provide you with the traditional overview of shareholders' equity and solvency.
So let's start with the shareholder equity. The shareholder's equity rose because of the
high valuation of the AG put option, now valued at €1.189 billion and you will remember the
change of methodology already explained in Q1. The total impact of the put accounting in
the shareholders' equity amounts now to €427 million, which would disappear in case the
put was not exercised in 2018.
Secondly, on the shareholder equity, secondly, there is an important contribution from
currency rate differences. And thirdly, there is a positive adjustment on unrealized capital
gain and losses , but you will remember that this amounted a balance between the
change in unrealized capital gain and losses and the effect of shadow accounting.
On the solvency now, so insurance solvency went up to 234% with an increase solvency in
Belgium and in Asia as a result of higher retained earnings, higher valuation on real estate
and absence of dividend payment based on the first six months result.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to end my comment here and to hand over to Frank.

FINAL

Thank you, Christophe. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the introduction, and as
usually, we now like to open the line for questions. In order to allow everybody to ask his
questions, may we ask you to limit yourself to two questions by preference. Thank you.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you very much. And our first question is from Ashik Musaddi with JPMorgan. Please
go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Hello. Hi. Good morning, everyone. So sorry, good afternoon. So couple of questions, first
of all is, can you give us some clarity on what the rationale of doing this reinsurance
vehicle? Is it because of Solvency II? Does it give you capital relief on the Solvency II,
because ultimately, you're putting €100 million of capital in the business, so there must be
some financial rationale as well and which of the business will go into that? Will it be mainly
Belgium or any other geographies? That's the first one.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, any thoughts on the M&A noise that is there in the market on Hong Kong would
be great if we can get some color on that.
Just a quick one on Asia, I mean you delivered a 15% growth in Asian earnings – sorry, on
the group earnings. And I think 30% growth in the Asian earnings in this quarter and in first
half, even after stepping off the €100 million gain from Taiping Life, so what should be the
regular earnings growth we should keep on focusing on from Asia? Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. I propose to pass the first question to Christophe and take the second and third
one.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Okay. So I take the first question on the reinsurance vehicle, Intreas. The first, of course, is
very, very simple. The job first is to optimize, let's say the risk profile within the group. We
are faced with of course whose size maybe very different and we have small operation,
bigger operation, since the reinsurance program are set on a local basis, some protection
can be seen at the group level at too low. And I will take a simple example, if you take Italy
for instance, they are protected at the very low level of third-party liability in motor for
something less than €1 million. For us being protected at this level doesn't make any
sense and we are keen to take more on this. So their reinsurance vehicle will trim this
situation and we will have, let's say, a more homogeneous approach on the group basis.

Page 7 of 25



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2015-08-05

Having said that, it's very common within insurance group to have such a vehicle and I
would say it's not really something new. We are catching up more on this.

FINAL

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yes, but you would get some sort of diversification benefit as well from this under
Solvency II because if we would take like businesses from UK, Belgium and Italy, et cetera,
there should be some sort of diversification benefits.

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Ashik, Filip Coremans here.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yes. Hi, Filip.

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Yes, indeed, we do look at the IRP (24:44) also as a vehicle that opens opportunity to
grab diversification effects down the line.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

But in the first phase, we decided to limit it to look at the improved retention, and in the
second phase, we will indeed study the opportunities to grab diversification effects.
Now in the lines that we will retain already some diversification benefits will come, but that
will be in first phase aimed at the catastrophe course.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

More in the – risk transfer at this point is not truly envisaged.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

All right. That's very clear. Thank you.

A - Filip Coremans

Yes.

FINAL

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Then, Ashik, unfortunately on the second question, I have to repeat the answer we always
give and it's about market rumors, so that we don't comment on them. But the third
question on the growth earnings in Asia, first of all, we of course cannot underline enough
that the €100 million exceptional in China is exceptional, and so it should be not be taken
as any recurring element for the future. But besides that we strongly believe, and it's part
of the reason why we have made all these investments to continue in Asia is that the
progress in the results is strongly linked to the continued growth of technical provisions
and like, but also the growth of the real risk, we take on board be it in accident, death and
so on.
And if you look to the increase of the technical provisions of the non-consolidated entities
of the first half of the year, and this is not only Asia but to a large extent Asia. You see that
the growth in six months is something like 15%, and this is not again an indication for the
future, but the fact that we invest so much in regular premium and in quality leading to
relatively low lapses makes that the portfolio – the underlying portfolio and the related
technical provisions will continue to grow at quite high rate for the coming years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Another last element on earnings, and it has been shown by the exceptional results in
China. Of course, the stock market volatility can always have a positive or negative impact
going forward. But in terms of underlying profit, I think we can confirm that we count a lot
on Asia to further underbuild the growth of the profits of Ageas in the future.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

So ultimately, you're not really concerned about any sort of growth momentum slowing
down in Asia if we split up the one-off ?

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Do you refer to the slowdown of the growth?

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yes, yes .

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Yes. Let's say also there – if you look to take a country like China where the growth is
below 7% the economic growth, but where the insurance industry still has a growth rate
that's higher than. And the main reason we see for that is that there is to be catched up
and the penetration is lower than in mature countries. The population that is capable to
save is increasing.
The incentives from, let's say governments in Asia, to stimulate their people to save for
the older days is positive and not decreasing. But this means that even if the economic

Page 9 of 25



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2015-08-05

growth is slowing down, the growth in the Life business, in the growing markets is
something we still expect that, that will continue. And again, there you have this
reinforcing element of regular renewal of premiums that helps making a growth that's
more than the purely year-on-year economic growth.

FINAL

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

All right. This is very clear. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you very much. And moving onto Albert Ploegh, ING Bank. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Yes, also two questions from my end on cash flow and
capital reversals too. On the cash flows, yes, you showed a very strong first half, a stream
of dividends. With Q4 results, you basically mentioned that you're recently comfortable
within, let's say in dividend stream from your units of around €525 million on annual basis.
The look now into your first half run rates, you are basically at €366 million from operating
units and including the capital restructuring in Royal Park around €500 million. So – and
also, with the comment I think in the call that you do expect some dividends in the second
half, can you give a bit of color?
And also, basically the same, same question, and then looking, for example, next year,
basically now in the first half, your operating entities are at €366 million, holding costs, if
I'm not mistaken, on a full-year basis, are around €100 million. So, without capital
restructuring, yeah, the dividend buffer, how do you look at that longer term? I know
you're not really managing – you're more managing on covering the dividend. So my
question would be, could you have actually more, let's say, if you would not have had the
capital restructuring in the first half ?
And the second question is on Solvency II, I know that is planned for the Investor Day, but,
yeah, in the past, you've always been pretty comfortable on the outcome there. Can you
maybe give a little bit more kind of feeling where it stands right now and, let's say,
because, I guess, the discussions with the regulator have progressed in the meantime?
Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Maybe a general answer and then pass over to Christophe for a bit more detail. I think we
have announced in 2009 our dividend policy and are very keen and attentive to keep that.
Also important to mention that, if you see the growth of the capital requirements, it has
been relatively low, for instance, in Belgium, it's less than 0.5% in H1, into the first half,
which means that we can continue to fund the high-growth markets plus to cover the
corporate expenses and the dividend in line with our dividend policy.
But, Christophe, you probably can give a bit more detail?
Page 10 of 25

FINAL

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

I can refer to my comment. In my comment, I said that we expect something in the
second half of the year, and I said that, with this, the dividend paid to the Ageas
shareholder and plus the holding cost. And by the way, not €100 million, your figure is too
high, it is more in the €60 million to €70 million zone. And in that case, it will be
comfortably covered, but I don't want to give you what we precisely expect on the
second part of the year, but our expectation is that, as I said, the objective of covering the
dividend plus holding cost will be comfortably covered.
Keep in mind that, for instance, in Belgium, with the strike that there is no strong growth,
the capital requirement is quite low, for instance. So, we think that, on the cash flow, we
are very well in the trend. You mentioned the €525 million of last year, we won't be far.
But I don't want to make figures at this stage.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you very much. Sorry.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Relating to question on Solvency II, this is Filip Coremans again, obviously, I'm not going to
say more or a lot more than we said before, but I can still confirm that we are comfortable
with the way things are going.
The main discussions which are taking place with our regulator, but more, I would say,
across Europe, with regulators relating to things such as company-specific volatility
adjustors, those absorption of deferred tax, placement of non-controlled participations
and other aspects of look-through on the investment vehicles, I think all these discussions
are moving ahead. And I would say clarity is being provided increasingly by the regulator.
And so we are well prepared and we will inform you adequately at the Investor Day which
now not so long from now anymore. So I know I'm testing your patience, but I'll continue
to do that and I hope we will not disappoint you when we disclose our package.

Thank you very much. And next in line is Thomas Jacquet with Exane. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Thomas Jacquet

{BIO 4110153 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, guys. Two small questions on Intreas, without giving too much
importance to that, but it's just to better understand the project. The first part is, can it
have midterm an impact on your tax ratio? And maybe another way to ask the question is,
can you share with us the location of this vehicle (35:02)?
And my second question is on the UK market. Inflows are down 6% at constant FX. We
had some more bullish views recently, I think, from some companies and from market
indices. Do you see a trough in the Motor market and do you expect this to recover?
Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So I can start with Intreas, the impact on the tax ratio. As you may have read that Intreas
was incorporated in the Netherlands, and in the Netherlands, we benefit from favorable
tax environment. You will remember that we have a lot of loss tax carryforward, so it
means that we won't pay taxes on the result of Intreas. And it's a joke, but usually say we
have Bermuda (35:59). So it is like this (36:04).
So the tax ratio, the influence is to go down, but frankly, I'm not sure it will be really visible
because at the end, as Filip indicated, we will limit to – mainly to cat covers and the
amount of collective premium won't be huge. And then, apart from this, please keep in
mind that we have to put in place a retro program so that we are decently covered. So
tax-free but not with a huge result.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. And then the UK market. So if we look to our figures, what we have seen is that the
– compared to a year ago, our average pricing went up slightly, something like 1% if we
look to – compared to Q1, it moved up a bit more, plus 3%. And also the volumes moved
up with something like 1.5%. But we moved to what you could call a category of risk that
we assumed, assessed to be less risky. So it means that we have more cars insured than
before, something like, let's say, 50,000 more. But the average cost of these cars that
we insured is lower than it was a year ago. Not for comparable risk but so the risk profile
has been slightly reduced.
We see a number of other companies also announcing that rates went up. We saw, for
instance, the tracker for the Association of British Insurers gives it 2.9% increase compared
to a year ago and a bit more than 2% compared to Q1. But let's say, the fragmentation in
and the segmentation is such that it can nevertheless change from company to company,
in all honesty, we expect it, and it's not the first time I say this, higher increases earlier in
time already a year ago. We expected it for the first time. It starts to materialize more and
more, but the big question will be whether it is sufficient to cope with what we also see
increased frequency and increased average cost of claims, which remains for us, and

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you very much. Just a one question on Ageas Retail in the UK, the second half
this year was meant to be the time when the profit started to improve and you've
confirmed that the project also now coming to an end. So what kind of take off pattern
that and should I assume for Ageas Retail from here?

Bloomberg Transcript

If I just the first half results, correct me if I'm wrong, which is adding back the project costs
of €2.5 million would still leave that business doing a 5% margin on revenue. I don't know
what's correct, but that doesn't feel very high. So what should we be looking for, is the
second half – do we just add back the project costs and that's it, or is the margin on
revenue going to be improving? And what's the ideal figure? Cheers.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

I think on Ageas Retail, three messages of importance, I would say. First of all, we are in a
restructuring program where a lot of efforts have been done to bring down cost. For
instance, we closed a site in Belfast, and that's on plan. Secondly, we also had a year ago
in Retail an exceptional impact, my memory is €6 million, out of recovery of a claim. So
that also explains part of the evolution.
Another element is that we indeed see volumes coming slightly down, and so there's a
point of attention. So the restructuring is well on track from a cost perspective, as for
some attention on, let's say, in turnover or business development perspective.
And the last point is that a lot of the business we do through Ageas Retail is directed to
us, Ageas Insurance Limited, so part of the benefits, if you look end to end there from the
customer to the end – underwriter, part of the benefit of our strategy with Retail is in the
results of Ageas Insurance Limited, so the underwriter.
But for us, the retail market in UK it's high on the agenda to closely follow up. So we
expect improvements. But when and how much is a bit too early to say. We first have to
wait to the finalization of this restructuring program target in the course of last year.

Thank you and hello, everyone. A couple of different questions. First on the Asia Life
businesses, I'm just wondering, have you seen any adverse development in terms of
underlying business growth or lapse ratio development given higher Chinese stock
market (42:23) volatility and so on? I wouldn't expect there to be any, I'd just be
interested in your observations.
Secondly, just coming back in terms of this sort of new reinsurance vehicle, am I correct in
my understanding that essentially this is much more about optimizing the Florida group
reinsurance protection rather than necessarily going to lead to a very material movement
in your overall retention ratios? But if I'm wrong on that, please correct me.
And then finally, can you just give us update in terms of development on your Turkish NonLife business? I'm actually (42:57) trading was quite difficult there. I would be interested in
your own experiences.

Q - William H. Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Okay. I'll try to get through some of these. Asia, on the ground, given some recent
volatility particularly the Chinese stock market, are you seeing any adverse development
either in terms of underlying business growth or policyholder lapse rates?

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. I think I'll repeat the question. I think the question was that we see volatility on the
Chinese stock markets and whether we expect or we have seen some adverse results
coming out of this? Is that the question?

Q - William H. Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Yeah, in terms of sales growth and in terms of policyholder lapse behavior?

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

That's question one. Question two is in terms of...

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Wait, wait, wait. First, we will answer question one.

Q - William H. Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Until the end of Q2, we did not see any effect. Of course, most of the policies we sell are
probably with guarantees and what we call the quality of this production is very good, with
more than 90% persistency rates. Maybe, Filip, you can add another point?

A - Filip Coremans

FINAL

I can maybe just give the comfort that, from our perspective, the volatility in the stock
market, of course, if growth were to slow, it will maybe have some longer-term impact.
But as Bart explained first and foremost, the recurring, the regular premium new business
and the renewal book in China are more than 60% – almost 65% of the income, and
these are all long-term contracts which actually create sustainable inflow.
Then also in the latest statistics, and I think China Taiping will give more color to that soon
at their press release, but the persistency rate in China are still amongst the highest
Bancassurance channels, they are above 90% but equally so in agency.
And what we also see and which is powering the distribution power in China still being
built up, where the number of agents has further grown from first half last year, 112,000,
130,000 to now almost 150,000 agents. So also the further strengthening of the channel
and the diversification away from the dependency on Banca makes them also more
resilient. So, of course, economic reality has impact, but we are confident that there is still
growth to come out of China despite the turmoil.

Bloomberg Transcript

The stock market does not immediately impact the results, nor the solvency yet at this
moment, because let's not forget that that market rallied even today after the
corrections, but you know that better than we do probably, that they are still more than
70% up year-on-year. And even compared to the beginning of this year, that market is still
17% up in equity. So, the capital base is largely intact and the growth potential is clearly still
there.

Q - William H. Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And my second question was in terms of the reinsurance initiative,
should we expect any material change in your property and casualty retention ratio as we
think about our forecasts?

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

So, we are again hesitating on the question. I think the question was reinsurance as an
internal organization vehicle, confirmation, please? Secondly, will it have some impact on
future capital retention and ROE? I think that was the question.

Q - William H. Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

It's more just in terms of thinking about growth rates in premium to net rates in premium,
what will be the level of retention change?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Okay. So the retention will be slightly higher since we built this group retention. So
retention will be higher, but not with huge figures, as I said. And as regard to the ROE, the
older (47:48) project was designed with our profitability target, so we are in the range of
11% for this project.

Okay. And then the final question, can you give us an update on trading in Turkey, please?

FINAL

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

So, in Turkey, we have seen, and we are not the only one, it's an industry issue, that in
Motor third-party liability, the average cost of claims has gone up substantially. And the
main reason is that more and more, let's say, Turkish citizens use the capacity to introduce
claims for bodily injuries within a time span of 15 years after the accident. So this is
something that not only we but also the competitors are confronted with.
Something we did and it's not for the last year, we did it as soon as we entered into the
company, was that we were not that keen to have a very high market share in motor thirdparty liability. And year-after-year, the proportion has been reduced, but, for instance, like
last year, you will remember that we nevertheless had to build up additional reserves
what impacted 2014 results.
Today, to give an example, only 7% of our portfolio is motor third-party liability, it was 12%
a year ago. And when we entered, it was almost 25%. So, it has been continuously
reduced, but we nevertheless see that the result in that business line is below
expectations.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second element explaining the result in Turkey or the combined ratio in Turkey, that's
above what we envisaged is that there has been bad weather in the first half, of course,
not to the proportion of UK and Belgium last year, but snow has been impacted in some
regions in Turkey, the results in Household.
So, an area of attention, but it's an industry issue. And we try to limit our – the impact for
us by decreasing our market share in, let's say, in a product line is not profitable the way
it's now in Turkey.

Operator
Thank you. And moving on with Benoît Pétrarque, Kepler. Please go ahead. Your line is

Q - Benoît Pétrarque
Yes. Good afternoon. First question on my side is on the dividend received from Belgium,
the €294 million. I think, in Q2, you have also issued hybrids I think the tune of €160 million
at AG Insurance. So, how much of this dividend is actually relating to the increase of your
hybrid ratio, therefore, your capacity to pay for the higher dividend to the group?
Second question will be on the dividend for H2. Is that correct to assume that you are
missing a divided from the UK and do you expect anything from Asia, I mean, it's
Page 17 of 25



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

something decent given the volatility on the market?
And just maybe to finish it, just on the CASHES, do you – have you seen any impact on the
– on a net cash from the CASHES buyback? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

On the dividend received from Belgium, there is no directly link between these two
operations. On the issuance of the hybrid instrument, it was more replacing an existing
instrument and which was called the Icon, (52:05) and we did a tender offer. It was not
100% successful.
So it means that we will see – the first call date is next year, in 2016. So it means that the
issuance is slightly above what we recovered from the tender offer. So there is a gap. We
are slightly better covered, but we have to keep in mind this deadline of next year in 2016.
But all in all, please simply consider that we replaced the Icon, (52:39) so this is not
related.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then on your second question, dividend from the UK, do we expect something from
Asia? As I already mentioned, we are clearly expecting something in the second half of
the year, and you rightly mentioned that UK has not paid anything so far. So you are right,
but maybe UK and Asia will be the main contributor for what I mentioned before.
The impact on the net cash position from the CASHES deal. So first, no deals have taken
place so far for the simple reason that BNP Paribas had to ask for authorization to do so,
and they have only recently received the authorization from the ECB, so no deal. So – and
then the contact will be directly made by BNP Paribas with the bondholders and, frankly, I
don't have any views on what they will do in the future if the pricing is adequate for them
or not, we are followers. What we said is that, for us, it will be a limited amount, and we
expect, that's kind of guess, at most, €100 million, but with rather high success rate.

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions on my side. Just looking at the
Belgium Life business and the net underwriting result, it seemed to have deteriorated in
Q2. And I know that you made a statement in the release about some adverse mortality
experience. And I'm just wondering if you could give a bit more color on that and if you
expect that to revise throughout the rest of the year?

Page 18 of 25



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2015-08-05

And then my second question is I'm just wondering in terms of outstanding litigation in the
second half of the year, if there is any important dates that you're aware of that you could
flag for us?

FINAL

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. For the Belgium underwriter results, you're right and it's also mentioned in the press
release, so that compared to a year ago, this is a consequence of an adverse mortality
which is of course something that's very volatile from one year to another. But if you look
to last year and this year, it's about €15 million. So it's not a number of cases where
people die more than the year before.
But if we look to the overall margin, so underwriting expense investment, take into
account to what Christophe mentioned, the lower unrealized cap gains than the year
before, and we see that the margin, the overall margin, in the Guaranteed business is
quite in line with the target we have set our self. You also see, for instance, that same net
underwriting result in Unit-Linked gives a difference of €5 million. So, overall, it's a €12
million change, and there's no, let's say, no recurring tranche that we see in – with respect
to the mortality.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Okay. And the second question?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Right. Regarding update on the main movements in the contingent legacies and whether
they are important dates coming up in the second half of this year, I can say that all is
relatively quiet on that western front. I mean, you can find on page 58 an overview of the
main developments, and there are still some mentioned for the second half of 2015. But
you can also see the main points, the VEB which is one of the most important
development, the pleadings have been delayed now for sure to the first half of 2016, so
nothing will happen there in the second half.
The judgments on the merits, which are still there for the separate proceedings in the
Netherlands, which are smaller proceedings, also are shifting slowly, we don't know
certainly, but slowly towards the first half of 2016. They're still there, but we also
encounter delays in the procedures there.
The proceeding of the pleadings for Mr. Bos also have been delayed because of delay in
filing his trial briefs. And that is also pushing it forward. The only real – how should I say –
judgment that we can expect is the (57:45) procedure in Belgium. The tentative date has
been published and the first announcement could be expected after the 24th of
September.
So the earliest that we could hear something about that is on the 21st of September. And
the content of that judgment, of course, we don't know that yet. But I would say the worst
case would be that it reconfirms what is already being confirmed by AFM, one ruling on
the same period and largely on the same topics.
Page 19 of 25



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2015-08-05

So we should not have too many surprises, but of course, I don't know the judge's final
ruling. But that's the only one where we would expect something, and the fine, this is an
administrative procedure, so the fine which was in first instance would – at €500,000 is
probably what the exposure is on that.

Your line is open.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, there, guys. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Firstly, in Belgium, I noted that
in the second quarter as well there was quite a big reserve release, well above what
you've had in previous years. So is this related to just lower frequency that you've seen in
your book? And therefore, can we expect it to be sort of maintained at decent level at
least this year and going forward, if you can comment on that?

Bloomberg Transcript

And secondly, in Household Insurance in the UK, are you seeing pricing pressure? We've
seen some commentary that low reinsurance pricing is putting pressure in that market, if
you could comment on that, that would be good. Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

On – maybe starting with the second question, UK, going to Belgium so that I can also
hand over to Antonio Cano. So, in UK, we see indeed a starting pressure in pricing in
Household, which is – I look into the markets where Motor is very competitive and on
under pressure. And Household, even last year with the weather events and certainly also
this year has a nice profitability. So it's not abnormal that a search for increased market
share moves now to Household. So this is something to be followed up and where, again,
we will follow our course to go for profitability above volume.
In Belgium, may be important to mention is that, indeed, the prior year release has been
substantial in Q1, also what you could see higher than a year ago in Q2. But as Christophe
mentioned the last time in – with the Q1 results, over the year, this will be flat, be
flattening and converge to a lower release than the one we had at the end of Q1 and the
end of Q2. That's our expectation in any case.
We may not forget also that the year ago have under (1:01:03) release was 4.2%. And at
that moment, we had a very strong strengthening of reserves in the other lines primarily
due to the third-party liability. It was about something like €30 million reserve
strengthening. So you could say that the 4.2% of a year ago was below our more historical
release. And if you look over the last five, six years, a release in Belgium prior year of 6%
to 7% is more the normal rate.

Page 20 of 25



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

But maybe Antonio can give some insight on why Q2 still had the 7% release where it was,
a year ago, 3.5%.

FINAL

A - Antonio Cano

{BIO 16483724 <GO>}

Thanks, Bart. I don't really have a lot to add. The exceptional releases were indeed more
in Q1 of this year. We commented already when we commented the Q1 numbers. Q2 was
not really very extraordinary. Towards the end of the year, the exceptional release prior
years will come down. And I expect towards the end of the year to have, let's say, in a
special release for the whole of the year of maybe 2% to 3% only. Apart from that,
nothing really special to mention.

Q - Steven A. Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Hi, guys. Thank you very much. I see the second quarter combined ratio was at 94%. And I
believe this is probably one of the best combined ratios quarterly that Ageas has actually
achieved for a long time. I see that the Portuguese and Italian operations are doing very
well. It's less than 85% combined ratio. And the minority buy-outs have obviously helped
considerably here.
But going forwards, I just wanted to know, in your opinion, in your Non-Life business,
where is improvement needed, why is it needed, what's causing the problems. Obviously,
outside of the consolidated entities, that's Tesco and Turkey, which appear to be
significantly worse than your current combined ratio of the consolidated entities. If you
could provide any kind of color on what further improvements then what is being done,
that would be very helpful.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Well, first of all, as mentioned sometime ago, we target the combined ratio of 97%.
Overall, in the business mix, we've got the business mix being a combination of
geographical regions and also profit lines. When we internally look to combined ratios per
product line, it can differ from one product to another just because the financial income
that we have from the yield on reserves can – is very difficult in different data. For instance,
Household where the claims are arranged in a very short period compared to disability or
workmen's comp, where it takes a lot of time or even more so where you have longerterm payments in a number of cases.
So we clearly – and it's also, I would say, in our press release, we clearly draw the attention
on Motor where still work has to be done but we also are aware that this is a very

Page 21 of 25



FINAL

competitive product. But the question is to find a good balance between a product that is
also, in many cases, building product for a customer and the other products surrounding
that are less under the same price competition to find a good balance and to take actions
where needed. We probably did not have the occasion in this call to underline that not
only reserve releases or recourses recognition in Belgium have led to this low combined
ratio, but also a number of quite drastic actions that have been taken in the second half of
last year in this third-party liability and also in workmen's comp has helped to improve, the
portfolio has improved pruned. A number of contracts have been canceled. Rates went
up in some areas with 10% to 20%, underwriting has been made more severe.
Referring to UK, we moved more to, let's say, the segment of customers that we know
best being the 50-plus, and even there maybe the 70-plus, but with lower average
premiums, but also lower risk profile. So it's a continuous work to try to find the right
balance, and our main objective and remains to stay around that 97% or lower. We are
there now and we – okay, we'll do everything to take all the initiatives needed to stay in
that range.

Thank you very much. And moving on to Matthias De Wit, KBC Securities. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. I have got three small questions. First is on the dividend, what
should we expect or how should we think about the dividend for over the full year
following this very strong H1 performance? Yeah, you have a target payout policy of 40%
to 50% off of net insurance profit, but I wonder whether you will make an exception for
the exceptional capital gains in the Chinese business in paying out or setting the dividend
over this year?
Secondly is to come back on the Insurance solvency, I'm a bit confused on the Belgium
quarter-on-quarter increase. Could you maybe break it down between the hybrids, the
organic capital generation, the capital gains? And could you confirm whether the Belgian
Insurance solvency is reflecting your dividend accrual?
And then lastly on Belgium Unit-Linked sales, they came down a bit from last year while
you see a relatively strong increases at certain peers. So could you provide some color on
these trends and I was also wondering whether or not you were planning to introduce
new type of Unit-Linked products in Belgium? Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. For the dividends, we have this dividend policy of 40% to 50%. We continuously
respected it. We have made one exception in 2011 with the Greek crisis where we, let's
Page 22 of 25

FINAL

say, somewhere corrected for the Greek crisis. The decision on dividend is taken in
February once we have the full year results. But I see no reason why our dividend policy
would not be respected as we have announced it being a dividend between 40% and
50% of the net result of the Insurance operations. So, no reason as far as I'm concerned
to not speak to our policy with respect to the annual dividend.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

So if we expect them or if we see a good second half and corresponding strong year-onyear increase in earnings over the full year, then we could probably expect also an
increase in the dividend?

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Let's say, if we apply the dividend percentage on an increased profit, we normally – it
should be a positive outcome.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Filip, you take the second question?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

I have the answer but only partially for you because I actually have not all the figures, it's
up by region on the movement. But the main contributors to the increase in the solvency
ratio, obviously, come from the increase in the strong (1:09:16) fees in the capital.
And the main contributors there are obviously the profit indeed in Belgium which was
significantly high. Also additional unrealized capital gains which we booked on the
property portfolio which amount close to €100 million, slightly above €100 million. And
let's also not forget that the equity market in Belgium did well and also there, although
our portfolio is limited, we had additional capital gains on that.
And indeed, your question on dividend is relevant because this one does not have the
dividend accrual in it, whereas the end-of-year figure did have the dividend accrual. And
these are the most important components of the move.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Then on Unit-Linked?

A - Filip Coremans

I'll take the question on the Unit-Linked business. It's fair to say that the inflow levels have
remained more or less leveled slightly down. We have introduced some new products

towards the end of Q2 which seemed to be working well. So we'll see a bit higher inflow
in Unit-Linked in Q3 as things stand now.
Overall, we remain pretty satisfied with the product Unit-Linked. Be aware that a lot of our
Unit-Linked products are in fact structured products with a capital guarantee, and low
interest rates do have an impact on the effectivity of these products as you cannot
construct a product that gives a relatively high upside to the customer. So the structured
Unit-Linked products suffer also a bit from the low interest rate environment. But I expect
that in Q3 you will see an increase coming from new products.

Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your good questions. To end the call, let me
summarize the main conclusions.
I think we have a very strong set of results based on solid operating performance. Based
on the current results, Ageas believe that 2015 can become an excellent year. Secondly, I
am pleased that we could conclude the new partnership in the Philippines and take part in
other important growth markets in Asia. And lastly, we announced the fifth share buyback
program in a row, evidencing our clear intention to return cash to the shareholders if we
consider this to be the best alterative use of cash.
With this, I would like to bring this call to an end. Don't hesitate to contact as usual our IR
team should you have outstanding questions. Thanks for your time, and I would like to
wish you a very nice day. Good-bye.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you very much for
attending. You may now disconnect your lines.
