Welcome to the Lancashire Holdings Limited Q4 results conference call. At this time, all
participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to your host, Richard Brindle. Sir, you may begin.

Richard Brindle

{BIO 1983776 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody. I'm joined by Alex Maloney, our Group Chief Underwriting
Officer; Elaine Whelan, our Group Chief Financial Officer; and Denise O'Donoghue for the
Q&A, who's our Group Head of Investments & Treasury. I'll just make a few brief remarks
and then I'll hand over to Alex.
In my long years in this industry, I don't think I've ever seen such a disconnect between
rhetoric and reality. Although more measured voices have started to be heard in recent
days and weeks, the relentlessly positive commentary on the rating environment from
companies is simply at odds with the facts of what is happening in the actual, as opposed
to what one might call the virtual, market.
A minor, and short-term, uptick in SME commercial US property rating has been
represented as betokening a broad-based rise in the property lines, which, sadly, is simply
not the case.
This is not a bad market. I cannot speak for casualty with any authority, but the short-term
lines are holding up reasonably well. But risk-adjusted rate increases are rare, and this

year will be a struggle.

FINAL

As far as our core portfolio is concerned, dull is good this year, although we will, as always,
be on the lookout for anomalies and niches in the market.
We are also excited about the formation of Lancashire Capital Management. There is no
doubt in my mind that ours is an industry in transition. We will expand this area of our
business in a responsible and measured way, but this is a transition that we will be at the
forefront of.
And I'll hand over to Alex at that point.

Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Richard. 2012 was potentially a difficult year for Lancashire, with the biggest
marine loss ever and a huge insured loss from the Northeast US storm. Both claims hit in
our core lines of business.

Bloomberg Transcript

To produce a net-loss ratio of 29.9% for the year was, therefore, a great result, and
testament to the hard work we've done on the portfolio to get the right balance between
risk and reward.
In an uneven market with strong rating in some lines, such as energy and property retro,
but heavy competition in others, such as terrorism and AV52, I'm pleased that we were
able to maintain a solid core portfolio, with an RPI of 104% across the whole book.
Looking at the individual lines, Energy has had a really solid year. There were no major
losses, although there was the usual one of attritional events. Pricing was at good levels,
and, although the increases that we've been obtaining over the last four years have
petered out, RPIs of 103% on the worldwide and 100% on the Gulf of Mexico books
represented a fair outcome.
We increased our gross written premium to just over $240 million; a 5.2% increase over
2011.
There is plenty of construction and new assets being deployed right around the world,
and we're travelling to meet clients in Asia, Africa, Russia, the US and Europe.
We're continuing to work on the Energy liability products, as we understand the risks
involved and we know the clients. Prices are at their highest level ever paid, so it merits
further work, and we believe that we can build a decent portfolio.
For Marine, there was a brief flicker of optimism that the tragic Costa Concordia event
might bring some backbone to the Marine market. But despite the fact that the client
base, in this case Carnival, conducted themselves very well at the subsequent renewal

Page 2 of 14

and paid an appropriate increase, the excess capacity in the market meant the optimism
was soon extinguished, and rates returned to flat.

FINAL

The IGPIA renewal has attracted a lot of attention and opened up some possibilities for
Lancashire, but, in general, the market is disappointing.
Even though Marine reinsurance saw significant rises at January 1, 2013, we still didn't
believe that the cat exposure had been sufficiently addressed to warrant deploying
additional capacity. The divergence between reinsurance and the direct pricing may force
rate increases into the primary market eventually, but we are not holding our breath.
In Terrorism and political risk we had a good year finding new opportunities, and holding
rates pretty steady, with an RPI of 97%.
We market our capabilities in this area constantly, and it pays off with an excellent
submission flow. As such, especially in the Terrorism book, brokers will work with us to
structure a program around our participation, and we can influence, not just the pricing but
the loss level at which we attach as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our sovereign book has grown substantially, and our overall political risk accounted for
over $41 million of written premium in 2012.
In Aviation, the excess AV52 niche product, which is our cornerstone, continued to be
competitive as the mainstream hull and liability markets increased their retentions and put
pricing under pressure.
Absence of losses and abundant capacity means only one thing in insurance, but we
battled hard to keep our 93%.
The marketing of our new satellite business got off to a good start with $23 million of
premium bound in 2012. We have started 2013 with a loss of the Intelsat 27 explosion, but
we expect losses in this class and this doesn't affect our view of the product.
In Property, our exit from D&F has taken a good deal of tail risk and parameter risk out of
our exposures, which boils down to less uncertainty around the model.
We've been able to write reinsurance and retro with increased confidence. Retro pricing is
at good levels at our higher attachments points and obviously Accordion has had a very
successful year throughout 2012.
On the cat XL side, the Japanese market also had good pricing for both earthquake and
wind products in April and we were able to increase our exposures there.
In the third and Fourth Quarter we were, as usual, quick to respond to opportunities after
the Thai floods.
Page 3 of 14



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2013-02-21

In the US our book was pretty stable, which reflected the market and the rating
environment.

FINAL

We launched our new Saltire product in November and, although we had a lot of interest
to date, we have only sold one contract. It is a complex product, combining non-elemental
and elemental protection on an aggregate and occurrence basis, with a feature being
that the capital relief will fall to the buyers.
We will continue discussions with potential clients throughout the year and we are pleased
to say that our third-party partners are very supportive of our measured approach.
Looking into the crystal ball for 2013 is the usual patchwork of expectations we would
expect, absent our 2002 or 2006-type post-loss environment. For Energy pricing this will
be fairly flat, but we think pricing is at good levels so that's okay.
On the Property reinsurance side we're already seeing predictions that Florida pricing
could be down as much as 15% in June. This is a not a market we participate in, but we
expect our portfolio to be flattish.
On the retro side, pricing in Germany stayed at good levels at January 1.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Marine and Aviation we don't expect anything dramatic, but our portfolio is pretty much
100% core so we don't think there will be too much change.
We will continue to build out our satellite portfolio and we're optimistic that we will find
new opportunities in the Energy liability line.
If all that sounds a little dull, it's worth remembering that dull is good in our business. We
look after our brokers and our core business and we'll be ready for the opportunities
when they come.
And on that note, I'll pass over to Elaine Whelan.

Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Thanks, Alex. Hi, everyone. Our results are on our website as usual.
Despite the impact of Sandy we've had a strong quarter, producing an underwriting profit
of $57.3 million and a combined ratio of 71.9%. Our return on equity was 3.1%, bringing us
to 16.7% for the year. Our compound annual return from conception is now 19.2%.
You will also have seen in our release that we've declared our usual final dividend of $0.10
per share, but also a special dividend of $1.05.

Page 4 of 14



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2013-02-21

Taking capital first then, as you know we declared a special dividend last quarter of $0.90
per share. Last quarter we had held back some capital following Sandy for two reasons.

FINAL

Firstly was simply because it was pretty early days following the storm. While we expected
our loss to be contained in our Fourth Quarter earnings, we wanted to take some time to
fully assess the impact on our numbers.
Secondly, we had hoped we would see some effect in the market, some hardening of
rates. Our Sandy loss is well within the range we published in December, at a net $44.5
million to the Company, and we still produced a decent profit for the Fourth Quarter.
While Sandy probably held pricing up, we didn't really see any dramatic change and
certainly don't think there are any spectacular opportunities on the horizon. It's really just
more of the same; pricing is decent but not exceptional.
We also issued debt in the Fourth Quarter and that gave us some extra headroom too.
While we put some of it to work, we're back to the same place in terms of outlook; so
we're returning around $200 million in capital over and above our standard final ordinary
dividend.

Bloomberg Transcript

That gets us back to around the $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion level of capital, which is a good
level for us in today's markets. That puts our leverage at around 17% or 18%, which, again,
is a good level for us.
Let me just flip back to Sandy for a moment. The majority of our reserve is Property D&F.
Our Property cat and retro books were largely unaffected, with only a small reserve
booked for Property cat accounts. There are a couple of Accordion accounts that we're
monitoring, but no reserves have been posted as yet.
We mentioned last quarter that we had some ILWs in place that trigger at a $20 billion
industry loss level. PCS's latest number is $18.75 billion, although technically for us it's $18.4
billion due to certain state exclusions. It's not quite there yet, so we haven't taken any
credit in our year-end numbers for recoveries from that.
We're obviously watching that meticulously and we're expecting PCS's next report to go
out in late March. On our current reserve for Sandy, if the ILWs trigger, we'd expect a full
recovery of $40 million.
Alex has talked about our (1/1) renewals and 2013 outlook, so let me just look back at the
quarter we're reporting on.
Our premium level I shouldn't think would be a major surprise for anyone. We stopped
writing D&F on July 1, so there's only a few million dollars of premium coming through
there.

Page 5 of 14

Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity

FINAL

Property, cat and retro are a bit behind Fourth Quarter last year as there were some
opportunistic deals written last year that didn't renew. Otherwise, we saw a boost in our
Aviation premiums from our new satellite book.
Just a quick note on premiums for 2013. Again Alex has mentioned our renewals, and we
wrote a bit less retro at 1/1 than last year; about $18 million less. There's more capacity
coming into that market, so that will have an impact on pricing and how much we renew
for the rest of the year.
We've ceased writing D&F, so there'll be a drop off in premiums there. Otherwise, I'd say
our portfolio is broadly flat to last year, although there's some Energy and Marine multiyear deals that won't be up for renewal just yet.
That said, we're seeing some attractive new business flow in those classes. We'll also
have the benefit of the prior-year multi-year deals in our earnings in 2013.
So all in, while we don't give top line guidance, we're likely to see some reduction in our
gross written premium, although we expect to maintain our portfolio quality. In fact, this
increased our session to the Accordion sidecar to 100% now and we also trimmed some
(inaudible) accounts at 1/1. So on a risk-adjusted basis, we're sitting very nicely.

Bloomberg Transcript

Back to the 2012 numbers, we saw some adverse development on prior-year reserves
this quarter, although for the year we had net favorable development.
Of the $15 million adverse development we had this quarter, most of that relates to
development on Thai flood losses driven by updated loss adjusters' reports received.
Given where our reinsurance program attaches, we don't see that developing much from
here.
The CD premium adjustment you see this quarter is reinstatement premium adjustments
in relation to that Thai flood loss development.
As far as Japan, New Zealand and some of the other prior larger loss event reserves go,
they've been pretty stable with no material movement.
Our accident year loss ratio for the quarter and year are 30.9% and 34.6% respectively;
so pretty impressive results by any standard. Our attritional ratio for the 2012 accident
year is running at around the 20% level.
Just a reminder, when you're comparing our reserve development to the prior year, we
had a few things in 2012 that we highlighted were non-recurring.
Firstly, we had a reserve study conducted in order to adjust the industry factors we were
using to our own history. That led to a decent sized release.

Page 6 of 14



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2013-02-21

We also had sizeable releases on our (inaudible) reserves on our political risk book, plus a
bunch of other medium-sized Property claims that closed in our favor during 2011.

FINAL

Moving onto investments. With all that was going on in the world in the Fourth Quarter, we
had a total return of 0.3%, which we're pretty pleased with. That gave us 3.1% for the year,
which is a great result, given the volatility and uncertainty out there.
We continue to try to limit the downside risk in our portfolio. We have funded a small bank
loan portfolio, and are looking at other measures to limit interest rate risk and volatility. No
significant changes in the portfolio, though; we're just tinkering around the edges.
The last thing I'd like to mention is on the uptick in our financing cost. Our new debt issue
is paying a coupon of 5.7%, with our existing debt 3.7% over LIBOR and EURIBOR. Our
current blended rate is about 5.8%-ish.
There are also some costs in relate to the new debt issue, about $1.5 million, that won't
be a recurring cost.
With that, I'll hand back to the operator for questions.

Questions And Answers

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)
Ben Cohen, Canaccord.

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

Could I ask two things? Firstly, could you say a little bit more about the opportunities in
Energy liability, maybe something about the tail of the business that you would look to
write there?
And the second thing was on Saltire. You've signed one contract so far. What's the
outlook for that picking up? Where are you with discussions with other clients?
And maybe you could also just touch on its success, or not, in the context of this, the new
venture that you've announced today. Thanks.

A - Richard Brindle

{BIO 1983776 <GO>}

I'll take that, and then I'll ask Alex to talk about Energy liabilities.
I think one of the problems with third-party capital is that companies feel obliged to
deploy it when they raise it. And that's just not the way we look at it. I think, in hindsight,
we could have spent more time preparing the ground with potential clients for Saltire.
Page 7 of 14



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2013-02-21

FINAL

But the main factor in us not deploying was, of course, Hurricane Sandy, which just came
along and, clearly, hogged the front page, if you will, for the latter period of last year.
We're in no hurry to deploy. When we returned the unused capital to the shareholders,
they were actually very appreciative that we hadn't just felt, right, we've got your money,
now we're going to use it willy-nilly. We could have done that, but it wouldn't have been at
the return levels which we require, both for ourselves, in terms of our retention, and for
our partners.
We've got the whole of 2013 now to talk to people. We think it's a great product, from a
number of angles. On the cat side, it's sitting in a space which is largely unoccupied. On
the risk side, it offers something pretty unusual. And yes, we're going to work closely with
our brokers to widen the client base.
But just because we raised capital doesn't mean we have to deploy it. And we're not
blinded by the fees. I think, with respect, some companies can be. And that's just not the
way we look at it.
We look at it as a much more long-term thing. We think our credibility with investors is
something which has to be built up over time. And we think ours was a responsible course
of action to take.

Bloomberg Transcript

Alex, do you want to talk about Energy (lines)?

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

I think, like anything, we see the Energy liability market as a possible opportunity. The
reason I'm saying it's a possible opportunity is because, in general, when the market's
flat, there's not many opportunities and you get a couple of opportunities here and there.
But I wouldn't say it's a broad opportunity.
We are comfortable with Energy liabilities. Effectively, we're insuring the same people that
we insure on the Property lines. We know the clients. There is a need for cover, particularly
for offshore contractors and operators at a certain level.
And for us to write this business, we're pretty much going to see it at a level where the
kind of event that's going to affect your liability budget is going to be a Macondo. And
that, obviously, brings down any issues you've got about the tail of that business.
I think it will be complementary to our Energy lines. We do currently write some Energy
cogency anyway within packages, and this is just something we're looking at at the
moment.
So I can probably give you a bit more of an update on that in the next couple of quarters.
Most of that business renews between now and July, anyway.

Page 8 of 14



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2013-02-21

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

And you mentioned that pricing there is at an all-time high. Can you give us any
comparison, in terms of either against another line or pre-Macondo, where it stands now?

FINAL

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Yes, okay. This is not going to be exact, but I would say for offshore pricing for big clients,
pre-Macondo, it's at least double. So on a historic basis, it's never paid any more than it's
currently paying. That's not saying today's price is the exact price.
And if you look at some of the renewals, if you look at what's happened to a lot of the
liability market, they've had to take much bigger retentions on their reinsurance programs,
and pay a lot more for cover. And if you look at some of the rate rises charged in the
direct market, that doesn't appear to be enough to make up the difference. But I think
that's pretty much the story across the board.
If you look at the whole market, the reinsurance market is quite disciplined; and
particularly for loss-affected business, clients have had to pay more for their reinsurance
and, in some cases, take bigger retentions. But direct underwriters are not really passing
that on, so you have to question the margin on some of this business.

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right. Thank you very much.

Operator
Chris Hitchings, KBW.

Q - Chris Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

I'm just -- a couple of things. One, just a detail. The impact of moving the ceiling rate on
Accordion to 100%, and the other changes to the protections on your Property account, I
think you've mentioned. I'm just trying to get what kind of relationship -- what kind of
overall ceiling rate we're going to see, because, clearly, most of the retro business is
written in the first half.
So does that mean we're going to see a markedly higher ceiling rate in the first half of
2013?
Secondly, I think -- I'm intrigued that your attritional loss ratio is, effectively, virtually zero.
And I'm trying to work whether, in fact, the book of the business, ex D&F, is actually
structured such that, really, the attritional loss ratio is zero. Or is this unusual?
If you were modeling this business going forward, as I have to and, presumably, you do,
then what kind of attritional and cat loss ratios should we be thinking? And is it much
different? Thanks.

Both of those are for Elaine, please.

FINAL

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

I guess, in terms of how to think about Accordion, we ceded 85% last year, and we're now
ceding 100%. We wrote a little less, in terms of the dollar value of the Accordion contracts
as 1/1, but, in terms of the net impact on our book, it's about the same as we would have
ceded last year.
So last year, in the First Quarter, we ceded about -- we wrote about $64 million of
Accordion-related retro contracts; 85% of that, which is about $54 million. And this year,
we wrote about $55 million, $56 million of Accordion contracts, and we're ceding all of
that.

Q - Chris Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

Yes, okay. So in terms -- yes, okay, fine. That's very helpful. And almost all the Accordion
business is written in the First Quarter, isn't it? Or --?

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Mostly, yes. Most of our retro business is written in the First Quarter. We do do a little bit
throughout the rest of the year, but not so much, and --

Q - Chris Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

Okay, fine. That's very helpful. Thank you. And the attritional loss ratio?

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

On the attritional loss ratio, there is a couple of things impacting that this quarter.
Obviously, when you strip Sandy out, it looks like our accident year ratio is about zero.
We did have some reserves that we put up earlier in the year, on US hail and tornado in
Q1 and Q2. So if you go back to Q1 and Q2, you'll see that our accident year ratio was a
little bit higher. We actually had a favorable development on the current accident year
prior quarter losses, this quarter.
So that brought that down, plus some other cat related. So if you back them out, we're
probably actually looking at an attritional ratio for this quarter of about 10%; which is still
low. And that's just reflective of just very low reported losses this quarter.
If you go back to last year, you're probably looking at an average run rate of about 22%.
This year, we're closer to 19%, 20%.

Q - Chris Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

Page 10 of 14



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2013-02-21

And so if I looked at -- yes, because, clearly, it's come down, partly because the D&F
book's gone. And presumably, the D&F book was a source of quite a lot of your attritional
loss experience. I wonder -- I realize attritional loss ratios would come down, post the
D&F, but I didn't realize they'd come down -- it's very hard to gage how much.

FINAL

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Yes. Our attritional ratios have come down more, because we're using our own
experience as opposed to industry loss factors. And that was something that we did last
year, pretty early on, which is why last year's reserves were a bit chunkier.
So I think we had vindicated last year, if were running with about 25% attritional loss ratio
to knock off a couple of points on that. This year has just been low. It's not really driven by
D&F. So the attritional losses are more in the Energy and Marine books.

Q - Chris Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

So you would very much keep to the original guidance, that somewhere around 20%, 22%
attritional loss ratio is reasonable.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Yes. Absolutely.

Q - Chris Hitchings

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you very much indeed.

Operator
Olivia Brindle, Barclays.

Q - Olivia Brindle

{BIO 17273762 <GO>}

I've got two questions. So the first one is on your cat risk exposure, and I see you've taken
that down both for the 1-in-100 year and 1-in-250 year events. I gather that's related to
buying a bit more reinsurance cover and I just wondered if you could comment a bit on
the rationale for that.
Then the second one is around the new capital management business. If you could give a
bit more color on the structure of that and, in particular, two things. Are you investing any
of your own capital at all to back that? And also, are you targeting any minimum size for
what that business might be?

A - Richard Brindle

{BIO 1983776 <GO>}

Let me deal with the first part of the second question and, as to structural investments, I'll
hand over to Elaine.

Page 11 of 14

FINAL

I think there is a structural change on the way in our industry. There are vast amounts of
money in the world looking for a return. A lot of the sources of money don't really
currently have a strategy for the ILS space. There is a clear logic in some of that money
coming to be deployed by people with good track records, like ourselves.
We've obviously already done Accordion and Saltire and it's something that we're taking
very seriously. Whenever industries undergo fundamental change, you have the option of
either -- some of them you think the change is sensible and inevitable, which I think it is for
both of the above. You have the choice of sitting on the sidelines or getting involved and
trying to help shape the way that this convergence takes place.
There have been some perfectly sensible comments by others about hot money. I agree
with that. Some of the money is hot, but this is not our operatives. We're looking for
longer term partners.
Obviously you have certain types of investors who are in and out and who could get
spooked by a loss, but there's also a lot of other money out there which is hard earned,
slower to get on board, but, once you do get it on board, likely to be stickier, and that's
really where we're looking.

Bloomberg Transcript

We're not putting ourselves under any pressure to grow this thing at a certain rate.
Obviously, as always, we will use our underwriting judgment first and foremost, but this is
coming soon to a cinema near you. This is definitely a structural change that is underway in
our industry.
There will be those who sit it out, and I think they run the risk of looking rather one-paced
in a few years' time. There will be others who get too over excited and think that every
single deal they see can be transformed with third-party capital, and that will probably
come unstuck.
But we think the right approach is to acknowledge that this transition is underway, to
embrace it, to take the lead in fashioning it, but not to be blinded by the fees into
underwriting business we shouldn't be underwriting.
As to structure and investment, I'll hand over to Elaine and then, Alex, maybe you can
cover the point about cat exposures after that.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

As Richard says, it's really just recognizing and formalizing what we've already been doing
in terms of this space. So it's just putting a new business division in place.
These things are driven either by a market opportunity, like Accordion, with a retro
product, or by designing a product like Saltire was. So it will be some kind of combination
of the two of those, no doubt, that we end up with going forward. And nice to have some
of this on the go, but not too much that we end up losing focus on Lancashire itself.

Page 12 of 14

So we would like to grow it a little bit. As Richard says, we'll take our time with that and do
that slowly. And in terms of capital for it, we have plenty of capital headroom for this
business and for our business divisions.

FINAL

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

To answer your question, Olivia, at January 1 there was quite a lot of changes to our cat
towers. We had a very large treaty renewal that wasn't renewed, which we knew about.
You can probably work out who that is.
Then it's very much a case of us looking at the towers. So if we're looking at US Wind,
we're looking at Japan, we're looking at our Energy towers, and, in an ideal world, we
would have the towers all level and that would probably be the most optimal use of
capital.
I think we are very close to that now. What we've done on Accordion, we can't have too
much retro on our books because it would just make our exposures too spiky. So that's
why we increased the quota share from 85% to 100%.

We did buy some opportunistic reinsurance, which, increasingly, is an area that we're
happy to look at. I think that our Bermuda underwriting team is now fully integrated with
our actuaries and modelers.
We're just getting much better at looking at risk and return and trying to get the most
optimum use of capital, but without forgetting the (saws); the more traditional
underwriting factors like continuity for clients.
So I'm quite happy with where we are on a risk-adjusted basis year on year.

Okay. Thanks very much. And just, sorry, to follow up on the capital management point. So
there's no target for now and you're not actually putting a penny of your own capital again
for now, although you could do in the future. Is that right?

A - Richard Brindle

{BIO 1983776 <GO>}

Yes. That's right, Olivia. We've obviously had an investment in Accordion and Saltire and
we will make investments in future iterations of third-party capital deployment. But there's
no target.
We're not really into targets. We don't have targets for our premium, we've never had
that. We have forecasts, but we don't have targets.
How can you really have targets in a cyclical market? You've just got to roll with the
punches and see what the market conditions are like. If you set yourself targets for
growth in a cyclical market that seems, to me, completely daft.
