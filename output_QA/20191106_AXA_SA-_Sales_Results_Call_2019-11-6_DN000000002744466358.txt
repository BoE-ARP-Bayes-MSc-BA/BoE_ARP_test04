{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to AXA's Conference Call on our activity
indicators for the First Nine Months of 2019. I'm pleased to welcome Gerald Harlin, our
Deputy CEO and Group CFO, who'll be taking you through the highlights of the release
from last night, and we'll be very happy to take your questions afterwards.
Gerald, for the last time, I hand over to you.

Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

joining our call. As you can see from yesterday's release AXA has delivered another
strong performance for the ﬁrst nine months of 2019. Overall, total gross revenues
increased by 5% at Group level, with all geographies contributing to the growth and we
see continued growth momentum in our three preferred segments, i.e. P&C commercial
lines were up 7%, Health plus 6%, and Protection plus 3%.
Our balance sheet remains very strong with a Solvency II ratio at 187% at the end of
September. We will come back to solvency later on in the call. So let me now take you
through the details of the activity for each of our geographies.
In France, total gross revenues increased by 4% with growth across all lines of business,
and notably in our preferred segments. Health in France was up 7%. Unit-Linked sales

were down 10%, as the rest of the French market, but oﬀset by an increase in our savings
products. We remain extremely disciplined in managing our French General Account
Savings business with inﬂows broadly oﬀset by outﬂows. And so, this means no dilution of
our French General Account from growth in savings business.
In Europe now, total revenues grew by 3%, notably with plus 4% in P&C commercial lines
which increased revenues across all countries as well as plus 4% in Health. Life and
savings revenues in Europe were also up 3% with growth across all countries except
Switzerland in the context of the Swiss Group Life transformation.
Moving to Asia now, revenues and APE in Asia were both up 4%. A few things to have in
mind for the regions; as you know, in Japan, there was a tax rule change related to the
COLI products, which are corporate -- Company-Owned Life Insurance in the second
quarter of 2019. This had a strong negative impact on APE,
If we exclude the impact of the Japan COLI products, APE in Asia overall was up 15%. The
strong increase was driven by higher sales in Japan from Protection with Unit-Linked and
Health, strong sales in Hong Kong from Protection with savings and continued growth in
China.

Bloomberg Transcript

We did see some slowdown in sales in Hong Kong to Mainland Chinese customers in the
third quarter, following the impact of social unrest. This was, however, mostly oﬀset by
continued strong sales to domestic customers. APE for the nine months for Mainland
Chinese customers was minus 20%. Growth from domestic customers was plus 23%.
International revenues grew by 5%, notably driven by Mexico, Turkey and Colombia with,
again, continued growth in preferred segments. Revenues declined in AXA IM impacted
by lower non-recurring fees.
Let's move now to AXA XL. AXA XL revenues continued to be strong, up 11%. We are
growing selectively, as you can see. Revenues in P&C Insurance grew by 18% and
specialty was up 8%. Reinsurance revenues were up 2% with growth in Specialty
Reinsurance business and reduced volumes in property lines Price increases at AXA XL for
the nine months were 6.9% in insurance and 2.8% in reinsurance. Pricing momentum
continues to build in the third quarter alone for -- versus the same period last year, prices
in insurance were up 11%. This is a very favorable environment for AXA XL's key
businesses.
As outlined in our press release, in the third quarter of 2019 and early into the fourth
quarter a series of severe natural catastrophe events occurred, resulting in above-average
claims charges for AXA XL, mostly in reinsurance. At this stage, given the severity of these
events and combined with ongoing wildﬁres in California and other smaller net CAT
events, we estimate that AXA XL may incur claims charges of circa EUR0.4 billion in excess
of the normalized level of CAT nat at AXA XL for the second half of '19.
This level of deviation from normalized and taking into account a relative normal year for
nat CAT elsewhere in the Group means that we remain very much within our overall
Page 2 of 15



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2019-11-06

tolerance level for earnings deviation, which I remind you is EUR0.5 billion at the Group
level, net of tax for one in 20 years.

FINAL

Now, moving on to Solvency II, which as I mentioned earlier was 187%, well within our
target range of 170% to 220%. This is a very strong level, especially in the context of the
very low interest rates in September.
Since then, rates are up signiﬁcantly and we have clear structural increases in the coming
year with the integration of XL in the internal model, potential equitable holding sell down
and the sale of AXA Bank Belgium; all of these elements more than oﬀsetting the impact
of future deleveraging.
So to conclude, AXA delivered another strong performance in the ﬁrst nine months of the
year. We recorded strong topline growth across the group. Our balance sheet remains
strong and resilient and we experienced an elevated level of nat CAT at AXA XL, above
our normalized level and through the rest of the industry -- and as for the rest of the
industry. This should continue to contribute to favorable pricing environment for AXA XL
and its businesses.
I'm now happy to take your questions.

Questions And Answers

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
(Operator Instructions) The ﬁrst question comes from Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley.
Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Good morning, Gerald. I've got three questions please, all on XL. Firstly, just looking at
the reinsurance segment of XL, how happy are you with the sort of risk appetite of that
units? And how long can we expect you to reshape that book if at all going into
(inaudible) renewals. It's the ﬁrst question.
Secondly, in terms of the protection to reinsurance business, I think at the Investor Day
last year you talked about the alternative capital and capital protection for the reinsurance
segment. Can you talk a little bit about what the gross net is on those reinsurance losses
and how much protection we've got left for the remainder of the year?
And then just ﬁnally, can you make a comment on if there is any trends of note in manmade losses in the quarter to date? Thank you.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Okay. So let's start with the reinsurance business. So, indeed we had quite elevated CAT
levels. I could say that normally speaking we should beneﬁt from higher -- you know that
Page 3 of 15



FINAL

Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2019-11-06

we beneﬁted mostly from strong price increases in insurance and less in reinsurance. As
mentioned in reinsurance, we were at 2.8%. I should say as well that on the CAT side, we
decreased our top line and that -- as we mentioned, we have protections. On your
questions on should we reshape or not our risk appetite, I would say that this is
something that has been done already. What would -- what we could do, it means that we
could -- we could eventually slightly further reduce our exposure to CAT mostly in
reinsurance. That's the point that we will see. We will update you later on and mostly
when we will publish our Q2, our full-year ﬁgures in February.
So that's what we can take. But keep also in mind that there are other lines which are quite
proﬁtable. And globally speaking, I would say that the outlook for the global commercial
lines is pretty good with continued increase in rates, and we are not the only one to
mention it.
So that's -- about the man-made losses, you remember that we said in the ﬁrst half that we
had roughly in excess of EUR0.1 billion for man-made large losses. I would say that the
trend is still there, it's still more or less the same. So that means that a relatively high level
of man-made losses and we could say that it could be of the same magnitude of the -than in the ﬁrst half. So that's mostly it.
As far as the protection is concerned, so that means that we have our global protection
level and our excess of loss aggregate protection and that this protection has not been hit
yet.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

And was there a big gross net on these Nat CAT losses so far?

A - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Could you repeat your question please, Jon?

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Sure Andrew. I'm just saying is the numbers you put out in terms of being above the
budgets, is there a big diﬀerence between gross and net on those numbers. Have you
actually got any meaningful protection that you beneﬁted from so far in the second half?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Okay. As you know, the protection is at a much higher level. So that means that -- again I
should insist on the fact that we are within our tolerance level. I mentioned that we had -we were have in excess of EUR0.4 billion over the expected level, it is EUR0.4 billion pretax. I remind you that tolerance level is $0.5 billion post-tax. So that means that we are
completely within our tolerance level.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay, thank you very much.

The next question comes from Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America. Sir, please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning everyone. Three from me as well, if that's okay; but I'll try to
keep it to just one for XL. Just wondered if you could give us any detail on how much
you've actually allotted for the California wildﬁres? I think the others were quantiﬁed, but
not Cali wildﬁres, just wondered if you can give details on that.
Secondly, just wondered if you could comment on debt leverage today, after you've done
a few redemptions over the last few months, just wonder if you could give us a rough
update. And thirdly, it was just on AXA Life Europe, should we still expect that transaction
to complete by year-end this year? Thanks.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, Andrew. So about the California wildﬁres, we are not speaking from a very large
amount, so it's part of it. But it has nothing to do with the scale of what happened last
year. So, globally speaking, you know that Hagibis as well as California wildﬁres are quite
recent events. So we are just in the estimating phase, but we don't expect it to be very
strong as far as we are and the impact won't be very strong on the AXA XL. That's our
guess today.
About the debt leverage, so we are -- you remember that we said that we would be at
roughly -- we'd be at 30%, 31% at the end of June. We mentioned that we would be in
September at 30%. I conﬁrm it, and we should be at 28% -- around 28% by the end of the
present year, taking into account the reimbursement.
I should say as well that taking into account the fact that we conﬁrms that -- we conﬁrms
that we intend to sell the totality of equitable holding up to the end of next year means
that we conﬁrms the 25%. So as far as the debt leverage is concerned, we are absolutely
on track.
As far as AXA Life Europe, what I can tell you is that we are still expecting the green light
from the Central Bank of Ireland. You know that it's always complex so -- but we are
expecting it.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Yes, thank you very much.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

And then the beneﬁt of course -- and the beneﬁt of AXA Life Europe will be -- will come
later on.

The next question comes from Kamran Hossain from RBC. Sir, please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. It's Kamran Hossain from RBC. Two questions; the ﬁrst one just on AXA
XL, could you maybe talk us through what the losses might have been last year if you've
had basically the same catastrophe losses, same reinsurance program or no change to
reinsurance program, what the kind of H2 might have looked like versus what you've got
this year? So that's the ﬁrst question. And then the second question is could you maybe
update on when we expect AXA Tianping to consolidate? Thank you.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Okay. First of all on the losses, I would say that the program was not fundamentally
diﬀerent. So it's been reﬁned. But let's keep in mind that when you compare last year with
this year. It was much stronger last years than it is today. So that means that the EUR0.4
billion that I mentioned would have been much higher last year.
AXA -- but I remind you as well that as we mentioned -- we mentioned that last year our
excess of loss and our aggregate coverage, reinsurance coverage didn't trigger. And
about AXA Tianping, so I believe that before the end of the year anyway we'd consolidate
it.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Fair enough, thanks very much.

Operator
The next question comes from Farooq Hanif from Credit Suisse. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, thank you very much. Apologies to keep asking this question, I just want to clarify the
EUR0.4 billion. It seems to me what you're saying is you've made an allowance for events
in Q4 and you seem to have some level of conﬁdence that it's not really going to be much
above EUR0.4 billion, is that because you think you're close to triggering protection?
So can we be -- maybe ask it another way, are you still very conﬁdent that you'll be limited
at EUR0.5 billion within your tolerance, almost regardless of what happens in Q4.
Question two is casualty inﬂation, so there has been a lot of commentary from US primary
carriers about problems in the casualty book. Can you remind us how much casualty
business you write in XL and what potential reserves are there and whether you are
seeing anything. And the last question is, if we take internal model for XL the European
VA business, exit from US Life and net deleveraging, where do we end up in terms of
management actions on the Solvency II ratio net from one of those actions? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Okay. So Farooq, let's be clear, meaning that, as you know we said that the average level
of CAT for the whole Group is EUR1.5 billion -- it's EUR1.5 billion pre-tax. For XL, it's half,
EUR750 million. And what I said is today, taking into account the expected losses for Q4,
which took place in October, then, we would have a deviation of EUR0.4 billion and this
takes into account exactly what we know today. It's an up-to-date estimate and it's
assumed that for the rest of the year, it would be in line with the average. That's what I can
tell you.
About the casualty -- about the casualty business and I could say that there has been a
large loss activity in the casualty insurance marketplace in the US. It's been driven by
social inﬂation and there had been a slightly higher frequency of large man made losses
on casualty.
Outside the US, I would say, it's a far lesser and the extent is much, much smaller. So it
leads to an increased pricing across many of our casualty lines. And in the US, we can
expect that this dynamic will continue in -- will continue in 2020.
So it means that we beneﬁted from very strong price increases in this year and we can
expect it to go on. That's mostly it. We can share the ﬁgures with you when we have all the
details of these ﬁgures, but it's -- if that's ﬁne.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

So it's just returns -- apologies. So basically if you had more events by the end of this
month and by the end of December, you know heaven forbid, if bad things happened,
would you still feel comfortable that you'll be capped a EUR0.5 billion above the budget?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

No, we wouldn't be capped, as I said, because we are not at the limit of our aggregate. I
would say, nevertheless that we are already in November. And I can say that from a
statistical basis, and today, generally speaking, we said that the hurricane season ceases
mid-November. So we are not very far. That's what I can tell you. But for the time being,
we cannot say that we are capped. Nevertheless, keep in mind that we assume that for the
next -- for November and December we are implicitly taking the equivalent of EUR130
million roughly of CAT coming from XL.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay, that's clear, thank you very much.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Okay.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hello. Hi guys, thank you very much. Just one question, with the solvency ratio, can you
explain a bit more how you achieved such a strong operating return, plus 5%? That really
seems very, very strong.

FINAL

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Okay. So, Nick, we had normalized operating return of 5 points. We had -- we assume
minus 3 points coming from the dividend and we have been operating variance of plus 2
points. You know that it's quite logical to have operating variance. There are more
positives than negatives because we're, as usual, relatively cautious. That's what I can tell
you.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

So, could you tell us which business lines were contributing to that?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Well, it was mostly the P&C business.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay. So maybe (Multiple Speakers)

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

France and Switzerland.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Right. So would that imply reserve releases or something like that?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

No, it's not reserve releases, but it means that it's an operating variance coming from
lines, which are P&C lines in France and Switzerland.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay, that great.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

You can -- okay, you can have -- Nick, it's not because you have releases, you know that
you can have releases, but you can -- you have also -- we are tracking as usual, the level of
reserves and when we consider that this level of reserves is increasing, this level of excess
reserve is increasing then we have to adjust it and that's what we call the operating
variance here.

The next question comes from James Shuck from Citi. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Thank you, good morning. I had three from my side, if possible, please. First one, just a
quick one, for the losses of Dorian, Faxai, Hagibis, could you tell me what you're basing
those oﬀ in terms of industry losses, please?
Second question, linked to kind of Casualty trends and just the XL reserving situation you
booked EUR1 billion P-GAAP reserve margin at the time of the acquisition. Could you just
tell me how that is developing over time, given the trends you're seeing on the loss cost
and other developments since then please?
And the last question was just around the Solvency II development in Q3. So we had H1
with negative market impact of 9 points. By nine months that have gone to negative
impact of 3 points, implying 6 points of beneﬁt in Q3, just given the interest rate
movement in Q3 standalone, I would have expected that to be worse in Q3, not better. If
you could just shed some light on that, that'd be helpful, please.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Okay. Starting ﬁrst with the three catastrophic events, so roughly speaking it's -- we are
assuming that it would, it would be $25 billion.

Company Name: AXA SA

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

So, can you just split those between the three please?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

FINAL

In total, in total, so $25 billion in total.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Yeah, could you split those between the three perhaps?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

No, because we are making assumptions. So, globally speaking, we prefer -- we have to -one important point that I wanted to share with you, don't consider that the only way to
assess claims would be a kind of top down approach. It's a combination of top-down and
bottom-up approach. So that means that don't consider that we are starting from the $25
million that I -- $25 billion that I mentioned and that we take our market share.

Bloomberg Transcript

No, we are most sophisticated than this, meaning that the $400 million has been backed
by -- I would say, adequate assessment of the claims line-by-line. That's a better view and
it's a combination of these two approaches which makes that in the end, we announced
the EUR0.4 billion.
The second question is the development of the casualty. You are right saying that we had
minus -- that we had EUR1 billion, it's euros of excess reserves links to -- linked to our PGAAP. And your question was clear on what's the evolution. That means that we consider
that today we are well reserved, and that we are well reserved and that this EUR1 billion is
suﬃcient in order to cover an eventual increase of reserves. So that's it. And I don't see in
the foreseeable future any kind of need to reinforce our reserves taking into account this
buﬀer.
The last question is on Solvency II, so we had a minus 9 points into the ﬁrst half. We had
minus 5 points in the third quarter. So the total market impact is minus 15 points. And
what I could add is that if we would do it today, it would be minus 11 points, meaning that
we recovered the equivalent of 4 points by the nine months by the -- in November; in
October and obviously the ﬁrst days of November, to be clear.
So everything equal, it means that we would be not at 187% but we would be at 191%, so
that's it. And there were some questions -- you asked a question about what are the
moving parts. We could say that as we mentioned XL, we still are expecting that XL will be
integrated in our internal models and the upside by 2020 should be between plus 5 and
plus 10.
Then we have the operational return net of dividend, which could be expected between
plus 5 and plus 10. Then we have equitable holding. I remind you that we still have an
economic interest of 30% to sell 148 million shares corresponding to 5 points to 6 points
of solvency at the time it will be sold.
Page 10 of 15



Company Name: AXA SA

FINAL

And then we have AXA Bank Europe, it's been published and you noticed recently and
we mentioned that the upside in term of solvency should be plus 4 points; Last, AXA Life
Europe, circa 1 point. This will be oﬀset by the deleveraging. I answered the previous
question and saying and conﬁrming that we would be at 25%. And we see a minus 5
points impact on the solvency. So I hope it's clear. There are all the moving parts that we
could expect for the rest of -- for the rest. But it will be by 2020, pay attention.
XL internal models, it's clear that it will be by the end of 2020, operational return will be
spread over the whole year. And equitable holding, it will depend at the time we will sell
it. Last point AXA Bank Belgium, it will depend on the closing, so it would be at closings
that we'll get the 4 points.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

No that's helpful.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

And for the deleveraging -- for the deleveraging, on top of my head, it correspond to
EUR1.7 billion of which EUR1.5 billion should be reimbursed in April.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. I think some of my numbers are a bit oﬀ for Q3, but that's helpful to
get that pro forma. Just one quick question, in terms of the mix of debt between senior
and subordinated, obviously most of your debt at the moment is subordinated. Do you
see any need or would you like to rebalance away from subordinated more towards
senior?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Not for the time being, so meaning that you are right saying that most of our debt will be,
when I said that we'll have 25%, most will be subordinated. So, for the time being, there is
no plan to fundamentally change. You know that today the spreads are quite -- it's quite
small, meaning that the diﬀerence between a subordinated debt and the senior debt is
not so huge. So that's why we don't plan in the foreseeable future to change it.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Okay, that's very helpful. And good luck for the future. Thank you Gerald.

FINAL

Q - Colm Kelly

{BIO 19140684 <GO>}

Thank you for taking my question. Just on the solvency, a number of peers in France have
cited challenges with respect to their subsidiary solvency ratios for the respective French
life insurance businesses, which is logical, given the low interest rate environment. I
appreciate we've had positive interest rate developments fourth quarter-to-date, but I was
just wondering if you could take the opportunity maybe to update in that context on the
solvency for France. Is there anything that would concern you there with respect to
upstreaming in the second half, et cetera. Thanks.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Okay. No, that's a good question, because I'm quite conscious that a lot of our peers or
some have been communicating on the need for recapitalization and so on. It's not at all
our case and I wanted to be clear on this. In France, we have a general account of EUR110
billion and this is on top of roughly EUR35 billion of unit-linked business.
First of all, I should say that our general account business has been managed extremely
cautiously over the last years, meaning that we didn't dilute our business. Take the
example of this year in -- over the ﬁrst nine months, roughly speaking, inﬂows oﬀset the
outﬂows. And that's the name of the game.

Bloomberg Transcript

That means that all our peers who have been hit or who communicated on some -- the
absolute need to stop this General Account where is it coming from? It's coming from the
fact that they diluted their funds to such an extent that their fund is exhausted.
It's not that all our case meaning that we can keep our funds over the last years, roughly
speaking, as I said inﬂows equaled outﬂows. So it was quite well balanced. We stabilized
the general account and we can -- over the next years, we have absolutely no fear and we
can keep it like it is with -- so taking also into account the fact that contrary to a lot of our
peers, we sell much more unit-linked business.
We, in the ﬁrst nine months, we had 35% and the peers are, on average, at 24%. So the
combination of, I would say, very prudent management of our General Account, no
dilution over the next years, a strong percentage of unit-linked business, and I should say,
which has been absolutely in favor of our policyholders. All of this makes that we have
absolutely no fear, no need for recapitalization, and we are quite relaxed as far as our
capital level of AXA France is concerned.

Thank you very much. I'll give you some respite from XL, Gerald and all three diﬀerent
questions from me. First one, on the solvency, can you conﬁrm what management actions
you took in the quarter and what impact those had. I think you took out some further
hedging. But I was just -- yeah, it'd be great if you could quantify any actions.
The second question was on AXA IM, very strong ﬂows there. I was just wondering if you
could split those between the XL integration third party inﬂows or anything else. And I
mean maybe just in the context of the changes announced. I mean the results look pretty
good, I'd say from these results -- from yesterday release. So I'm just wondering if you
want to elaborate on anything that you think can be diﬀerently in your new role.
And then maybe ﬁnally the EIOPA review has been out for a few weeks now. I was just
wondering if you had any comments that you wanted to share from your analysis of that.
Thank you very much.

Okay. So management action. No, nothing speciﬁc that I could -- that I could mention.
Maybe some people that -- one point that I didn't mention yet is that, keep in mind that
with the decline in interest rates, we have an exposure to Japan and the decline of interest
rates -- long-term interest rates in Japan has been lower than for other currencies.
So, meaning that we have always an active management of our solvency. You remember
what I said many times, that means that in the investment side we optimize, that means
that we have -- we trying to privilege the assets with a strong return on solvency and that's
what we did. So nothing speciﬁc Peter, nothing speciﬁc to mention on that side.
On AXA IM, I could say that on AXA IM we had -- roughly speaking, plus EUR10 billion
coming from XL. We had plus EUR2 billion on top of my head, coming from the third
parties and we had also an outﬂow coming from the JVs and from China of roughly EUR8
billion.
You asked me about my new role. I would say that my new role -- over the last 10 years,
I've been in charge as the CFO of the investment side of the Group. So I know AXA IM
quite well. Maybe some of you remember that I've been CFO long time ago. I've been at
the Board over the last 25 years, and knowing -- you know that the success of AXA IM up
to now has been on what we call the win-win. What is a win-win? It's the fact that we invest
ﬁrst for the insurance company in new asset class and then after a couple of years, we can
sell it to the outside world.
My mission at AXA IM obviously clearly will be to develop this business. It's a nice
business, it's a fee business and on the both sides of the two categories of assets, which
are core assets and alternatives, I remind you that today we have EUR110 billion of
alternatives, over the EUR800 billion total AUM, meaning that these two categories of
assets will be develop and it's my mission. I will do it. I'm conﬁdent that we'll achieve it.

FINAL

So the third question was the EIOPA, it will -- EIOPA is a completely diﬀerent topic. EIOPA
is a -- I would say that, as you know they've been, we are in the preliminary phase. EIOPA
is screening diﬀerent, I would say alternatives in term of evolution of Solvency II.
Personally, I'm absolutely convinced that nothing will happen. Not at all in 2020. At the
earliest, it will be '23.
Second, you can imagine that it's not because the EIOPA is screening diﬀerent
opportunities, including strengthening of certain criterias or certain parameters that it will
be accepted by the Commission. So that's it. So, honestly I'm not worried by this and it's a
long time before we will see any change.
Did I answer your question? Peter?
