I'm joined on the call by Denis Kessler, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief
Executive Officer; Mark Kociancic, Chief Financial Officer; and Connect members, JeanPaul Conoscente, Laurent Rousseau, Frieder Knpling, Francois de Varenne. Romain Launay.
Paolo and Brona are unable to make it today, but we are joined by Redmond Murphy,
Head of Business Performance for the Life division.

FINAL

With that, I would like to hand the floor to Mark Kociancic, Group CFO.

Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Thank you, Ian, and good morning, everyone. In 2019, the third consecutive year marked
by a high level of natural catastrophes and man-made claims, as well as the persistence
of a low interest rate environment, SCOR demonstrated once again its capacity to absorb
shocks.
The dividend delivered -- the group delivered a solid performance in 2019 and performed
well against both the profitability target and the solvency target of its new strategic plan
Quantum Leap. We've demonstrated good value creation capability by successfully
reporting sustainable and profitable growth and increase in profitability and a further
strengthening of solvency.

Bloomberg Transcript

SCOR wrote over EUR16 billion of gross written premium during the year, representing an
increase in excess of EUR1 billion, being 7.1% increase over 2018 at current exchange rates
or 4.1% at constant exchange rates. Overall, SCOR's net income for 2019 stands at
EUR422 million, up 31% compared to 2018.
This translates into a return on equity of 7%. Normalizing for the natural catastrophes and
reserve release, the return on equity stands at 9% above our Quantum Leap profitability
target of 800 basis points and above the five year risk-free rates.
The solvency position of the Group stands at 226% at the end of the year, above the
upper-end of the optimal range of our solvency scale. This elevated solvency level is
driven by strong capital generation of EUR1 billion, accounting for positive 31 basis points
of solvency alone, as well as by efficient capital management, which are partially offset by
the negative impact of interest rate movements.
Turning to Slide 5, let's look at the business units in more detail. SCOR Global P&C grew
strongly at 12.7% at constant exchange rates. The business unit continues to expand its
franchise in the US, where we're uniquely positioned to gain market share. Meanwhile,
and despite the high level of natural catastrophes and man-made claims notably in the
third and fourth quarters, SCOR Global P&C recorded an underwriting profit for the year
with a net combined ratio of 99%. Combined ratio benefits from EUR110 million of reserve
release and includes a nat cat ratio of 11.6%, above our budget of 7%.
SCOR Global Life continued to successfully expand its franchise and delivered a strong
level of technical profitability in 2019. SCOR Global Life gross written premiums were
slightly down at 1.8% with constant exchange rates and up 1.2% at current exchange rates,
Page 2 of 14



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2020-02-27

and this is due to the renewal of certain financial solution deals as fee income under
deposit accounting.

FINAL

Had this been renewed as premium, SCOR Global Life growth would have been 4.5% at
constant exchange rates. The Life technical margin is strong at 7.5%, slightly above the
Quantum Leap assumption and benefits from the positive impact from the financial
solution deals just mentioned, renewed since the beginning of 2019 as fee business.
SCOR Global Investments pursued prudent asset management strategy and delivered a
strong return on invested assets of 3% in 2019, supported by a recurring yield of 2.6% and
realized gains of EUR93 million over the year.
Moving on to Slide 6, SCOR has seen a strong growth in its book value over 2019. Even
taking into account, the dividend payment of EUR325 million last May, our shareholders'
equity increased by 9.4%, compared to the end of the year 2018 to reach EUR6.4 billion at
December 31, 2019. This significant increase of EUR546 million in the Group's book value
is largely driven by the net income of EUR422 million, EUR359 million of positive impact
from revaluation reserves, and EUR126 million of positive impact from currency translation
adjustment due to the strengthening of the US dollar.

Bloomberg Transcript

Overall, the book value per share stood at EUR34.06 at the end of 2019, up from
EUR31.53 the previous year end. This strong increase of the book value has mechanically
decreased the financial leverage by 1.1 percentage points since the beginning of 2019. The
adjusted financial leverage ratio that allows for the intended call of the debt callable in
October 2020 stands at just above 25%, in line with our Quantum Leap assumptions.
Moving to Page 7, SCOR generated strong operating cash flow standing at EUR841 million
in 2019. SCOR Global P&C provided robust cash flows in line with expectations despite
significant claim payments on the 2017 and 2018 natural catastrophe events. SCOR Global
Life experienced lower cash flow as a result of the volatility on claim payments as we
noted earlier in the year. Overall, the total liquidity of the Group is very strong and stood
at EUR1.5 billion at the year end.
Moving to Page 12, SCOR is pursuing its strong shareholder remuneration policy in the
light of the Group's high capital generation and strong solvency position. And in line with
our consistent capital management process and dividend policy, a cash dividend of EUR1.8
per share for 2019, up 3% compared to last year, and totaling EUR335 million will be
proposed at the Annual General Meeting. So you'll be aware that the industry is facing
two hot issues now; social inflation in the reinsurance industry and the coronavirus.
Now, I'll ask Jean-Paul and Frieder to discuss these two issues. Let me hand it over to
Jean-Paul first. Jean-Paul?

Jean-Paul Conoscente

{BIO 20770277 <GO>}

Thank you, Mark. Let's move on to Page 19. We have recently seen an increased focus
upon social inflation, notably in the US, with the recent spate of announcements from
Page 3 of 14



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2020-02-27

companies highlighting their concerns. SCOR's controlled risk appetite and strict
underwriting discipline appropriately limits our exposure to such negative developments.
And SCOR has limited exposure to social inflation.

FINAL

Our overall casualty portfolio is materially lower than that of our peers, both on absolute
and relative terms. Our recently built US casualty portfolio is modest representing only
12% of the Group's P&C reserves and 11% of the Group's P&C gross written premium.
Furthermore, we have limited or no appetite for those business lines most impacted by
social inflation with no appetite whatsoever for workers' comp, and very limited appetite
for commercial auto and medical malpractice businesses with these lines of businesses
representing only 1.5% of the Group's P&C reserves.
The casualty business written by SCOR Global P&C is highly diversified across personal
and professional lines and across sectors. The portfolio is largely proportional so benefits
directly from primary market price increases. As far as the excess book is concerned,
we're mostly focused on upper layers with higher attachment points and smaller limits
than most of our peers.

Bloomberg Transcript

In 2019 as in every year, the P&C book has been reviewed thoroughly during our annual
reserving review exercise, both through internal reviews and with the help of external
actuaries, whom were asked to carefully look at US casualty. The conclusion is clear, we
have every confidence in our secure reserving position with the best estimated valuation
that includes consideration of upward market loss trends.
I'll give the floor to Frieder to discuss the second topic.

Frieder Knupling

{BIO 17247809 <GO>}

Thank you, Jean-Paul. Let's move to Slide 20. The coronavirus is obviously on everybody's
minds. Based on current available information coming from public sources and from our
clients and partners about the spread of the virus and the fatality rate, we do not foresee
this epidemic as having a material impact on our book. We are monitoring the situation
closely and, if there are any changes to this assessment, we will update the market in
subsequent disclosures.
On the Life side, exposure could arise from mortality and medical expense business.
There is a strong focus on containment, on clear communication and on self-protection
measures by the Chinese and now also by global authorities.
With the information that is known at present, we are in a situation that has nothing to do
with the one in 200 year extreme stress scenario that we disclosed. China represents
only a minor amount of this scenario. SGL writes about EUR9 billion of total gross written
premiums per year, of which just over EUR1 billion comes from Asia. Of that EUR1 billion,
around EUR400 million comes from China, where we mostly write critical illness and
medical expense business with limited mortality exposure.

FINAL

Total death to date from COVID-19 are less than 3,000. Put this into context, our 1-in-200
extreme stress endemic scenario allows for in excess of 10 million deaths in the general
population.
It is also worth noting that the WHO estimates that global deaths arising from seasonal
influenza epidemics are between 290,000 and 650,000 per annum, which is between
100 and 200 times more than the current COVID-19 estimated total deaths. We would
also note that, impacts upon insured and general uninsured populations do differ as a
result of different levels of access to medical care and other factors.
On the non-life side, exposures could arise from non-proportional property contracts for
commercial and industrial risks. At the moment, we do not see any impact on property
contracts for commercial risks such as hotels or commercial buildings. For Industrial risks,
infectious disease is usually excluded.
SCOR's investment for the portfolio has limited overall equity exposure at 2% of total
invested assets, mostly through convertible bonds that is subject to any broader macroeconomic effects. Further, SCOR has limited credit exposure to the retail, leisure, hotel
and airlines sectors, the sectors most likely to be affected.

Bloomberg Transcript

In summary and to reiterate with the information that we have at present, the Group
believes exposures are currently limited and we do not foresee this epidemic as having a
material impact on our book.
Let me now hand back to Mark.

Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Thanks Frieder. So we'll move to Page 21. Another key differentiating factor of the SCOR
Group is its balanced business model between Life and P&C reinsurance, which provides
an optimal diversification across underwriting risks by both geographies and lines of
business. The significant size of SCOR's Life portfolio also means that SCOR holds
significant economic value in the form of future profits embedded in the book that is not
fully recognized under the current IFRS four framework and which can therefore be
unlocked in the future.
The IFRS 17 accounting framework should better reflect this large unrecognized asset in
SCOR's balance sheet of today. The Solvency II framework already provides a better view
of the economic value of the SCOR Group. Solvency II adjustments translate into more
than EUR3.1 billion unrecognized assets under IFRS.
This adjustment remains conservative for two reasons: First, the Solvency II methodology
includes some regulatory conservatism and cannot be considered to be a true economic
measurement. It notably relies on a prudent risk margin approach with two conservative
features. It is not diversified between legal entities, and additionally, it relies on a high cost
of capital rate.

Page 5 of 14



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2020-02-27

FINAL

Second, the Solvency II framework only captures the in-force portfolio. This means that
the Solvency II net asset value does not reflect the franchise value of the Group i.e., the
value of all the future new business that will be generated.
SCOR's diversified business model and four cornerstones are proven creators of superior
value. With our very strong operating capital generation of EUR1 billion, we are very well
positioned on a Solvency II ROE basis with a high return on economic capital of 14.8% in
2019. Ian?

{BIO 19976646 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Mark. On Page 25, you will find the forthcoming scheduled events,
starting on April 19 with the SCOR Q1 2020 results, followed by our Investor Day in Paris
now scheduled for July 7 and also the other conferences that we plan to attend across
the first half of the year.
With that, we can now begin the Q&A session. And can I please remind you to limit
yourselves to two questions each? Thank you very much.

Questions And Answers
Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

(Question And Answer)
Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions). We will now take our first question from Kamran
Hossain from RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. Three questions. The first one is just on the, I guess, the Q4 reserve release. I know
that you addressed kind of uncertainty in social inflation. It's very clear that where you think
the effected part of reserves might be is very small in relation to the rest of the book. But
why release that now? You've got EUR50 million, there is probably not much pressure on
you to do it. Why do that now and not just wait for six months, 12 months and get that out
aat later date? So that's the first question.
And the second question is just on the dividend. I'm kind of looking at the message that
you're sending. One is that the capital position of the company is strong, I understand
that. Solvency ratio is above the top of your range. Dividend growth is a bit light. And I
understand that cat losses have been high three years in a row. But if I look at one of your
peers that reported last week, they grew the dividend a bit faster on the basis that they
have very strong capital position. Could you maybe talk about some of the factors driving
the decision making there? And any progress or update on, I guess, the building up hard
capital for your S&P rating again would be very useful. Thank you.

Okay. Thanks Kamran. I'll address both pieces or both questions. So for the Q4 reserve
release, we felt -- two parts to it. First of all, we felt very secure with our reserving position
overall. We're trying to make that clear today both with the disclosures and the
messaging, especially with regards to the social inflation issues, which are around us. And I
think to the reserve release itself, we felt there was adequate margin that was built up
that could be released, and so it was taken into the P&L. That's something that we use
from time-to-time, particularly when we have significant volatility from nat cats. So that
should be a reassuring message.
I think on the second piece on the dividend, first of all, we do start with a very strong
solvency position. We're at 226%. 223% when you take away the callable debt that we
anticipate calling in October. We do have a very strong S&P capital position, several
hundreds of millions above the AAA threshold, in our view. So we're primed and ready to
execute our Quantum Leap plan for 2020. We're well positioned for growth.
On the dividend itself, we felt that the earnings and the dividend question were really
commensurate and so we increased it by EUR0.05, our ROE was 7%. We had EUR422
million of net income. Payout ratio of 80%, we felt good about that. There was some
discussion of potentially going higher, but I think when we looked at all of the factors, we
felt comfortable with the EUR0.05 increase.

Next question is from Vikram Gandhi from Societe Generale. Your line is open. Please go

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Hello. Good morning, everyone. It's Vik from SocGen. Just a couple of questions. Firstly, I
remember the comment made at the January renewals presentation that the P&C results
are on a best estimate basis, which is also flagged on Slide 19 today. I just wonder why
you say that, since in the past, the message was always that it's best estimate plus a
margin, but just that you didn't disclose what the margin was. So that's question one.
Second, I'd like to go back to the cash flows on Slide 7. The presentation says that the FY
'18 figures for the Life business are a bit inflated due to a large one-off transaction. But I
remember they were also negatively impacted by the US tax reform. So just a bit of help
in terms of looking at the FY '18 and '19 numbers kind of like-for-like comparison, that'll be
really appreciated. Thank you very much.

{BIO 17247809 <GO>}

There's no specific change to our reserving policy. So our reserving position is following
our reserving policy, which is unchanged compared with the past.

FINAL

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Just on the second point with the cash flows. We did -- we were impacted on the
operating cash flow in 2019 from significant US BEAT related tax payments, not
necessarily BEAT directly, but income taxes resulting from the BEAT restructuring solution
that we put in place. Technical cash flows were pretty much in line for both P&C and for
Life with our plan for 2019. So the main drag from the prior year comparison would have
been the tax payments regarding the BEAT solution. Overall, the EUR841 million was
strong, in line with what we expected.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

Thank you.

Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

Our next question is from Michael Haid from Commerzbank. Please go ahead.

A - Frieder Knupling

{BIO 17247809 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good morning. Two questions, both on the capital position. First of
all, can you provide us a walk through from the Solvency II ratio at the end of the third
quarter to the end of the fourth quarter? And the second question also related to that,
you spoke about portfolio optimization. Can you tell us of what measures you have taken,
what management actions to improve the Solvency II ratio?

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Okay. So there were some economic movements between Q3 and Q4, but the main
impact as you alluded to was portfolio management. We disclosed during the renewals
call that, we've taken some strong portfolio action at the one/one renewals. And we also
have a clear plan for the renewals for later this year, which are improving composition of
the book, reducing overall underwriting risk capital requirements compared to what we
had in the model last year. Generally, they are somewhat reducing the impact of peak
risks in the SCR, which are very much driving overall capital requirements. And the
improved balance between peak risks on the P&C side is having this effect of reducing
capital requirements.
And we have a similar effect on the Life side, where we're expecting an improved balance
of the portfolio, in particular, between mortality and longevity business, resulting from the
business, which is in the books and which we plan to write in the coming quarters. And all

Page 8 of 14

FINAL

of this flows into the SCR calculation, which includes the plan new business for the coming
year. And the combination of those portfolio improvements and management actions on
the portfolio have reduced the SCR. You see this in the operating step, the SCR has gone
down by about EUR130 million compared to the position at the beginning of the year and,
compared to Q3, the decrease was even a bit stronger and that explains largely the
strong increase in solvency position from Q3 to Q4.

Q - Michael Hermann Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

A - Ian Kelly

{BIO 19976646 <GO>}

Thank you Michael. Let's go to the next question.

Operator
From Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi, there. Two questions. First of all, could you update us on what the profitability was on
the primary P&C business over the year on SCOR Specialty Insurance. I mean, it has been
a drag. I appreciate you're getting higher rate increases on that book. I just wanted to
know how much higher the combined ratio was on that book versus the P&C reinsurance
book for the full year. Secondly, on the EIOPA solvency II review, what are your kind of
leatest thoughts on that? I guess you're flagging the risk margin effect. Are you more
hopeful there could be some change on that front? And have you changed your attitude
to potentially hedging the effect of the risk margin vis-a-vis interest rate sensitivity?
Thanks.

A - Laurent Rousseau

{BIO 19524847 <GO>}

So hi, Andrew. It's Laurent. Answer is very short on specialty insurance that the
underwriting ratio is the same, actually, for the full year 2019 between specialty insurance
and reinsurance. So not worse.

A - Frieder Knupling

{BIO 17247809 <GO>}

On your second question, yes, it seems as if EIOPA is now a bit more open with respect
to addressing some of the issues, which the current risk margin methodology on the
Solvency II has. That wasn't apparent when the consultation came out in October, but
what we're hearing now sounds a bit more flexible. We'll know more in next week, when
the specifications for the holistic impact assessment are expected to come out.
Does it have an impact on our ALM and hedging strategy? I don't think so. We currently
hedge the risk margin partially. We recognize that there needs to be some form of
conservative margin on top of best estimates and, in principle, the cost of capital
methodology can capture this. We just think that the current Solvency II methodology is

Page 9 of 14



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2020-02-27

FINAL

inappropriate, because the cost of capital rate is too high and it doesn't reflect
diversification.
So we expect that maybe this is bringing the Solvency II methodology closely in line with
our economic view, which we use for our ALM economic management metrics anyway.
Generally, I think that is very good news. It could be very good news for SCOR, because it
would bring a close alignment between Solvency II and our house view on the risk margin
and economic valuation.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

A - Ian Kelly

{BIO 19976646 <GO>}

Thank you so much, Andrew. Let's go to the next question, please.

Operator
From Thomas Fossard from HSBC. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, everyone. Just two question. The first one would be related to Slide
14 -- sorry, 15. Just to better understand your EUR1 billion economic capital generation in
2019. Actually, the expected in-force contribution increased by 50% year-on-year. So could
you maybe explain what has been the main driver behind this EUR220 million higher
contribution, and also is the EUR1 billion is now a normalized -- is the normalized number
going forward? And the second question will be related to maybe the initial discussions
you may have with your Japanese clients. Actually, we've seen that the accumulation of
losses in the '19 results are pretty high. So can you shed some light on what -- how your
expectations regarding the April 1 renewal. Thank you.

A - Frieder Knupling

{BIO 17247809 <GO>}

On your first question, Tom, the change in the expected in-force contribution was mainly
driven by two factors. Compared to the situation as of 1st of January 2018, interest rates
on 1st of January 2019 were somewhat higher and credit spreads had been wider. So both
of this leads to a higher expected investment income for the year compared to the full
year 2018. So this is quite mechanical and it's largely explaining the difference between
those two numbers. And as interest rates move and credit spreads move, you will see this
moving up and down. But that's really the mechanic.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

So the normalized number would be below EUR1 billion at least then today?

FINAL

Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2020-02-27

Well, I'm not guessing what the normalized level of interest rates and credit spreads is.
I'm just saying this number will move up and down with rates and spreads. There are
other factors, which have contributed to this -- the total operating impact being above
that of previous years. We've seen on the Solvency II basis positive variances. We've also
had this occasion in the past. But on a longer-term basis of our models, correct, you would
this more -- expect this more to average out to zero. But then of course, you have other
factors. We're planning to grow our new business substantially, and we've achieved this
compared to the past. So there are also other driving factors.

A - Jean-Paul Conoscente

{BIO 20770277 <GO>}

On your second question, this is Jean-Paul, related to the Japanese renewals, yes, we
started to engage in discussions with our Japanese clients for the last month. In 2019, the
payback was mainly on the loss affected programs. After cat years in '18, '19, this is clearly
no longer sufficient. And discussions we started to have with them is the payback across
the whole portfolio. We've been in Japan for the last 50 years. We have very strong
position. We're the third largest reinsurer in Japan today, and we plan to use our deep
client relationships to come to a landing with them on the overall portfolio payback that's
relatively rapid.

Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We will now take our next question from Vikram Gandhi
from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Hello. Hi. Thank you for the opportunity. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. The first one is
on the cash flow upstream from the Life and Health business. That's a number that you
usually publish during the Investor Day presentations, which I think was missing the last
time around. So can you share what the number was for FY '19 compared to around
EUR20 million to EUR30 million average over the past few years?
And secondly, just going back to the strong Solvency II ratio, strong capital generation. I
appreciate you've already touched upon what led to a strong in-force contribution, but
the assumption changes and experience or answers as seen as positive. It's a bit puzzling
to me at first glance since you refined your view of the P&C risks, there were some
elevated claims on Life and Health year-on-year. So just maybe some explanation on what
led to the assumption change and experiences or answers being positive will be helpful.
Thank you.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Vikram, just on the cash flow I reference you to Slide 7. We're showing the operating cash
flows from SCOR Global Life and P&C separately. So SCOR Global Life had a very strong
technical cash flow, and then obviously a positive contribution on the operating as you can
Page 11 of 14



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2020-02-27

see, the EUR101 million. I'm not sure what other level of detail you're after. Maybe that's
something we can take offline, but this disclosure has been consistent.

FINAL

A - Unidentified Speaker
Mark, maybe just to add briefly to that. The operating cash flow was down slightly from
last year, but it's in line with expectations. That's relating from some volatility in the claims
payments, which Mark you described already, and also some volatility from timing of
claims settlement. Also in 2018, we had an exceptional impact from a one-off financial
solutions transaction. So I think, again, in line with your comments, the overall liquidity of
the group is very strong at EUR1.5 billion.

A - Frieder Knupling

{BIO 17247809 <GO>}

On your second question, the variances are affected by a wide range of items. Claims are
one of them, but we also have movement in economic reserves of different types
portfolio management, changes to assumptions and so forth. It's a wide range of factors,
including the performance of the book outside of the cat affected areas. So overall,
they've contributed to a slightly positive outcome. And it's not straightforward to reconcile
this to the IFRS results.

Thank you, Vik. Let go to next question, please.

Operator
The next question from Paris Hadjiantonis from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Yes. Hi, and good morning from my side as well. The first question will be on your
combined ratio, looking at the normalized level and as we were discussing, but in the
January renewals, you are around the 96% level. During the January renewals conference
call, you were discussing that certain claims trends have been a bit concerning to you. I
think most of the stuff that you're saying today have to do with man-made losses. So the
question would be should we be taking that level as what you consider to be the two
normalized? Or is it actually impacted by a level of man-made, which you think might be a
bit too high for these combined ratio?
The second question will be on life insurance and given the technical margin in Q4 has
been probably a bit higher on what we are used to or what you're usually guiding to,
could you give us maybe the quarter specific benefit from the fee business from the
financial solutions transactions and whether or not there any other one-offs in the quarter
benefiting the technical margin? Thank you.

{BIO 20770277 <GO>}

Okay. I'll take the first question on the normalized combined ratio. Yes, the guidance for
the normalized combined ratio remains between EUR 95 million and EUR 96 million. For
2019, we had 96.1%, so slightly above that range. And the driver is mainly due to, let's say,
abnormal frequency of man-made losses. We do expect the man-made losses in fire and
large, let's say, explosions, things of that nature. But this year, there was a lot of also
aviation, space, credit and surety losses in addition to the Ogden rate decision early in the
year. So all those contributed to a slightly higher normal attritional loss ratio than we had
initially projected. But our guidance going forward for 2020 and '21 remains 95%, 96%
combined ratio.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Okay, and to take the second question. Excluding the 40 basis points impact from the
renewal of certain financial solutions deals to the fee business, the year-to-date technical
margin is consistent with the levels recorded in previous years. So 7% in 2018 and 7.1% in
2017. The net technical margin is driven by the performance of our different business lines
and reflects the overall positive performance from the protection business, building off
our active portfolio management and strong reserving positions in several markets.
I think it's actually probably most relevant to focus on the full year technical margin rather
than the specific Q4 quarter. Overall, our objective remains the technical margin in the
range between 7.2% and 7.4% as defined during Quantum Leap.

Thank you very much, Paris. Do we have any more questions?

Operator
As there are no further questions in the queue at this time, I would like to hand the call
back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you.

A - Ian Kelly

{BIO 19976646 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much for attending this conference call. And please don't hesitate
to give us a call should you require any further information as usual. And also, a quick
reminder that we have a sell-side analyst round table held in our Paris, London, and Zurich
offices at evening at 5 P.M. UK time; 6 P.M. European time. And I hope to see you there.
I will now hand back to Denis for closing remarks.

A - Denis Jean-Marie Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thank you, Ian. And just a word. This is a special year for SCOR because we're going to
celebrate the 50th anniversary of SCOR. We're created back in 1970. So the good news is
that we already ordered a few bottles of champagne to celebrate throughout the year.
But we stay focused, of course, on the mission and we'll pursue the Quantum Leap plan
