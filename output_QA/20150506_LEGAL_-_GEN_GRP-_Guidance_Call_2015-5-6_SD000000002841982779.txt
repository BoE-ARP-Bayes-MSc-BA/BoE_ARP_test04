results conference call. My name is Rhiannon. And I'll be the operator for your call today.
(Operator Instructions) Journalists may not be dialed into this call; all such individuals
should disconnect now.
I would now like to hand over to Mark Gregory, Group Chief Financial Officer, to begin
today's presentation. Mark, please go ahead.

Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining our Q1 call. With me in the room today
are Mark Zinkula, CEO of LGIM; Duncan Finch, MD of Insurance; Jackie Noakes, MD of
Mature Savings; and Mike Berry, MD of Digital Savings. And on the line we have Kerrigan
Procter, MD of L&G Retirement; and Paul Stanworth, MD of L&G Capital.

FINAL

The top-line numbers are that operational cash is up 11% year on year at GBP330 million.
Net cash is up 8% at GBP326 million.
LGIM's total assets are up 17%, compared to Q1 2014, at GBP737 billion.
Annuity assets are up 19% at GBP45.6 billion.
Savings AUA up 11% at GBP113 billion.
And UK protection premiums are up 5% at GBP372 million.
Our strategy remains to drive growth in our business, based on five global macro longterm trends: namely, aging populations; welfare reform; globalization of asset markets;
digital lifestyles; and retrenching banks. All of these trends have played a part in today's
numbers.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to our businesses. And starting with L&G retirement, our stock of annuity assets
has increased to GBP45.6 billion, with sales in the First Quarter of over GBP750 million,
including GBP655 million of bulk annuity transactions.
Individual (annuity sales) remain a key part of our at-retirement proposition. And sales
totaled GBP99 million in quarter 1.
Pensions' freedom started on April 6, 2015. And we're offering our customers various
propositions in response to these new freedoms. This includes lifetime mortgages, where
we've completed the acquisition of Newlife Home Finance and are now active in the
market.
Moving to LGIM, which now has total assets of GBP737 billion. External AUM net flows in
the First Quarter were a healthy GBP4.3 billion, driven by continued demand for LGIM's
pension de-risking capabilities and further expansion of its international operations in the
US and Asia.
Total international (assets were GBP126.4 billion).
Workplace pensions, which is now part of LGIM, grew assets under administration to
GBP13 billion; up 43% year on year.
Our insurance business had a solid First Quarter with UK retail protection growth written
premiums up 6%. And UK group protection up 3%.

Legal & General savings, which now comprises digital and mature savings, increased its
assets under administration by 11% to GBP113 billion.

FINAL

Digital Savings had net inflows of just under GBP1 billion in the First Quarter. And our
cofunds platform now has GBP76 billion of assets.
L&G Capital remains focused on increasing the risk-adjusted returns on shareholder
funds; a further GBP400 million of new direct investments were completed in the quarter.
The Group's total direct investments are now GBP6.3 billion; up 62% year on year.
The price changes introduced last year by Legal & General America resulted in sales of
$31 million, compared to $38 million in Q1 2014. Gross premiums, however, increased 5%
to $283 million.
Turning to outlook, we've positioned our businesses to grow as the long-term macro
trends play out over time. We made a good start to 2015. And the business has
momentum, both in the UK. And increasingly so internationally.
In terms of regulatory capital, we've updated you on where we are with the Solvency II
process. Discussions with the PRA are ongoing. This is an iterative process. And we will
provide updates as clarity emerges. Final clarity is not expected until late in Q4 this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

In summary, our stock of business is up; cash generation is up; our businesses have
momentum. And growth opportunities.
And finally, we remain confident in delivering the 2015 operational cash guidance we gave
at the time of the 2014 prelims.
I now open the call to questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Andy Sinclair, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Q - Andy Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Just three questions, it that's okay. Firstly, can you tell us the level of regular premium flow
that you're now seeing coming into workplace pensions on a quarterly basis, if you
excluded any transfers. And of existing assets, just to get an idea of the underlying flow
per quarter?
Second, you've mentioned that large workplace schemes are being re-broked. I just
wondered if you could give us an idea of what the reasons are for these schemes leaving
their existing providers. And what L&G is doing that others didn't.
Page 3 of 20



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C
Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

And thirdly, just on Solvency II, just wondered if you could confirm for us that the
application for transitional doesn't affect your dividend policy and moving to 1.5 times
cover by net cash generation by the end of the year? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Andy, thanks for those. I'll pick those up quickly, unless Mark can add a bit of color, if he
wants to add, on the workplace.
In terms of the flows, year on year we had GBP0.5 billion of inflows in the First Quarter this
year. So similar to where we were last year. A slight difference in terms of the make-up,
Andy. I think last year we had more pension transfers come with the scheme, whereas this
year I think we're seeing more of the regular payments coming through quarter in, quarter
out; in some ways, the compounding effect of the (fly wheel) of regular contributions
beginning to have an impact in workplace.
So in absolute terms the cash flow looked similar. But actually the make-up slighting
changing. We're now seeing the benefit of having more members on our auto-enrolment
platform, obviously, with pay rises, etc., that impact coming through. Similar, I say slightly
different color than what we had this time last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of the general re-broke in the workplace market, I don't think at this stage many
schemes have actually been formally re-broked. We are seeing some interest, potentially,
from broker firm themselves in terms of whether to revisit some of their earlier decisions.
Certainly, some of the companies have perhaps used a -- perhaps their final salary-type
solution to actually comply with the auto-enrolment rules when it first came in. I think some
of those companies now are looking at -- employers are now looking at whether that was
the right answer and, therefore, whether a more DC-focused solution might be right. We
are seeing quite a lot of activity in that space. But certainly the general interest in
workplace remains very, very high.
In terms of the impact of transitional. And any impact on the dividend policy, we said today
that we are -- we will be applying for a transitional provision as part of our Solvency II
application. We won't know whether that's needed, or the size of that, until the end of this
year, because it's based on the end of 2015 balance sheet.
To be absolutely clear, the transitional rules are very clear cut; any transitional relief will
come straight off the debt provisions. That boosts own funds. That's a key component of
the Solvency II balance sheet. So it will have no impact on the dividend policy. Clearly, our
dividend policy remains as we stated at year end, two months ago.

Q - Andy Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Very good. Thank you.

Andrew Crean, Autonomous.

FINAL

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Actually, can I follow up on that question on transitional? If you apply transitionals for one
subsidiary, would you then be blocked from getting dividends up from that subsidiary to
Group in the case where presumably you're trying to build capital in a subsidiary, rather
than reduce it through dividends?

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

So it's just one question, Andrew? Just to be absolutely clear on that point, I'll probably
reiterate what I just gave to Andy on the previous questions; transitionals are clear cut in
the way they work. They're absolutely clear, they come off technical revisions, i.e., they
reduce your debt provisions, therefore, they increase own funds.
And the Solvency II balance sheet surplus will be cut on the overall state of the overall
balance sheet. So it's not about component parts, it's the total balance sheet. So we're
not foreseeing any issues with any blockage of inflows up the Group.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

So no fungibility issues from your annuity company in terms of getting dividends up?

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Correct.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Greig Paterson, KBW.

Q - Greig Paterson
Just three quick questions; one is in terms of new business release box. What sort of
outlook, stable, up, down, for the rest of the year? I just want to understand the trend
there in that sort of margin?
I noticed on the individual annuities you had a jump in the First Quarter versus the Fourth
Quarter last year, which is unusual in the run up to the (A) day. I was wondering why that
was. Did you launch a new product? Or there's some kind of phenomena going on there.
Then on third question, in terms of cost cutting, the GBP80 million, I wonder if you could
(inaudible) further into the program and give us an idea of how much of that GBP80

Page 5 of 20



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C
Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

million will fall through to the bottom line. And of that, how much is actually coming
through within the target to achieve breakeven on the workplace savings business?

FINAL

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Thanks, Greig. Kerrigan, if you're on the line, hope you still are, can you answer the
question on bulk trend in individual annuities, what happened in First Quarter? And I'll
come back and say a few words on the cost-cutting program.

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

Absolutely. Thanks for the questions, Greig. Yes. In terms of new business release and the
trend in margin, really not seeing any change in that trend. We continue to find what we
think are attractive assets, attractively priced assets, to allow us to support that -obviously, we didn't (show) separately the new business margin. But the ongoing trend in
(multiple speakers).

Q - Greig Paterson
So it's roughly unchanged?

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, roughly unchanged at the moment. Of course, we always come back to our point
that we have an internal return on capital hurdle metrics. And we've applied that
consistently throughout. So you'd probably expect something similar in terms of trend.

Q - Greig Paterson
Then, the individual annuities, why it jumped quarter on quarter.

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

Yes, I think, probably, Q1 -- no new products in Q1; they came in Q2 with freedom of
choice on April 6. So no new products in Q1. We just found ourselves a little bit more
competitive while retaining our price discipline. So slightly up from where we were in Q4.
But I think the Q4/Q1 run rate is broadly what we're expecting, going forwards..

Q - Greig Paterson
You don't have cap drawdown in there do you?

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

No. We don't, no. No. That's just individual annuities.

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay. And on the cost-cutting point, Greig, as you say, we did highlight we were targeting
GBP80 million of absolute cost savings this year. Obviously, did also, at the same time,
where we expected to spend roughly GBP40 million of restructuring costs to achieve it.

Page 6 of 20



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C
Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

FINAL

So before we get too excited about any bottom-line impact, we will have to expense the
restructuring costs at the same time.
Broadly, again, we haven't given too much (away). As I said when we announced it at year
end, some of this is just to reflect the fact some of our books are more mature in nature
and, therefore, will have a declining revenue profile. Therefore, some of this is just
housekeeping to make sure that our cost profile reflects some of our revenue profile to
some of these more mature books.
As a kind of rough rule of thumb, I'd expect, probably, about half, or just over half, of that
net benefit to drop through to the bottom line. Again, that's not a precise number at this
stage. But just to give you some steer about what impact you might see from that.
In terms of the impact you asked specifically about workplace savings, every part of the
organization is playing its part. I would say we've designed workplace to be a highly
automated process in the first place. We have a highly automated on board in process
there. So I think in terms of the net-net-net, probably workplace won't be one of the
major beneficiaries from the explicit cost-save program.

Q - Greig Paterson
All right. Thank you.

Fahad Changazi, Nomura.

Q - Fahad Changazi

{BIO 15216120 <GO>}

I'm sorry, I might have missed the answer to Greig's question on bulk annuities. Are we
expecting bulk annuity premiums in full-year 2015 to be up on full-year 2014?
And just two other questions. One on LGIM, it looks like the index funds are doing better
in Q1. I know we had a big one last year with Tesco. But could you give us some guidance
on outlook, how we should be thinking about outflows from the index funds this time
around? Shall we take Tesco out from last year and then model up increasing upflows
from 2014?
The final question is on LGC. Could you just remind us, again, of your ambition for total
assets in LGC. And any color on how much of that will be direct investments? Thanks.

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Thanks, Fahad. Kerrigan, you just pick up the clarification point on the bulks outlook. Zink,
can you pick up on index? And Paul, at the end, pick up the comment on our ambitions for
our asset profile within LGC.

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

Great, Fahad, thanks for that. Really, my answer to Greig was more around the new
business release and margin.

FINAL

In terms of premiums, I'd say 2014, at GBP5.9 billion of bulk premiums, was really an
outstanding record year. I'd view that as a tough hurdle to beat, shall we say.
I think GBP650 million Q1 was a good result in bulks in Q1. Plenty of pipeline out there. We
talked about GBP10 billion pipeline in the markets. And I think that pretty much remains
out there. So there's plenty of demand from the clients. And we'll just be selective about
which deals make sense for us in terms of our internal hurdle metric. So positive. But it's a
lumpy business and we'll be selective.

In regards to our index business, we are seeing more inflows for the first part of the year
outside of UK DB channels. So consistent growth in other channels locally.
Won our first couple of (index) mandates in the US, where we'll talk more about this at half
year. There'll be more activity over the first half of the year. Then, have won a couple of
managed recently in Asia, which are not funded yet. So we're having good progress,
much better progress, in growing our index assets in other channels.
In regards to the outflows, last year we did have an unusual number of large one-off
events. So in terms of what to model, I think you have to look at this. (We) (inaudible) of
outflows of passive equities from UK DB plans as they de-risk. And fortunately, we've
seen that more than offset by growth in our solutions business. That trend will continue.
But, again, it will be somewhat uneven year to year. And certainly quarter to quarter.
We are doing a much better job, though, in retaining assets that are switching out of
passive equities into other products, de-risking products, which shows up in our market
and other line item, movement line item. We are doing a better job.
We've expanded our range of old LDI solutions. And our fixed income offerings, as well as
into property, as well. We're seeing a lot of switches, a higher level of switches, into those
other products, which not just retains assets. But, in most cases, also enhances our
revenues.

FINAL

Thanks, Fahad. LGC is looking after a portfolio of around GBP5 billion. The returns on that
overall portfolio were around 4.5%.
Out of the portfolio, around GBP1.5 billion of that was equities. And we've been acquiring
direct investments effectively over time to replace equity at around GBP0.5 billion a year.
What it allows us to do is contribute to operating businesses and projects, which can help
the access to assets for the annuity funds. And also provide co-investment opportunities
for LGIM's funds as well.
The ambition, which was your question, is to replace, effectively, the traded assets we
have in equities with real assets for superior returns that give us better access to assets
for the annuity fund and bring in more clients for LGIM. Overall, there'll be a sort of
enhanced return from those other business units as a consequence of the assets that we
purchase.
Our focus is on, which Nigel reiterated, I think, in the last results, housing and urban
regeneration; and also, we are looking at where there are opportunities in energy space
and alternative finance.

Ravi Tanna, Goldman Sachs.

Q - Ravi Tanna

{BIO 16926941 <GO>}

Just one question, please, on the impact of the pension freedoms on defined benefit
pension schemes.
A number of your peers. And also some of the actuarial consulting firms, were referring to
an uptick in the number of increase from customers in DB schemes who are looking to
transfer into DC schemes so that they can ultimately cash in their pension pot. So just
wandering what your experience has been of this. Have you also seen an uptick? And do
you expect it to be a material impact at all on your business? Thank you.

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Thanks, Ravi. Kerrigan, do you want to comment on that?

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

Yes, sure. It's certainly been a well discussed topic that deferred pensions could be
approached to switch their pensions to DC and then cash them in when they get to 55. I
think it's been more discussion rather than action.

Page 9 of 20



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C

Date: 2015-05-06

FINAL

And even though enquiries have gone in probably for people checking their pension
amounts, I don't -- haven't seen a lot of actual action in terms of transfers. I think it's more
challenging to actually go ahead and do it, because you need to get an IFA's advice, show
the trustees that you've got an IFA advice. And then find a DC provider who will accept
the cash. So it's a fairly involved process.
So no impact on our business as yet. Can't really see that being a substantial impact on
our business, going forward. In fact, I think if DB schemes tackle that by reducing their
deficit by transferring cash for deferred it would actually free up the market to do even
more bulk transfers for pensioners. Probably, overall, it might be a positive if it does pick
up. But no pick up I've seen yet.

Q - Ravi Tanna

Q - Anasuya Iyer

{BIO 18981555 <GO>}

I just want to ask about -- come back to the US outlook question. When I think about your
business in the UK, I think of it across the pension de-risking spectrum. So I think about
index LDI plus bulk together. Should I think the same way in the US? Or should I think of it
separately there with you focusing on the index mandates, (instead) of the entire
spectrum?
My other question was, with US expansion, is there any Solvency II issue there? I know a lot
of European players talk a lot about Solvency II equivalents for the US businesses; is there
something there that I should think about for you as well? Thanks.

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Zink, perhaps you could comment on the more general LDI index stuff in US.

A - Mark Zinkula

{BIO 16142450 <GO>}

From a market perspective, you should certainly think about, (thematically,) the US is going
through the same transition in its pension landscape as the UK.
The DB plans are de-risking. And there's a shift from DB to DC. This is playing out in -- in
the details it's playing out a bit differently in each country. Ironically, the DB market is
ahead of the UK -- the UK is ahead of the US in de-risking. But the US is way ahead of the
UK in the growth of the DC market. But it's the same general trends that are happening.
From an LGIM perspective, or a L&G perspective, since we -- our history is in the UK
market, we established a sizeable market-leading position in the UK DB market, which we
were then protecting. And have been growing actually, as that market's gone from a
Page 10 of 20

FINAL

growth phase to maturity phase. And ultimately into annuitization. Also, we had a buy-out,
buy-in longevity risk off-loading phase, which that obviously is -- flows into Kerrigan's
business.
In the US, since we entered the market already in this maturity phase, we're establishing
our business as a market-leading LDI business. So we built our business starting with a LDI
business, rather than index business, for those reasons. But we're now adding the index
business to it.
Then, obviously, Kerrigan can talk about his plans for expanding into annuity space. But
clearly, we see that as a growth market in the US as pension plans continue to mature and
those that can afford it. And desire to do so, will ultimately pursue some kind of longevity
risk offloading strategy.

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

And on your second question around any impact of Solvency II on our US expansion, I think
it's fair to say that a lot about pension currently is coming through LGIM as non-insurance
business that is not impacted by Solvency II in any way.

Bloomberg Transcript

Just more general, I just want to say, almost certainly, most of our risk capital under
Solvency will be deployed in the UK; and, therefore, it would need quite a material change
to our model (factoring in) than it would do in the US to make much of a difference to our
Solvency II balance sheet. I'm not saying it's completely immaterial. But I'm simply saying
it's unlikely to be a big driver of our ambitions in the US.

Q - Abid Hussain

{BIO 17127644 <GO>}

Three questions from me, if I may. The first one on bulk annuities, on the surface, it
appears you're focusing on the smaller cases, or certainly in Q1. Can you just talk about
the competitive landscape at the small end, the mid end. And the large end in terms of
bulk annuity transactions?
The second question is on cofunds. Cofund net flows were about half of what they were
this time last year. Can you just talk about what's driving that slowdown, as we had
expected a ramp up in flows by now?
Finally, my last question is on Solvency II. You mention, in the press release this morning,
the use of transitional arrangements, can you just talk about what product that might
relate to? I'm assuming it's probably annuities. And can you also just talk about what
Page 11 of 20



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C

restrictions, if any, the regulator might apply, should you go down the transitional route?
Thanks.

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

FINAL

Thanks, Abid. Kerrigan, if you pick up the bulks question; Mike, if you pick up the cofounds
flow point; and I'll come back on the Solvency II impact.

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

Great. Thanks, Abid. On bulks, I think what you can say about the bulk market it's anything
but it's not homogenous. Even if you look at the GBP650 million, that's 15 contracts. But
they weren't all equal size; there's two larger ones in that. So let's say in probably the
medium sized, in terms of your description of the market. And then a few smaller deals.
I guess just in terms of competitive nature, the large deals are just very lumpy. We think
we have a USP in that space. It's probably only ourselves who do the larger ones, or
maybe there's a couple of other firms who get involved.

Bloomberg Transcript

Medium and -- well, small certainly felt the impact of the changes of freedom and choice
in pensions and increased competition there. So we did less in that market in the last year,
probably, less overall in Q1. But that's started to come back. That's starting to become
slightly more attractive now. I think the kind of initial reactions have worn through and
pricing is starting to look a bit more even across the competition there.
And medium's probably somewhere between the small and large. Slightly fewer
competitors in the medium space. Again, the medium space is probably where the
majority of the GBP650 million came from in Q1. So definitely some attractive deals for us.

A - Mike Berry

{BIO 2386667 <GO>}

Perhaps now if I turn to cofunds, you're quite correct, the inflows into cofunds were a little
lower in the First Quarter of 2015 than the First Quarter of 2014.
You need to see the cofunds business as being two things; there's institutional flows and
there are retail flows. The institutional flows tend to be a little bit more erratic, depending
upon the deals with particular customers. The First Quarter of last year, we had particularly
strong flows into our institutional business. So the reduction in net flows over the year
represents a reduction in institutional inflow.

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

(inaudible) your question on transitional, what impact it might have on particular products,
just taking a step back, the transitionals work on a total balance-sheet basis. So you simply
compare your total (technical) provisions under Solvency II compared to where you were
the same thing under Solvency I. They're calculated on a different basis. And if your
Solvency II technical provisions are higher than Solvency I then you get transitional relief for
the difference.

Page 12 of 20



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C

Date: 2015-05-06

So -- and that is a total balance sheet impact, rather than any particular products
themselves being affected by it. Therefore, as I said earlier to the previous question from
Andy and Andrew, we're not foreseeing any restrictions being inappropriate on the back
of that, the way the balance sheet will work in a Solvency II regime.

I've got three questions on bulk annuities, please. First, in the UK, several schemes have
bought buy-ins from you on a slice of their liabilities; that's been an increasing trend. I just
wonder what proportion of these do you expect to be pretty much repeat buyers. And
just give a sense of the size of this repeat business. And also the probability. That's the
first question.

The second one is on the US. It's a follow up from a previous question someone asked
about how you're pushing on here. I understand your way in was to sell LDI mandates to
big pension funds there. So I just wonder how many of, say, the top 100 pension funds in
the US, or whatever number you want to give me, are you managing LDI mandates for
currently?
And the third question, on the Dutch market. You talked about some intent here. And I'm
assuming that you'd only look at post-retirement liabilities. I just wonder, is this quite a
small opportunity, or small potential market at the movement, given that lots of the
schemes in Holland are still open? Thanks.

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Gordon. I think, Kerrigan, most of those are for you. Mark, you might want
to just chip in on the LDI point in the US. But Kerrigan, could you just perhaps answer those
three?

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

Yes, fantastic. Mark, I will hand over to you for the comments on number of LDI mandates
in the US for the top 100. But just in terms of UK buy-ins, I think it's a very, very good point.
It's definitely part of our business model. Our bulk annuities new business team is split
into two parts; strategic and core.
And strategic is really about setting up relationships with the top 200 pension schemes,
very much with the idea that in our ideal situation there'd be a large initial transaction and
then further slices of new business. And so, it's developing in far more of a relationship

management business. So I would put it as quite high probability that we'll get repeat
business from that kind of strategic relationship with the largest clients.

FINAL

In terms of the US, clearly, an interesting market for us. Mark, did you want to talk -- say
something about the --

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Yes, I'll be really brief, because the answer is I don't know. Off the top of my head, we
have -- at the top -- in terms of your question, the number of top 100 pension funds that
are clients, I don't know that exact number. It would be a substantial number, though, for
the top, whatever, five or top 10 pension funds are clients.
And just given the inherent nature of our business model, as you can imagine, a significant
percentage of our assets would be with the largest plans in the country, because they are
going to be the first to implement these kinds of strategies. And, obviously, do them in
size.
So for both of those reasons, a substantial percentage of our assets are with the 100
largest plans in the country. And that portion will continue to grow over time as they
continue to implement their de-risking strategies, as they hit their various targets. I just
don't know the exact number off the top of my head. But we can get back to you with
that.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

Yes. And just finally, on the Dutch market, we are interested in entering as a reinsurer
probably as much as a direct writer there.
Definitely, some opportunities for us that we're following up. We have our longevity
pricing basis and investment strategy all set so that we're comfortable with that. And
there are deals to be done. But you're right to say that it feels like a smaller market than
the UK. And the US, certainly. But we'd expect to see some action there. There's certainly
some deals in the market pipeline and things that we're interested in.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Just on that last point, you would reinsure -- you'd be reinsuring the major Dutch insurance
companies, who are writing this business?

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

Well probably, that's the first option to provide capacity to the market in that way,
although there are some ways in which you could enter as a reinsurer directly with pension
schemes. But that's probably a bit further down the line.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks very much.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

I've got three questions, please; two on Solvency II. And one on bulks. On the Solvency II
point around the transitionals, I think what you're saying seems to be different than the
message we had from the Pru at full year. It may be sort of a new odds. But they seem to
be talking about taking the transitionals on a discrete basis for the annuity funds, rather
than applying it across their entire UK business. I wonder if you could comment on that.
Secondly, I just wondered whether you, or the industry, had any idea yet about how you're
going to communicate when you had some final idea about where the Solvency II
numbers sat. And whether you were going to talk about when you had model approval. Is
this going to be a 2015 event, or a 2016 event?
Then, just finally, on bulks, just on the pipeline, I just wondered whether you're seeing any
impact on the pipeline for the sort of funding pressure we've seen on DB schemes in the
course of the recent reporting season from the corporates in the UK. Thank you.

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, I'll pick up the first two. Then, Jon, just on the transitionals point, I'm obviously not
entirely sure what Nick said at the Pru prelims. I'm sure he was technically right in what he
said.
But the way that it works, it is done on a regulated entity balance-sheet basis. So it will be
done in that (inaudible) entity and at Group level based on the actual -- as I said earlier,
the difference between the technical provisions under Solvency I and Solvency II. So that is
the way the directive is set out, it's very clear-cut. And that's the way it's going to operate
in practice.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Sorry, just to follow up on that, some of your competitors have talked about a sort of
partial internal model basis. And effectively choosing entity by entity whether they use an
internal model or a standard formula. I'm just surprised you're saying you're going to
apply it to the entire business.

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

(I intend to) do it on a regulatory entity basis. So we have various regulatory entities within
L&G Group. And then it will also apply at Group level. But within that, we will have certain
entities which will be done on standard formula, which are less important from our
perspective. And some on an internal model basis. So I think we're saying the same thing.

Okay. So you're not saying you're going to use the transitionals for the entire Group
balance sheet; it's going to be the transitionals for discreet entities, where it makes
sense?

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

FINAL

Correct. But then (multiple speakers) --

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

So you're saying exactly the same as the Pru?

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Then, it aggregates up Group level. Yes. We're saying the same thing.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay, fine. Thank you.

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of communication, I guess we're all slightly in the same camp here; we're all,
obviously, in fairly fluid ongoing negotiations and discussions with the regulator.
I would envisage, Jon, we'll only get clarity very late in this year. And I wouldn't be
surprised if the PRA don't try and coordinate it to make sure we all get the feedback at
pretty much the same time. I think it would make sense to do that, to an extent. But I think
in terms of your expectations, I think it could well be very, very late 2015, indeed, could
easily be slipping into 2016, before we have the absolute clarity the market would like to
have at this point.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

And Kerrigan, on bulks?

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

Yes, just the impact on funding pressures. In terms of the -- want to talk about the market
pipeline out there. I mentioned the GBP10 billion figure of the kind of people who are
looking for quotes to transact. Just to be clear, they might not all transact this year. But I
think most of those have probably gone down the de-risking route, or LDI route in some
way. So actually, the continuing fall or lower-for-longer interest rates haven't had so much
of an impact on them. So no impact of that size.

Page 16 of 20



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C
Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

Clearly, those further away from de-risking, or just embarking on the de-risking route,
they'll be the ones probably most impacted by what you've seen in reports and accounts
on the size of pension deficits. So, therefore, may have a longer journey to go before
they're ready to proceed to actual pension risk transfer.

FINAL

They'll be looking actively at pension risk management. So they'll be definitely courted by
our LGIM business. But (multiple speakers).

Just a couple of questions from me. First of all, your new business strain was quite low in
the quarter, even without the benefit of any large books. I wonder if you could tell us
what's driving that. And is that sustainable, if you don't have any major books throughout
the year?
Then, I guess, secondly, on your retail protection business, I know you've got a large share
of the market there. But the premiums were up and sales were down. I wonder if you
could give us some color about what's going on in that market and what the outlook is.
Thanks.

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Alan. I'll pick up the first one on new business strain; and, Duncan, you can
comment on the dynamics in the retail protection market right now.
Clearly, at Q1 and Q3, Alan, we don't give the exact breakdown of by component part of
OpCash strain and net cash. To give you a little bit of color, though, some of the benefits
we get are simply come from greater scale, full stop. Some of the unit costs, etc., some
of our overheads, etc., the bigger the books are in total so some of those unit cost
benefits come through to new business strain, or surplus as well.
Some of those is just the fact that the organization gets bigger so we spread our fixed
costs more generally. And, therefore, the impact on each component, such as new
business strain, does reduce. So a bit of that is going on in the dynamic as well.
Clearly, we'll show a bit more color at the half year, when we actually give the detailed
breakdown. But clearly, we are very active in managing the amount of capital and strain
we incur when writing new business; that's been true for quite a while now at L&G.
Duncan, just to pick up retail protection?

{BIO 18966514 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, just on retail protection, First Quarter, yes, we're satisfied with the performance that
we had in the First Quarter in retail protection.
Quarter One 2015 did reflect slightly lower volumes of retail protection business
compared to the same quarter in 2014; that was a very strong quarter. But underneath
that, the underlying business that we have in retail protection continues to perform very
strongly. New business, obviously, is only part of the story. As Mark said earlier on, overall
GWP for retail protection is up 6% year on year.
In terms of full-year outlook, I'll just direct you to the outlook statement that we've got
that talks about where we will be on the full year in terms of new business volumes and
margin.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

A couple of questions. First of all, sorry if you have already answered this. But can you tell
us what sort of transition arrangements are you using? Is it mainly on the discount rate? Is
it mainly on the asset-risk charges? Some sort of color on that.
Secondly, I guess, you have a big deferred annuity book as well in your annuities, I think it's
around GBP4 billion or GBP5 billion, whereas I heard that there is no matching adjustment
will be applicable on this particular book as of now. Any thoughts on that? What are you
doing with that book? Is there any issues with respect to capital on that particular book,
how you'll be using that under Solvency II?
Thirdly, just to cross-check, the lower volumes in bulk annuities, has it to do anything with
Solvency II, i.e., are you pulling back on bulk annuities at the moment because of
uncertainty on Solvency II? Or is there -- no, it is just a timing thing, rather than anything
else? Thank you.

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Ashik. I'll probably pick up all those myself. (Don't forget), I feel a bit like a
cracked record on the transitional point. I keep going back to transitionals are calculated
based on total technical provisions by regulated entity compared Solvency II with Solvency
I. That is the way the rules work. So I think people are looking for shadows which don't
exist. It's very clear-cut. It's defined in the directive.

Page 18 of 20



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C
Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

We will make an application. We won't actually know where we need them, or what size
we're going to need them, until -- it'll be based on the December 31, 2015 balance
sheets. So that's the way the rules are going to work, in practice.

FINAL

In terms of your point around matching adjustment applicability to deferred annuities, I'm
afraid, you're just wrong on that. The MA rules are the MA rules. And whether it's deferred
or an annuity payment doesn't matter, it's still eligible for matching adjustment treatment.
And your final one about whether we're pulling back on volumes in respect of -- with one
eye on Solvency II, I think Kerrigan's already picked up the point.
(Actually,) they're down to the market are that the bulk market remains pretty lumpy; with
GBP655 million, was a good First Quarter for bulks. Clearly, we recognize that Solvency is
coming down the track. And we're happily writing new business and recognizing the likely
landscape with a capital regime post this year. So certainly no impact on Solvency II in
terms of the amount of business we're writing in the bulk space.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks a lot for your clarity. But just coming back on your bulk deferred annuity point, I
thought that matching adjustment is only applicable to businesses where you have fixed
cash inflows and fixed cash outflows, i.e., there is no optionality.
But if you think about deferred annuity book, my sense is that there is a huge amount of
optionality because of the recent pension freedom. So would matching adjustment still
apply on that? Sorry. But I got a bit confused on that. Any color on that would be really
great. Thank you.

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

I stick to my answer I gave earlier, Ashik. We still fully expect the matching adjustment to
apply to both deferred and to pensions in payment on our annuity book.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay, that's very clear. Thank you.
