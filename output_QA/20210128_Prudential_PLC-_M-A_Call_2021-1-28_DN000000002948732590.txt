Presentation
Michael Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Welcome to our call, everybody, today and I appreciate you doing this on short notice.
Today is an upgrade of the -- an update, excuse me, on our next phase in the
transformation of Prudential plc into a pure play Asia and Africa group, with obviously
exciting growth opportunities. At the start of this pandemic, I said that during this
uncertain period that the company would be providing more frequent updates to
investors, the wider market community, and all of our stakeholders. And today's
communication should be seen in that context.
As you've heard me say in a number of occasions over the past year, we have two key
priorities. One, to pursue, at pace, a fully independent Jackson. And second, to ensure
our investors fully benefit from the opportunities of Asia and Africa. The developments
that we are announcing today support both of those priorities.
So let's start with Jackson where there are three key points. First is the acceleration of our
plan for full separation of Jackson in Q2 2021. We intend to conduct a demerger, whereby
the majority of Jackson's shares will be distributed to existing Prudential financial
shareholders. This will lead to the earlier creation of a separate, fully independent Jackson
that wouldn't have been possible through a minority IPO. Shareholders and various
regulatory approvals will be required, but the Board is determined that this is the right
path to take.

FINAL

Second, the appointment of Steve Kandarian. Steve is a well -- excuse me, is a -- will be
and independent non-exec Chair of Jackson's Board of Directors. And Steve is a wellregarded industry figure. He was previously CEO of MetLife and he will bring the
tremendous expertise and tremendous experience to Jackson.
Third, good progress is being made with other steps to complete the proposed
demerger in the second quarter of this year, namely in the debt raising and the regulatory
process underway. You have also seen that from 31 December 2020, Jackson is revising
the modeling for calculating reserves and capital for US statutory reporting. Then, that's in
respect to its hedge program.
As I mentioned, our full-year audited 2020 results will be out on the 3rd of March, where
we can go into more detail as you're used to. However, for this short call today, with me
are several other key members of the leadership team, including Mark FitzPatrick, Nic
Nicandrou, Michael Falcon, and Axel Andre, CEO and CFO of Jackson, respectively. All
here to join us and answer your questions as best we can, given the environment and the
process as we have underway.
So, Michael, over to you for some short points and remarks on Jackson, if you would,
please.

Bloomberg Transcript

Mark FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

Great. Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everybody. Let me start by echoing Mike's
remarks that we're really proud and happy to share the news of Steve Kandarian's
appointment as Jackson's non-executive Chair and we look forward to his official arrival
effective February 1. His appointment marks another key step on our path towards
becoming an independent public company.
As Mike mentioned, in this morning's release, we confirmed several actions we've taken
to position Jackson as an independent US life insurance company and we continue to
move forward. We are actively engaged with the rating agencies, with our banks, and our
regulators. We place a high value on those relationships. Jackson remains committed to
building on our decades-long history of helping US retirement savers by offering valuable
product solutions, supported by excellent service and a strong balance sheet.
Our expectation is that at the time of demerger, Jackson will have an RBC ratio between
425% and 450%, with a total financial leverage ratio of between 25% and 30%. The
proceeds from debt or hybrid security issuance prior to separation will be retained by
Jackson and largely held at our operating company. As we said previously, we are
committed to a strong credit rating and capitalization and we are confident on our path
forward.
This morning's announcement also addresses changes Jackson is making to our hedge
modeling approach under US statutory accounting, which are the standards used for US
insurance regulatory reporting. At the outset, I'd like to emphasize that we are not
changing our approach to hedging or the manner in which we execute it. Rather, we are
Page 2 of 16

FINAL

changing how we model the anticipated future net benefits of our hedge program under
the US statutory accounting for variable annuities.
We're making this change to refine the simplification that we made in our modeling last
year and because it has benefits on a go-forward basis, including enabling us to better
track and communicate the performance of our hedge program against objectives. But
the change in approach will result in a one time in the level of hedging credit that Jackson
will recognize under the statutory accounting regime. We estimate that reduction to be
around 80 RBC points at year-end 2020. At year-end, as we've noted in the release
earlier, we expect our RBC ratio to be in the range of 340% to 355%.
When preliminary results are released by the group on March 3, we will of course provide
detail on the RBC go forward from last year, just as we always do. Again, this change does
not affect our approach to hedging or the effectiveness of our hedge program which
continues to perform well and as expected. It is a one time change in our statutory
accounting approach, which we will reflect at year-end 2020. The change does not have
an explicit impact on GAAP or IFRS financial reporting, nor does it change the underlying
fundamental health and economics of our in-force business.
Jackson is well positioned on our path through the planned demerger to trade as an
independently listed company. The management team at Jackson and myself are keenly
focused on moving this process to completion in the second quarter and we look forward
to building our business in the years to come.

Let me turn it back to Mike.

Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Thank you, Michael. Turning to the key points now for the Prudential Group, we've also
given you a brief update on trading for last year. And despite quite extraordinary markets
and operating conditions, the businesses across the group proved resilient, adaptable,
and agile. And in particular, we can confirm that the overall quarterly sales trajectory in
Asia has continued to improve during the second half of 2020. We'll give you the full
picture when we do report our full year results again on 3rd of March.
Pivoting to the demerger, we are able to complete the transformation of Pru into a pure
business that's purely focused on our exciting growth opportunities in Africa and Asia
sooner than would have been possible with the minority IPO. To spell this out into the IPO
route, Prudential, in all likelihood, could still have been a majority owner of Jackson for
some considerable time to come and a demerger means that within the next six months,
Prudential will be down to a very small stake in Jackson.
We want the new Prudential to be best possible positioned to take advantage of the full
range of opportunities that we have to invest in in terms of growth. This means having a
capital structure and a leverage position which reflects our position as a growth-oriented
business. We've invested heavily in Asia for many years and we have never passed on a
deal we wanted because of lack of financial flexibility. That said, as we confirm today, the

FINAL

new Prudential, once Jackson is separated, would have a pro forma debt-to-equity ratio
somewhere in the low 30s in percentage terms. And that's above where our pure play
operating models and our target of 20 to 25 midterm plans.
Prudential is and will be a highly capital-generated business. And just through the normal
course of business, we would be able to get down to an appropriate level of leverage in
just a year or two. However, the pure play in Asia Prudential is, as I said, a new company
and we want that new company to have the best possible start in life and with further
financial flexibility to invest in growth opportunities. So that's why we've said today that we
are considering raising $2.5 billion to $3 billion in equity with the objective of being -- to
increase the group's investor base in Asia. Such a transaction, if executed, would maintain
and enhance the group's financial flexibility in light of the breadth of opportunities to
invest in for growth. The exercise would allow us to get our medium term -- excuse me, to
get to our medium-term leverage targets faster and to take advantage of the recovery in
our Asian and African markets, build future new business value, and grow our embedded
value for those regions. I'm sure you'll appreciate these are early stages. We can't
comment on timing. We're limited to how much we can make on process and other
details than what we've said in today's news release. We'll be able to give you more
updates in due course.
Finally, looking ahead, while the pandemic still has a long way to run and its impacts will no
doubt continue to be felt in the balance of 2021, overall quarterly sales trajectory in Asia
has continued to improve during the second half of 2020 and we anticipate our operating
performance for 2020 to be in line with current expectations. And in particular, our teams
continue to get better and better at adapting to the restrictions caused by COVID in
meeting the needs of our customers. We are well positioned for growth and today's
announcement shows we are moving at pace in executing on our strategy.
I'm going to pass it back over to Patrick, who'll just remind everybody how we need to
manage the questions and the answer session. Patrick?

Patrick Bowes

{BIO 16444249 <GO>}

Thank you, Mike. As you've heard, we have our results due out on the 3rd of March and
you'll appreciate that we have a number of legal and regulatory limitations in providing
details over and above what we've announced day. Following those results, there will be a
number of documents for the proposed demerger. In respect to the listing of Jackson in
the US, this will be what is called a Form 10 and for the group a UK circular to Prudential
shareholders. So there will be much more information in due course. On that basis, please
bear in mind when asking your questions today for the next 45 minutes or so.
And now over to Britta, our call operator to start the Q&A. Over to you, Britta.

from Andrew Crean from Autonomous Research. So, Andrew, your line is open. Please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - Andrew Crean

Good morning, all. I've got three questions, if I can. Firstly, can you comment at all on
headquarters costs now that you're demerging and getting a clean break from the US
business, whether you'll keep both London and Hong Kong and whether there are any
further cuts there? Secondly, could you talk about the -- you talked about the debt in the -at Pru Group, but could you talk about the LCSM, which was 334% at the half year, what it
looks like on a pro forma basis? And I think you said that the group-wide supervision ratio
will be roughly in line. So talk a bit more on that. And then thirdly, could you talk a little -you talked a lot about management teams in Jackson. Are those -- what are the
management plans for the existing business?

A - Michael Wells

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Andrew, thank you, good morning. Mark Fitzpatrick, can I ask you to comment on the
headquarters and the LCSM? And I guess general comment, Andrew, on the
management team. We're going to continually -- we've been working, I would say, on an
evolving model for getting to the cost targets we discussed. And also to improve the
speed at which we make decisions in Asia. So we've made a number of structural changes
in last year in our management model, specifically who reports to Nic. And you're treating
the more mature businesses both an expectation and in line of communication differently
than our developing markets. So, Nic, why don't you spend a couple of minutes after
explaining the objectives of that work stream and how that's working since you've got a
little bit of history with that?
So Mark to the cost and LCSM, please.

A - Mark FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

Certainly. Andrew, good morning to you. So in terms of the right-size [ph] central costs, if
you recall, we previously committed to a reduction of $180 million saving by FY21, which
we said at the half-year we are on track on and I will be able update you more on that on
the 3rd of March. And we also indicated at the half year further $70 million of saving
through rightsizing the head office costs given the expected evolution of the footprint of
the business. So we're still on track to that and we're still looking at that. So that's $250
million of head office -- headquarter cost that we are looking to reduce. And we're on our
way to doing that.
In terms of the LCSM at the half year, you're quite right. The half year group LCSM number
was 334%. The RBC changes that have been announced today and in isolation are
equivalent to -- are kind of in the ballpark of about 15 to 20 percentage point reduction in
group LCSM shareholder position. So we'll announce full details of the year-end capital
position alongside the results in early March, but I hope that gives you a sense of the
overall scale that we're talking about. Thank you.

Nick, if you would please.

FINAL

A - Nicolaos Nicandrou

{BIO 15589153 <GO>}

Yes, Mike. Hello, Andrew. About a year ago, we made a number of changes to the
management architecture at PCA. I was Chairman of the China business from day one, no
change there. But the other four businesses, big businesses Hong Kong, Singapore,
Malaysia, Indonesia, Eastspring, their CEOs report directly to me. And all the other more
developing markets were grouped together. And that's since been led by Wilf Blackburn,
who you would have met at the Singapore Investor Day. And as I said, that's been in place
for a year and designed to speed, to accelerate and speedup the decision making of the
larger businesses and ensuring that the other developing businesses have more full-time
oversight and support.
And actually, this structure has helped us respond with considerable agility and help us
accelerate, if you like, or do far -- many of the capabilities -- additions, new capabilities
that we got it in the course of last year in face of the pandemic. We can roll them out
much more effectively and faster. The interaction with London hasn't changed, but I have
always participated in the Executive Committees, participate at the Board, so the focus on
and the support that I get has remained unchanged and is very much appreciated.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Michael Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

And then Andrew, in general, the consolidation of the support functions has been going
on for the same time period. So HR, risk compliance are now all based in Hong Kong for
the group and the teams are working together between London and -- one actually, our
Hong Kong facility and it's been a single team. There's no longer a regional office
concept. There's a single operating model. So we've been getting a lot of those
efficiencies you asked about on the cost side by just consolidating teams and getting
them to work. It gives us an advantage on the clock and then also talent in key markets. So
we're very pleased with the way it's going so far.

Thank you. Morning everybody. I've got three questions, please. First in terms of the
indicative capital raise, the $2.5 billion to $3 billion, is that purely for deleveraging and for
expansionary CapEx in Asia or is there some underlying strengthening of the -- your Hong
Kong group ratio in that number? Second question. In terms of the deleveraging, you're
talking about 20% to 25% in the medium term in terms of leverage ratio. I'm assuming
that's including some book value growth. Can you put a dollar number please on the 2021
deleveraging in terms of what that might be? And then just finally on Jackson, in terms of
the 80 points RBC reduction from the modeling change on a statutory basis. Does that
suggest that there's going to be an increased level of statutory capital generation going
forward and RBC points given you've taken a hit upfront? Thank you.

A - Michael Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Thanks, Jon. Good morning. So again, I think I'm going to have Mark on the first two and
then Michael Falcon, if join us for the third one. But, Jon, directionally, as you know, we've
got some more expensive debt that we'd like to retire and I think -- the first call on the
capital. But, Mark, do you want to go through the detail a bit as we can in this
environment?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

So Jon, hi, good morning to. So the potential equity raise that we're considering would, in
essence, help us to accelerate the intended deleveraging and also enhance the financial
flexibility for the growth strategy that we talked about in Asia. So we have about $2.25
billion worth of relatively expensive debt that is either past first call or due to past first call
in the next quarter. So redeeming that would increase our financial flexibility and put us
towards the lower part of that 20% to 25% range, or the medium-term range that we
speak about in the announcement today.
So that I think is a key element in terms of that piece. And hopefully, that gives you a
sense in terms of how we're looking at the potential raise and how we're looking to use
the potential raise. The potential savings (inaudible) on that, the potential saving, if we
were to go down to the $2.25 billion on interest cost will be about $125 million per annum.

A - Michael Falcon

{BIO 17026942 <GO>}

Yeah. And it's Michael Falcon here, Jon. Hello. Thanks for the question. So the impact of
the change is modeling change in terms of the credit we received in the capital calculation
under stat and it doesn't impact either the installed book or the go-forward business in
terms of capital generation from the business. There's no impact on the underlying
economics of the health of our book, which we're obviously pleased with.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.

Q - Larissa Van Deventer

{BIO 20764470 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning. Two quick questions from my side, please. The first one
leading into the second. If you could please comment, you mentioned accelerate -- the
continued acceleration in growth in Asia as a recovery of the first lockdown. Could you
give us a sense of what is happening under the current COVID situations and also on the
reopening of the border between Hong Kong and Mainland China? And then related to
that, you talk about the deleveraging, but you also speak of growth opportunities. Could
you give us a sense of where in Asia you would look to invest if you were to do the
potential capital raise?

A - Michael Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Certainly. Nic, I think you're best positioned given you're there. Why don't you comment
on our -- I think the three really blend into it, similar sort of update on the feeling on the
ground and obviously, a status update on the border is relatively straightforward, and
where you see opportunity.

A - Nicolaos Nicandrou

{BIO 15589153 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank you, Mike. Good morning, Larissa. Again, within the confines of what we can
say at this stage and mindful, we will give you a full trading update at the prelims. What
can I say in response to your question? Well, the first thing is, despite, if you like, ongoing
disruptions, which are varied in both severity and duration in different markets, the
business has successfully deployed, not only its existing strengths but also its new digital
and physical capabilities, many of which we talked about at the interims, to achieve what I
would characterize as a strong rebound in Q3 and a good sequential progress in Q4.
So when I'm talking about what are the capabilities, what do I mean? I mean capabilities
such as establishing virtual sales. We said at the interims is that they accounted for 37% of
all agency sales in Q2. And that percentage remain meaningful in the third and fourth
quarter, not only for agency, but also for the bank channel. I also mean capabilities such as
the Pulse-led customer engagement and acquisition where we've doubled the number of
downloads from the 8 million we announced in August. And at the same time, we've
broadened both our digital offering and accelerated their sales to Pulse subscribers from
referrals to agents. I also mean capabilities such as the launching of very many new health
and protection products.
We're now offering simpler standalone cover at lower price points, which has enabled us
to tap into the much increased demand, which has been driven by the backdrop into
these products. And as a result of this, the trend that we reported in the half year of
seven businesses growing the health and protection mix continued in the second half.
And finally, I mean, capabilities, such as the -- those that come from stepping up our
agent recruitment. We stepped up our recruitment in the first half. We said at the time, it
was up 7%. And that provided a tailwind in the second half as did the expansion of our
reach in the first half to 19,000 bank branches in that channel following the addition of
new partnerships. So those that -- if I can stop there on that as a teaser for now, as I said,
more color on the 3rd of March.

Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity

In relation to your question on the COVID situation, some markets are the same. Some
markets have improvements, some markets have deteriorated. Maybe a bit more color.
Countries such as Philippines and Indonesia have never had the COVID under control. So
we had to live with that pretty much throughout the year since March and that continues.
There's no change there. In places such as Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Thailand, we've
seen some deterioration at the back end of the year or indeed, some in position of
additional restrictions early in this year. Places like China, Taiwan, and Vietnam where we
saw a return to normality after the first quarter, that normality pretty much continued and
remains the case. And the one place where we've seen an improvement is in Singapore,
where from the beginning of January, there's been a lifting of some of the restrictions.
Now, all that said, and to Mike's earlier comments, we now have many more tools, much
more experience and better know-how on how to phase into all these -- for this type of
backdrop. And candidly, our approach and mindset is to pretty much go for growth
irrespective.

Bloomberg Transcript

As to the question of where there are opportunities to grow, I mean, the answer is
everywhere. The markets remain under penetrated. The current backdrop has increased
and reinforcing people's minds and the importance of protecting themselves and indeed
having enough protection, there are -- there is investment that we're making in both our
physical route to market, whether it's agency or bank. The investment that we're making
in our digital routes to market through Pulse, the investment that we're making in
automating and streamlining our servicing.
And, yeah, there are one or two gaps that we have in one or two markets. We've talked
about historically about expanding our access and our presence in the bank channel in
Indonesia that we're looking to plug at the earliest available opportunity. So there's no
shortage of opportunities. No shortage of new product type areas to invest in, whether
it's retirement or protection. And really, the enhanced financial flexibility that a capital raise
would bring lends further support to our growth ambitions as we go forward.

Q - Larissa Van Deventer

{BIO 20764470 <GO>}

Is it fair to assume that protection products are relatively low capital in their requirement?

A - Nicolaos Nicandrou

{BIO 15589153 <GO>}

Are they low cap? Well, it depends whether they are whole of life or whether they are...

Q - Larissa Van Deventer

{BIO 20764470 <GO>}

No, pure protection, because you mentioned that is what you're focusing on writing at the
moment. But those are relatively capital light?

A - Nicolaos Nicandrou

{BIO 15589153 <GO>}

We're focusing on addressing all the needs and savings needs and health and protection
needs are abundant. The backdrop has increased the demand for health and protection.
Health and protection, no, it's not capital light, not as capital light as linked to all (inaudible)
as with profit business. In fact, because we have to put this capital behind to protect
against the current -- under the current regimes. On the new regimes, RBC regimes,
Page 9 of 16



Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity
Date: 2021-01-28

which is what we're evolving to in many of our markets, where we can take credit for
future premiums, they are -- those regimes make this business more attractive from a
capital perspective.

Q - Larissa Van Deventer

{BIO 20764470 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you.

A - Michael Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

So -- and again, I know we've got a few new people on the phone, but that focus is on
recurring premium health and protection business. And again, we have multiple channels.
We're taking that to market, bank, digital, and our successful agency force. And from a
range of capital intensity, Nic sort of went through it, we have a Par, which is very efficient,
link very efficient. Some of these products have more traditional capital stream, but they
also have very attractive payback and return on equity metrics. Thank you for your
questions.

Thank you. We now have the next question from Farooq Hanif of Credit Suisse. Farooq,
please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. Thanks for the opportunity. First question is on ambitions for liquidity in
Hong Kong. You've mentioned -- you implied that you are going to try and raise as much
as possible in Hong Kong. Do you think this will be enough and what are you going to do?
What are your plans going forward to further increase that? Second question is, yeah,
forgive me if you said this already, but taking the half year, what would your LCSM be
excluding Jackson's RBC ratio in that ratio? Just to get a sense of that. And then last
question is, what is your thinking process behind retaining the 20% in JNL? And how are
you going to think about allocating the value to those JNL shares in the group? Just
qualitatively, if you can help us with that. Thank you.

A - Michael Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Yeah, we can. So again, we're subject to regulatory comments and approvals what we can
say, but our intent would be to seek to 20% as an investment with the flexibility to sell
down opportunistically, but also because we see value in the company for the
shareholders and as far as Jackson. The capital raise that we have proposed decides to
what we think we need. There's not a plan for excess or we would have disclosed that.
But I'll let Mark give a little more color on that and LCSM. Mark?

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

FINAL

Mike, thanks. So in terms of the half year LCSM number, we indicated that the RBC change
that we announced today would have an impact of about 15 to 20 percentage points in
the group LCSM position. So pro forma for the -- also for the separation of Jackson, we
estimate the LCSM would be kind of in the 300s, but it's not a constraint. It's not a
concerning factor at all.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

And sorry, just to come back on the liquidity longer term, but do you think it's a concern
that you need to address to sort of rebalance some of that liquidity towards Hong Kong
going forward? And how much do you think you would have to do there? Is that going to
be in areas potential significant news flow going forward? Thank you.

A - Michael Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No. I think we said all along in that, we started this journey that alignment of regulatory or
some of our future opportunities, our capital base needed to be accomplished. In doing
that, there's obviously tremendous demand for investors in that part of the market, an
interest in the company and we think that there's a chance to tap into that. And there's
also -- I think it's good for all of our shareholders, regardless of where they are sitting.
And then the other piece is, we continue to move towards an embedded values, being a
better metric to measure the recurring cash flow that we're just talking about in the last
question. And that tends to be the lens for some of the investors in that market. And I
think the other one that's not trivial is assuming we pursue successfully a Hong Kong
equity lift, again, I'm trying to caveat this for all the various regulatory requirements we
have to step through here in this call today, but it also is supportive of extending our retail
brand even further because there is a retail element to that in that marketplace. And so
there's -- I think there's a number of benefits for us in going that marketplace. But again,
the sizing was based on what we think is the current efficiency of capital, reducing
expensive debt, giving us a little bit of headroom and getting to the targets that we think
produce the highest returns for our shareholders. It's not a -- we're not -- we think it would
be an appropriate amount period. It's not an implication that there's more to come.
Does that answer your question?

Thank you. The next question comes from Blair Stewart of Bank of America. Blair, please
go ahead.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. Good evening to Nic. Three questions from me. Firstly, just on
Jackson and the change to stat capital modeling. Obviously, having a very significant
cascading impact and which leads to an equity raise, which is unpleasant for the market.
So I'm just wondering, why that changed now? Was the modeling not compliant with the
requirements in the past? So just trying to get an idea of what's changed in your own

thinking. And also, why is it, if you are effectively putting more capital in or receiving less
capital credit, same thing, why does that not have an impact on future statutory profits or
capital?
My second question is the IPO versus demerger route. I'm just intrigued as to why you've
abandoned the IPO route given that market conditions are probably better, if anything,
than they were when you first announced it and obviously, the timing of selling down on
an IPO would not have been a surprise to you back then. So what's changed in your
thinking? And what feedback have you had from investors on appetite for a demerger?
And what will you do to combat flowback by way of investor education, et cetera, in the
US?
And thirdly, and I suspect this will be a short answer. But is there anything you can say on
Jackson National strategy going forward with a new Chair in place? Thank you.

Yeah, Blair, good morning. It's Mike. So I think I can get a couple of those and Michael
Falcon, the capital model, the first piece, I'm going to let you answer.
On the IPO versus demerger, Blair, I think that where we got to -- what changed, I think, is
just the continued volatility in markets, the timing. You asked about investor feedback. We
got a tremendous amount of feedback that -- from our investors across the board that
the highest way to generate our shareholder value was to -- with certainty, execution
certainty and timing. So if you look at today is a perfect example. I'd agree with you, two
weeks ago, you'd have said, equity markets are up, rates are up, you're bringing an IPO.
It's a wonderful day. You do it today and it would have been a difficult day. We just -- the
demerger has a fraction of the market sensitivity, market hurdles to clear and it's quicker.
We're out quicker. They're independent quicker, which gives them less -- their own trading
characteristics are better. On developing on flowback and managing the creation of a new
investor base, there's already a -- we're going to be very careful here in what we say
because, again, they are in filings. But obviously, there's a -- the normal processes for a
company doing these sorts of things would be road shows and meeting with the
institutional investors that buy these shares in North America and we're well aware of the
playbook for companies in that sense.
And then the other comment on leverage. So if you can see, we're not -- from a rating
point of view and from a capital generation point of view, we don't need to do a capital
raise. We're doing this because we think it accelerates the shape and the ability to
address opportunities, the ability to pay down that expensive debt faster. I mean, we
could do this organically, but we think this produces a -- positions the firm more
competitively quicker. So it's not a -- there is no need to do the capital raise in the sense
of a rating pressure and things post Jackson. So I would separate those two a bit.
Michael, do you want to talk about capital modeling?

Yeah. Great. Blair, good to hear your voice, if not see your face, and one day we'll all be
together again in person. So your question, first question relative to Jackson, why now
and why doesn't the -- it had an ongoing impact. So the change in statutory capital
modeling is not related to the underlying economics of our business. It's related to the
computational model by which we get credit for the hedge programming capital. And that
component changed with the VM-21 regime that we adopted early last year. In the course
of that, we made a simplifying assumption as we do and as everybody does in the
models and in reviewing that this year. And that's part of the -- our process in preparation
for Jackson on the path to public. We found that one of those assumptions was
inconsistent with what the intent of it was. And so we've corrected that and adjusted it,
and it's a one-time change.
So I would think of it as a ratcheting, a recalibration of a sort of the thermometer of where
that is. And that's really the answer of why it doesn't have an impact in terms of capital on
a go-forward basis. It's not like we're taking something upfront from the future and
bringing it now and so the future flows have different. This doesn't affect the economic
value generation. And as you know all too well, there are gaps in how economics of VA
would perform relative to the statutory construct around the VA. And this means it relates
only to that statutory.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Michael, can I just ask -- sorry interrupt. But does that mean that you hold more statutory
capital? Is that the impact of the change?

A - Michael Falcon

{BIO 17026942 <GO>}

No, I mean, it means that the capital level raises to get to the same -- to a similar level of
RBC, if you will. It's an adjustment to the credit that we received in the computation.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. So my read of that is that you hold more stat capital, which I would assume, given
you've talked about the inefficiencies of having a low capital requirement and low stat
capital in the past that there would be efficiencies of having more stat capital. But we can
maybe defer to that, but that's why I'm slightly surprised that having more capital -generate more efficiencies going forward, given you've talked about the inefficiencies in
the past.

A - Michael Falcon

{BIO 17026942 <GO>}

So from the standpoint of capital going up, you do have changes in terms of macro,
hedge overlay and other things like that. But that's not the focus of the change. There's
changes in the underlying required capital to that increase. So it's not -- we can follow up
later, but it's not a -- it's not accretive or diminutive in terms of go-forward position.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you.

On the strategy, some of that, you'll have to wait for the Form 10. I think I'm going to
defer into the normal process around this going forward. But suffice it to say, we remain
committed to the US retirement market and we see that as large, dynamic and growing,
and we're going to be very, very excited to attack that market as an independent
company.

So Patrick, how are we on time? We take one more? I know we committed you guys to
get you off quarter after. I'm just conscious of that. Britta, do we have one more in the
queue?

Operator
We have a question from Dominic O'Mahony of Exane BNP Paribas. So, Dominic, please
go ahead.

Q - Dominic O'Mahony
Hi, folks. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. Most of my questions on the US I
think have been answered. Thank you for the clear answers. Can I ask one small
clarification? So the 80 points of RBC ratio you've pointed to, can you give us a split of the
effect from requirements versus capital or it is just qualitatively an indication of that? And
then secondly, just turning to Asia. You've been very clear -- Nic, you are very clear about
going for growth despite the COVID effects. I wonder if I could just ask about Hong Kong.
Clearly, there's a feature there, which is that Mainland Chinese have to be there physically
to buy new products. And there's -- and that's the core part of your business. Could you
just tell us what sort of the agency forces in Hong Kong had you been growing? Have you
had any attrition as agents see that there is not much business from the Mainlanders and
so they are stepping away? Could you give us some update on that, please? Thank you.

A - Michael Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Yeah. And I apologize, I realize we did not -- let me just -- so the border is not open
between China and Hong Kong to make sure we're clear on that. Nic, why don't you go
first -- I'm sorry, Michael, why don't you go first on the US piece on what (multiple
speakers) and then Nic, let's go to Asia, Hong Kong.

FINAL

Yeah. So on the components of the 80-point drop, the answer is, we will give the -- just as
we always do in the roll forward of RBC at the full year results, we'll break out the impacts
relative to both capital and required capital as we -- in the context of the way we present
that usually. But no additional information now other than the estimated range of where
we're going to be, where we expect to be in separation and the impact of the change.

A - Michael Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Nic, Hong Kong, what's the agency force?

A - Nicolaos Nicandrou

{BIO 15589153 <GO>}

Thank you, Mike. And apologies, no, you're right, I didn't answer Larissa's question in
relation to that, which, as you said, the border remains close. So has there been any
attrition? No. The agency count is actually up in Hong Kong overall. But clearly, we've
retained the agents that are registered with us, whether they are from focused or
exclusively in Mainland China or not. We saw a lot of the agents that did the majority of
their business with Mainland China customers. So a lot of those pivot into the domestic
market. And we've been able to feed them leads from the 0.5 million or so downloads
that we had on Pulse from domestic customers in Hong Kong. So they -- yeah, as I said,
they pivoted the focus into domestic and to support the building of a customer base that
used the tools that came with the Pulse investment that we made across the region,
including Hong Kong.
