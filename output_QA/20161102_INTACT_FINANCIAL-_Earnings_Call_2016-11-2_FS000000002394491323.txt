{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today we announced
third quarter net operating income of CAD 1.01 per share through absorbing CAD 0.93
per share of cat losses. It was clearly a challenging summer as many of our customers
faced severe weather conditions including multiple hail, wind and rainstorms. As usual,
our troops across the country worked hard to help our customers get back on track.
We were pleased to see our top line grow 5% in the quarter all organic. Clearly our new
product lines telematics software and improved digital experiences continue to pay oﬀ,
particularly in personal lines. On the commercial side, while growth was negatively
impacted by tough conditions in the West we continue to see beneﬁts from rate increases
and the introduction of new products for a sharing economy.

Bloomberg Transcript

Despite 8.1 points of cat losses, we delivered a combined ratio of 97% with two points
improvements in the underlying loss ratio. That being said, personal auto's performance
was choppy given intense hail activity and the fact that upcoming rate increases and the
full impact of recent reforms is not yet fully felt. Our commercialized performance
continues to be excellent.
Our operating ROE remained healthy at 13.4% particularly in light of our strong capital
position and the impact of elevated catastrophes. When comparing ourselves to the
industry, we outperform by 680 basis points on ROE for the ﬁrst half of the year. We
ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, CAD 881 million of excess capital and our
book value per share grew 10% for year-over-the-year to CAD 41.47.
Let's now look at our third quarter results by line of business. So, personal auto grew 5%
thanks to our telematics software, the continued success of Quick Quote, as well as the
strength of our marketing initiatives. While growth was solid, the combined ratio
deteriorated by 9.9 points to 104.3%, impacted by severe weather, lower favorable prior
year's claims development and some cost inﬂation.
We estimate that weather represented approximately 8 points of combined ratio from
catastrophes and other non-catastrophe weather events. To address, cost pressure rates
increases are being implemented across the country. This rate momentum, combined
with our claims action plans, ﬁner risk selection and additional beneﬁts from recently
implemented reforms will improve our auto results within 12 months.
When it comes to the industry outlook for auto, we continue to anticipate a rational
competitive environment with low to mid single-digit growth in the coming 12 months as
rate increases are implemented to address cost inﬂation. In personal property, premiums
grew 8% as new products and continued rate increases were deployed in favorable
market conditions.

FINAL

The combined ratio of 99.7% included 18.8 points of catastrophes from severe weather.
Our underlying results were very good having improved 8.2 points year-over-year on the
eﬀectiveness of our proﬁtability actions. When we look at our performance so far this year,
a combined ratio of 96.4% after absorbing losses from Fort McMurray and severe summer
weather storms that were well positioned to meet our 95% target combined ratio on a fullyear basis, even in bad times.
In terms of the industry outlook for personal property, there is no change there. We
expect recent weather events will prelaunch the ﬁrm market conditions in personal
property with mid to upper single-digit growth over the next 12 months.
In commercial P&C, diﬃcult conditions in Western Canada upset rate increases leading to
ﬂat premium growth. With that said, our commercial P&C business delivered an
outstanding combined ratio of 81.3%, one of the best quarters in recent years. The
underlying current year loss ratio improved 3.2 points from last year from the success of
our proﬁtability action.

Bloomberg Transcript

Commercial auto premiums grew 7% in the quarter, mainly driven by new products aimed
at the sharing economy. The combined ratio improved substantially by 8.4 points to
88.6% on the heels of strong underlying result. Our actions are working so far and we're
on the right path to maintain a low-90s (06:37) combined ratio in that line of business.
With respect to the outlook for commercial lines, the industry remains competitive but
market conditions are ﬁrm leading to low single-digit growth in the coming year. In
summary, while the quarter's underlying results are disappointing at 97%, the underlying
performance in our property lines and commercial auto improve meaningfully. A strong
testament to the resilience of our operations.
Personal auto was a drag on our performance in Q3, but the actions we're taking will have
a positive impact over the next few quarters. We're also making good progress on several
of our strategic initiatives. Our product oﬀering for the sharing economy is gaining
momentum with the growth of car sharing services in Ontario, Alberta and Quebec.
With the coverage we provide to Uber and Turo, two leaders in the sharing economy, the
drivers and customers we serve are well insured. We continue to develop innovative
solutions to leverage these emerging opportunities. On the digital front, we reached a
milestone with 1 million online quotes for our auto products through Quick Quote, our
online quoting engine. This translates into about CAD 100 million in new business
premium since its launch in early 2015.
On the back of this success, we launched Quick Quote for homeowners where customers
can get a quote in two minutes on average. Consumers are reacting well to a simpler,
faster and easier experience.
On the claims front after a successful start in Calgary, we recently launched a new service
center in Ottawa. It is well received so far. To give you some perspective on capacity, our
Calgary service center serviced 2,000 customers since its launch in February. Beyond an

easier experience and higher quality repairs, we have reduced the repair time by about
25% for those customers using the Intact centers. We remain on target to open our
Toronto location later this month, while Montreal is targeted for early 2017.
Finally, we're also pleased to have made progress in building the strength of our two core
brands. In recent national research, 30% of Canadian named Intact Insurance
unprompted when asked to think of home and auto insurance provider, up 7 points from
last year. This is an all-time high. Intact Insurance is a relatively new brand, but truly
gaining momentum. Furthermore, belairdirect was not far behind at 27%, up 4 points
nationally.

Bloomberg Transcript

Clearly, the initiatives we have in place are making a diﬀerence and we're on the right
path to build the Intact Insurance and belairdirect as household names. In conclusion,
while we had a tough quarter the business continued to show its resilience. Our initiatives
are paying oﬀ in driving solid top line growth and outpacing the industry. Our actions
continue to drive underlying results improvement. That being said, our team is relentless
in driving initiatives to protect our business against natural disasters and improving
personal automobile proﬁtability.
In addition, we've seen material progress on our strategic initiatives, particularly with
regards to our digital leadership, the expansion of our distribution, and the sharing
economy. Our focus on oﬀering a customer experience that is second to none combined
with our ﬁnancial strength, places us in a very strong position to beneﬁt from the
environment in which we compete. So I'm conﬁdent that the strategy we have in place will
continue to help us outperform the industry ROE by at least 500 basis points and grow
our net operating income per share by 10% per year overtime.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Marcotte.

Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles. Good morning, everyone. Although Q3, 2016 was a challenging quarter
for Intact with CAD 166 million in net losses from multiple catastrophes, our operations
still generated CAD 137 million in net operating income. Our operating ROE was 13.4%,
we have a very strong capital position with CAD 881 million of excess capital and our book
value per share is up 10% from Q3 last year.
Our operations have again shown their resilience in the face of adversity, with solid
earnings and a strength of balance sheet. When I look at our overall underwriting
activities, we improved our underlying current year loss ratio by 2 points in the quarter to
62.8%. Thanks to our proﬁtability initiatives. All lines of business contributed to the
improvement except for personal auto, which experienced some uptick in frequency and
severity, most of which relates to a rise in claims from hailstorms.
Prior year claims development was favorable across our businesses consistent with our
long-term expectations, but 2 points below Q3 last year, which had beneﬁted from
favorable development in the industry books (12:00). Even if the summer of 2016 seemed

FINAL

long, warm and beautiful for many Canadians, some of our customers placed a high
number of severe weather events. This resulted in 8.1 points of CAT losses, twice as high
as last year and well above our expectations.
Given the frequency in severity of catastrophe losses in the recent past, we have revised
our expectation for the future annual run rate from CAD 200 million to CAD 250 million,
half of which are still expected to occur in the third quarter. This takes into account the
growth of our business as well as loss mitigation and product changes being rolled out in
response to changing weather patterns. We also expect the ﬁrm conditions to continue
for another 24 months as insurers adapt to these changes.
Net distribution income grew 7% in Q3 to CAD 30 million from growth in our broker
network and higher proﬁtability. For the full year of 2016, we expect to report slightly
above CAD 110 million in net distribution income and this amount should grow north of
15% in 2017. Our investment portfolio continues to deliver consistent investment income
slightly below last year at CAD 102 million as expected. Although average net investments
increased 6% to CAD 13.6 billion from operating cash ﬂows and mark-to-market gains on
common and preferred shares, this was oﬀset by a lower reinvestment deal.

Bloomberg Transcript

We continue to expect investment income to decline marginally in dollar terms over the
next 12 months. We reported net investment gains in the quarter of CAD 17 million, a
sharper improvement from last year's losses of CAD 64 million. Favorable equity markets
led to realize gains on our equity portfolio compared to net losses and high impairment
charges last year.
In summary, we reported quarterly earnings per share of CAD 0.91, CAD 0.04 lower than
last year as the impact of elevated catastrophe losses was largely oﬀset by net investment
gains and lower impairments. A few comments on our ﬁnancial position. Our balance
sheet remains very strong, our MCT stands at 215%, 3 points higher than at the end of Q2.
The improvement reﬂects capital generated from our operations, favorable equity
markets and the phase-in of MCT guidelines, less dividends and investments made.
Our total excess capital amounted to CAD 881 million at the end of the quarter, while our
debt to total capital was 19%. Our investment portfolio's unrealized gained position
increased materially from Q2 to CAD 258 million. We executed on our buyback during
the quarter purchasing some 52,000 shares for a total cash outlay of CAD 5 million
between the launch of the program and the end of Q3, we spent CAD 37 million on the
buyback with an average price per share of CAD 87.84.
Our capital deployment strategy remains unchanged and while our priority is to invest in
growth opportunities, buying back shares at times when the market price may not fully
reﬂect the intrinsic value is irresponsible use of our capital.
In conclusion, with strong underlying results in property lines and commercial auto, we
continue to focus our eﬀorts on improving results in personal auto with our usual
discipline in energy. We believe the actions we are taking in personal auto combined with
the favorable conditions in other lines will drive improved results in the next 12 months.

We still believe there will be continued consolidation of the domestic P&C industry both
in manufacturing and distribution, and we will be active participants.

FINAL

Our balance sheet is in great shape, and we are ready to tackle opportunities as they
arise. Our earnings have proven their resilience to adversity. Thanks to our business and
regional mix, the contribution of our distribution and investment activities and the
strength of our insurance operations across the country.
With that, I'll return the call back to Samantha.

Q&A

Your ﬁrst question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, Kai.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you. So, ﬁrst question on the personal auto side, you mentioned
there are 2-point deterioration because of moderate increase in frequency in severity as a
result of non-CAT weather as well as some cost inﬂation. Can you give a little bit more
color on that to say breakdown between what do you think is kind of one-oﬀ non-CAT
weather and the sort of underlying attrition loss inﬂation? And also what pricing action
you're taking right now? You mentioned that you expect will fully oﬀset by early next year.
I just wonder what gave you that conﬁdence.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks for your question. I think Kai, maybe what we could do is give you a full
perspective of the automobile performance, not just on frequency and severity, but what
we've seen at the CAT level, what we've seen in prior-year development, and give you a
little more color on some of the actions we're taking because at 104% combined ratio, for
me, that warrants color. So, I'll ask Darren to give you his perspective on that, and we'll
address speciﬁcally your question in the exercise.

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles. So, yeah, as Charles and Louis both mentioned in their opening remarks,
a disappointing quarter to 104.3%. Let me break down some of the components. I'll start
Page 6 of 25

FINAL

with CATs 6.2-point CATs in the quarter, up 2.8 compared to Q3 of last year, mostly
attributable to multiple hailstorms in Alberta, clearly exceeded our expectations. It was
real tough summer for automobile in Alberta due to hail activity.
In terms of PYD, clearly we see some ﬂuctuations quarter-to-quarter in terms of PYD. We
had (18:3) swing in this particular quarter with respect to personal auto, 4 points to that
gap is attributable to the favorable PYD that came from pools last year. And also versus
some slightly unfavorable PYD in the pools this year, but I should say that the pools for Q3
of 2015 was abnormally high.
Another element of the PYD, is we continue to see development on Alberta BI claims.
We're not seeing acceleration, nothing new that's consistent with the trends that we've
seen in the past quarters. On a year-to-date basis, PYD is still favorable at 3.7% of net
earned premium. So, just to put that in the context of the quarter.
Now when I turn to the current accident year, just over 2 points of deterioration, as you
mentioned, a little bit of an impact from claims frequency and also from severity. And this
was oﬀset by a slight increase in rates.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, when I look at the rates in particular, and I'll go into more detail here in a moment in
terms of what we're doing for our future rate actions, there's a currently a bit of lag
between written and earned right now, as far as rate increases in personal auto. We
already have great momentum in the portfolio, as evidenced that the gap between written
and earned is higher in the month of September versus the quarter.
So, when I turn to frequency now, largely due to non-CAT weather in Alberta when we
exclude the non-CAT weather impact from Alberta, the automobile frequency is relatively
ﬂat compared to Q3 of 2015. We did see a slight uptick in the frequency in Ontario from a
UBI data when we compared to Q3 of 2015 we have seen an increase in the number of
trips that our customers booked in that period. We've also seen an increase in the length
of those trips as well.
We attribute these mostly to the favorable summer weather experienced in Ontario, with
few days of precipitation in Q3 year-over-year. The remaining provinces, however, outside
of Alberta oﬀset the increase that we saw in Ontario. On a year-to-date basis, however, I
should say is that we don't see this as a longer-term trend as frequency is down year-overyear. I should say though, it is clear though that UBI data continues to provide further
additional data points for assisting the earlier identiﬁcation of potential trends.
In terms of severity, slight increase in the quarter again mostly due to non-CAT weather
losses in Alberta similar impact that we saw on frequency. Driven by more comprehensive
claims, more hail claims which have a higher severity than other physical damage
coverages.

Darren, why don't we talk about what we have in the pipeline to improve the performance
in persona auto?

FINAL

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Sure, so Charles when I look coast-to-coast, if I can, so let's start with Ontario. We have
seen and we continue to see normal claims inﬂation in the system. The rate increase that
we talked about in the last quarterly earnings call is now eﬀective. We continue to ﬁle for
further rate increases. In addition in terms of the reforms that we saw in July, we expect to
see further beneﬁts from them playing out in the coming 12 months. We expect to see
from those reforms an additional 2 points of loss ratio improvement in 2017, as some of
those reforms are on a policy renewal eﬀective basis as opposed to a loss of current
(22:28) basis.
So, in addition to the rate increases that we have ﬂowing plus the reform impact, we have
mid-single digits of loss ratio improvement already baked into the portfolio in Ontario.
When I look at Alberta, as we've previously mentioned we increased rates by 8% in Q2.
Earlier this week, we received approval for an additional 2.4% rate, eﬀective January 1,
2017. And we're also preparing future further ﬁlings for the spring of 2017.

Bloomberg Transcript

Look at all those rate changes in aggregates, we have upper single digits of loss ratio
improvement already baked into the Alberta portfolio. Not to leave out the other
provinces in the Atlantic consistent with last quarter, we're increasing rates and we also
have further rate ﬁlings being prepared. And again, in Quebec, we continue to increase
rates after a long period of ﬂat or declining prices.
In terms of the rate changes themselves, they're all heavily segmented. In addition, our
UBI program performing well, attracting a better quality customer. We have strong new
business penetration in Ontario, Quebec, and the Atlantic with UBI. And we'll be
introducing our UBI oﬀer in Alberta in Q1 of 2017.
Now, if I look at the auto portfolio now on a year-to-date basis, current accident year is ﬂat
compared to 2015 with a slight decrease in frequency, as I mentioned earlier, oﬀsetting a
comparable increase in severity together with a ﬂat rate change. When I look at what we
see from a frequency, from a severity standpoint, when I look in terms of the rate action
that we have, we have strong plans in place. We have strong plans in place also in
underwriting and also in claims actions plans as well.
This is what varies very much by province to province, but many of these actions are
already in play. So, given the right momentum we currently have, what we know will be
ﬂowing through the portfolio in the coming quarters, our segmentation strategy
improvements in our risk selection models, together with additional Ontario reform
impact due to ﬂow through in 2017, we believe that the actions will provide a positive
impact on the coming quarters.

A - Charles Brindamour

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's very comprehensive, thank you so much for that. And as my second question on
the capital management side, you have close to CAD 900 million excess capital. And on
the merger acquisition front, there are recent press report about you might be looking at
especially insurance company in Bermuda. And also on the buyback front, you have CAD
600 million authorization with six buyers in February, and you only bought back CAD 37
million out of that. And you mentioned your book value grow 10% year-over-year, but
stock hasn't moved anywhere. So, I just wonder why wouldn't you be more aggressive on
the buyback front.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So Kai, as you know, our main priority is deploying capital on growth opportunities. I don't
think we'll comment on rumors. But as you know, we are on the lookout and interested in
the consolidation. So, at the ﬁrst premise in launching the buyback is really doing it
opportunistically, but maintaining the priority of (26:08) capital for growth opportunity
that would come about. So, our view today remains the same. We still think there's
consolidation to be happening. The best use of capital for us is deploying it on growth.
And on the buyback, we launched it to take opportunities in the market when the price of
our stock is well below intrinsic value, and that's what we're doing. And I don't think our
view has changed in that respect.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No, when I think, Kai – when you think about our two big ﬁnancial objectives, one is ROE
outperformance and the other one is net operating income per share growth, both those
ﬁnancial metrics have an important capital component to it. If you sit on fat capital, this
depresses your ability to outperform from an ROE point of view and capital deployment
as a lever or income per share growth. So, rest assured that when we feel that the excess
capital we have is a burden on our performance in relationship with visibility we have on
growth opportunities, we'll be more aggressive from a buyback point of view.

Q - Kai Pan

Great. Thank you so much for all the answers.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. My ﬁrst question was, I know we're only kind of month into it, but
there's been a number of kind of continuation of wind storms and rainstorms and
whatnot, and just wanted to get any color that you have on what Q4 is kind of shaping up
like. And then, on a similar note, given what we've seen in the past few quarters, and I
know you don't want to necessary react to maybe one or two quarters of data, but do you
feel like what you've seen in the past couple of quarters might suggest pricing some of
your lines of businesses might need to change from here or is it in line with how you guys
think about the business?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So, I'll ask Patrick to give you his perspective on the start of the quarter. I will then ask
Darren and Alain to give perspective on pricing in home insurance as well as in
commercial lines. So, Patrick.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yes, fairly simple. So far, we had, after the end of Q3, two events, two main events. One is
– sorry.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Maritimes.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah, the one is the Matthew Hurricane, (28:49) of the Matthew Hurricane that's hit the
Maritimes. And the other one is another rain event in Quebec in last weekend, not the
one that we've had with October 21. Those are the only two events, most of the CATs we
expect in Q4 is usually in October. So right now, it's not very diﬀerent than...

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

...what we would expect.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

There's not a story there, I think it is – it is, as far as we're concerned, in line with what one
would expect at this point in time. That being said, look, we came out of the summer with
a view in home insurance that more needed to get done. I think Louis was very clear that
we've increased our expectation, and that translates into what we believe will be
continued rate increases despite the fact that we're convinced that our oﬀering today at
Page 10 of 25

FINAL

its price is geared to operate sub-95% in bad times, and I would say, 2016 is one of those
very bad years from a natural disaster point of view. Nine months into the year, we're at
96% in home insurance. That being said, our view is the industry ought to do some more
work. We're growing in that environment, and we will get some more rates in that
segment for the foreseeable future. And I think this extends our outlook in home
insurance probably from 12 to 24 months of the hard market. Darren, I sort of stole the
punch there but maybe you want to add a bit of color.

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yes, the only thing I would add there, Charles is, in the quarter itself, we had just under 4
points of rate already ﬂowing through our personal property portfolio. So, we do
deﬁnitely have right momentum within the portfolio, we have the further rate increases
planned pretty much coast-to-coast in personal property. In Alberta in particular, probably
hitting a little harder in terms of segmented rate increase, we're also looking to further
enhance our product to respond to the increase in hail activity as well too, so there're
probably some high-level changes that we're looking here.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, I think in home insurance, I will see, despite the natural disaster, this is a segment
that we would be very comfortable growing at a faster clip if the market lent itself to faster
growth because we're very comfortable with our product. We're very comfortable with
our rate position. I think it's been tested in the past year. We're seeing the current
accident year improved 8 points, and so we like what we're seeing there and we think the
market conditions lend themselves to us continuing the transformation we started in that
line of business.
I think we're spending a bit uptime in commercial lines, in particular, property, I think we
like what we're seeing there as well. But I'll let Alain talk about that.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Charles. So, Geoﬀ maybe a bit of context, we said we believe the market
is in a ﬁrm position, not in a fairly ﬁrming, but basically remaining ﬁrm. We pushed in the
last quarter 3% of rate on renewal and our retention is still holding, so that lets us that the
market is still in a position to accept rate increase and experience rate increase on that
side, that's the 13th quarter in a row that we've been pushing rate. It's slightly lower than it
was a year ago, more in the 4%, but it's still continuing on that. And we believe, like we
said, what keeps the market ﬁrm is low interest rates and there're certainly no sign of
interest rate moving upwards and also elevated losses in the market. And the situation like
Fort McMurray in the second quarter is another point that leaves the elevated losses very
high. So, we think there's an opportunity and a situation where the ﬁrm market will
continue for a few quarters.
On the commercial auto side, clearly the trucking business was really ﬁrming and we're
seeing in that market a very ﬁrm market. On the regular automobile, although things are
very competitive, we see signs that there is a bit momentum on increasing rates. Our rate
increase in the third quarter are in the range of about 2.5%, but that's on the top of the

product reform in Ontario, so we're talking of an eﬀect of about 4.5% rate increase in
total, and that's higher than what we saw in the ﬁrst and second quarter. And at that level,
our retention again is still holding. So, we see a bit of momentum on the automobile, and
that is probably on the fact that 2015, we saw the industry combined ratio in commercial
auto probably north of 100%. So, there is a need for increase on that market, so we see
good momentum on that side.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay, thank you for that. And just my second question, just following up on Kai's question
around the M&A. I understand you obviously were not going to talk about speciﬁcs
transactions, but can you maybe talk about kind of the tone in the industry or what you're
kind of looking at, is it things are kind of a bit more in a holding pattern or maybe if you
can just provide a little bit more insight about what you may be looking at or what may be
going on domestically as well as outside of borders?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think, if I look domestically, there have been transactions this year. Again, one notable
one for sure. And so, our view has not changed. I think domestically, near mid-term 15
points of market share will change hands. I think that there are disconnects, I think,
between what people might expect and what the value might be. But we think
consolidation will continue to take place in the domestic marketplace, and this is not a
long-dated forecast. I think when I look at distribution in the domestic marketplace, that's
very active. And we're deploying capital in small chunks, but in businesses that are doing
really well, and I think this will help fuel our distribution proﬁt later in 2016, but more
importantly in 2017, as we mentioned, we expect to grow our distribution income, north of
10%. And portion of that is driven by the fact that we're able to deploy capital there and
could deploy more or would deploy more.
I think in terms of – so, that's priority number, it's to deploy capital here both from a
manufacturing and distribution point of view, and I think it's a good environment for that.
That being said, there are very clear thresholds that we're using to deploy capital. And so
long as we cannot meet those thresholds, we're holding on to our capital.
I think when it comes to abroad, I mean, the risk consolidation at the industry level outside
Canada as well, and I think we're still prudent from that point of view. But as we've talked
to investor over the past few years where we have an interest in exploring what's going on
abroad, and one shouldn't read rumors. And what I just said, as a validation of these
rumors at all, I think our thesis has not changed there, there are opportunities, priorities is
in Canada.

Your next question comes from the line of Jaeme Gloyn with National Bank Financial. Your
line is open.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

Yeah, good morning.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

First question is related to the commercial auto segment and the onboarding, I guess, of
Uber and Turo. It looks like rate increase is up about 15% year-over-year. I was just
wondering if you could sort of break out what would be I guess organic rate increase and
what's related to Uber and Turo. And then, I guess how you see that evolving as you bring
Quebec online for Uber and potentially other sharing economy related sources?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, I think, by the way, we view Uber and Turo as organic as well, but we might give you
a perspective if we excluded those numbers. These are big growth levers. I think there is a
lot of...

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

I think without pointing and give you an exact number to tell you how much we collect
from Uber and Turo, I can tell you that the majority of the growth you see in commercial
auto in the quarter is driven by the sharing economy that was about Uber and Turo. Like I
said, this is – we have basically three months of operation with Uber, which is the larger
share of that part. And technically, this is usage base of that. So, how much will that grow
is very much related to how much it's going to be used with the adding of the automobile
piece in Quebec starting on October 2017, we'll have new premium coming in for that
size. But as Uber operates in more city, as they become more popular in the city, they're
being used, our premium will grow on that side. But being only three months, not having
a view on the seasonality of the usage and things like these, I think it's early to say to what
extent and to what level it will grow. But clearly, this is a major impact on our volume in
the next 12 months.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Okay. And then, second question relating to investment income. I just noticed a tick-up in
income from loans and other, is there a shift in strategy from ﬁxed income to potentially
other sources of yield? And I guess a follow-up to that is, what are some of the strategies
that you're employing to enhance yield either in upcoming quarters or down the road?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So, yeah, I think, overall, we're not reaching for yield. Our asset mix has not changed
meaningfully. We're very much ﬁne-tuning the products we've been operating in for a
Page 13 of 25

FINAL

while. I think, Louis, you might want to give some more color. But look, our thought
process here is that we're operating with ROE targets. And when we operate in the low
interest rate environment, our troops on the front line know that they have to step up from
an underwriting performance point of view. I mean, this is a communicating base and
reaching for yield to (40:17) return, that's not how we run the business. I'll let Louis give a
bit of his perspective there.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Well, you're right, so I think we're trying to diversify the portfolio a bit, but it's marginal.
It's on the edges. And we're not trying to increase yield through taking more risk, that's
very clear. And I would say from another interest income from loans, those are related to
our broker investments. So, in some cases, we have loans, some cases we have equity.
And the uptick is what you're seeing from the broker loans.

Thank you. Good morning.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good morning, Paul.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

First question is related to your reinsurance coverage and understanding you're probably
negotiating for January renewals, so it might be a little sensitive there. But want to ask
following the Q3, where the CAT losses were a matter of frequency versus severity, if
you're giving any thought in terms of changing the structure of how your reinsurance
coverage works to give you more protection against these smaller CAT events?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So, maybe, Alain, you could give a high-level perspective on the reinsurance market
conditions.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Yeah. I think like you said, Paul, this is a bit sensitive at this point, so as we're renewing in
January 1. But when we look at our price and our situation in the market evolving
reinsurance, it's pretty much an international market. So, when you look at what happened
in Canada and when you look what happened worldwide, you see probably a diﬀerent
picture as there had been CAT mainly in Q2 and some frequency in Q3 in Canada. So
Page 14 of 25



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

Date: 2016-11-02

FINAL

clearly, the Canadian piece of the reinsurance is aﬀected, and there will be maybe some
adjustment on some of the bottom layers, but the overall international CAT market have
been very good to a reinsurer, and we believe it's still a favorable environment for buyer.
So, we'll see probably a diﬀerent approach on diﬀerent layer of our program for 2016, and
I think that gives you a bit of a picture of internationally.
I think we have to look at Canada, but we also have to look at the international market.
And this has been very favorable to reinsurer internationally. So, I think that puts us in a
favorable position overall on the program, but clearly, there will be some thinking some
adjustments on layers.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, for me, Paul, it's not very sensitive. Let's be very clear. At the top of the program,
there's a lot of capacity. There's a lot of option. There's a lot of people who want to
participate in our program. At the bottom of the program, it might get a little more
expensive, but our attachment points in relative terms is very, very low. So, for reinsurers
who might try to get better condition than they deserve, we can easily just not reinsure
the bottom of the program. So, it's not very sensitive. We have a bunch of options from a
negotiation point of view that we're prepared to act upon. And as such, we're excited
about the renewal season.
Your second point is about frequency versus severity of events. I think that, you folks
understand well natural disasters, what it means to products, pricing and so on. And there
is so much margin that we should pay to the reinsurer to avoid noise because I think if
investors understand the noise might as well keep the margin for us and explain it from
quarter to quarter. That being said, if there are opportunities and if there is capacity to
reorganize around frequency of lower event, we'll explore these as we have with the
aggregate cover last year, we thought there was a market opportunity.
So, for us, when it comes to reinsurance, everything is on the table. And we're looking
forward to the negotiation that is taking place these days.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks for that. And then, second question is related to growth and distribution
income. So, your guidance for 2016 was 10% or higher, we're running at 5% year-to-date,
so does that mean that there is something that hasn't transpired in terms of growth that
you would have thought was going to transpire at the beginning of the year or we're just
looking for really big Q4 result?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

And also you heard our guidance for the full year, just above CAD 110 million. We gave
10% guidance last year that will take us closer to CAD 115 million, and I would say, the
GAAP is really, the actual results of the year and how that impacts the proﬁtability of each
of the brokerages. With regards to 2017, when we actually plan the results for individual
brokers including past acquisitions, that's the rate of growth we're expecting to see next

Page 15 of 25



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

year. So, it's obviously improved proﬁtability next year and just absorbing past
acquisitions and the impact they will have on our results.

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, I think, Paul, it's important to keep in mind that the portion of the distribution
income is proﬁt sharing from the carrier that are represented in our distribution operation
and when the industry's performance diminish a little bit, the proﬁt sharing that a broker
gets and that some of the brokers where we're invested including BrokerLink which we
own, will diminish a bit and you've got probably a few million dollars below plan there.
That also means though that manufacturers like Intact Insurance would end up being less
proﬁt sharing, when the performance is less than what we have anticipated in part
because of natural disaster.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Understand, that's helpful. Thank you.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Right? Yes. And then, just with respect to the increase CAT load, help us understand how
that translates into pricing in personal property in particular and maybe some of your
commercial lines. Like presumably, if you're thinking of a higher CAT load, does that not
translate into increase in prices associated with these kind of property.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No, absolutely. And I think Tom, that's the point I was making a little bit earlier. I mean,
we're seeing the current accident year performance and home insurance improved by 8
points. Rates are up in the single-digit rate or -ish percent, and we will increase that in the
coming months across the land. And our view is that the ﬁrm market environment will
continue probably beyond 12 months in the home insurance, and so absolutely baked in
our thought process and in our plan. I mean, we wouldn't increase our view on CATs
without taking action on rates and product. That being said, I think the product right now
is geared to generate sub-95% in real bad times which is 2016 is an example, but we feel
the market.

Page 17 of 25



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2016-11-02

FINAL

As people come to the realization that natural disasters are more important than they
were, we feel the market oﬀers the opportunity to move on rates, and so we think that that
will be in a hard market environment for a good 12, 24 months there. To a lesser extent in
commercial lines, I would say because a big portion of the natural disasters home
insurance driven has had an impact in commercial lines but to a lesser extent.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

So, if we were to take up our CAT load in personal property, you anticipate that to the
underlying combined ratio, should -or the reported should still some – the underlying
combined ratio should adjust accordingly, and then we would sort of come back to the
same kind of reported combined ratio we would be thinking of prior to the increase in
CAT load, is that what you're sort of projecting (50:13)?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, I think that it ﬁts the – it's not a bad way to read this, Tom. Everybody has a view that
defer from one another which is good, but directionally speaking, our actions are very
consistent with what you've just described.

Good afternoon, Charles. One of your competitors, global competitors recently was

He was talking about the underwriting advantage that you could get from a broader
insurance model, and he was quoted as given example, he said if you're a pension
customer, you're 6% less likely to claim on your home insurance and they had algorithms
that can use that to their advantage. I'm just wondering your reaction to that or maybe

underwrite better.

Well, I think the – so, I'm not sure who you're referring to and that doesn't matter so much,
it's an interesting point, there's no doubt about that. I think that we observe – we establish
at Intact the expected proﬁt per customer with all the information we have on customers
including other product they have with us. And if I look at, the segmentation work that our
actuaries and data folks are involved in, and I stack the predictability of variable in order
of importance, I would say that having other products such as home insurance and
predicting car insurance is interesting, but far and less predictive than the sort of stuﬀ we
collect on telematics, for instance and so on.
So, I wouldn't deny that this has some value, but I think in the world of productiveness, I
would say other products would be low on the totem pole so to speak compared to other
rating variables. And as you might know, we're studying 2.5 billion kilometers driven from
that data we've collected from our customers in the past couple of years and observing 15
new raw data points, 30-ish derived data point, and the sort of stuﬀ we ﬁnd in there in
terms of risk selection is probably more powerful than anything we've worked on before.
So, my view is that with, additional data sources, big data in particular, that's where the
future is in terms of predictability, more so I think than the other products that one might
have. I'm sure that's some predictive value, but there's nothing like focus when it comes
to outperforming the market.

Yes, that's the future run rate for CATs. So, we have been indicating that our expectation

was there anything unusual happening in the quarter just with respect to premium, written

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, good observation, Brian. Alain, why don't you give our perspective?

FINAL

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

I would say, Brian, when it comes to commercial lines we'll always be cautious about the
number of risk because there's a lot of noise in going that and in this case, what we see
there is probably the biggest impact is on the sharing economy where we see
multimillion-dollar premium, but I think for the sharing economy in total we have about six
or seven unit. So I think that throws the number completely oﬀ and after that, the unit are
aﬀected by a near-cap (57:15) policy where we have a single vehicle and it can be CAD
600 or CAD 700 compared to the other side, multiple ﬂeet or where we have lots of
premiums, not as many units or anything, so I think the true exposure of what's happening
is really measuring the premium and this is how we compare to the market because the
unit considering the fact that the risks are far from being homogenous can be really
thrown up in either direction with a few little things.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

But I think in general, Brian, ﬂeets tend to skew big time the relationship between risks or
units and premiums from quarter-to-quarter.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Yes, and maybe as an add-on on the earn piece, all the volume that is coming from the
sharing economy is on a written earned basis because we basically are earning as we
write every usage based on every quarter. So there is a bit of disruption also going on
between the written and the earned coming from the sharing economy.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great and then, Charles, just a quick update. How the speciality growth is going right
now, commercial?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Specialty lines is doing very well. We've announced the creation of a new division in May
under the leadership of Joe D'Annunzio. We're making good progress on that front. The
combined ratio in that segment is solid. I'll ask Alain to give you a bit of perspective on
the growth of that division, but certainly making excellent progress there.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

There's a lot of lines of in business in the speciality lines, but the growth in the quarter is
about 9.2%. Again, a lot of that is driven by the sharing economy but we're seeing a very
good momentum there. I would say not only on the volume but also on the level of
expertise and people we attract where the objective was to grow our line of business and
grow our expertise, thank you very much. So, I think this is really moving in the right
direction. We have probably within that two lines where we're doing remediation. Like we
said, trucking is really undergoing a lot of corrective action and some large account in
one of our provinces are also undergoing action there and that's put a drag a bit under
growth, but at 9.2% in the quarter that's close to our target to reach CAD 1 billion in ﬁve
years.

Page 22 of 25



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

And on the combined ratio, results are very good, 80.2% so far in the quarter in 2016 and
85.5% for year-to-date. So results are really in line with where we want them to be.

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, so I think we're trying to grow that business sub-90s and this is a segment of the

not disrupt the market, on the other hand be much bigger in that market.

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, or afternoon. Charles, you went through a pretty comprehensive list of
pricing increases in personal auto and I expect you've done all the work you need to
satisfy yourself that you won't be giving much up from a market share perspective but
what have you done or is it safe to say that from a political perspective that there is a
political will for those price increases and that you satisﬁed yourself on that front as well?

So what we've talked about this morning, Mario, is what has been approved, as opposed
to some of the other actions we will take, and the issue right now is what has been
approved that's not yet rolled through the earnings, but it's in the system being written at
the moment. So, in relationship with what we've been talking about today, I'm very
comfortable.

Q - Mario C. Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

So I may have misinterpreted them? There was no comments about expectations of future
ﬁled for rate increases.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

None of the quantiﬁcation that we've talked about. I think we might have mentioned we
will potentially take more in the future, but what we've talked about in terms of concrete
actions is in the system.

Q - Mario C. Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

So the reference is – thank you for that. The reference is then to low single-digit or
perhaps mid-single digit improvements in the underlying claims ratio, those are doable
with the already approved rates increases, not future rate increases?

Okay, that's helpful.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

That's exactly right. I will say this ,Mario, though – look the product in automobile
insurance is a framework that the government provides. I mean the government designs
the products, they establishes the cap on minor injury and so on and they certainly have a
role to play. We're very active in all jurisdictions. The Ontario Government is certainly very
proactive as well on that front. The last front of reforms that they've ruled out were really
looking forward to see their impact in the coming period. I don't think one should assume
this will not get political though.
This might, but I think people are fairly proactive and where people are not proactive,
we're spending a lot of time with them to show how they can help themselves in the
exercise by modifying the product.

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Or year and half away from another election on Ontario, anyway, so this won't be topical
for some time I suspect. Let me just sort of drive onto another issue though, and this is
very speciﬁc and perhaps it's too granular. The reserve development in auto, you made
an important there that it's not what you wanted to be, is there any, can you point to
anything in Ontario AB or Accident Beneﬁt that may have aﬀected the reserve
development this quarter and may perhaps on a go-forward basis?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No.

Q - Mario C. Mendonca
