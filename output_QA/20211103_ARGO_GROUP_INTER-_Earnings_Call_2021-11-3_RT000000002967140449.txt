Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Good morning, and thank you for the introduction, Greg. Welcome to everyone on the
call. I'm happy to speak today about the strong results we reported. Our operating
earnings per share was $0.91 for the third quarter, despite elevated catastrophe losses
the industry experienced.
Argo annualized operating return on common equity was 7.3%. Our loss ratio improved
9.8 points to 64.0% for the third quarter, and reflects lower catastrophe losses, and an
improved underlying loss ratio, which is directly attributable to the strategic direction we
have implemented at Argo.

Bloomberg Transcript

We continue to make progress on reducing expenses, implementing our growth plan, and
the actions we are implementing are starting to come through in our financial
performance as we remain focused on pursuing profitable growth, improved underwriting
margins, reduced volatility, and disciplined expense management. I'm particularly proud of
the results achieved given the elevated catastrophe losses facing the insurance industry
this quarter.
Over the past year, we have highlighted our strategy to reduce the volatility of our
underwriting results and allocate capital to businesses with more stable returns. This was
evident in the most recent quarter as our efforts to reduce property catastrophe
exposure led to a significant improvement in our results.
We made the decision to exit our reinsurance operations in 2020 because we actively
adjusted our insurance business to significantly reduce volatility. Given the tougher
conditions, the reinsurance market has experienced recently, we are very happy with the
direction we have taken.
We continue to increase attachment points and reduced limits across multiple areas of
our portfolio. And our U.S. excess casualty portfolio during the first nine months of 2021,
the average attachment point is up 26%, while the limits are down 11% compared to the
same period in 2020.
Our D&O[ph] portfolio the average limits have continued to decrease as well. And over
the past two years commercial primary and excess limits have decreased by 45% and 11%,
respectively. Importantly, this leads to increased underwriting profitability, while at the
same time limiting volatility.
We continue to execute on our priority of becoming leading US focus specialty insurer.
This quarter, we executed on several transactions to exit underperforming or nonPage 2 of 16

strategic business, including the recent announcement to sell our Brazil operations Argo
Seguros, and we closed on the sale of our contract P&C business in October.
Now our business is comprised of three main platforms. Our US operations, which
represent 2/3 of our business, on a go-forward basis, followed by Syndicate 1200 and
Bermuda insurance. US specialty risks are regularly placed in the Lloyds market and
Bermuda. In these platforms, we are focused on US specialty risks, and we are targeting
business in which we have demonstrated our expertise.
Our Bermuda insurance business has an impressive long term track record, generating
underwriting profits in nine of the last ten years. And we have taken numerous actions in
Syndicate 1200 on the business to optimize this portfolio and are starting to see them
come through in our financial results.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the investment side, we reported very strong results, driven by a significant
contribution from our alternative investments portfolio. We adjusted our portfolio to
target asset allocations based on a study conducted at the end of last year. Our bond
portfolio is more heavily weighted to short durations due to the profile of our liabilities. A
portfolio with shorter duration for us of three years and eight plus credit quality, positions
Argo well in an inflationary environment. We also continue to hold allocations in equities
and alternatives.
In terms of underlying growth, our top-line in the quarter continued to reflect our focus on
growth areas. Overall, gross premium was down 1.6% in the quarter, the decrease in
gross written premiums is attributable to the businesses we are exiting, plan to exit or
have sold including sales of Ariel Re in November 2020, contract binding in October 202,
and businesses in Italy, Malta and the U.S. grocery business.
In the ongoing businesses, premiums grew approximately 17% during the third quarter of
2021 when compared to the third quarter of 2020. U.S. growth was 3.7% in the third
quarter of 2021. Premium growth continues to be driven by businesses we highlighted in
March as grow and invest businesses, and those include our Argo Pro, casualty,
construction, environmental, Inland Marine and Surety.
These businesses, which represent nearly 2/3 of our U.S. operations gross written
premium, were up approximately 20% in total during the quarter. And more importantly,
these businesses remain highly profitable with the combined ratios in the 80s and minimal
catastrophe losses. There was meaningful top line impact from our decisions to reduce
exposure and property and underperforming business units. On a year-to-date basis,
these actions have limited top-line growth by over $60 million, but have improved overall
profitability.
In the U.S., we continue to see solid rate increases in the mid-single digits on average.
This is a bit less than the increase we experienced over the last couple of quarters, but
we feel very good about the rates we're getting and direction of our margins. Our grow
and invest businesses outpaced the U.S. average increasing in the high-single digits range.

FINAL

Turning to international. Reported gross premiums were down about 10% in the third
quarter due to the impact of businesses we are exiting, plan to exit or have sold including
the sale of Ariel Re in November 2020, and the planned exits of businesses in Italy, and
Malta. And the ongoing businesses excluding the increased share of Syndicate 1200's
capacity, gross written premiums were up approximately 19%, primarily due to the higher
rates. Of this growth, rate increases and exposure from lines with attractive market
conditions each contributed approximately one half of that growth.
Pricing continue to be strong in the quarter with rate increases averaging 11% in
international and continue to remain broad-based. Over the past three years, cumulative
rate change for Syndicate 1200 has been 32%, and approximately 110% for Bermuda
insurance.
We believe these businesses are well positioned to continue to generate right favorable
underlying margins and market conditions remain attractive across most of our platform.
We will continue to deemphasize or take strategic actions in lines where we believe
market conditions are not attractive or where we do not have a competitive advantage.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now turning to expenses. We continue to make progress towards driving efficiency in our
operations. On a year-to-date basis, our non-acquisition expense ratio continues to
decrease and we are making meaningful progress in several areas.
We have reduced our real estate footprint as we've embraced a hybrid and flexible work
environment. Including the divested businesses our head count has decreased by 16% or
248 employees since July 2020. Additionally, we have consolidated, renegotiated or
eliminated a number of contracts with outside vendors with additional significant savings
to be realized going forward. We continue to target 36 expense ratio for the full-year
2022.
Overall, I'm very pleased with our results for the quarter and the progress we've been
able to make on our strategic objectives.
I will now turn the call over to Scott to discuss our results in more detail.

Scott Kirk

{BIO 18973074 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everybody. We reported strong earnings during
the third quarter of 2021, driven by reduced catastrophe losses and improved combined
ratio, and a strong contribution from alternative investments. The combination of these
factors resulting in operating earnings per diluted share of $0.91 and an annualized
operating return on common equity of 7.3%.
I'll turn first to our consolidated operating results. Gross written premiums decreased by
1.6% in the third quarter of 2021. However, allowing for the impact of previously
announced exits premiums are up approximately 17% during the third quarter of 2021.

FINAL

Now while reported grocery premiums decreased, net written and net earned premium
both grew approximately 9% per quarter. As we discussed previously, the key drivers of
the net premium growth are related to the sale of Ariel Re and our increased ownership
percentage in Syndicate 1200's capacity, we expect net premium growth to continue to
outpace the change in groceries and premium for the balance of this year.
The third quarter on year-to-date basis, our retention ratio calculated as net written
premiums divided by gross written premiums increased 7 points to $0.67 and 61%,
respectively. This was primarily result of the increased retention in our international
segment, resulting mainly from the sale of Ariel Re, where we retained very little of the
risk on a net basis and our increased participation in 1200 results. The U.S. segment also
contributed to the retention increase due to the ships and business mix towards focus
lines business where we retained more of the risk net.
In the third quarter of 2021, we reported a loss ratio of 64%, down nearly 10 points from
73.8% during the prior year period. The improvement reflected lower CAT losses and
improved ex-CAT current accidentally loss ratio. Our CAT losses totaled $27 million or just
under 6 points of the combined ratio on the third quarter 2021. Of which, $24 million
related to natural catastrophes and $3 million related to the impact from COVID.

Bloomberg Transcript

This result compares favorably to catastrophe losses of $71 million or 16 points on the
combined ratio on the prior-year quarter, which included $54 million related to natural
catastrophes and $17 million related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As Kevin mentioned, the successful implementation of our strategy to reduce property
tax related exposures has resulted in a significant reduction in our catastrophe losses,
despite elevated industry CAT losses during the quarter.
Unfavorable reserve development totaled $6 million in the third quarter of 2021, this was
driven by $7 million one-time accounting adjustment in our international segment. The
prior year quarter included $1.6 million of adverse reserve development.
The ex-CAT current accident year loss ratio came in at 57.1% in the third quarter, which
represents 30 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. The improvement
reflects the impact of continued rate increases as well as the benefits from our
reunderwriting actions.
Turning now to our expenses. Our expense ratio was 36.3% in the third quarter 2021, and
was flat compared to the prior quarter. Both our acquisition expense and general and
administrative expense ratio were in line with Q3 2020.
Importantly, however, this marks the third consecutive quarter of improvement in our
expense ratio, and our year-to-date expense ratio now stands at 37.3%. As we said
previously, the improvement in the expense ratio is not going to be linear and we remain
committed to the 36% expense ratio target in 2022.

FINAL

In the quarter, we also incurred $8 million in non-operating expenses mainly related to the
reduction in our real estate footprint, and we expect the benefits to begin to materialize
in expense ratio in 2022.
Turning now to our segment results, in U.S. gross written premiums were up 3.7%,
comparable slow quarter 2020. The growth in the period was driven by our grow and
invest businesses that include Argo Pro, Casualty, Construction, Environmental, Inland
Marine and Surety.
Now our gross written premiums increased just under that 4%. Net written premiums and
net earned premiums in the U.S. increased by 7% and 8% respectively versus the prior
year quarter. It's worth noting that after adjusting for the fronting business that we write in
the US, our retention ratio was 72% in quarter and 68% on a year-to-date basis.
The U.S. Segment reported underwriting income of $15 million, and our combined ratio of
95.4% in the third quarter of 2021. The loss ratio decreased 6 points to 63%, mainly driven
by reduction in catastrophe losses. The expense ratio of 32.4%, decreased 50 basis
points from the prior year quarter, and was driven by improvement in both the acquisition
ratio and the general and administrative expense ratio.

Bloomberg Transcript

Improvement in the acquisition ratio was primarily related to change in the business mix
and the improvement in the G&A ratio, which is due to the increase net earned premiums
and the execution of expense reduction initiatives.
Turning now to our international segment. Gross written premiums declined 10% in the
third quarter 2021, due to the previously announced business exits and the largest
decrease in property lines. This was partially offset by higher rates and increased
participation in 1200 capacity.
International net written premium and net earned premium increased by 13% and 12%,
respectively versus the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily driven by growth in
Syndicate 1200 due to changes in ceded insurance, rate increases achieved over the last
several quarters and our increased share of the Syndicate results. Partially offset we offset
by the impact of business exits, and $5 million of reinstatement premiums in the current
quarter. The reinstatement premiums are mainly related to the cat events that occurred in
the third quarter 2021. Our reinstatement premiums were $700,000 in the third quarter
2020.
International segment report an underwriting loss of just under $5 million in the third
quarter 2021, compared to an underwriting loss of $23 million in the prior year quarter.
The combined ratio decreased 13 percentage points to 102.8% in the third quarter of
2021. This decline primarily driven by the reduced catastrophe losses and continue
remediation efforts and rate increases earning through the results.
Current accident year ex-CAT loss ratio was 51.6%, which increased to 130 basis points
from the prior year quarter. The relative increase compared to last year was primarily

Page 6 of 16

FINAL

driven by the impact of reinstatement premiums on the denominator, net earned
premiums in the third quarter of 2021.
CAT losses during the third quarter of 2021 of $17 million or 11% -- 11 points of the
combined ratio, that compared to CAT losses of $45 million or 31 points of the combined
ratio in the prior year. Losses in the current year third quarter included natural catastrophe
losses generated mainly by Hurricane Ida, as well as a reduced level of losses related to
COVID-19.
The expense ratio of 39.5% increased 80 basis points from the prior quarter, driven by
the reinstatement premiums associated with the CAT losses in the quarter.
Moving onto investments. We reported net investment income of $46 million in the
quarter. The result included $24 million of income from alternative investments, principally
mark-to-market gains on our private equity and hedge fund investments.

Bloomberg Transcript

Although, we are certainly pleased with this result we're recognized of the
outperformance of alternative investments from the last quarter -- last five quarters may
not continue for an extended period and could revert back to long-term historical loans.
Net investment income for the remainder of our portfolio was $22 million in the quarter,
which was down 3.5% from the prior-year quarter. This decline reflects the derisking
actions over the last two years, as well as the lower overall yields available in the market.
Our book value per share was $50.01 as of September 30, and this was flat including
dividends compared to the second quarter of 2021.
Now finally let me talk about capital. On our second quarter call, we mentioned that our
required funds with Lloyd's position was in the range of GBP300 to GBP350 million at the
end of 2020. This figure has decreased to around GBP290 million. Let me say that again,
this figure has decreased to around GBP290 million at the end of the third quarter, due to
a combination of improved results in our international segment and reduced funding
requirements for Syndicates 1910. A little under half of this is provided by Argo Re.
And we continually monitor our capital levels, determine whether to put it to work in the
attractive opportunities to see in the marketplace, and against what we need from our
regulatory and rating agency perspective. As we've said in the past and it holds true now,
if we have excess capital after meeting these requirements we will look to return this to
shareholders.
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. And we're now ready to take questions.

Hi. Thanks. Good morning.

Good morning.

Q - Matthew Carletti

{BIO 5249827 <GO>}

Kevin, I just have -- I just had a high level question for you, back in March I guess on
Investor Day. It sounded like you largely had the team on the field, if you will, in terms of
the business going forward. I think there was -- there could be some nips and tucks
around the edges but the big pieces were in place.
Since then, obviously, Brazil is sold or you guys haven't said anything, it's been widely
reported in the press that Syndicate 1200 is going through a sale -- has been put up for
sale. Did -- is my interpretation from the Investor Day, right, do you have the big pieces on
the field that you want or are there potentially still big moves to be made? Just trying to
get a picture of kind of what our goal is going to look like going forward at this point.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yes. That's a -- thanks, Matt. At our Investor Day -- this is a good time to update it. That's
part of the reason we put the supplement out for some updates on what is remaining
because there's been so many pieces that moved around. So as I mentioned in my
remarks, we are in three places now, effectively. We're in the U.S., we are in Bermuda, and
we're in Syndicate 1200. I'm not going to comment on the market rumors because we
don't do that.
But the point of having the supplement information was to give everybody a sense of
what the underlying remaining ongoing businesses look like in there, and what the
performance has been on those because we've spent a lot of time working through
things and we believe that the potential for continued good results out of what we are
down to is in line with our returns. And I would suggest that we are in a position where
every business where we remain in is in no different position than the others have been.
Or since I was running the US, all the U.S. businesses have been if there's an opportunity
to make a profit and have some good opportunities for growth given environmental
outlook and how we're performing and what our resources are will do so, and the
business leaders understand that.
So I think it was time to help clear out the noise. Now there's going to still be some noise
in the results of these things we've recently gotten out of, but this gives you a sense of
what it looks like. So hopefully that helps.

Yeah. And I think I appreciate you can't comment on rumors, but would it be safe that I'm
hearing you right that at least as it stands today, Lloyd's Syndicate 1200 is, you consider an
ongoing business?

FINAL

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Absolutely. Yeah. I mean that's why -- look if you go to the supplement and look at Page 5
on the pro formas, what's left in there is actually good and we still have some things that
we're moving out of and we're still getting rate. So, like I said, it's all about capital and
opportunities and the U.S. businesses that haven't made it and there's been a lot of -we've pushed out almost $1 billion over the last 10 years in businesses that didn't work out
for one reason or another and still continue to grow it.
So those things are going to apply a line of business and we very recently announced in
the Syndicate that we're getting out of the North American binders business and the
property business. So those will have a significant impact on volatility as we go forward.

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

Yeah. Thanks. Alex. It's Scott here. Look that was a result of remediation efforts that have
been undertaken through the first nine months of the year. There's really nothing more to
say other than that.

FINAL

Q - Alex Blostein

{BIO 15412167 <GO>}

Okay. And then maybe going back to the investor presentation, you set out ceded
reinsurance ratio targets. I think about 63% in the U.S., 57% in international. I guess, you
still seeking those targets or the targets moved at all?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yeah. So they're not actually targets, those are actual numbers and that's why we put
them out there. And what we're intending to show is that it's on a trend upwards and will
continue that way based on some reduction and exposures. But more importantly, the
reduction in the volatility lines, which are heavily property weighted and had sort of an
outsized share of reinsurance relative to what's remaining.

Q - Alex Blostein

{BIO 15412167 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then lastly, maybe just can you touch on maybe your confidence of the
right environment, maybe into 2022.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yes. Sure. We are seeing rate that is consistent with what we're hearing from our
competitors and brokers in the lines we participated, right? We're sort of solidly there or
right in the middle of the pack, in some instances, we may be a little above a little bit low.
But there are areas where -- it's certainly not as strong as it was in the previous year, but
it's still good and it's still above what we've experienced for lost cost increases and what
we are hearing others talk about in terms of the increases for a lost cost. So the fact that
inflation is on the horizon. The competitive environment is still pretty strong. I think, we're
going to continue to see rates moving up in certain lines are going to drive it heavily, but
it'll -- there's -- we're not looking at or expecting an abatement right now.

Q - Alex Blostein

{BIO 15412167 <GO>}

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yeah, good morning, Casey.

FINAL

Q - Casey Alexander

{BIO 1521572 <GO>}

Yeah. My first question kind of relates to clearly, successfully you took down the property
and or wind exposure and it resulted in a much better outcome this quarter. Are you kind
of satisfied where you are? Or is it the sort of underwriting strategy and structural
strategy to take that wind exposure down, even more, when we get to the catastrophe
season in 2022?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yeah, really good question. We are both satisfied and continuing to move forward, right,
to answer it very specifically. So we had anticipated that we would reduce the exposures
over the course of the year and over the course of a year and a half and we managed to
get there faster than we hope partly just through driving ourselves out of some of these
lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

And so, we're not surprised where we ended up based on what we talked about in June,
but the actions I just talked about earlier today, including things like not going forward in
the North American binder business, not writing DNF book for U.S. lines out of Syndicate
1200, the sale of the contract finding book and a continued reduction in our property
exposure across the board.
What's happening is we're focusing on what we're good at and we're really good at
casualty lines. And so we're putting all our resources there. And so, the expectation is that
there would be a continuation of exposure reduction. What that means to the net, really
depends on what reinsurance program we can buy going forward. But it's -- we are happy
with the direction we're going in and we're continuing to work on it.

Q - Casey Alexander

{BIO 1521572 <GO>}

Okay. Got it. Thank you. Secondly, I hate to get too far a field, but we're getting near the
end of 2021. So from a modeling perspective, we, unfortunately, have to start thinking
about 2023. So would you expect the downward trend in the expense ratio to continue in
2023 and would that come primarily from expected earned premium growth or from
continued expense actions?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

So we tried to give some color on the expenses for so far, right. And I think the key one is
that we've reduced the overall headcount of the organization by 16%. And what we've
said before was that, look, this is going to -- as we get out of different things and places,
we need less of the infrastructure to support, right? Or we have winds that are not
performing well.
So that will continue as we continue to take actions that move us out of some of the
things that are still underway or they get finalized. So there's an element of that. But at
Page 11 of 16



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2021-11-03

FINAL

the same time, we're putting a lot of resource into growing the businesses that make a
lot of sense. So on the headcount side, I think we've really done a lot and will continue to
manage that well.
Relative to outside services, we -- because of the consolidation of the organization, we
were able to get rid of multiple contracts or things that were duplicative and that had
significant savings. And then, we'll have some continued effort on the real estate side as
we move forward and continue to work in the post-pandemic environment. So, we'll
continue to do that.
We're not just going to sit back and hope it all happens through earned premium growth.
There will be an impact from that, but the targets of eliminating things that are
unprofitable, redundant, or unnecessary will absolutely continue to be a cultural hallmark.
And I think it bodes well for us as we translate that into some of the real-life experiences
that were -- everyone's dealing with the great resignation and with some of the
employment inflation that's going on. So I think all of those things factor into it, and with
the mix of business we're going to see an uptick most likely in our acquisition costs
because of the lines we got out of and that will have an impact to. But again, it's
something we'll watch very closely and stay after.

{BIO 1521572 <GO>}

Okay. I have two more questions for you. And I think these are questions that are
confronting a lot of organizations these days. My first question is, how do you have to
manage differently in order to create a culture in an environment where a lot of your
employees are not on site? I'll bring that first question out. I mean, it's just a difficult issue.
I'm curious what your thoughts are.

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yeah, it's a difficult and great issue to talk about. So there's two pieces to this. For the
folks who have been around a while and work together, it's really not that hard. It's -people go through personal issues at times, but it's -- for those of us who have worked
closely together for a while, it's not that difficult, but we have a lot of new employees,
right. And someone -- we've got people who've joined and never met anybody or we've
got people who have joined and had limited interaction.
So, we're taking an approach based on businesses or regions of trying to find a way to
connect people, whether it's through Zoom meetings, whether it's through some kind of
fun event that people can do -- or whether it's actually getting together if that's possible
and all three of those things have happened.
It's imperfect, but we're looking to what others are doing, what outside resources are
there and there's a lot of communication going on. So, the business is going in the right
direction, but it's something that we watch and work on every day. The re-emergence of
the off-site pot luck. I think is where we're going to end. There are some pretty creative
stuff people are doing.

Q - Casey Alexander

{BIO 1521572 <GO>}

Here is my last question. I think that investors really appreciate the strategic streamlining
and the much tighter focus of the business effort, and whatever you can do to continue
that and even tight-knit further, I think investors really like it but is there a piece that's
missing, is there something that you would add here that you don't have that you think
could be highly accretive or strategically important. And I think it would be helpful to
communicate that just so that it didn't catch investors by surprise and feel like a strategic
change.

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Okay. No, that's a good point, that's while taking. Let me just start to answer that question
by saying that, the feel of the business and the leaders that are left running what we have
is better than I've ever seen, right. And on the international side, we've got people that
are clear on what their direction is, and they're excited about it, and they know what lanes
are in, and they're the ones who have been doing the business, that's been the
underlying piece, that's been successful or they remediated it. So they feel good.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the U.S. side, our last operating review. I have never been to one that was as good,
focused, solid with opportunities, optimism happy about where we are in the marketplace
and how it's working with our technology. So I walked away from that meeting feeling
great and that translates into where our U.S. specialty care is. So there's some number of
specialty lines we are not in.
And I have a group of executives dedicated to research on some lines that some of us
have hands-on experience at multiple companies and know the market, and it's getting to
the point in some of these areas where we can find people with the right fit culturally, who
understand what we're about from an underwriting standpoint and exposure standpoint
and have the right market contacts. And so you may see in the future us entering a few
areas that we haven't been in or haven't been in for a while.

Q - Casey Alexander

All right. Well, I'm way over my quota for asking questions. So, I'll stop there. But thank you
for taking my questions. I appreciate.

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yeah. We appreciate your interest. Thanks.

Hey. Good morning, Ron.

FINAL

Q - Ronald Bobman

{BIO 17308423 <GO>}

I have a question about, hi, you gave us I think again sort of specificity on the expense
ratio estimate for next year '22, and I recognized an estimate or guidance for a loss ratio
is far more complicated, particularly with the mix changes. And of course, sort of the
changing loss environment, which no one ever knows. But how long are trying to maybe
you plan on giving us greater specificity at some point between now and the start of next
year.
So maybe you could sort of let us know, maybe is there any intention to provide some
loss ratio guidance for next year? But maybe separate and apart how long will these mix
changes and the exits of certain geographies and or markets or lines or books of
business be sort of a friction or a drag on the loss ratio and combined ratio. And I know
you've laid out sort of what the underlying combines are on the go-forward mix. But that's
really what I'm getting, can you help there, please.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yes. So we have traditionally not giving guidance, however, the last two years in the fourth
quarter call we have given some sort of direction about where we thought the business
would go on a combined basis. So while we haven't given the expense -- I'm sorry, the
loss ratio, specifically, we'll probably going to do the same thing and since we have been
pretty candid about what that expense ratio is. The loss ratio is pretty easy to define. So
it's pretty mature right now to talk about what that would be, but I think your point about
before the end of the year, we try to find the way, if we can do it that early, we will, if not,
we will do it when we did -- when we do the fourth-quarter call.
But secondarily, and more importantly, your point about what I'll refer to as noise that is
going to continue to come. We will do our best to quantify that and it was really hard last
year, just given us the magnitude of different moving parts and you got to see what
happened based on our nets being almost between 50 million and 60 million for CAT. It's
the early part of the year and then dropping down to where they are now.
So in between, I know some people were frustrated because we couldn't tell them
exactly what it was because it was moving. But I think the numbers that we have are a bit
more discreet, will try to do our best about timelines on certain things. It's a good request
and we'll work on that for you because that noise is complicated.

Q - Ronald Bobman

{BIO 17308423 <GO>}

Yeah, understood. Understood. Moving a field, the contribution in the quarter the
underwriting contribution from a profit or loss. How Syndicate 1200 and how did Argo
Bermuda contribute to either operating income or underwriting profits in the third quarter
or year to date. Separately, not lump together as international.

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yeah. We haven't broken that out. And I don't really want to set a precedent here, but on
the international lines from an operating income, you can see on the release it was 7.4
million.

Q - Ronald Bobman

{BIO 17308423 <GO>}

So in the past, you've commented on 1200 underwriting profitability. How did that do in
the quarter?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Scott, do you have the final number there?

A - Scott Kirk

{BIO 18973074 <GO>}

Ron, could you run the question by me again? What we looking for exactly?

Q - Ronald Bobman

{BIO 17308423 <GO>}

Was 1200 from an underwriting perspective profitable in the quarter?

A - Scott Kirk

{BIO 18973074 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Look, you can see that the contribution overall was not huge. So we're in and around a
break-even or thereabouts.

Q - Ronald Bobman

{BIO 17308423 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

A - Scott Kirk

{BIO 18973074 <GO>}

I can't be any more specific than that, because I don't want to --

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

But as a reminder, we didn't announce we're getting out of North American binders and
the D&F business, which was impacted by either. So those are -- I'm just pointing out
facts, I'm not trying to make excuses for it, right. We're focusing on what's the underlying
business going forward.

Q - Ronald Bobman

{BIO 17308423 <GO>}

Okay, I'm not sure. Okay, I can ask offline. Actually want, I fully understand my last
comment. Thank you.

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Okay, thanks.
