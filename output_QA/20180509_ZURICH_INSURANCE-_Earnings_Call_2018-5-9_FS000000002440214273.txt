MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Welcome to the Zurich Insurance Group First
Quarter Results 2018 Conference Call. I am Sarah, the Chorus Call operator. I would like to
remind you that all participants will be in listen-only mode, and the conference is being
recorded. After the presentation, there will be a Q&A session. The conference must not
be recorded for publication or broadcast.
At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Mr. Richard Burden, Head of Investor

{BIO 1809244 <GO>}

Good morning, good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to Zurich Insurance Group's
ﬁrst quarter 2018 Q&A call. On the call today is our Group CFO, George Quinn. We have
an hour time today, so can I remind you to keep your questions to two in the ﬁrst go
round, and if we have time at the end, we'll come back to you with additional questions
once everybody has had an opportunity.
Before we start with the Q&A, George will just make a few introductory remarks to the
quarter. George?

FINAL

Thanks, Richard, and good morning and good afternoon to all of you. So a few initial
remarks. The ﬁrst just as a reminder that the – as you know from last year, the focus for the
ﬁrst and third quarter is on revenue trends with some qualitative commentary on the
performance of the business, and of course, you'll see the customary and full earnings
detail when we have the half year.
Over the ﬁrst quarter, we made a good start to the year, and probably more importantly
we've continued to make good progress towards the targets that you are all familiar with.
We've also continued to strengthen the business through targeted transactions that builds
on already solid foundation, particularly as you've seen in the ﬁrst quarter in Latin
America.

Bloomberg Transcript

P&C pricing trends continued to improve in North America over the ﬁrst quarter, but as
we highlighted at the time of the full year results back in February, we continued to focus
on improving underwriting proﬁtability over volume. And rates in some areas of the
portfolio is still not suﬃcient. The quarter has seen a number of knockout events around
the world. However, I want to conﬁrm that overall knockout levels for the ﬁrst quarter are
only very slightly above historical levels.
Life business continued to deliver on our strategy of focusing on capital light and
protection business. And this is continuing to support good growth, which aims to return –
to balance return on capital, cash generation, new business margins, which have all
remained on attractive level. Farmers continued to deliver steady performance. But I think
what stands out in the quarter is the improvements in underlying customer metrics and
the performance of the Farmers Exchanges. And this shows up in both improved
retention and growth in both new business and policy gains over the course of the
quarter.
Combined with the further improvement in the underwriting performance of surplus of
the Exchanges, these plans should be supportive of future growth in the business. The
quarter also conﬁrms the very strong cash positions that we have on our Z-ECM ratio. It's
improved to 133% providing us with continued capital ﬂexibility.
As you'd imagine, we continue to review the capital levels of our business in light of
growth opportunities and the macro outlook. However, the near-term key focus remains
on delivering on our dividend policy and on growing the dividend over the plan period.
I'll now be happy to turn to Q&A.

Q&A
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The ﬁrst question is from Peter Eliot
from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you very much. My ﬁrst question is on the agreement you've reached with Uber. I
guess you're one of a number of insurers that are talking about agreements with Uber in
diﬀerent regions. And I mean, just purely playing devil's advocate for a second, I mean, I
guess, my starting assumption would be that Uber probably has the bargaining power in
these agreements.
I'm just wondering, as the world moves from sort of smaller ticket business to larger ticket
business, does that shift the value towards the customer rather than the insurer? Say just
playing, devil's advocate, but I'd be interested in your thoughts on that sort of trend.
And then the second question, I was wondering if you could just run us through the
operating assumption changes that you made in the Life business. Thank you very much.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks Peter. So on the ﬁrst one, important to say, ﬁrst of all, that the Uber contract or
contracts are with the Farmers Exchanges and not with the Zurich Group. Obviously the
point is valid nonetheless. So I think the – I mean, as the world potentially shifts and we
see more of ride share and eventually I guess shared or eventually fully autonomous
vehicles, I think we all have an expectation that the insurance purchasing that goes with
that will shift over time. We suggest that really change the fundamental dynamics
between who has more inﬂuence over the outcomes.
I mean, it's not – I don't think it does. I think the biggest driver of, I think, what happens in
terms of – I mean the entire contracting process is it's a normal economic demand and
supply topic, isn't it. So where you have excess capacity, I guess the rates on oﬀer and the
types of conditions will be more conducive for the buyer and then vice versa.
So I'm not convinced that with the changes that we see or the changes that we potentially
see in the way the market operates, the fundamental laws of economics are fundamentally
altered by that process. I mean, the one beneﬁt it clearly does create for the buyer is of
course for a much larger entity in the same way that if you're a much larger insurance
company, I mean, your tolerance for risk could be diﬀerent and that will impact obviously
the need for coverage in the ﬁrst place.
On the operating assumption changes in the quarter, I mean there's a number of, I mean,
relatively small things. I mean we've got – I think we have no numbers that are above the
single-digit level. So we've got some minor changes to expenses and minor changes to
lapse, but there's nothing in the quarter that particularly stands out what I would view as
indicative of something you can expect to see in the remainder of the year. I viewed the
changes in the operating assumptions is a better randomness in the ﬁrst quarter.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Yeah. Great. Thanks so much. And it is probably obvious by my ﬁrst question but I guess
what I was referring to was fewer customers controlling more of the market and possibly

Page 3 of 18

does alter the supply demand economics slightly, but I'm sure you've covered that. But
thank you.

Thank you.

Operator
The next question is from Michael Huttner from JPMorgan. Please ahead.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Oh, thank you. And also on the Farmers, I wonder if you can – you talked about supportive
of growth and also the policy count and new business and I just wanted if you could give
a little bit more insight into these things.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then the other thing, I was actually – I didn't see it at ﬁrst and when I saw it I thought,
oh no, this is not nice. And at Farmers you've got a $200-million reduction in gross written
premiums and I understand this is the independent agent business, which you're deemphasizing and there's still a lot more that you could de-emphasize. In other words, the
fees at Farmers could really decline substantially if you give all this business away. And I
just wanted to hear if the interest, the incentive for shareholders are fully aligned. It
doesn't at ﬁrst glance, I would say, the answer is no but maybe I'm completely wrong.
Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you, Michael. So on the ﬁrst topic, so – I mean a bit more insight into the top line. I
mean, if you look at the headline numbers, I mean, very strong growth in GWP. I mean
both on an absolute and on a continuing operations perspective, continuing operations
up 6%. Obviously, the Uber contracts that I was just discussing with Peter, they are very
late in the quarter, so it won't have an immediate impact on hand (09:15). I mean an
almost immaterial impact on fees for Q1.
But the other dynamic you see in the Farmers business over the course of the last couple
of years is, I mean, there's a part of the business which have been in run-oﬀ for in 21st
Century. That is obviously something that has reduced the reported headline growth
number. We expect and the Exchanges expect through the course of this year that
process of run-oﬀ will be complete. And therefore, by the end of the year, we should be
away from this concept of continuing versus the headline number.
On the business insurance sold through independent agents, I mean you are absolutely
right. The Exchange has taken the decision in the quarter to dispose of that via a renewal
rates transaction with Hartford. I mean obviously that does reduce premium volume, it
does have an impact on the fee that's paid. I mean, ﬁrst of all, it's a decision that the
Exchange makes rather than the one that we make. But to be honest, I think if any of us
were looking at that portfolio of business, it'd be hard to reach the same conclusions that

Page 4 of 18

FINAL

the Exchanges have reached. And, therefore, I think – I mean they are acting as you would
expect them to act.
I think the most important issue – this issue that you raise around – I mean what the risks
that we see more there. So two things, and I think if you look back or you've been on
these calls over a longer period and you've listened to the conversations that we've had, I
mean that particular portfolio has been a challenge for a relatively long period of time. So
I think that we end up in this position is probably not a huge shock to people.
And then if you go back to the presentation that Jeﬀ and the Farmers team gave at the
Investor Day in December or November rather, and you look at what we're seeing
elsewhere in terms of growth in the Exchange, I mean we have no signiﬁcant concern that:
one, we're not aligned: or two, that the Exchange has its right to dispose of lost parts of its
business and portfolio. I mean the Exchange is looking for growth. And they are trying to
ﬁnd a way to make sure that they can ﬁnd new folks at the market, whether it's the thing
we just discussed around Uber; whether it's the eastern expansion that you saw in the
press release today, they got signiﬁcant growth there; or whether it's just using the
distribution power that they currently have.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I think from a shareholder perspective and I think the most important factors from
today's release are – I mean, the customer metrics are obviously extremely important.
Policy count is a very strong indicator of where the business is headed. And all of that
combined with, I mean, Farmers continuing to drive rates, I think is actually a very positive
sign for the future. And on this particular topic, they are acting, I think, as almost any of us
would.

The next question is from James Shuck from Citi. Please go ahead.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, George. I'd like two questions. Firstly, on Farmers and the
Uber deal again. I guess this is the ﬁrst time really we're seeing Farmers grow outside of
tied agents and then start to come around maybe direct. My question is really kind of how
that aﬀects the FMS business model over time?
I think you mentioned that the margin will come down because the level of services is
being reduced. So if you could just explain the dynamics a little bit about all the services
that you provide kind of to the tied agent and how that will evolve through a partnership
type model, particularly given that's where a lot of growth might be expected to come
from over the medium term.

FINAL

Secondly, on the Zurich Americas statements, just kind of ﬁrst time to ask you questions
on this, but I was just looking at the reserve releases by line of business. And we've seen
big releases on workers' compensation, particularly in the kind of 2014 to 2016 years and
relatively good conditions on commercial multi-peril and other liability lines. If could you
just comment on those that would be helpful, please?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Great. So thank you, James. So on the ﬁrst one – so the Uber deal is – I mean it's quite
diﬀerent from what happens with the tied agents, or the Exchanges, or Farmers. If you buy
a policy through an agent – a tied agent at Farmers, you buy also a home, it's like the type
of product that you and I would recognize. So you pay a premium, you cover for all the
risks that the policy provides protection for. And if you have a claim, the claim gets paid.

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean on the Uber transaction, I mean, it's a commercial rideshare contract that covers
particular part of the risk and, I mean, it has characteristics of the claims handling
agreements in the end. So it's really quite diﬀerent from I think what you see within the
normal Farmers distribution channel. So I don't think it has a direct impact on the tied
agent, I mean, we could debate. I mean, if you have a much longer time horizon, so if
you're thinking 10, 20 years from now, I mean, what impact can this have. We're back to
that strategic question around impact of gig economy, impact of shared or fully
autonomous vehicles.
But for the time being, I mean, the way that we are inclined to view this and the way I think
the Farmers tend to view this is that this is then taking advantage of a core competence
that they have, a scale that they have to support, I mean, what is an interesting customer
segment that is not currently covered by Farmers through the tied agents channel.
On the Zurich America, instead of saying – I guess we talked at length at various times at
worker's comp on this call and I guess point more often in the sense of some of the
concerns that people have had, I mean we've given group disclosure and you have access
to the Yellow Books in the U.S., which you've obviously used. I mean we've been pretty
positive on workers comp over the course of the last few years.
We've seen good performance from the book and that's reﬂected in the reserve releases
that you've seen recorded in the ﬁnancial statements and in fact that also ﬂows through,
as you can imagine, into the reserve development group and is published, and as a sign
of a couple of things. One is that the – I mean for the recent years have been a period of, I
mean, relatively strong proﬁtability in workers comp, combine that with I mean relatively
modest inﬂation, all of those things tend to drive these outcomes.
I mean, if you look across the Zurich American book, I mean we've seen relatively strong
reserve release across the entire portfolio. And then you mentioned two of the more
obvious lines, I mean there are some areas we've added because Zurich America has
been one of the most signiﬁcant contributors to the group's reported PYD of 1% to 2%
regularly over the course of the last couple of years. And in fact, I mean given what we see
coming, I expect that to continue. So, we are very happy with what we're seeing, but it

Page 6 of 18



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG

really looks like a combination of a relatively positive period in pricing and a relatively
benign period for claims.

FINAL

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

I guess if I can just quickly follow up on the workers comp releases. So, I mean, is it
something that's coming through from the market as a whole, because it seems like rate
increases are stalling a bit on workers comp. And I guess I'm just wondering there's such
a high level of releases coming on that line. I think you're reporting combined ratios in the
region of 60%, is that in common with the market, do you think rate is going to stick in
that line of business?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think when you look around the rest of the market, the – I mean you see a variety of
diﬀerent positions. I think – and both from a perspective of the initial loss pick which can
diﬀer signiﬁcantly from company to company and from the actual experience therefore on
PYD. I mean, it's hard for me to comment on, I mean, how the peers see the market, but I
mean we've been very pleased with the performance.
I think you're right on the current price trend. So, I mean as we look back, I think you
would be a bit complacent if you were to extrapolate this into the future. So, on the
pricing thing I mean we looked at it carefully, we've talked at length either on these calls
or the Investor Day on mix and the importance of that to us. And in fact some of the
commentary around premium volume in the press release this morning. So, you saw this
remark that maybe we have growth in APAC, and Latin America, generally we've seen a
reduction across North America, especially around commercial. Part of that is driven by us
trying to move the workers comp book away from the more inﬂation exposed product
and into the less inﬂation exposed product as we try and position the book to some of the
risks that will almost certainly emerge in the future. But, happy with what we've seen in the
past, but we should be cautious about how this line develops in the future.

The next question is from Arjan Van Veen from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

Thanks. George, can you just comment brieﬂy on the minus 2% reduction in EMEA, which
we also saw in 2017 just where some of the pressure points are coming from or is it like in
the U.S. a bit more mix shift?
And the second question was on the margin in the Life portfolio. Last year you had very
strong growth in new business values, it's minus 1% in the ﬁrst quarter. So, I was just

Page 7 of 18



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2018-05-09

wondering whether there's a bit of seasonality there and what we can look for in the full
year.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Great. So, on the EMEA topic, so if you look around the European business, we have
growth in Switzerland, particularly in commercial, and maybe (19:34) weakness than in the
UK and in Germany. I think nothing particularly stands out for me, I mean there are – there
is a need for example in the same way that we're tackling commercial auto and the
weakness to that tends to produce in the U.S. We have some of those issues in Europe too
on commercial auto and you can extend some of the action we're taking in the U.S. on a
smaller scale and to some of the things see happening in Europe. But in general, UK and
Germany are the drivers of the reduction. Switzerland is slightly up.
On the Life portfolio, it's not really seasonality, so what you see in this quarter and you see
pretty healthy growth on APE, but as you mentioned, I mean our new business value, if
you adjust for foreign exchange and the impact of last year's disposal of the corporate
savings business in the UK. I mean, we're in this 25.1% margin level.

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean, the reason you see the slight drop in Q1 is really a mix of business, that's actually
deliberate rather than accidental and it's driven by two areas. So one in the UK, we've
grown in that, particularly because of corporate protection, which certainly drives volumes
but has a relatively low margin, I mean that can come or go depending on client demand
in a particular quarter.
And the other thing we've done this quarter, which is something we have done before,
and we've grown the planes de ahorro business in Spain with Banco Sabadell, our joint
venture partner there. That's a savings product. It's spread supported. So it typically has – I
mean very little, sometimes negative new business values. The reason for doing that kind
of business is that there is an ROE optimization that we can achieve through rating some
of it. So I mean we have set an appetite for that business with a certain capacity to do it in
Q1 and we certainly had a partner, who could sell it. So that's what you've seen, it's not a
seasonal issue, it's really – at least partly opportunistic.

The next question is from Farooq Hanif from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi there. Firstly, going back to – shifting away from kind of inﬂation exposure in the U.S.,
but when you look at the price increases that you're getting, does that mean the risk of
that will be oﬀset in the future when inﬂation has gone down materially, could you
comment on that?

Page 8 of 18



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2018-05-09

And secondly, going back to the Life margin, I just want to understand this point about
optimizing between margin, ROE and earnings. Does that mean – I mean you are basing –
your answer just gave it to Arjan. So that means that actually the earnings on this business
that you're writing are going to be better than the margin suggests? Thanks.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Great, Farooq. So on the ﬁrst one, it'd be (22:49) to claim that on the basis of what's
happened in Q1 that we've really shifted the inﬂation proﬁle materially. I think as you know
from prior conversations and generally from the Investor Day that we had back in
November, we're looking at a number – or we have looked at a number of diﬀerent levers
to move the portfolio mix and those levers available to us include reinsurance.

Bloomberg Transcript

The challenge on the reinsurance side is that's a relatively eﬀective way to address
inﬂation exposure on the prospective liability risks. Doesn't do so much for the in-force
and there's also a very limited appetite in the regions market for the workers comp
exposure. So some of the things we've done will certainly have moved it in the right
direction, whether that's the use of reinsurance or whether it's some of the product shift
that we try to execute within Q1.
But as I mentioned earlier, we still need to tackle some of the issues around the products
that carry the most signiﬁcant inﬂation exposure, and that's workers comp. And we try to
shift clients away from the products that carry the most would certainly help. I mean
ultimately though I think given the way that inﬂation expectations develop, I mean lately
over time that portfolio for us will be a bit smaller in the long run than it is today. And that
shows the most eﬀective way and the most cost-eﬀective way to address inﬂation
exposure.
On the life margin, that question, and earnings that – I mean just to be very transparent
about when the product works. If you look at it on a – I mean if we sell our spreadsupported product, which is not so common in our portfolio, I mean if we do that because
the economic system that we apply has no liquidity premium within it, I mean that type of
business will typically produce either very low or potentially negative new business values
or issuance.
On the assumption that over the life of the product, and the products are typically pretty
short-term, let's say the spread adjustment that you would make from a risk perspective is
not required because you don't see the levels of defaults that might be anticipated. That
will produce a higher ROE than you would see otherwise. Now, the ROE is clearly now risk
adjusted. I mean we try and look at all of the diﬀerent metrics to try and optimize
earnings. In the end though, from a group perspective, this impact is really small. So, I
mean, I wouldn't spend too much time worrying about it.

Q - Farooq Hanif

FINAL

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, guys. Look, there's obviously been a focus on proﬁtability of certain
business lines in your North American business for a number of years now, but I guess
how many more years are we likely to see this restructuring taking place? I know that
there're issues with workers comp and trying to move the portfolio, but obviously you've
been doing this for a number of years now. So when are we going to see that
restructuring sort of ease?
And the second question is just bit more of a cheeky question. I guess one of your peers
described the possibilities of a merger of equals, how would you view these within the
context of possibilities at Zurich? Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. Where am I going to start now? Let's do the proﬁtability question ﬁrst, while
my brain thinks about the answer to the second one. This might seem a bit odd, but I
don't think we're in an abnormal period in what's happening in the U.S. business. So I
mean obviously it's our aim in all of our businesses to grow them over time. I think if you
look at the entire commercial market in the U.S., I mean it clearly faces some challenges,
certainly if you look at a more granular level, say, line of business.
So I mean the need to tackle that is not a surprise, I think, actually to many people. I mean
as the market turns and as we see more momentum on pricing, I'd expect that business to
grow again. But I mean we wanted the business to maintain a focus on proﬁtability at all
times. This is the most important driver of success for the ﬁrm. I mean hopefully it's not
always necessary to make such adjustments as you've seen in Q1, but I mean there's
nothing going on that feels like a major turnaround situation. I think what we see the
business do is make, I mean, reasonable choices with capital allocation, which is what we
want them to do.
So I can't tell you when the business will grow, but it will grow when the opportunity to
grow more proﬁtable is there; and hopefully that's not far away. I mean on the pricing, the
rate topic, just to maybe broaden the issue a second. I mean you've seen the commentary
already today in the press release around rate for Q1, sequentially that's stronger than Q4
last year. Initial indications are that Q2 will be sequentially stronger again. And, in fact, in
discussion with the U.S. team, I mean they have some – and it's not just optimism, the
foundation for their expectation which is that trend will continue certainly through the
middle of the year. Some of the most loss aﬀected accounts actually have yet to renew. So
we are expecting to see some of that – I know you're pretending that will accelerate and
become exponential, but we certainly expect to see an improving trend certainly through
the middle part of the year.
M&A; so I think the most important I can say on M&A is that, I mean, we don't exist to do
M&A. I mean we exist to serve our customers well and generate a good return for our
investors by doing that. And that means that the operational plans that we put forward at

Page 10 of 18

FINAL

both the Investor Day in 2016 and again at the Investor Day last year are the most
important priorities for us. And I think you can see through the course of last year and the
results that we published in February, I mean we're making progress, and that's had
positive beneﬁts for shareholders. We think that's the highest value priority that we can
pursue.
As far as how M&A ﬁts with us, I mean you've seen us do M&A. So I mean over the course
of – in the last 18 months, we've done a number of smaller acquisitions that in almost
every case had two key characteristics. One is that they were a strategic enabler, so they
were part of something that I hope you as analysts and our investors would recognize us
pursuing goals that we previously communicated to you and ﬁnancially they're attractive.
So compared to the alternative use of capital, which would typically be to return them to
investors, and these all represented actually a superior use for our investors.
You've also had to talk about the fact that we don't believe in this large scale, multi-market
approach to M&A that creates a huge distraction for the business. It's pretty rare that two
plus two in this world equals four or something more than four or one plus one is more
than two sorry. So, I mean that's not our priority. Our priority is on the operational side
and that's what it will continue to be.

The next question is from Oliver Troop from Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Q - Oliver Troop

{BIO 20035307 <GO>}

Thanks, and good afternoon. I've got two questions. My ﬁrst question is on Farmers.
You've obviously been reducing the quote share over time and it's now down to 1%. And I
noticed also that the Farmers' certiﬁcates of deposit – sorry certiﬁcates of contribution
held by the group are being reduced. It just seems like Zurich is becoming more and
more decoupled from Farmers. So my question is, do you still see Farmers as a core part
of the group in the long-term?
And then the second question, I wondered if you could just give an update on claims
inﬂation. How does that compare to the 2% overall price increase you've got in P&C,

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So thank you Oliver. So on the ﬁrst one, so is Farmers a core part, so Farmers
Management Services is a core part for Zurich Group? Absolutely. I mean the things that
we've done less of are the things – I mean Zurich doesn't necessarily do this for any of its
clients. So the – I mean, I think probably as long ago as 2014 maybe 2015, we talked about
the fact that I mean being a reinsurer to Farmers over a longer period. I mean, this makes

no sense for Zurich or for Zurich shareholders, and therefore we've been reducing the
participation over that period, the Exchanges of (31:53) resources of support.

FINAL

I mean, Zurich is not a professional reinsurance organization, and I think Farmers is
actually best served by ﬁnding that type of support. And certainly our shareholders are
also well-served by us not exposing the capital base of the ﬁrm to those types of risks.

Q - Oliver Troop

{BIO 20035307 <GO>}

Okay.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

(32:14) I mean, we view that relationship as extremely important. I mean, we spent a lot of
time looking at how we can help and how we can improve the relationship, it's a core part
of what the Zurich Group oﬀers, and I don't expect that to change in the foreseeable
future.

On the claims inﬂation topic, I mean, as always it's going to vary a lot by diﬀerent lines of
business, and if you look at it in relatively short periods, it can be diﬃcult to judge. I mean,
given we've seen more signiﬁcant rates within Q1, we expect claims inﬂation to come up
gradually, but not at the same rates – same rate as pricing. So therefore we think we're
seeing margin expansion currently.
We've talked in the past about the fact that claims inﬂation overall for our book is maybe
running in that 1% level, it's maybe fractionally higher than that today. And of course if you
look at some of the lines of business, I mean you see the opposite trend, but I mean for
the overall portfolio, we're beneﬁting overall from the rate change.

The next question is from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi, there. The ﬁrst question P&C premium growth, growth versus net, I thought I
understood part of the plan for 2018 was to continue re-underwriting gross which meant
some shrinkage, but also re-underwriting or buying more reinsurance on certain lines. So
is it fair to assume the underlying net written premium growth is below the gross still so
far year-to-date? I presume the guidance still remains about ﬂat NEP for the year as a
whole, and is there any reason why that should have changed?
The second question looking at movements in yield curves and spreads year-to-date I
would be assuming that your reinvestment yield had risen somewhat, are there any
changes you've done to your asset allocation that would mean that I'll be wrong? Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you. On gross versus net, so ﬁrst of all on the reinsurance point, you are right, we
have a bit more reinsurance, partly around portfolio mix and partly around some lines of
business where we're looking to reduce the capital allocation. I mean within the quarter, I
mean now that they're risk attaching contracts, so the impact to the reinsurance will blend
in over time. Net and in the quarter I mean, it's not vastly diﬀerent from the gross written
picture, maybe a slightly more positive. I mean it's not materially diﬀerent from the ﬂattish
picture that you see.
And our guidance for the full year hasn't changed, so ﬂattish in the outcome. Albeit, we
may see a switch as we talked about before between commercial and retail, and other
businesses.
On the yield curve piece, I'm really glad you asked that question because I was hoping
that someone would ask me that. On the SAA side I mean no signiﬁcant change, but
actually on the reinvestment rates and well – I mean again it's one quarter and it's a
relatively small impact in the short term. What we've talked about this is the – as part of
the year where for P&C sounded at least the impact of reinvestment would bottom out
and in fact we've seen the inﬂection point already in the ﬁrst quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, that we have a book yields in the P&C book of about 2.7%, reinvestment yield about
2.9%. So, that's actually beneﬁcial for us as we go through the remainder of this year and
next.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hi, there. Just one question. I'm wanting to ask about your P&C expense ratio and can you
update us on where you think this is heading? And in particular, are you concerned that
by cutting premium in the U.S. you put more pressure on the expense ratio? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Nick. So, obviously we haven't given an expense ratio number today, we'll update
in more detail when we get to the half year. And just to remind everyone that we have a
particular skew and seasonality around crop, which has some unusual expense ratio
features that I know you're all aware of, but just a reminder as you think about the ﬁrst half
results.
I mean what's most important for us is reduction in absolute expenses, that's the thing
that we obviously completely control. We have the target that you are aware of, you know

FINAL

how much progress that we've made through the end of last year, that progress has
continued as we expected through Q1. We'll give a more fulsome update when we reach
the mid-year but we expect to continue to communicate an achievement of our expense
goals and the reduction in the expense base that would follow then.
I mean there will be a challenge at times if – I mean that was the reason why there is going
to be a larger correction around premium volumes because of a proﬁtability challenge in
the market. I mean there is a risk to the expense ratio but that's the key reason why we
haven't set an expense ratio target. Maybe more positively though – I mean as you heard
me respond to Andrew a moment ago, in looking for a fairly ﬂat outcome on the net end,
which of course would be the driver of the expense ratio side. I don't expect at this stage
to trade away the beneﬁts of the expense cuts through a fall or a signiﬁcant fall in top line.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon. Thank you very much. So George just to clarify this minus 5% in U.S.,
is this a shift in the recent few months that post your commentary in the full year you
decided to get a bit more careful about underwriting or is it just something that was
anyways likely to have happened by now as they are planned? just looking for whether it's
incrementally more changed on underwriting.
And second question is you mentioned the bolt-on M&As and some of those have been
in Latin America, where obviously the currency is quite in focus last week, as well in Q. Is
there anything we should know about that, is a hedge in place or something to highlight?
Thank you very much.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Vinit, thank you. So on the shift in business, ﬁrst of all, so I don't remember precisely when
we would ﬁrst have talked about it in a public forum, maybe on the Q3 call, maybe on
one-on-ones which took place in between, but this is something we've been planning
since last August, September.
I think I've talked to some investors about the fact that – I mean, I think as you guys could
see in the half-year results and again in the year, I mean within the commercial business, it
was clear that we needed to do more to shift the mix. And part of that was going to be
pruning some of the portfolios that have been a challenge. I mean, the obvious (39:55) I
mentioned earlier on the call is commercial motor or commercial auto in the U.S. It's
actually quite a hard business to reduce volumes and because it's the business that has by
far the highest rate. But this is a planned activity and the plans go back already seven,
eight months for the activity you're seeing there.

On the M&A topic, so I guess you are following – well, maybe not following, but you
certainly are aware of what's happening clearly around the Argentinian peso. I mean, we
have a traditional transaction, we have the customary protections, but of course, I mean
we enter into this transaction with a longer term perspective on the market. And I mean, if
you're really worried about Argentina environment, we have to have daily calls that give
updates on what's taking place.
I mean we've had good experience in Argentina even through relatively diﬃcult periods,
but also I mean if you look at – I mean a good example is Brazil. So I mean go back to
2015, 2016 and look at the challenges that we saw on the macro side of Brazil. I mean,
some of them are more recent in those two years has been a particularly strong period for
Zurich in that market. So I mean what we see happening at the moment is something that
I mean it can happen from time to time in markets, I mean, besides Argentina. But I mean
this is a market we liked from a long-term perspective and that's why we made the
investment.

The last question is a follow-up from Jim Shuck. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just one question actually. I think George in the past you
had referred to surplus capital in the U.S. and looking to upstream now after the holding
company. It doesn't really seem to have happened. Just looking at the progression of the
dividend over time and U.S. RBC ratio is now 378% for the full year. I guess what's the kind
of target range on the RBC level and what's the outlook for that ratio given the potential
tax factor changes or any potential changes to your (42:09)?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Great questions. I mean you connect the two drivers here. So I mean you're
absolutely right. I mean (42:14) in the past that we were looking to bring ourselves down
to target levels of capitalization in the U.S. and that would have triggered, well, certainly
an early expectation additional cash ﬂow if we did that. We've never had those cash ﬂows
and the cash remittance guidance that was always going to be something that potentially
was on top.
But the reality of the tax changes as we restructure avoids the potential issues the big
components can create. That capital will be used locally to reduce to the extent to which
we seed this and perhaps other parts of the Zurich Group. So at this stage, I have no
expectation of other than the ordinary dividend ﬂows from the U.S. and we'll use that
surplus capital that was there to make sure that we get the beneﬁt of the change in the
federal rate in the U.S.

The next question is a follow-up from Farooq Hanif. Please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Oh, hi there. On your Z-ECM capital ratio, you have made lots of little – I mean, obviously
quite small acquisitions, but it seems that it's very diﬃcult for you to sort of make a dent
on that capital ratio to get it back down to 100% to 120% level. So I'm just kind of
wondering do you think you could use that up with M&A or do you think you're going to
have to do something else? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

The thing I'd point out here is that while probably people focus more on the acquisitions.
We've also made disposals. And it's more than simply the – I mean, the things that we
frequently talk about around the transactions in the Middle East, South Africa, Taiwan,
Morocco. We've done (44:15) work. And in some of those transactions have had, I mean,
really signiﬁcant positive impacts on Z-ECM. So as you've seen us do things like couple
more, I mean, some of those things are paid in their entirety by some of the restructuring
done on the backend to remove some of the risk from the portfolio. So I think that's partly
why you've seen the ratio be a bit more resilient than perhaps you might have anticipated
given what's happened on the M&A side.
I don't think we can make a dent in it. I mean, I think we said frequently that we don't have
a shadow target range that we haven't announced the target range is 100% to 120%.
We're in the fortunate position that we run above that currently. Priorities are unchanged.
So primarily that's something that should be a topic that gives investors a conﬁdence that
the dividend is very secure indeed. And beyond that we'd like to deploy a type
and beyond that we like to deploy it preferably an organic activity, if not an organic
activity an inorganic activity that would be would help us not only get to targets, but either
help us get there faster or help us exceed the targets. And if we can do that and we still
have surpluses over given periods, we would do what you'd expect us to do. Nothing
changed on our priorities on capital.

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you so much. And on the small rise in the Z-ECN from 132% to 133%, is there any
anything to highlight in terms of moving parts as anything stands out?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Actually not much, it's one of the simplest course of movements on Z-ECM. And so it's
actually 4 points, so I guess what we would call operating cash ﬂow generation three
points dividend accrual. No management adjustments or management actions or any
other unusual things in the ratio. It's all the stuﬀ you see or would see if we publish more
details I guess.
