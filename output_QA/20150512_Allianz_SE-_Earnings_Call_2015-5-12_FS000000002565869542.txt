MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Allianz Conference Call on the Financial Results
for the First Quarter 2015. For your information, this conference is being recorded. At this
time, I would like to turn the call over to your host today, Mr. Oliver Schmidt, Head of
Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Thank you, Christy. Yeah, good afternoon from my side as well and welcome to our
conference call about the results of the ﬁrst quarter 2015. I think I can keep it brief. We
have published key numbers already last week. You have seen our analyst presentation
this morning and for the details, you will now get from Dieter.

Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Thanks so much, Oliver, and good afternoon also from my side, and good morning to the
ones dialing in from The States. I am using the analyst presentation as usually and
mention from time to time the page numbers in case you get lost.

So I start on page 3, the business highlights. I think it's good, easy to read. Let me just
highlight that in our joint venture with UniCredit we have restarted on the motor side
selling and for a roll out in a large branch network 15,000 policies in one quarter is a very
good start. But also we have agreed on a new business plan for unit-linked products and
there we had a substantial increase in volume. Well, that's through the bank channel, but
also through our ﬁnancial advisor network, so unit-linked sales in Italy substantially up.
Asset Management, PIMCO continues to contribute strong investment outperformance.
Allianz Global Investors, good inﬂows we will talk about later.
On our real investments, the largest investment of the quarter was Colchester Garrison
facilities in the UK, where we are now the new landlord for the British Army and Fireman's
Fund transactions, the sale of the personal lines business got closed on April 1 that means
the proceeds are in Q2 and not Q1. And with this one I would move on to the numbers.

Bloomberg Transcript

So let's start with the high-level overview of the operating results. Headline ﬁgure, the
€2.855 billion, so 5% up compared to last year, but admittedly there are three one-oﬀs
included in the numbers. In P&C, a minus €100 million restructuring for the commercial
part of the Fireman's Fund, in Life I would say €200 million unusual realized gains, and I'll
come to this later; and maybe €100 million net in the corporate segment out of changes
of our own pension schemes in Germany. So the net one-oﬀ I see at €200 million for the
quarter that means the quarter had started with €2.655 billion. I think we can stick to this
for the rest of the year. That is probably a very good number, plus the €200 million
outperformance in Q1, even if it was one-oﬀ all counts for the full year results.
Net income 11% up. We have a slightly lower tax rate. I explained this in more detail and I
have not forgotten to talk about the revenues. They are 11% up, where we have to split it
between the various FX. It's 3.7% internal growth in total. Foreign currency makes a good
5% and then we have the ﬁrst time consolidation of the Unipol acquisition and also the
smaller acquisition of in Australia Northern Territory. And with this one I would move on to
the balance sheet.
I think it was a very good quarter for shareholders equity, €68.4 billion is a huge jump
forward, not really surprising. There's on one hand almost €2 billion of additional retained
earnings. There is the FX impact. The euro got beat up against most major currencies, and
what of course has the biggest impact as the U.S. dollar, but we should also not forget the
Swiss franc and also British pound, Australian dollar, et cetera. So broad positive impact
and then all assets values went up substantially on a gross basis before policyholder,
shareholder split in Texas our unrealized gains are now almost €90 billion. That is a huge
jump in unrealized gains and part of it of course goes also into the net asset value.
Conglomerate solvency, it's the old still – the relevant measurement for 2015 is also
beneﬁting from the increase in shareholders' equity. Additionally, we issued a hybrid
bond in March of €1.5 billion, which is adding 4 points to Solvency I and also 4 points to
Solvency II and I have seen that you were partially surprised that our solvency ratio is
sticking pretty closely to the year-end number.

When I take all market movements, we lost through straight market movements 16 points
and then there was 3 additional points through, I think, calculation and updates from yearend. So that's for the 19 points drop and we countered it with 20 points on action and
including the hybrid, which made also here roughly 4 points. It's quite a long list of
activities that is derisking on pension schemes that is lengthening duration through our
whole list of instruments. We have clearly looked in each Life unit how we can reduce
sensitivity and also improve the situation and still keeping enough money at risk because I
think it is easy to close out now the volatility, but it is more important that we keep enough
capital at risk that we can beneﬁt from positive developments going forward.
What certainly has helped us is also our equity exposure. We have sold and reduced
some equities, but in market value our equity holding still increased by almost €6 billion
to €47 billion, and also this increase of course supported the development of the balance
sheet, as I said. But it is also, I think, a good support in the risk return which we are taking.
So, overall, a quite positive development, and actually S&P rating unchanged, and when I
look at the S&P Q1 numbers, actually we are very solid above the AA level.

Bloomberg Transcript

So now moving to page 9, the P&C growth. I think that is one of my favorite pages of this
quarter. We continued to grow on a very broad scale. 3.5% internal growth adjusted for
currencies is really a good number. You see here the total growth including currency and
the already-mentioned acquisition 14 points. That is, of course, that would be really great
when we would have 14% without the currency movement, but 3.5% is actually nicely
ahead of our 3% average ambition level, and also you can see that the price eﬀects were
positive, and it is actually reconﬁrming what we said at year-end that we expect positive
impact from price increases in Germany and France, but also UK, Australia continue to
contribute to this.
So how does this translate then into the combined ratio development? First of all, you can
say yes, all the positive news, but operating proﬁt €200 million down. €100 million is
under other, that is restructuring charge for the integration of Fireman's Fund Commercial
business. We had actually planned it as a second quarter event, but I think the integration
is so well advancing that we booked it in Q1. And then we have a weaker underwriting
result, mainly driven by catastrophe events. And that is, in Germany, we had €150 million
of winter and spring storms in the quarter, so 1.9 percentage point cat loss compared to
0.5% last year. 1.9% is still light, but when I take all weather-related events then we are at
2.8% in the quarter and that is roughly our normalized expectation for a quarter. So the
quarter was on a normal level, but it was not excitingly positive.
In particular, the personal lines business of Fireman's Fund is actually leaving the group
with a very poor quarter, and that has been driven by the long and hard winter season in
the U.S. where we had quite a substantial list of homeowners losses in our personal lines
portfolio, so that will certainly – that has certainly stopped on April 1. Run-oﬀ results 3.2%,
a bit higher than last year, but 3.2% is actually our long-term average in run-oﬀ results,
and we have here actually a positive contribution in run-oﬀ from many countries, so there
is no concentration in one unit; it is very broadly supported as in most of the last series of
quarters.

When you go to page 13 and look at the overall operating proﬁt combined ratio
contribution, I think also continued to have a strong contribution from many markets. So
how is Russia and Brazil doing? And actually I should have mentioned this. The attritional
loss ratio ﬁrst quarter 2015 looks 1.2 percentage points weaker than 2014. And I think in
the ﬁrst quarter of 2014, we did not yet fully recognize that the situation in Russia, Brazil
and also Fireman's Fund was as bad as it is. I think the full run rate attritional loss of these
three markets is better reﬂected in the Q4 numbers. And compared to Q4, I think we see
a slight improvement and that is also visible in the Brazilian results. Yes, still a combined
ratio of 111%, but an operating loss only of €8 million in the quarter. And remember, in Q4,
Brazil contributed almost €200 million operating loss in the quarter.
Russia also is a driver for the decline in premium in Central and Eastern Europe, so the
Russian business is shrinking as planned and we are fully on track with the closing of the
retail business. And Fireman's Fund, as I said, personal lines business had a poor farewell
quarter and the commercial business is in volume terms, I think, picking up nicely. The
broker market in the U.S. clearly supports and encourages us with our One Allianz
strategy and acceptance rate of the change is very high, and that was the main focus of
our change that we get back on track with the broker market.

Bloomberg Transcript

When we move on page 15 to the investment results, operating investment results €50
million higher. That is probably slightly distorted also by foreign currency changes. All
numbers look in euro absolutely stronger. But also we have to see that the negative net
harvesting results was driven by foreign currency losses, so where we held emerging
market bonds mainly in euro balance sheet and this year the same bonds had a positive
FX impact. So it's more – actually it's a turn of the negative harvesting results and both
added makes €50 million more investment income.
Reinvestment yield actually substantially holding up was 2.1%, but I think that is driven by
three eﬀects. On one hand, we invested mainly right at the beginning of the quarter then
we increased duration slightly and we had also from the mix of investments; there were
maybe more investments outside the Eurozone than inside as we increased also our
buildings and corporate bonds. So all helped with the 2.1%, but I would expect that this
number is hard to keep for the rest of the year.
Moving on now to the Life business. Life business internal growth, 5%, as I said, a strong
growth in Italy. This is a two unit-linked business without any bells and whistles, so we
have actually 108% growth in unit-linked only, and the other business shrank by 5% in
Italy. In France, we carved out International Health business, which is now shown under
AWP that explains part of the negative numbers, but also we have reduced our single
premium business in this market environment.
In Asia Paciﬁc, it's Taiwan contributes with a strong growth that is almost all unit-linked
business, so very positive. And in the U.S., we have seen a little reduction in volumes.
Well, ﬁrst of all, we had a really strong quarter a year ago, but also with the repricing to
keep the proﬁt margin up in this falling interest rate environment, we lost some volume so
that was well-directed and not surprisingly.

FINAL

So let's move to the Life operating proﬁt. I mentioned already in the beginning that
maybe of the investment margin, you have to apply a €200 million haircut to get to a
longer-term average number, but also a €900 million operating proﬁt is a very strong
number driven by the volume increases of last year. Then also here our U.S. operation has
a bigger share in the overall pie with stronger dollar.
And so what did drive this €200 million one-oﬀ in the investment margin? Well, that is
quite a composition of events. On one hand, there are the trading results from our
derivatives. They are the derivatives to protect against falling interest rates, so they had
obviously a fantastic quarter in Europe. Then there are trading results from equities and
also some trading results from foreign currency exposures, emerging market bonds, as I
also mentioned on the P&C segment. And then we turned over some of the public equity
and also we lengthened duration on our ﬁxed income portfolio and some OEs. And when
you sell at the moment any investments, you always feel like a gain because I think we
have almost non-investment left with unrealized loss. Everything has a strong realized
gain.

Bloomberg Transcript

So the big swing in loadings and fees, I think that is more a technical change based on
quite a number of foreign currency impacts. So in the operating proﬁt, it has net a less
visible impact that is some – Taiwan is growing nicely and has products with high
loadings, then also Taiwan dollar is higher against the euro. And then, also the U.S. and
then also some other market that is less of a change in the overall proﬁt line.
Then I would move on to the value of new business. New business margins 1.5% is a drop
of 1 percentage point and I have to make here an additional explanation. We are moving
forward fairly radically and with full conﬁdence to the Solvency II world, and therefore we
have also adjusted our new business margin calculation. So what does this mean? Under
the Solvency II world, the contract boundaries are quite diﬀerent. So you cannot assume
that a 12-month contract is renewed with a certain probability which was the old actuarial
calculation. So, for example, our French group business, which are all 12-month contracts,
most of them are being renewed after 12 months, but in the Solvency II world, you
account for them as a 12-month contract. That means also the new business margin
calculation for this business is then more or less being reduced to calculating a combined
ratio. Make it very simple, that is actually also nice that some things are getting simpler in
life actuarial terms.
But that has as a consequence that the new business margin might look slightly diﬀerent,
and I come to this point later, and you have much more recurrent premium new business
in your books. And when you go in our appendix, you will see that actually the French
business shows a huge increase in new business recurrent premium and that is the
contract boundary eﬀect.
So now, what would have happened to last year's new business margin with the new
contract boundary? It is plus, minus a few basis points the same 2.5 percentage points we
have shown last year. There are pluses and minuses. This statement is not true for each
OE, but for the overall portfolio, and therefore we didn't make a big restatement page
and started to go through all the analysis because the number variation in total was so
small. But I think for the analysis of the proﬁtability, it really doesn't change the picture.

FINAL

But internally it makes the calculation much easier because now the market consists the
balance sheet of Solvency II and everything we do for the Life business proﬁtability
calculation is now all integrated into one calculation, and therefore there is also no
diﬀerent assumption setting which makes everything in the long run easier for everybody.
And now, let's move to the investment margin. There are two things I would like to draw
your attention to. Current yield, ﬁrst line that is IFRS current yield dropped by 11 basis
points without deeper looking at it. When you see how strongly the market value of the
assets moved, so the average market value of the assets moved from €414 billion to €494
billion where the policyholder reserves only moved €40 billion, the diﬀerence in the
movement is the market appreciation of all the assets. That means also when the same
asset pool, when you calculate the average yield, the yield is already a bit suppressed,
because of the higher market values, although you have the same bonds and the same
coupons as before. And when you split the eﬀects, then it is roughly half-and-half. I would
say 5.5 basis points is true drop in yield and 5.5 basis points is the drop to asset
appreciation, and that shows you actually more how slowly the yield is dropping.

Bloomberg Transcript

Also it shows that based on policyholder reserves we have a much higher, nicer yield, as
we only pay the yield to the aggregate policyholder reserves and not to the market value
of assets. And then, comes the big item. It's the net harvesting and other that was a 0.7%,
which I explained with some realization the duration lengthening and also trading result.
But in this calculation most of it goes to proﬁt sharing to policyholder, so that the net
margin moves from 19 basis points last year to 25 basis points this year. The 25 basis
points is, as I said, still too high for an average quarter, so probably more around 20 basis
points is a more reasonable and that is equivalent to my €200 million less in investment
margin.
So with this one I move to Asset Management. I think you all know the whole discussion
and story around the PIMCO outﬂows. Again, market and foreign currency helped us a
lot, because at ﬁrst glance third-party assets are actually up to €1.4 trillion. I think the
movement chart on the right-hand side of page 25 shows you that FX is a big driver of it
and the outﬂows of PIMCO were at €68 billion. That is actually half of the number we had
in the fourth quarter and the vast majority of the outﬂows is in the traditional business and
only a smaller number in the non-traditional.
Before we forget it, Allianz global investors actually were €6 billion inﬂows for the quarter,
a very strong number, and it's now the ninth quarter with this net inﬂows at €6 billion is so
far our biggest number. Market appreciation also supported strongly the development at
Allianz Global Investors and that is then also in the assets under management included.
When we move to the revenue page, also revenues are slightly up in the overall Asset
Management business where PIMCO is 3% down in euro terms. In internal numbers, that
means excluding FX, it's 20% down in revenues, and Allianz Global Investors is strongly
up in all measurements, driven by market inﬂows. And that results then on page 29 in an
operating proﬁt development which is in euros 14% down. And excluding the dollar we
would lose another 12%. And here it is the volume decrease has a big eﬀect, but expenses
stay more or less stable in euros and are not falling and that is certainly – in U.S. dollars,

Page 6 of 24



Company Name: Allianz SE

FINAL

sorry – the expenses stay stable in U.S. dollars and therefore the cost income ratio at
PIMCO is deteriorating by 10 percentage points.
We have not reduced our staﬀ and we have additionally some one-oﬀ expenses. There is
the higher – there is the retention package which we started in October. There are
additional marketing expenses. There are some provisioning for the legal actions, defend
cost, and there is also additional one-oﬀ proxy fees for some of the major funds because
the lead manager is changing and then we have to redo all prospectus and everything.
So I would say in the PIMCO cost income ratio there might be good 2 percentage points
of one-oﬀ costs in Q1, and please also remember that we said with our February outlook
that we expect still a substantial amount of performance fees out of private funds
maturing in the fourth quarter, so the whole annual result for PIMCO will be very much
back-end loaded.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, the Corporate segment a small €100 million loss including the €100 million one-oﬀ
net because there were actually two one-oﬀs €150 million from a pension provision but
also some write-downs on software, so I would say the net one-oﬀ is €100 million and that
is coming from a still restructuring or I should say bundling of the German pension
schemes from local subsidiaries to the holding company and additionally we will in the
second quarter also do some de-risking of this pension schemes in Germany, but also in
other markets also to continue to manage our Solvency ratio.
And I now move to the last page with numbers only to mention that a tax rate is 2
percentage points lower, but for my perspective it is lower for the wrong reasons. The
reason for the lowering as the mix of pre-tax proﬁt PIMCO has a 38% tax rate which is
above the average that means reduced PIMCO operating proﬁt creates and also a lower
eﬀective tax rate and that is for me the wrong reason to get a tax rate down.
And now, let me come to the summary. In euro terms, revenues going double-digit, proﬁt
5% and shareholders net income up 11%. Overall, I think we are reconﬁrming our strong
capital and balance sheet basis in all measures, IFRS, Solvency I, Solvency II and as a B
rating. And I think also in the Q1, we are showing the really substantial progress on all the
promises we made beginning of the year and the promises starting with that we manage
our Solvency II ratio actively ﬁnding a right balance between the risk taking and risk
avoidance, because we want to beneﬁt from the changes in the ﬁnancial market. We I
think on track to correct the developments in Brazil closing in Russia, integration of
Fireman's Fund and also the outﬂows at PIMCO in line with our expectation for the ﬁrst
quarter, so I think that is a successful start in executing plan 2015 at Allianz.
And with this one, I open to questions.

Thank you. We will pause for just a moment to allow everyone to signal. We will now take
our ﬁrst question from James Shuck from UBS.

FINAL

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I had three questions, please. Firstly, on
economic capital, I mean obviously, you've managed the development since year-end to
Q1 to be broadly ﬂat. There's a number of moving parts in there. There's a certain amount
of subjectivity around the calibration of economic capital. And I think in the past, you
targeted 160% plus a 30% buﬀer on top of that and what's clear is that you have a certain
degree of subjectivity around how you calibrate it. So my question is, what is the kind of
additional buﬀer that you have to play with, with regards to how you actually calibrate the
economic capital model? You've made some changes around policyholder participation
rate assumptions, for example. I understand those are still above statutory minimums. But
I just want to get a feel for kind of what scope you've got to actually manage that number,
if possible.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, on economic capital sensitivities on slide 42, I was just a bit surprised to see
that you're still fairly positively exposed to a higher yield environment. So, plus 50 basis
points adds about 9 points to Solvency II. I was surprised to see that given the closing of
the duration gap on the Life business. So if you could just explain where that's coming
from, please.
And then, ﬁnally on the MCEV disclosure on slide 67, could you just talk through some of
the movements here? I'm particularly interested in the asymmetric nature of the
diﬀerences between the German-speaking countries and the Western and Southern
Europe part of that. So, for example the interest rate being positive for Western Europe,
but negative for Germany, obviously the German-speaking is clear, but the volatility
diﬀerences and the equity diﬀerences. And I suppose there's a sub-set within that. Could
you just talk about the negative experience variance you've had on Allianz Life U.S.
following the very strong growth there, please? Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Okay, James. Thank you very much. I must say I have to reject the statement about
subjectivity in the economic model. If this would be our own internal model, yes, there
would be subjectivity. But this is the model we are going to ﬁle over the next few weeks
with the regulator as part of the oﬃcial IMAP process. And that model is being
accompanied by more than 60,000 pages of documentation, and that is now after three
years of intense discussions with many regulators in Europe which are bundled under the
Supervisory College who deals with Allianz internal model application. So that reduces
subjectivity actually quite a lot.
What of course is still a management decision is how long you keep a certain crediting
rate for a policyholder up depending on future interest rate scenarios. And this
environment, actually more careful in crediting rates that are management decision, if you
want to call this subjective, I think that it's more a careful reﬂection on what you see in the
interest rate development in Europe altogether. But that is a small impact in the overall
calculation in Q1. It is much more the active changes we have done to the asset portfolio,
Page 8 of 24

FINAL

but also we are certainly also reviewing in-force business where we can adjust some
conditions on group contracts. I think we are careful acting here in the interest of our
customers, but also keeping a balance to the shareholders.
The interest rate sensitivity that is a complex thing, I think the better calculation which
gives the deeper insight is the full economic Solvency interest rate sensitivity, because
here we are modeled through the whole impact. A duration calculation is in the end a
simpliﬁed calculation, in the end linearizing occurs which is actually convex. And this
eﬀect therefore shows diﬀerent numbers. So even if the duration would be completely
showing the same number, you are still not getting out of the interest rate sensitivity
because our liabilities are convex. That means when interest rates are falling, the liability
duration gets longer, and that is reﬂected in the interest rate sensitivity of the full
calculations and just the shortened duration calculation.
On the sensitivities in the MCEV, page 67, the diﬀerence under the column Germanspeaking versus Western and Southern Europe, I think the totals are correct. I think there
is some messing around with the individual numbers because you are picking here a
good point. The signs look to me also diﬃcult to interpret. I think we will look at this page
67 and maybe send out an updated version of it. We are this quarter a bit short in time
and I think some of the checks probably missed this. Sorry for that.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, that's ﬁne. That's ﬁne. Could you just clarify on the experience variance on the U.S.
business, please?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

I think that is probably just a trading results out of the hedging, which are not always
perfect as the uptake of some small base was clear and that is being updated in the
changes, but that is very small. And that is driven by changes in interest rates that is
coming from mismatches in the hedging program.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

I guess, my point is on the U.S. We've seen very strong growth coming from Allianz Life.
And I just want to be sure that that business is behaving as you thought it would do when
you sold it?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Absolutely. And by the way, there's a positive number.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

It's a negative number, isn't it? Minus €386 million?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Then I'm on the wrong page. I'm on page 67. I look at the €61 million.

Operator
Thank you. We will now take our next question from Paul De'Ath from RBC. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Paul C. De'Ath
Yeah. Hi, there. Thanks very much. Couple of questions for me. Firstly on the duration
management that you've been doing during the quarter. Obviously now, as you
mentioned, the duration gap on the Life side is practically zero, should we now think that
your – that actually you've lengthened the duration as much as you would like to? Or
should we expect any more of these kind of actions going through the year? And just a
viewpoint on that because obviously that's also impacted the earnings.
And the second point is just a bit of clariﬁcation really on the negative new business
margin in France. Obviously, you mentioned this is due to the change in the contract
boundaries and this turns negative. Should we just be factoring in negative new business
margin in France? Going forward here, is this the new normal? And kind of under the real
situation it will turn out ﬁne, but under new MCEV guidelines you'll be reporting negative
margins here? Thanks.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Paul, I think the duration management's done for the year. I would not say – we continue
to look at each OE and will continue to very proactively manage our solvency ratio. But
certainly, as of today, as you have probably all noticed, the 20-year euro swap curve at the
end of March was 79 basis points and the 20-year is a more important point in the interest
curve for the solvency calculations than the others. And now last Friday, we were at 110
basis points, so 31 basis points up. That has certainly a positive impact on the overall
solvency calculation, but we will continue to watch it. And as I said, derisking of the

pension liabilities will continue, also matching of our pension liabilities because the
duration gap in our pension liability is actually certainly bigger than in our customer
portfolio, so that is also part of the interest rate volatility. So we will continue to work on
this.
And then the French margin, no, actually I think the new measurement is probably giving
a better transparent view on the tools. We have two major lines of business in France. On
one hand, it is the Group Health business, which has – in combined ratio terms has a
combined ratio above 100%. Therefore, the new business margin is negative. And the
normal standard capital is a strong product in France is due to the interest rate diﬀerence
between what we credit to the customers and new investment rates you can achieve in
the market is also slightly negative. And we have – because you have to pay in between
expenses, and we have to work on to reprice both products to turn positive. So, therefore,
I think it is not due to the change in rules. It is a very transparent weakness.

Thank you. We will now take our next question from Farooq Hanif from Citigroup. Please
go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, there. I was wondering if you could quantify what would happen if you moved your
U.S. business to now to two times the level of capital that you're assuming and also if you
could comment on what BaFin thinks of your U.S. capital assumption that you're making in
the equivalence calculation. That's question one.
Could you comment on – maybe you said this already, but could you comment on the
actual message you used to increase duration, so how much of it was in sort of physical
assets and how much was hedging overlay? And could you also, lastly, just talk about
what you think the regular growth rate in your reserves is in the Life business if you
exclude FX? So it was obviously up on an average reserve basis 11%, but it seems your net
ﬂows were also quite positive. Your interest rates are on a normalized basis holding up.
So, do you think you could've achieved roughly 4% or 5% growth a year in your reserves
and could you possibly quantify that? That would be really helpful. Thank you very much.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

I think if I remember correctly from end of 2014, we had roughly 8% net growth in the
reserves and half was inﬂow and half was accrued interest. And three months later, the
situation has not changed a lot because a lot of the inﬂows were from the second half of
2014 and certainly further supported by inﬂows in 2015. So I would say 7% to 8% is
probably the growth eﬀect overall. I think there's actually in our year-end book, there was
certainly a disclosure for this.

I don't know what BaFin thinks, but certainly we are ﬁling the model as we explained it
and as it is here currently stated. I'm also positive that the EU Parliament will grant U.S.
equivalence. And the whole discussion about what is the right percentage of [capital] is a
very complicated one. I think you should start talking to your U.S. colleagues and look at
the comparability of local solvency ratios. For U.S. VA business, the U.S. regulator has
actually adopted a total asset concept. And that means you can either increase reserves
or you can have a higher capital charge. And the U.S. regulator looks at the sum of
reserves and capital charge. That means to the extreme if you want – if you assume you're
a pure VA player, you could have €10 million capital charge and you have in your balance
sheet €100 million capital and you would show 1,000% ratio. Or you show the whole €100
million as capital and not as a reserve charged and your solvency ratio would be 100%.
But it is the same balance sheet. And this little reﬁnement has to be considered quite a lot
before debating what multitude you want to apply to what numbers. Therefore, I'm
staying away from all this speculation, whether it's factor one, two, three, four or ﬁve
because I think that are all debates based on an uneducated view on U.S. statutory
requirements.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Actually my question was probably a little bit more benign. What I meant was, obviously,
you must have – I mean, BaFin are not going to be completely surprised when you input
this model to them because they will have seen it before. Is that correct?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Well, as I said, we are discussing with them all details since more than three years with the
same team. And actually when we – I also said in the February call, when we changed to
U.S. equivalent, of course, we had a consultation discussion with BaFin and we are not hip
shooting.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

And is it a bigger factor if you changed your assumption?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Well, in the end, that would go a few points down.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

And actually probably the gap between internal model and equivalence is, as we speak,
smaller than at the beginning of the year. I did not do the test, but U.S. interest rates are
on the rise again, credit spreads came down. So probably end of April number, the
diﬀerence between the two is certainly smaller than January one, but it's not relevant as
we will ﬁle now with U.S. equivalence.

Thank you. We will now take our next question from Thomas Jacquet from Exane. Please
go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Thomas Jacquet

Hi. Good afternoon. So my ﬁrst question is on the Italian Life new business margin. I'm
quite surprised to see such a decline in new business proﬁtability, given the fact that you
have a lot of unit-linked, so do you plan to take actions to restore proﬁtability? Or is it
something linked to the calculation methodology? And my other question is regarding
your – the management actions you've taken to save the solvency. Can you give an order
of magnitude of the diﬀerent things you've done? And can you specify whether you used
some hedging techniques and some – buying some options, for example? Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 4110153 <GO>}

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, the drop in Life new business margin, it's – I think they have a good new
business margin on the unit-linked business, but also the classical Italian general account
business has a small negative new business margin. Why is that? Because the old fund
credits to the customer a higher interest rate than what you can achieve in the investments
so, therefore, you are in the end making a loss when you calculate it standalone, and that
is what a new business margin should reﬂect. So, therefore, it is not a surprise and we
have to do repricing or changing of the traditional business to get the overall new
business margin back to a good level. The unit-linked sales standalone are absolutely ﬁne.
So what did we do in ALM? I think, to a large extent, we just bought longer physical
bonds. But then also we have extended our swaption programs, but I think the bigger
part were actually futures, which we executed and which we are using in hedge
accounting. That means they are not – you are not seeing any derivative impact in our
P&L.

Q - Thomas Jacquet

{BIO 4110153 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. We will now take our next question from Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Hey, there. I've got three questions please. Firstly, could you go through the movements
in the solvency ratio? You were talking faster than my ability to write unfortunately. I think

Page 13 of 24



Company Name: Allianz SE

Date: 2015-05-12

you said market movement 16 points, 20 points of action, 4 points of hybrid. I think I
missed something in the middle. That's the ﬁrst question.

FINAL

The second question, on the duration gap narrowing, has all of that been achieved on the
asset side or have there been some changes to modeling on the liability side? I'm just
wondering whether some of the currency rate adjustments you've put through have
actually made a diﬀerence to the duration liabilities.
And then ﬁnally just on the reinvestment yield for the Life business, on I think slide 23, you
sort of break out a lower number due to the impact of derivatives. Just wondering if you
can explain what the diﬀerence is between the gross number and the lower net number?
Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

I think with the last question you lost me. What is...

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

So just on slide 23, Dieter, there's...

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

The new investments?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

In brackets, or in the bubble actually. The 2.2% down from 300 (sic) [3%] the prior year,
and there's a breakout bubble, so in the economic reinvestment yield including
derivatives.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yes. The duration extension on the new business, when I include also the forwards and
these are more the AAA government bonds, then that reduces the average new
investment yield.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

So the model – the economic one, we should be using the 1.7%, that's the number to
compare going forward, is it?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Well, that in accounting terms in the next number of years, the 2.2% is what materializes.
Because the 1.7% if you buy it forward during the forward period in hedge accounting,
that is a zero impact of this one that will only crystallize after the forward period.

Okay. Okay. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

And so that was this question. Then the Solvency II movements, I think that was – in total,
the downward changes were 19% and the upward changes up obviously 20%, otherwise
it's not moving plus 1%. And there is – I think that's mainly the management actions and
then, of course, including the hybrid, which makes 4 points.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Is it possible to break out a little bit the 19%?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Well, I thought actually more it was our result call and now it's becoming a Solvency II
seminar. I think you are only using the very detailed disclosures of Allianz to challenge the
others. That is ﬁne, but I'm actually not sure whether Allianz gets a lot of beneﬁt out of the
details. It seems that every detail creates only a myriad of further reviews of our model,
and that is already being reviewed by the regulators.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

So the main driver is asset duration. There are some equity hedges in it. There is a better
matching of our own pension liabilities and things like that. So in each of our Life OEs I
would say it is a list between ﬁve and 20 smaller actions and it is all adding up. I think it's
for the very orchestrated activity across the group, and the group has demonstrated that
they can live in a Solvency II world because Solvency II means active management, and it
is not a stable number which you calculate once a year and which is only changing every
ﬁve years like Solvency I. And I think that is what you have to learn when interpreting it
and the companies have to learn to manage it.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And then the duration gap closure, that was up principally on the asset
side, or was there any liabilities?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

I think liabilities are naturally going also slightly up because we are in a convex world, and
convex actually means that when your credited interest rates goes closer to the
guarantee, you get closer to the pure native duration calculation of the guarantee. So, as
long as you pay high crediting rates, your liability duration appears further because the
crediting of the proﬁt sharing reduces so to speak the average duration. That is the
explanation for the convexity.

Thank you. We will now take our next question from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous.
Please...

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi, there. I promise I wouldn't ask about Solvency II.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

I buy you a beer in London for this.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. I'll remember that. The ﬁrst question just on normalized. I noticed the – in the roll
forward chart of the accident year loss ratio you showed a 1.8% eﬀect of frequency and
severity excluding NatCat. I think from your comments you would suggest a lot of that is
sort of weather eﬀect underneath the NatCat and maybe some large losses, but maybe
just give us a sense as to are there any underlying severity trends?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yes. There is a bit of the weather. But as I also said, in Q1 2014, we were still too optimistic
on Brazil on Fireman's Fund and also Russia and the whole catch up which happened
during the quarter during 2014 is of course now embedded also in Q1 2015. So, that has
certainly changed also in the numbers. So therefore I think when you look on the same
page on the comparison to Q4, you actually see, well, quite a lot of improvement to Q4
and Q1. It is, of course, always tricky because you are as a very experienced analyst know
that there are all the seasonal eﬀects in loss ratios and, therefore, we usually compare
season by season, but for Brazil and Russia that was less of a seasonal eﬀect, that was
really operational deterioration and that...

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

I guess I just observed in some of the commentary you talked about severity in Italy and I
think Turkey. I mean is there – what is severity out running in Italy for example?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Well, our claims average is slightly up, that is – and in Turkey as well also on the motor
side. But that is I think in the – that is probably not baking in a lot here in the numbers.
Yes, our attritional loss ratio also in Italy is slightly higher than a year ago, and that is not
surprising as the whole market is reducing rate. And we can also not keep rate completely
unchanged.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And frequency is no longer falling presumably?

FINAL

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Frequency is actually slightly lower in Italy. It depends whether you look on MTPL alone or
whether you look at other MODs. The total frequency in Italy for our book is still a little bit
lower.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. And then the second question...

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

MTPL is a little bit up.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Great. Second question was just on the Life new business in the U.S. You mentioned
in your comments, I mean you repriced it to maintain the margin, but the margin still fell
quite a lot year-on-year. I guess I'M just curious, why did the margin fall on a product
that's not that interest rate sensitive, the FIA product? And also I'm a bit surprised sales
fell as much as they do. I thought you still had exclusive use of the Barclays Hedge and
that still meant that even in your repricing you would still see decent volume growth. So
maybe just a bit more explanation on what happened to the U.S. would be useful?
Thanks.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Well, I think, ﬁrst of all, the starting point with last year is a fairly high sales volume. There
is also a little bit more competition coming in. And the product is in falling interest rates
less attractive for the customer. Therefore it is not surprising when you increase your fee
charges that means that the total return for the customer is reduced, that you have less
sales. Our bigger step in repricing will kick in in April. We did two smaller steps in
repricing in the ﬁrst quarter and we did not maintain the full new business margin, but the
new business margin is still above our 2% level. And it was in the end a local decision to
trade oﬀ between volume and margin, which is okay from a group perspective as long as
the margin is above 2%.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

So the repricing may aﬀect volumes a bit more, but I guess you get a bit of margin back?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

We get a bit of margin back in the second quarter, yeah.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thank you.

Thank you. We will now take our next question from Michael Huttner from JPMorgan.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thanks. I'm afraid I'm not going to merit any kind of beer, but I hope this is a Life
question. On this Solvency, my understanding, I mean it's very, very high level, it's
eﬀectively the big trade-oﬀ is that or the big management action involved futures and as
you describe them they go through the balance sheet and the impact on earnings
therefore is limited for however long the future's hold. Is that the right way of thinking
about it? In other words that in a way – let me use my words carefully, the management
actions that you took have no immediate impact in terms or very little immediate impact
in terms of earnings?

Bloomberg Transcript

And the other question is the combined ratio. So I was trying to guess what a sustainable
level would be. Coming around, because there's a bit of pricing improvement still coming
through, maybe the weather was a bit worse in Q1, I don't know, is 94% the right level,
93.5%? Just trying to average all these things out which you mentioned, given that it's a
bit worse than Q1 2014. But the other – it seems a bit better than the rest of the year, and
the rest of the year seems to have averaged just around 94% and a bit, 95%. And then the
last question is on the PIMCO. How much is the – can you give us a rough idea of how
much performance fees is to come, just so we know what ﬁgure to add? Thank you so
much. And yeah, sorry, no beer.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

No beer, yeah. I think that was indeed a light question on Solvency II. Maybe you get half
a pint.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

So impact on earnings is very small through the actions. I think some of the shorter dates
at physical bonds we replaced by longer dated, that was probably the more of – well,
economically it was probably positive in operating investment income is small change. I
think the futures maybe a third of the whole lengthening program. It was a lot in physical
bonds and there are also some additional swaptions which we added. So it was a wellbalanced package between all this. We're really looking at the individual situation. You
have to remember that actually a lot of the balance sheet are split in segregated funds,
and you have to take the right decision for each of the segregated accounts. There are
individual policyholder, shareholder rules, there are accounting regimes that vary
diﬀerent from country to country. So therefore you cannot take one strategy to solve the
problem, it's really a very detailed bottom up work.

FINAL

On the combined ratio, I think for me the more important statement was that we are on
track with the turnaround cases, and we said that we will keep in the mature markets the
combined ratio stable compared to last year. And I think that we are going to do because
the small deterioration in Italy, and actually Italy is holding better up than I expected
because I thought that the Unipol portfolio will have a more worse loss ratio than our
portfolio, but in the end it played out that we are – it is a little bit worse than the Allianz
average portfolio. So therefore the average combined loss ratio in Italy, and that is a 20%
portfolio extension in Italy, is actually looking very strong, that means supporting our
underwriting results.
France and Germany continues to have rate increases, so also support from there. AGCS
and Euler are holding up and the turnaround candidates I think are on the right track.
Russia will just be diminished to 12 to almost nothing. Brazil is on a good way going
forward. The personal lines business Fireman's Fund is sold. And the commercial business
before we improve the loss ratio there, that is a longer-term work. But I think we see
already some good ﬁrst steps on the expenses, certainly paid by restructuring charges,
but the restructuring charges will also be oﬀset by €330 million proceeds from ACE, so I
think that is all balancing out quite well.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

All right. Fair enough.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

And PIMCO, you had a question on the performance fees. Well, in the end when you take
the midpoint outlook of our Asset Management segment, you can almost easily calculate
how much performance fee has at least to come.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Three questions, please. I'm also in for a beer, it's only
on earnings, not on capital. The ﬁrst question is on, I come back to the U.S. Life and also
maybe Italian Life, and the fact that you repriced the business. From a management
perspective, does this imply that the business you sold the last one or two years basically
now looks not as good as you thought, and hence the need to reprice. What triggered
this need to reprice and how should we think about the back book rather than the new
business as you say right now? First question.

Page 19 of 24



Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity

FINAL

Second question, you mentioned of course the obvious problem at PIMCO, the lower
scale driving up cost income ratios. So what are the plans here? Do you expect the asset
situation to stabilize or even improve from here, or should we expect that you take
material action to bring the costs in line with the lower scale?
And the third question is on the P&C segment. We know that the price momentum seems
to have stabilized right now. After a number of quarters we're now at 80 bps increase,
which is not great, but it's still stabilized. My question here is from here is, your
expectations that we basically see a slight upward trend? Or when I just look at the page
59, overall, it seems to be maybe slightly going down going forward?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, Thomas. The repricing in the U.S. is actually a very ongoing activity, and I think in
2014 we have repriced eight times our ﬁxed index annuity business because we are
selling the business, so to speak, in tranches. We look every two weeks how did the U.S.
Treasury rate move and depending on this, we calibrate our expense charges, but also we
take our investment income because we match the received premium with an investment
being done. So, therefore, the old business is not aﬀected by this one. It is an ongoing
adjustment, and additionally in case that there is something wrong, we can on a yearly
basis, but always with one year delay, adjust the fee charges for our ﬁxed index annuity
business in the U.S. and, correct, therefore I'm not concerned at all about that business
looking in the past.
In Italy, well, I think that the large diﬀerence between your old yields you have in the
portfolio and your new money yields is creating a problem and that is an inherent
problem in most continental European countries for all this general account business and
that is simple. You can go to your bank, borrow €1 million short dated and invest it in a life
policy and there are combinations in Europe possible, there you can create a positive
arbitrage out of it.
And I think what we have to do to ensure that our products are not giving any opportunity
to this type of arbitrage and that has deﬁnitely introduced limits on the sizes of single
premiums in Germany for example. You are in the ﬁrst – when you buy a single premium
policy. The ﬁrst ﬁve years you are not participating in the general account returns. You get
a substantially reduced total return because the arbitrage guides are not patient to wait
more than ﬁve years and there are also steps you have to do when you have such an
anomaly in interest rates between existing yields and new money yields.
I think the pricing increase of 18 basis points, I think, that is for the overall portfolio, still a
good number, because we are still living broadly in a ﬂat claims inﬂation growth. You can
read everyday how desperate ECB is trying to create inﬂation in Europe. Italian business –
I answered PIMCO, yes, sure, lower scale is correct. Total Return Fund smaller than before.
I think with the expense actions, we are more prone to invest in the future and building up
the next development phase of PIMCO instead of optimizing next quarter's earnings. But
certainly the one-oﬀ expenses of Q1 should also be less and as I said, maybe 62% is a too
high cost income ratio and slightly below 60% is a better cost income ratio for the year,

Page 20 of 24

not counting on performance fees. If you add them, then of course we are back to a very
good cost income ratio.

Thank you. We will now take our next question from Nick Holmes from Société Générale.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Thank you very much, there. Hi, Dieter. I've got just one question. I'm afraid it's on
Solvency II, but it's a nice Solvency II question. I wanted to ask, looking positively at what
Solvency II is doing for the industry, do you think that you will stop writing guarantees in
Germany? And do you think the whole industry is going to change, that everybody's
going to get out of the guarantee business? And this could actually be a very good thing
for the industry overall. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yes. That is indeed a nice question on Solvency II. Well, maybe the industry would not
consider it as a nice question. I don't think that we would stop writing any guarantees. I
think when you look at our product, Perspektive in Germany, that is exactly our answer to
writing guarantees in the Solvency II world, because that product has split the guarantees
into two halves and therefore you end up as a duration liability, which you can match with
assets, the accumulation phase until people are 60 or 65, whatever they pick as
retirement age and then a new market-adjusted guarantee from the decumulation point
starting.
I think that is one of the potential answers to Solvency II and also our ﬁxed index annuities
in the U.S., which we sell also quite – very well, actually in Germany – also examples,
because these products are matched. And you have more options to re-price and react
faster to market movement and certainly the industry in Europe has still to become more
ﬂexible with the fast changes of the ﬁnancial markets – that we are living at the moment in
this total – extreme yield scenarios driven by quantitative easing exercising around the
globe. I think that is something diﬀerent, but even if this goes away, that interest rates will
recover to 6% is very, very unlikely. And also ﬁnancial markets are today much more
volatile than we were all used from previous periods and this volatility is probably more of
the driver that this 40 years stable guarantees are very diﬃcult to manage.

Thank you, Dieter. So just to clarify, are you actually selling at the moment open-ended
guarantees in Germany, ones that can extend 20, 30, 40 years.

To a small extent as everybody else in the market, but I think we do. This is a very large
and highly capitalized balance sheet and it's in our new business I think by far the smallest
share of all players.

FINAL

Right. And in 2016, would you actually stop altogether writing that type of business?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Look, as we are measuring internally already now for several years under the Solvency II
regime and we managed the company like in 2016, why would we act next year diﬀerently
than this year?

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

You cannot start acting under Solvency II on January 1; that will be a bit late. It seems so
that some people believe they can start next January, but I think that is a bit late.

Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you. We will now take our next question from Michael Haid from MainFirst Bank.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Michael Haid, MainFirst Bank. One question on
Allianz Leben, certainly Allianz Leben is not amused by the current low interest rate
environment. So my question is maybe a little bit broad but aside of lengthening the
duration of the asset side, what other measures you take or you plan to take to improve
the situation here? I guess, my question goes into the direction, how can you improve the
mortality results or cost results or what other measures can you take or you have already
taken?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Well, ﬁrst of all, I actually read your study on the German life insurance industry, was the
very well done and very interesting reading material, Michael. So what can we do in the
ultra low yield environment? I think we play here our scale and peer advantage. I think
that is the product design I mentioned already to reduce duration length. I think that is the
deferral period we have on the single premium products, then I think our cost advantage
is probably around 80 basis points compared to the average market. And our asset
strategy is probably also more exploited and more sophisticated. We – as a part of the

Garrison, I mentioned right in the beginning of my presentation, of course, is being held
by the investment portfolio in Stuttgart in our life balance sheet, and that is also a type of
investment which is lengthening out our asset duration and gives still reasonable returns.
I think it is really a combination of all of it. And I think the scale advantage and the active
Asset Management is probably the main positive. That does not mean that we are sitting
idle on our old successes. We are constantly working on further changes and
improvements.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

How easy would it be for you to improve the expense result, which, if it's negative, it has
to be carried...

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

We had the positive expense result.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.
