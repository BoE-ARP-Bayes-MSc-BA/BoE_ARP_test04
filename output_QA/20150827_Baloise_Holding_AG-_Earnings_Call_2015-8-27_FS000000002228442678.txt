MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning or good afternoon depending where you're
attending from. Welcome to the Bâloise Group Half Year Results 2015 Analysts
Conference Call. I'm Celina, the Chorus Call operator. I would like to remind you that all
participants will be in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. After the
presentation, there will be a Q&A session. The conference must not be recorded for
publication or broadcast.
At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Mr. Martin Strobel, Group CEO. Please go
ahead, sir.

Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our analyst conference. German
Egloff and I will be presenting our half year results to you. As you all know, we changed our
communication methods. You might have seen the transcripts of our speeches this
morning on the Internet, as well as the videos of the presentations. So this means we'll
focus only on the highlights and the short introduction at this call and then we are ready to
answer your questions. Both of us, so German Egloff and myself, together with Martin
Wenk, our Head of Asset Management will be happy to answer your questions at the end
of the short presentation.

FINAL

I would now like to turn to slide number 5 with the highlights of the results. Ladies and
gentlemen, Bâloise has posted a strong set of results for the first six months of 2015 with
a profit of around CHF 250 million. These results have been driven by strong operational
profitability which has enabled us to overcome the significant difficulties posed by low
interest rates and the strong Swiss franc.
The non-life sector once again proved to be a pillar of Bâloise's success. Our combined
ratio reached 92.3%, an outstanding figure for the European market. We've been able to
achieve this high level of operational profitability thanks to the uncompromising
implementation of our operational excellence and target customer management
strategies that we have now been pursuing for more than 10 years. We've also been able
to significantly reduce costs, as a result of numerous efficiency measures. This high margin
of our non-life business ensures reliable substantial cash flows.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our results in life business have been robust despite significant headwinds from a
strengthening Swiss franc and the significant fall in interest rates in Switzerland.
Developments in the interest rate and currency markets naturally had an impact on our
gains or losses on investments. Despite the challenging market environment, our tried
and tested team at Bâloise Asset Management was able to generate a good level of
gains on investments.
Growth in our target segments has even been stronger than before. The volume of
business rose by 3.9%, measured in local currency and with ongoing business. We are
strongly capitalized. Our solvency ratio now stands at an impressive 333%. Our
operational strength and robust capitalization are also reflected in the confirmed rating of
A with stable outlook from Standard & Poor's. With these figures and results, we are on
track to deliver our financial targets for 2015.
That was a brief overview of the half-year results 2015 for Bâloise. And now, we are happy
and ready to answer your questions.

Q&A
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Mr.
Daniel Bischof from Baader Helvea. Please go ahead.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. A couple of points. First on top line, the Swiss non-life business, which
was again declining due to the re-underwriting measures on the accident and health side.
I think this process is now going on for probably some 18 months. Could you tell us what
sort of underlying growth rates you achieved and when we should expect this reunderwriting process to come to an end?

FINAL

The second one is on the expense side in non-life where you overall reported group
progress yet in Germany the gross expense ratio actually increased from the previous
year's level, although you think that the ongoing cost reduction initiatives are well on track.
Could you explain this and also maybe provide your thoughts where the expense ratio
might roughly be in 6 to 12 months' time?

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you, Mr. Bischof. I'm going to answer both questions from my point of view. So, top
line non-life Switzerland, you're absolutely right. We see an increase of premium in the car
business, in the property business, in the liability business. All of these type of the
business have excellent, really excellent combined ratios. In all of these cases, we grow
above market growth. If we take the (05:55) figures – the figures of the Swiss Insurance
Association, we're above. And so, we're gaining market share in attractive lines of
business which makes us actually quite happy.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the other side, yes, we have two high combined ratios in the Group Accident and the
Group Health business. And as you rightly said, we are in the process of re-underwriting
the business for almost now two years. I expect this to level out, let's say, mid next year.
The one reason is we see an improvement of the combined ratios in the Group Health
business due to our re-underwriting.
At the same time, we are very happy that especially the health insurance in Switzerland,
they face, let's say, some pressure be it from the market or be it from the regulator to
have a closer look on the profitability in the insurance part of the business they do. So,
what we see here is a hardening in the market especially in the Group Health business
and this obviously helps the non-life – the combined ratios in this business.
On Group Accident, what we have done in recent years is to fully reserve out the very low
interest rate levels we see in this business. And as you well know, some of these liabilities
in this business are interest rate-related (07:31) to annuities. So, we reached – according to
our information, we have now the best reservation level in the Group Accident business
and this often means lower load and lower, let's say, claims ratios in this business going
forward. So, overall, I think growth should be (07:54) with next year, that's what we
expect, and combined ratios will keep on going to be excellent in this business.
Second question was the division of the expense development in Germany and why don't
you see this in the combined ratio cost ratio. Costs are down in Germany, and year-onyear it's about €30 million. We promised €40 million to the year-end and we will reach this
€40 million. Half year now, we have about €30 million. Not all of these costs you will see in
the cost ratio of the combined ratio (08:38) restructuring costs are not necessarily
mirrored in the cost ratios. So it gives our cost position also in Germany we have to look
at.
So, we will reach by end of the year do you see the €40 million that we indicated. We will
reach 300 FTE by end of this year. We stand now at minus 200 FTEs by midyear. We will
have the 300 by end of this year, and then the minus 400 by end of 2017. So, again, here,

Page 3 of 20

FINAL

we are at fully on track with the efficiency measures. And this leads to – the question was,
okay, what is the run rate in the expense ratio?
We are aiming for a combined ratio in all businesses and for the Bâloise Group as well in
between the 93% to 96%. And both elements have to support this, so be it the cost ratio
and the expense ratio. And we stick to this target. I already hear your question, but Martin
didn't exceed 112% combined ratio in Germany in the first half. This is far away from 93%
to 96%. I have to agree. Actually, I have not been happy or not been satisfied with the
combined ratio when I saw it for the first half. The main reason for this is this is much, by
far, too high combined ratio.
There are two very large claims that we had in the first half. One is from a natural hazard
or a storm. And one is from one single fire claim we had in the first half. This is in the Black
Forest. They're a big, big company producing cakes and so on. And they burned down.
And if you put these two large claims together they account for 12 points, 12 points of the
combined ratio.
We're seeing the business as extraordinary. We do not assume that this is, let's say, the
normal load of claims in the German business. And so, we expect this not to happen
every year. Then, we will be much closer to our target of, let's say, 93% to 96%. It should
not count as an excuse. I'm not happy with the result. Just some growth information.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

That would still leave some four points to the 96% at the upper end of the guidance, so
you do expect the remainder of the delta coming from – or from the improvement
coming from the underwriting or mainly from the expense side?

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Both of them actually. Yeah. Both of them. I mean, the cost ratio is too high in Germany.
The market is standing at, I would say now between 28%, 27%. We should get below the
30% over time. Yeah.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Nice one. Thank you.

Operator
The next question comes from Mr. Peter Eliot from Berenberg. Please go ahead.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you. I have two questions, please. The first one was just on the sort of Life result,
and at the full-year results, you guided to the division having an underlying sort of EBIT run
rate of CHF 200 million to CHF 250 million. I think when I sort of add-back the one-offs
that we have this time around, you're probably towards the lower end of that range at the
moment. And I guess interest rates have sort of taken another leg down recently. So I was
Page 4 of 20



Company N ame: Baloise H olding AG
Company Ticker: BAL N SW Equity
Date: 2015-08-27

FINAL

just wondering if you could sort of update us on your thoughts about the sort of the run
rate there and perhaps share your thoughts about the – in light of the current interest rate
environment?
And then the second was on the buyback. I note that you said you made very good
progress partly because of the share price. And I'm just wondering if perhaps you could
share your thoughts on, I guess, how big a deviation it might have been from the natural
run rates, which was well ahead of target for being complete in the time period you set
yourself and obviously there's been some volatility in markets recently. So I'm just
wondering if you could add any comments about the outlook there? Thank you.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you, Mr. Eliot. I'm going to answer the first question from a general point of view.
And if there are details open, I'll hand you over to German Egloff, our CFO. And buyback, I
will hand you over then to Martin Wenk who knows everything about our strategy, how fast
we buyback these shares.

Bloomberg Transcript

And coming to Life, you're absolutely right. And our guidance was for – talking about the
full-year results, CHF 200 million and CHF 250 million – between CHF 200 million and
CHF 250 million. And we stick now to the guidance of CHF 200 million. Swiss franc isn't
the reason why it slipped to the lower end. It's exactly what you said. It's translation
effects. It's hedging costs that increased and so on. And so that is a change, but there's
still a good – very good quality actually of the Life earnings. We stand at the lower EBIT in
the half year, and German can give you some insights on that.
But before he goes into detail, I would elaborate (14:09) what are our thoughts on the Life
business. Actually, we stick to exactly the strategy that we also discussed in March this
year. Meaning, from the product side, we continue to change the new product mix
towards, let's say modern or let's say capital-light product that can be pure risk product,
that can be capital-light guarantees and so on and so on.
And we see very good progress in – if you look for the proportion of new business that
we classify as being modern, this has again increased. Now, for the first time, we see also
a substantial part of the new business in Group Life in Switzerland coming from our semiautonomous foundations and the risk process – or the risk premium business. So we see a
good progress here that we are able to return around the new business in the right
direction.
Also, let's say, from a technical point of view, we are very happy with the risk results of the
Life business. So nothing worth mentioning in terms of – we still have a very high quality of
the risk part of the business. In some markets, we have among the best in the margin of
the risk process. Costs are going down in Life. You will also see this at the profit and loss
statement. And we are very happy with this since cost process or costs are also – or lower
costs are a value driver in the Life business.
And the first element comes in from the assets here, underlying earnings, recurring
income, and so on, fitting with the guarantees, it's still intact. So we have a positive margin
Page 5 of 20



Company N ame: Baloise H olding AG
Company Ticker: BAL N SW Equity
Date: 2015-08-27

FINAL

here if you compare recurring income with the guarantees. The only thing, let's say, for
the half year, if you noted, we have a very, let's say, volatile mechanism when it comes to
profit and loss with the U.S. GAAP mechanism in the core. The good news is, yes, we have
seen very low interest rates in Switzerland, but we're now fully reserved out for this level,
but this leads to certain swings. And Peter, I hand you over to German.

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well, a lot of us said, I guess, the most important thing is maybe that operationally in the
business much less have happened than you would expect at a glance if you look at the
results of the segments. So therefore, just to remind you that we have a couple of
positive one-offs last year that we were communicating as well. I realized gains in Belgium,
which were somehow extraordinary. Then, we have the quite substantial gains on interest
rate derivatives in Switzerland. We have compound annuities, so policyholder dividends on
annuities, and this is one-off of course.

Bloomberg Transcript

And that actually led us to the guidance of CHF 200 million and CHF 250 million. And
you're right, that was of course given the economic platform that we had at that time. And
now, this translation effect that we see again is sort of – well, I don't know whether
interest rates can fall in further down than they are. On the other hand, I've said that for a
couple of years now that build around (17:59-18:00). So therefore, I'm careful with that. But
currently, we see still not a different trend in interest rates. And last year, the picture was a
bit different. So I would as well say that's, probably for the run rate, it's closer to CHF 200
million and CHF 250 million.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Martin, the share buyback and the speed of having to do this.

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

Yes. Okay. The question regarding the share buyback has, in my opinion, two levels. One
is our strategic goal or our overall goal is to be always ahead of the time schedule, so to
be a little bit in front of the linear approach and to finish that before the end of the two
years. And technically, it is so that we have imposed – you know that there are two lines.
We basically – we buy on the second line. We have to put there a bid order. And if it's
executed or not, it's decided basically by the spread between the two lines. And since we
don't want to pay too much for those shares, we have imposed ourselves kind of a
downtick rule. So we only buy if there is a downtick. And on our home page, you'll find all
the details that we had bought 275,000 shares, which is more than a quarter in four
months at roughly CHF 117 million. And we will continue that way to get them early but
cheap.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot.

The next question is from Mr. Michael Huttner from JPMorgan. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Thank you so much. On Solvency, I wonder if you can say a couple of things, maybe just
use the S&P report, which seems to hesitate whether you're very, very, very strong or
simply very strong. And I still don't understand why in a county as orderly as Switzerland,
something which has been in place since 2011 is still not done. But anyway, maybe I'm a bit
slow. I don't understand that.
The other point is a broader one, also from the S&P report. They make comments which I
really didn't – I kind of struggle with. It's on the outlook section. And they say that they
would – in the thing where they say they might upgrade you, they say an upgrade could
occur if we expected Baloise's ERM, so that's enterprise risk management (21:05) and
management practices to enhance the group's financial strength. That seems such an
odd comment. It almost implies that at the moment you're lacking in this area. I just
wondered whether you could explain how you see that. Thank you.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you Mr. Huttner. I think both questions are perfect for German.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Yes. On Solvency, I indeed would actually refer to the Standard & Poor's report that's
probably the best information you can get about this. And why it is going from 2011 until
now and the system is still not tied, I mean, I can just repeat what I said in the last couple
of years and that is, indeed, the problem. And I fear that's what (22:04) problem you will
see about the same thing in Solvency II as well in the future.
So, internal models, the process that regulators thought how they would approve internal
models is, by far, too slow. The market is changing too fast. And that, of course, a kind of
a problem if you want to be market-consistent on the one side and, on the other side,
you take three years to approve the model. But then, all the new experiences that you
have, they have to be built in in the models immediately.
And we will see what will happen but it's just that the whole system is too nervous and I
guess we will make sort of the same experience with Solvency II as well. This transition
period of 16 years, that might soften the effect. So, there you get sort of quietness into
the system but, in fact, that is a problem. And...

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

And just on the solvency, I did wonder in the S&P report, it comes to us 2014 with 2015
and 2017. What happened between those two dates? It says extremely strong 2014, very
strong 2015-2017. What happened?

Company N ame: Baloise H olding AG
Company Ticker: BAL N SW Equity
Date: 2015-08-27

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well, the thing was probably that last year, the equity almost exploded. And that might
have been – I might come back to that.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. No problem. Okay.

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

But the other thing about the ERM, that's actually a point of discussion (24:01) In fact, we
are very strong on ERM. The thing is just that up to now, Standard & Poor's claims that ERM
is not so important for us and that actually makes the difference. And I, in fact, asked them
the question, well, if we were in a riskier business, then it became important and it would
create an upgrade whether that's true and they sort of answered it positive which, of
course, in the effect is absurd.
So, therefore – but I think ERM becomes more important than – and the other thing might
have been that – well, that's just my guess. We had an upgrade last year and they sort of
didn't want to upgrade us two years in a row.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

The next question is from Mr. Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Jonny Urwin here, UBS. Just a couple of questions on the life business if
I may. The new business margin has obviously fallen by quite a lot particularly in
Switzerland. I'm just wondering if you can give us an idea sort of quantum of investment
moves and business mix as well.
And just are you sticking to the 10% guidance, and if so, how do you propose getting
there? I supposed pricing actions would be required, your peers are clearly doing that and
it's working out quite well. And lastly, I just wanted to know if we can get any color at all
into the IRRs and payback periods on the Group Life business, and perhaps on the wider
book if you can. Thank you.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Internal rate of return. Okay. I see. Okay. Thank you very much for your questions. I'm
going to answer the life questions, and then I hand you over to German Egloff, our CFO,
for the IRR question.

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

(26:21)

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Okay. New business margin, yes, it fell. We stand about 7% new business margin at half
year. And the main reason for this having gone down is, as you rightly said, the Swiss
business, and here we are confronted with a very low interest environment. And what
we're doing right now is exactly what we had been – first, first we continue with the
process to move the business towards that part of the product area that has better new
business margins. And on the other side, especially in the core Group Life business, the
next update of the clarification will include a price uptick. So, those are exactly the
measures we are going to take.
And for emphasis, I would like to add that's it's hard to compare the new business data
from different insurance companies. If you look at some of our competitors in this market,
and look at their new business margins in Switzerland, you will find figures that are so high
that you should ask them, okay, why don't you sell the non-life business and go for pure
life. And so, they seem to be different as, say, business models are. I think that more
important part is different assumptions beginning behind different new business market
calculations. So, this make it a bit difficult I think to compare the figures.
But nevertheless, yes, we are still aiming for the – this is our target. It remains our target,
the 10% new business margin. And we're taking action now to further improve the new
business margin especially in Switzerland.
So, the internal rate of return of the life business, German?

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well, we don't disclose that. And I have actually – well, you have an indication at the end of
the year when we are disclosing a full MCV. Currently, just one indication, I mean, probably
what you're interested in is whether our cost of capital are covered or not. And what I can

Page 9 of 20



Company N ame: Baloise H olding AG
Company Ticker: BAL N SW Equity
Date: 2015-08-27

FINAL

tell you is that even though you're – Martin just spoke about the new business margin in
Switzerland and – I mean, it's positive.
So, that means capital costs are certainly covered. And probably it's even better than the
new business margin looks because the assumption – what the cost of capital are, are
given the market environment. So, related to, for example, Swiss government bonds that
are negative on a 10 years basis probably the assumption for the cost of capital are rather
aggressive currently. So, aggressive means probably too high.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Just one quick comment perhaps. It would be really helpful to get the
source of profits based on a half-yearly basis as well, if possible?

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

That's quite a tricky one because especially the Group Life business in Switzerland, there
we have a legal quote. And the legal quote is actually done by the end of the year. And
that's based on the local debt. So, it could well be that certain things can be done to
optimize the profit for the shareholders as well only at the end of the year. So, too much
disclosure on half-year could actually be against the interest of the shareholders.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

But that was an internal one. That's not to publish.

waiting for the next question.

Operator
the next question comes from Mr. Stefan Schürmann from Bank Vontobel. Please go
ahead.

Q - Stef an Schürmann
Yes. Good morning. I have two questions. First one on the reserving fees. I understand
you increased reserves in the Swiss Group Life business. Can you maybe give us some
indication if we should expect more in the second half of the year and how much average
guarantee has been reduced in life overall?
The second one on basically investment yield, recurring yield came down quite a bit. How
much was related to FX and where does the new one yield stand?

and then the second one to Martin Wenk. German, please.

FINAL

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Yes, we did reserve strengthening in the first half. The question is actually whether we'll
do it in the second half as well or not is what interest rates are doing in the second half.
So that (31:39) driver to do that.
On a technical interest rate basis, no, we're not disclosing how much that is actually. But
currently, we are on a comfortable level. But of course, as I said, depending on what the
interest rates are like in the future, that's not only the close future, but I mean, if they stay
where they are for the next 15 years, there will be further reserve strengthening that part
of the year. And of course, the other thing especially in crude price is what the – what will
be decided for the minimal interest rate for next year. The discussion about that is
currently starting to emerge.

Q - Stef an Schürmann
Okay. Yeah.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

And now to Martin Wenk talking about the recurring income.

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

Yes. The recurring income actually came back by CHF 97 million. That's correct. And it has
a threefold source through that. About half of it is actually translation of foreign exchange.
So simply, the euro-denominated coupons that we get are worth less. So that's about
CHF 45 million and the rest is lower reinvestment yield on our new money and the
maturities we have.

Q - Stef an Schürmann
Okay. That's helpful.

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

And the reinvestment yield of the new investments came also down. It's about CHF 1.4
million in life and about CHF 1.6 million in non-life. But that's only for the new money, not
the overall yield.

Q - Stef an Schürmann
Okay. Thank you.

Hello. Good day. Thank you so much. I have three questions if I may. One is number one
and it's just to understand the duration gap where you are now. If I remember last year,
you touched it quite a lot to I think 0.6 years or 0.8 years, just a little update there.
The second is – surprised really. So, you're the third company I follow which is (34:18) this
year still have – or fourth (34:21) reported. No company, not a single one, have mentioned
the China crisis as an issue in their outlook, in the results, in investments, nothing. So, I just
wondered if it is just sort of strong in Solvency and management that it doesn't matter or
is it too short, I don't know?
And then the last question is now that you've decided to leave, Mr. Strobel, how do you
see the group developing? So, the answer I'm really looking for is how much do you think
the targets which you kind of obviously have can be improved. I can see the combined
ratio, it can be improved. I can't see the (35:06) being improved much. And I just
wondered if you have a feel for where the ROE target could end up. Thank you.

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Very interesting questions. I will hand you over for the
duration to German Egloff. Then China crisis, since we are not operating in Asia, it's more
an asset management question, I guess, from our point of view. So, I would hand you over
to Martin Wenk. And then the targets, I had to pull out my crystal ball and give you – share
some thoughts with you. German, duration gap.

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well, to be sure that I don't give you a wrong number relating to the one you mentioned, I
won't do so. But just generally, Mark, I guess that Martin is probably aware of my answers.
I guess that the duration gap probably had increased due to the low interest rates in longterm fixed income papers. We have to switch to corporate bonds, certain switch to senior
secured loans, and I guess those have rather a shorter duration than the ones that we've
realized. But that's just a guess. And therefore, I would expect that duration gap has
increased to a certain extent. But, Martin...

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

Well, what you said is absolutely correct. We did all those actions. But on the other hand
we also have taken some counter measures, and we have increased the duration of the
bond portfolio in life from 8.2 to 8.8. So, the duration gap from that time, I would say, is
rather stable, didn't react too much. We have more asset classes that are short-term
duration but they have increased the bonds. So, in that level (37:09) at the end of today.

FINAL

The China question is, I would say, also again it's twofold. One, I can say we are not
affected by this development in China directly in our assets. We do not have any assets in
China and I can say we do not have investments in the emerging market, Asia area. We
have no shares and no high-yield bonds in that area. So, we have not a direct impact.
What worries us, of course, is if it has any impact on growth generally in the Western
Hemisphere in the U.S. and then Europe. That's something we are analyzing and we could
implement it into our asset allocation decisions. For the time being, we are analyzing – we
haven't not taken any other measures, but, of course, it's something we are monitoring
closely. But as I said in the beginning, no direct impact.

Now, coming back to your future – first question regarding the future. So, I'm not giving
you – I cannot give you and I will not give you a clear answer. This is up to my successor
and he will be happy to answer this question. That's clear.
You asked, is there any further potential within Bâloise Group. Obviously, there is a lot,
there is a lot. I mean, if you just – one picture I draw here, not meaning that this is the
concrete objective for follow-ups from the new year onwards. But if you compare Bâloise,
a second – some of the Nordic insurances, you will find that they have a much better ROE
than we have right now. And I mean, they have two big levers. One is we have a big
portion of classic life business. We will be moving away from certain new business. I mean,
there are different speeds you can take.
And on the other side, we've got very conservative refinancing structure and balance
sheet. So, there are levers to improve ROE and there's definitely a little potential for
Bâloise to improve further. But these are just thoughts. It's up to my successor and board
to come up with the next strategic step, and that will happen in the next year.

Yes. Hi. Ralph Hebgen from KBW. Hi. Just one confirmation and two questions if I may. Just
a confirmation, did I hear this right, that you do not disclose at the moment what your
average enforced guarantees are? And, well, if that was wrong, then I would be
interested to hear what they are at the moment.
Second question would be I would be interested to hear some of your thoughts of how
the sort of discussion in Switzerland is progressing with regard to the statutory minimum
guarantees. What do you think is the Bundes Life going to announce in September? Of
course, you don't know, but you're closer to the development in – and indeed part of the
process. So, any thoughts you might share with us would be appreciated.
And the third question is a numbers question. If I look at the P&C segment, it looks to me
as if the underwriting result was stable, 1H-on-1H. The investment income has of course
come down slightly because of the averaging down in the portfolio return. And so the net
positive impact on the EBIT was sort of driven by what is known as net other income. And I
would just be interested in having perhaps a breakdown of the composition of this last
reporting line?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you, Mr. Hebgen. I'm going to answer the first two questions and then what we
(41:32-41:35), I'll hand you over to German Egloff. Yes, we do disclose (41:42) average
guarantee in the books. If you look at the full year, disclosure we have – if I remember
correctly, but you can as well as I can do look this up and the IR can revert to you. I think I
have in mind it's 2.2% of the average currently of the entire book at year-end last year.
And we disclose this, absolutely, we do so. I mean that's a very important information for
your purposes.
And the next question was the minimum guarantee rate in the Swiss Group Life business.
I'm very optimistic that it is going to be lowered. Right now, it stands at 1.75%. If you take
this 777 formula, so 70% of the seven years bonds with a seven-year average, you end up
I think with 0.8% or something.
And there is a very good discussion, let's say, going on in BALN that people feel that the
financial environment, be it the currency effect, be it the interest rate effect raise on the
pension funds, be it the insurance companies or be it the autonomous or semiautonomous foundations.
Hence, I think the argument of being stable in the long run is a very important argument I
hear in BALN. So my expectation would be that it really goes down, and maybe not to
0.8%, but maybe for instance to 1%. So I think I could imagine this. But I mean, you asked
for my opinion, and I gave you my opinion. And it's – I mean, there's now an explosion in
share prices and the U.S., if they start to increase the interest rates, the picture might be
different. But I would expect that maybe the interest rate comes down, at least a bit
down.

FINAL

P&C segment, the other elements (43:58) other income and expenses, you have actually
two effects there, which were positive. One of them was that the internal reinsurance that
we have has its assets in Swiss francs, but the liabilities of course are in euro. So
therefore, we made a gain on that. In fact, I was then compensated on the asset side, but
you don't see that. And so that's why it looks like a gain.
And the other thing, which is real and probably even more important is that the year
before, we had some extraordinary expenses from Germany and Belgium. On the
disposition in Belgium, it was the – you remember, we mentioned that with an earn-out
that we had from the acquisition of Nateus. And in Germany, there was the social plan
costs that were in there and which we don't have meanwhile. And that was exactly the
position that Martin mentioned a couple of minutes ago, that absolute costs in Germany
are actually going down, even though you don't see it in the cost ratio apart from that day.
And of course, premiums have come down even more than the costs, and that's actually
creating the increasing cost ratio. But the important thing for you is probably that even if
you adjust for these effects, actual costs are going down.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Sorry. Am I still on the line? Can I do a quick follow-up just on the enforced guarantee. I
was interested in the average enforced guarantee at the moment, so as at June 30, of
course.

Q - René Locher

A - Martin Strobel

Yeah, we hear you loud and clearly.

FINAL

Okay. That's fine. So, just going back on the P&C underwriting. So it looks like matching
(46:32). If I take a look at Germany, here the combined ratio increased by 8.6 percentage
point. If I apply that on premiums of roughly €472 million, that would result in a lower
underwriting result of €41 million. And despite the negative or diversion of the combined
ratio, you increased the German EBIT from €17 million to €34 million. So perhaps – I just
had a discussion before with you prior the forum, but just to see if I got it right? So that's
my first question.
Then the second one is on slide 14, for Martin Wenk, I guess. Yes, you have slightly
increased your equity and equity-related investment exposures, now 8.3%, roughly at
CHF 4.5 billion. And as I understood, you have increased your exposure to senior secured
loans in the U.S., which are included in others. So Martin, perhaps you could explain a little
bit what risks are you running there and what's the return you can generate?
And then, the last question on slide 28, where I see the business mix, right. Well, I can see
you have a very strong sort of this combined ratio. And I was wondering if the Health
business, which account for 4.6%, and Accident, which account for 13.3%, is this mainly
Swiss business or do you have Health and Accident exposure somewhere outside
Switzerland? Thank you.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. Well, you have four for (48:33) the questions. I'm going to answer the first and
the third one. And yes, you already – you rightly saw Martin Wenk to give some insights on
the risk return profile of the senior secured loans.
EBIT is – so the combined ratio of Germany is high. It's 111%. Actually it's too high. We
talked about this with these two large claims, but still EBIT doubled. Then, how come?
There are two reasons for this. One is costs are significantly down in Germany. That's a
big factor. It's about CHF 30 million. So it's a huge factor. And we have some increase in
realized gains in Germany. So this explains the EBIT or the increase of the EBIT.
And now at page 28, the business mix, the Health portion, you see here, this 4.8%. This is
only the Group Health business of Switzerland. That's the only, let's say, Health business
we have in the group. And then the Accident portion, this is the 13.1%. There are two major
sub-components. One is the Accident business in Germany. We have quite substantial
platform of(49:57) business in Germany, such as Accident. And the other part being the
Group Accident business in Switzerland. (50:07-50:15) Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Now, Martin,
risk return.

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

Yes. As you rightly said in these figures that you have for the equity portion. There are
also old investments that are held in the form of util funds (50:34) or institutional funds, so
let's say, so you have also investments in there in the real estate funds and in bond funds.
Bond funds, it's mainly the senior secured loans you mentioned that we started about 18
months ago. And we have a pretty good experience right now.

FINAL

The risk involved there is really very low. We hedge 100% of the forex risk. So we end up
with a fixed income return of about 3% off of that hedge year-on-year. And this is a result
of a very low volatility because behind that you have a lot of different loans.
The particularity of senior secured loans is that there is a market through that in the U.S.
So basically it's loans and not listed bonds, but you have a market as for listed bonds. And
that makes it very interesting as an investment at that time. So it's really – I really can say
it's a fixed income risk you have there more than equity risk.

Q - René Locher
Okay. Thank you. Martin, just a follow-up on Germany, unfortunately. Your leading the
company, but if I'm right, you were always guiding for an EBIT above CHF 100 million for
Germany in 2016. Is this guidance which is still valid or you have those...?

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The guidance is valid. And it has to get there as well. I mean, if you look at, as I said, risk
capital that is in Germany, I mean, we have to have certain earnings to meet our standards
at Bâloise group.
Actually, as we talked about, I'm not satisfied especially with the Non-Life performance. I
mean, just to give you an impression here, the big two losses we talked about, they
weigh on the EBIT, let's say, with a double-digit figure. And so, I think assuming for a
second that we won't see every year such big claims, such as really big claims, and I think
the other earnings power of Germany is already better than it is now demonstrating the
EBIT, I see that costs are going down, I see that we have quite a good growth in our
target segments to have a better combined ratio in the overall business, and I see that in
new Life product to pick up, and I see that FTEs numbers are coming down.
So every measures we have taken to improve the business is going in the right direction,
but we have seen a bit large claims in the first half. So Germany is yet to demonstrate its
full ability off in the EBIT. That's the ultimate test. But the guidance is all right.

Q - René Locher
Okay. And just the last one for German on slide 12, so that's about the guidance, this CHF
200 million that's I guess that's on a net basis. But what is interesting when I take a look at
this interest rate effects, there is a huge swinging there. And I do understand with the
derivative, you had decreased your hedges somewhat. I guess the big swing is also
coming from liabilities, DAC, and PVFP, which increased from minus CHF 31 million to
minus CHF 99 million. And I guess these are the additional reserving in the Swiss Group
Life business. So, assuming that interest rates remain at the current low level and you'll
see no need (54:40) to increase reserves in Switzerland, then I do believe there's quite a
positive swing here in H2?

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

That is a dangerous question.

Company N ame: Baloise H olding AG

Q - René Locher
Okay.

FINAL

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

I will not give you a dangerous answer. I mean, everything can happen. In fact, what we
have found is the strengthening of the technical reserves was more or less set by realized
capital gains, so that's more policies. And you're right, I mean, a certain effect from – on
the FX side, they come immediately in the first half. They will not repeat in the second
half.
Nevertheless, I mean, interest rates – if interest rates stayed where they are –
unfortunately, they never do. They never stay where they are. So therefore, it is a bit
dangerous and it gets more and more, not only in Switzerland, but in general, it gets
more unpredictable because local regulators are, in this interest environment, applying
more rules on the local accounts and where we – whether it's not very friendly there, it's
what you have to do in re-reserving local accounts. And that's only a downward potential.

Bloomberg Transcript

So that means volatility that comes through from the local accounts is always negative.
Volatility that can be positive is on the IFRS side. But it makes it difficult to predict because
that's really – not only in Switzerland, in Belgium as well. You have already (56:48) in
Germany since 2011. So that is sort of moving as well. And that makes it really difficult to
say what will actually happen.
But I repeat, operationally, in Life as well, not a lot has changed actually. It's really the
market movements that are running around that kind of business, and that makes it a bit
difficult. I agree with you, and that's probably what I can tell you. If interest rates are
staying where they are, I expect the second – and the exchange rates as well, I expect
that the second half could be a bit better than the first half.

Q - René Locher
Okay. That helps. Thank you.

Operator
We have a follow-up question from Mr. Stefan Schürmann. Please go ahead.

Q - Stef an Schürmann
Yes. There are just maybe two follow-up questions for me. The first one on the, basically
level of shareholder funds, I mean, we all got it wrong. I mean, have you been surprised
that we got it wrong or have you been surprised that it was that low in terms of translated
FX impact? And the second question, just coming back on the regulation, is there anything
you want maybe to update in terms of regulatory talks in regard to standard models, SST
and so on, that with these, is there anything moving there?

Thank you very much. I hand you over to German for both questions.

FINAL

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

For the equity, well, that's really difficult to guess because what has a heavy weight in
there is they are historical currencies in our participation. And that goes directly into the
balance sheet, and that do have the sensitivities there. That's not that easy. I would say,
depending who you're asking, the accountants were not at all surprised. I was of the
impact, a bit surprised but not worried. It's just technical thing.
On the regulatory update, there have been – there are actually currently a lot of (59:36)
the kind of things will be published in the next couple of months. Some of them are
following the equivalent discussion with the European Union. So, a lot is happening. But
not actually in those areas where you're interested, unfortunately, as far as we know. I
mean, you have heard that the FINMA Chief talking about more standard models. What
we know meanwhile or what we have seen meanwhile is that they invented standard
models for captives, for branches of foreign reinsurers, and that kind of things. So things
that isn't our choice, but for example for the Life business I haven't that there are – at
least, a standard model is currently in development.

Q - Stef an Schürmann
Yes. Okay. Yeah. Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Because, I mean, we think there is a standard model, even if it's useless.

Q - Stef an Schürmann

level of happiness has changed or unhappiness has changed like half year going now?

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well, well, I'm sort of trying to avoid that my happiness is actually dependent of
regulators.
