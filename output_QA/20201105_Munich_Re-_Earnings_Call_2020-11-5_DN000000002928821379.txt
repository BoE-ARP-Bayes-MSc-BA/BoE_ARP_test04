Presentation
Operator
Good day and welcome to the Muenchener Rueckver Q3 results 2020 Conference Call.
Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference
over to Mr. Becker-Hussong. Please go ahead.

Becker-Hussong

{BIO 19080254 <GO>}

Thank you, [ph] Sasco. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to Muenchener
Rueckver Q3 2020 earnings call. I have the pleasure to be here in the room with
Christoph Jurecka, our CFO and I will directly hand it over to him for his introductory
remarks and then we can go into Q&A as always. Christoph, please.

Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Thank you, Christian, and good morning from my side. The third quarter's financial
development once again reflects good underlying performance in this very challenging
times. As we've announced already further significant COVID-19-related losses as well as
other major losses that were above expectations left their mark on our P&L. Our Q3 result
amounts to EUR199 million, which you think is quite remarkable given the additional
EUR800 million in COVID-19 related claims this quarter, and after 9 months, we achieved
a net income of around EUR1 billion including accumulated COVID-19 claims of around
EUR2.3 billion. Of these with around EUR2.1 billion P&C reinsurance accounts for the
largest share. So far the insurance of large events is the most affected area and we still

expect this to be the case once the pandemic has run its course. Beyond these losses, we
have set up material provisions as point across other lines of business. These include in
decreasing order of magnitude a property including BI, casualty and credit. Our reserves,
which we have served in a consistently prudent way like we always do to a degree. They
cover all claims incurred until the end of September, and as mentioned earlier already,
reserving for claims not incurred by then. It's not possible according to our accounting
standards. So far the claims actually paid a reported amount to EUR300 million and the
large remainder of EUR1.8 billion is then IBNR. In Life and Health reinsurance COVID-19
related claims development in Q3 continued at about the same pace and that's what we
saw in the previous quarter already, so the losses year to date amount to around EUR200
million, as in Q2 COVID-19 related claims dominated by US mortality. Claims reported
from other regions and other lines of business have been very low.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking at ERGO COVID-19 related claims, ERGO continued to be insignificant also in Q3
from a co-perspective. In P&C Germany, we observed minor additional claims due to
business closures and event cancellations. Travel insurance was affected by COVID-19
clearly part on the health side, we did not see an increased claims activity. Now let's move
away from COVID-19 and let me just give you few comments on the development aside
from COVID-19.
As usual, starting with the investment result, the ROI amounts to 2.7% for the quarter and
2.8% for the 9 months and supporting our guidance of approximately 3% for the year.
Interestingly in Q3, we saw a difference in the investment return among our fields of
business, in reinsurance the ROI of 3.7% was higher than the ERGO benefiting from
disposal gains on the one hand portfolio turnover, but also from the disposal of some
strategic equity investments. At ERGO by contrast the ROI was comparatively low at 2.1%,
as we did not have any sense of our financing this quarter and therefore realized a very
small amount of unrealized gains only and there was a negative contribution from equity
impairments as well as from derivatives.
The regular income on Group level declined to 2.4% in Q3, given the lower dividend
income compared to the previous quarter, a weaker US dollar and also, of course, the
lower interest rates. Reinvestment yield of 1.3% was also affected of course by the lowinterest rate, but maybe more importantly it also affected by the higher volume, a higher
portion of short-term investments. Now, in life and health reinsurance, the technical result
including fee income was EUR56 million and this is a similar level than the last quarter and
again fall short of the pro-rata full-year ambition. This is almost exclusively owing to the
impact of COVID-19 and in North America, we saw some excess mortality claims on top of
that in the aggregate and we also saw some impact from lower interest rates. However,
all of that was largely compensated by strong results in Europe and Asia and also by a
better than expected experience in Australia. Organic business growth continues to be
healthy across all geographies. In P&C reinsurance, our combined ratio stands at 112.2 for
Q3. In addition to the already mentioned COVID-19 related claims, the explosion in Beirut
contributed to the high man-made loss ratio of 18.4%.
In contrast, a Nat Cat loss ratio of 8.3% turned out to be only slightly above or largely in
line with the expectations. Despite an accumulation of large losses centered in the US, in
particular several hurricanes, thunderstorms, as well as wildfires. Our underlying

FINAL

performance remains sound, which I think is very pleasing including the reserve release of
four percentage points, normalized combined ratio amounted to 97% which is fully in line
with our ambition.
In primary insurance, ERGO once again posted a strong net result of EUR136 million in Q3
and all three segments contributed to this pleasing performance. In German Life and
Health, the net result amounted to EUR31 million and in contrast to Q2, the Q3 technical
result benefited from the intra-year volatility driven by COVID-19 into capital market
effects. In German P&C, the segment delivered sound earnings of EUR48 million and here
the combined ratio was exceptionally good, driven by the strong premium growth and
also benign Nat Cat activity.

Bloomberg Transcript

The combined ratio in the first nine months is fully in line with our full year guidance of
92%. In the international Ergo business, we also posted strong results of EUR57 million
driven by an ongoing sound operating performance. The very pleasing combined ratio
benefited from the reduced claims and also from lower large losses in P&C and then in
health from seasonal effects rate increases and the favorable claims development.
Combined ratio in the first nine months fully supports our full-year guidance of 94%.
The Group's economic position remains sound [ph]from the situation increased to 216%
still being at the upper end of our optimal range. The literal only funds benefited also
from the issue of the Queen bond, which accounted for 7 percentage points. While the
economic earnings came in below our expectations of course due to the COVID-19
losses, the SCR remained stable. Now regarding the outlook for the remainder of the
year, we kept our guidance unchanged for the investment return, which has proved quite
resilient and also for the ERGO financials, despite an environment, which continues to be
very challenging, also for ERGO and also for primary insurance in general I can say, given
all the uncertainties we have on the capital market volatility and the second COVID-19
wave running across Europe right now.
As the uncertainties are even higher for reinsurance, we still refrain from providing a net
result target. Despite all the in-additional insight we have at this point in time and also the
experience gained so far, it's still difficult to predict the COVID-19 claims for the remainder
of the year and beyond. It is a very wide range of possible path that the pandemic can still
take. Assuming normalized large losses, we agree would have been very well on the way
to achieve its EUR2.8 billion net income target. Over the last few years, we have
accelerated growth and we have further strengthened the earnings power of our group
and this together provides a very good basis going forward for the consistent execution
of our strategy and new financial targets, which we will communicate at our Investor Day in
December. With that, I'm looking forward to answering your questions, and now I hand it
back to Christian.

Becker-Hussong

Thank you, Christoph. We can then go right into Q&A, and as always, I would like to ask
you to limit the number of your questions to a maximum of two per person. Please

Questions And Answers
Operator

FINAL

Thank you. (Operator Instructions)
Our first question today comes from Emmanuel Musil from Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead.

Q - Emmanuel Musil
Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. So the first one,
could you please tell us what is your outlook on rates and how this might impact your
growth prospects in 2021 and maybe in the same context, could you please give us some
elements about your view on buybacks and dividends.
Secondly -- second question, in your press release in October when you anticipated
COVID-19 losses of EUR800 million for the quarter, you referred to then cancellation
[ph]penalty the mine line, so could you please give us your view on casualty post-COVID19 or do you expect in terms of claims and how comfortable are you with current loss
estimate in casualty? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yeah. Emmanuel. Thank you. First of all, outlook on rates, I think what we can say is that
the environment continues to be very constructive for a number of reasons, including the
elevated cat activity over the recent years, including also COVID-19 claims, including
alternative capital behaving differently than maybe some years ago, including also
reserving topics casualty developments in the US, so there is a number of reasons which
makes us think that the environment continues to be very constructive and in that sense,
we are looking pretty optimistic towards the renewal at year end.
Now, can I give you a number or something -- no I can't at this point in time, it's too early
and then we'll talk about it obviously then in February when you will came in, but this is it -the environment seems to be pretty constructive. On the buyback side, the dividend side,
that's something we generally decide as you know in January, anyway only once the yearend has been reached. You know our capital management strategy, which is basically that
the dividend is something really very important to us. We did not decrease the dividend
for the last 50 years, the whole organization is very proud on that, so that's something
which is extremely important to us, so we are going to fight with everything we have for
that. On the buyback side, that always has been meant as a very flexible tool and that's
the way how we look at it anyway, yeah.
Casualty, yeah I think you were referring to COVID-19 and casualty and we have some
claims, we have set off some reserves for that, but looking at other lines of business, I
would continue to say that casualty is not the most heavily affected line in that area.

Thank you. We now move on to our next question from Vikram Gandhi from Societe
Generale. Please go ahead.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

This is Vikram, Societe and thank you for taking my questions. First, is really on the
quantification of exposures and claims. I remember that the first half results presentation,
the Group has flagged that contingency claims was the biggest risk and we see that
coming through in the third quarter numbers, however, I think the market (technical
difficulty) [ph]sort of depiction of the potential risk exposures going forward, since it's still
a source of potential future claims. The other quantification that I was looking for was a
(technical difficulty) EUR2.1 billion figure, where I would have a reasonably good picture of
the lost drivers and the second question is more of a clarification, I have read in the press
articles several of them saying Munich Re is going to stop offering pandemic coverage,
however, I am not sure I understand whether that relates to the pandemic coverage for BI
risks or for the event cancellations or Board, so would be to have that confirmation
please. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you Vikram. Yeah, first of all, contingency, how do we look at that? Obviously,
we have an exposure which has been underwritten in the last couple of years, most of the
policies are one-year policies, but there is exposure beyond that with some multi-year
contracts which we also have. So, therefore, it's an exposure, which will also effect 2021.
Now the way we look at it when we reserve for claims. as soon as we are aware of the
claim, we reserve for it, so this means that either an event has happened already until Q3,
then obviously we have to set up a reserve for even pay out the claim already, also if you
look at our numbers paid out, pretty limited so far. But also if we are aware of a future
event being canceled, then of course we set the reserve already in Q3 or in the future -in Q4, we would be aware of an event next year to be canceled, we would set up the
reserves in Q4, right? So that's the way we do it, but as long as we do not have any
indication if a future event will happen or not, then we have no plans in setting up a
reserve.
As soon as this indication that event is not happening, we are reserving for that and that's
the way our numbers are being derived and I think by looking at these explanations, we
will probably understand why there was another increase of reserves now in Q3 for
contingency, because obviously there we became aware of events we've run that before
events to be canceled or postponed or whatever happen to these events. So that's the
way we look at it. Exclusion of pandemic, your second question, pretty much across all
lines of business.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

Company N ame: M uenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG in M uenchen
Company Ticker: M UV2 GR Equity
Date: 2020-11-05

Okay. If I can just come back on the first point. I appreciate what you say in terms of the
approach towards reserving, but how do we get a sense of the scale of exposure that's
there for the future -- potential future claims is really my question.

FINAL

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yeah. First of all, as I said, I mean there are some multi-year contracts, but also many of
the majority is one-year contract, so the exposure will decrease over time. That's
something where I can give you assurance already. But as I said also it's not gone in 2021,
it will still be there to some extent at least. The difficulty in measuring the exposures in
these lines of business always is that it's not one of you -- if you have a claim or not, but
there are many in between depending, if really an event is giving notice early on, then the
claim is different than if you really get a notification of a cancellation very late, a
postponement is different and then something being canceled quite away and so it's not
about the exposure, but the question is what will really be the impact or the extra claim is
and that's a lot of query areas between the zero and the one, that's what makes it little
more difficult to assess.
So in that sense, I can only tell you, it will be shrinking over time the exposure, but as long
as there is a second wave or potential third wave, we will continue to incur claims.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Okay. And the breakdown of EUR2.1 billion figure for the nine months?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Well, as I mentioned already in the beginning, I cannot give you detailed figures, but the
biggest number is contingency. The second biggest is property, which is BI and then other
lines are smaller.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.

A - Becker-Hussong

{BIO 19080254 <GO>}

Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Kamran Hossain from RBC has our next question. Please go ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. The first question is just on I guess total COVID reserves. I guess you
kind of 85% IBNR in P&C. At this stage, is that kind of relatively easier points about -- kind
of how few case reserves or how many kind of advice losses for this stage or is that
normal, I'm just trying to work out if we got normal mean decrease in services and kind of

Page 6 of 15



Company N ame: M uenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG in M uenchen
Company Ticker: M UV2 GR Equity
Date: 2020-11-05

plus 4% reserve release on top of that or you've got Munich Re plus costs given the huge
range of uncertainty?

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

And then the second question, coming back to kind of points on quantifying some of the
losses, I'm sure you have brought this number out, but if you assume that all events
canceled for this year, for 2020, that have not already been counted. What does the
number look like? Is it smaller than Q3 or not? Thank you.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yeah. The first question, 85% IBNR supplies the normal. I think that's a very subjective
question, so I can only -- I'll give you my personal thought and I cannot guarantee that
there is not other people having other expectations and would be surprised by other
things than I am. But the way I personally look at it, I would have maybe expected some
more notifications already coming in now after three quarters, so in that sense, I am a
little bit surprised. If you look at the business, I mean in this 85%, I mean we cover both
primary as well as reinsurance because you know that out of the second reinsurance, we
also got in the primary business and especially on the reinsurance part of the business, I
would have expected more notifications to come in already. Finally, we are in close
contact with our clients anyway, but on the reinsurance side, so we have re-talked to the
primary insurance, I probably would have expected some more information or some more
notifications already at this point in time.
Your second question was the exposure until year-end. I can only give you a structural
answer and the structural answer is that for this year, as I said, we reserved for all the
events. We are aware of already that they will be canceled this year. So structurally that
should cover a lot of events happening in Q4 already. On the other hand, in Q4, we will
have to make up our minds and look at the information we will be getting about events
next year and this might then also increase the necessity to set up reserves in Q4, so
that's a twofold answer to your question. For this single year, I would expect less in the
fourth quarter, but then there will be the need to set up reserves for 2021 already and
there I would expect also a quite significant number.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

That's great, thanks very much.

Operator
Thank you. We now move on to Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous Research for our next
question. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi there, if I could change topics Christoph and take you back to your old job at ERGO,
could you just give us a perspective on any impacts to earnings power and in particular,
any sort of additional impact this year from increased said that are contributions at ERGO
is Life and Health business and whether that will positive or negative, it could be a positive
because of higher gains to be realized, but just -- I just would like an updated perspective

given the low rate environment on ERGO Life and Health if possible. And the second
question, do you have any sense as to the trajectory of the Munich Re AG distributable
reserves this year, I guess you benefit from equalization reserves being drawn down,
albeit there aren't as many of those backing contingency as same property. So I'm
struggling to work out how resilient the AG profit should be this year relative to a sort of a
heavy calendar year. Thanks.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yeah, Andrew, thank you for your questions. ERGO Life back book, first of all, I have to -- I
think the headline would be that the life back book is profitable in the foreseeable future
and largely immune to further distortions as we see from the low-interest rate phase. Why
is that? A number of reasons for that. First of all, we have a big stock of [ph]set already.
The increase this year is expected to be of the same order of magnitude as the last year,
so not significantly bigger and the stock we had already end of last year was more than
EUR6 billion, we would expect to be at the end of this year at around EUR7 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

So quite a significant number, which helps of course to drive down the average interest
rate guarantee anyway. On top of that, we have been applying hedging measures,
swaptions already for more than a decade or more than 15 years in the meantime,
thereby mitigating the effect of the lower interest rates consistently over time.
Reinsurance means reinsurance measures are applied very regularly there and there we
are benefiting also from the knowledge and expertise we have it on the reinsurance side,
which helps us to stabilize earnings and hedging the guarantees of our back book.
So, in that sense, I can -- I think I can (technical difficulty) some of the concerns you were
raising just by the fact that this book is being stabilized very much and that's really how we
look at also into the future. Distributable earnings, first of all, as you know, we have a stock
of distributable earnings and the way we managed local GAAP anyways in a way that we
are not overly -- do not look too much on the single year results as we can balance due to
the stock of distributable earnings we have anyway. For the current year, you're right, the
number of effects we mentioned first of all, yes, the equalization reserve will help in many
lines of business, but there are other lines like contingency where there is not a big stock,
so claims will also be visible in local GAAP, at least to some extent.
At the same time, I also remind you that also the investment (technical difficulty) is very
much different in local GAAP to IFRS, so also there are some differences to be expected.
Overall, I think it's too early to speak really about the year-end local GAAP result, but do I
see anything holding us back from sticking to our capital management to achieve? No, not
at all.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Hello, good morning to everyone. Two questions, both I think on ERGO, first of all the FX
loss of around EUR100 million incurred, the majority of which is ERGO, can you explain
where this FX loss has come from and the devaluation of the US dollar? And if I
understood correctly, you also incurred derivative loss at ERGO, does this come from the
lower interest rates? Second question, I did not see any figures regarding new business
generation at ERGO Life in the third quarter? Can you tell us -- can you give us a little bit
of sense of how new business generation even in the nine months, how it has worked?

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, Michael, thank you for the question. First of all, FX, overall wide EUR100 million loss,
that the bigger share at ERGO and the ERGO FX development is indeed US dollar-driven.
The Reinsurance FX development is not US dollar-driven. The ERGO piece is US dollardriven. You have to be careful looking at our numbers. The ERGO FX result, as we show it
in our IFRS P&L is a pre-policyholder share number, so only 10% of that is really affecting
net income, just the way we present it in the IFRS P&L is a little bit misleading here.
Therefore, I would say it's not a big topic at ERGO, where does it come from? It comes
from investments with us in the US dollar, so no liability impact or anything, it is really on
the investment side and ERGO applies a core loss strategy in hedging the FX. So around
a bit point, there is a certain range in that the FX effect is fully at risk, fully visible in the P&L
and beyond that color then, it hedged and ERGO is doing that so to reduce hedging costs
obviously and the volatility, as I said 10% of the demand only is affecting the P&L is
something ERGO can digest and it's completely within the risk appetite at that area. On
the reinsurance side, the FX loss has to do with emerging market currencies, not with the
US dollar, which is maybe a little bit surprising given the fact that we have a lot of business
in the United States. The point is that here I think the exposure management of our
colleagues worked pretty well.
The second question, was I think new business at ERGO.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Yes, Ergo Life and Health.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Ergo Life and Health specifically, ho sorry. I think overall what I can say is that we are happy
with new business at ERGO. I would say it's across all lines of business, it's pretty stable
compared to prior year despite COVID-19 and then there are certain ups and downs
between the different lines of business, where life insurance is probably falling a little bit
behind P&C, but overall I think it's a very good result that ERGO was able to stabilize new
business given the lockdown situations we have now for the second time already in
Germany.
Okay, thank you very much.

We now move on to Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca for our next question. Please go
ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good morning. Thank you. And hope everybody is well. So my two questions, first
one will be on the realized gains. I can see EUR321 million in fixed income in this quarter
and I would assume that to the AFS fixed income move of around EUR306 million and
then when I look at in context of sharp fall in reinvestment yield 1.3% now, also I note
comment that you're increasing infrastructure private equity ABS, I mean the whole
picture seems that how are you balancing realizations of gains and the reinvestment plus
some re-risking? If you could comment a bit about this whole asset side it would be very
helpful.
Second question is just on life mortality, I mean recent trends, at least last few weeks if
you have any views -- I mean the thing is, I'm trying to understand if we know that the
portfolio and the population are different things, but has the difference being increasing in
your experience recently in October maybe or would you still say that it's sort of similar
and one should keep expecting that and in that context of life, I could also ask your
Australian positive comments was quite remarkable given we think some of your peers
report how they were under pressure in Australia this quarter, if you could also comment
that? Thank you.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yeah, Vinit. Thank you for the questions. First of all, realized gains, I think the general
remark is we don't realize gains for increasing our earnings, so we only do that if there is a
need to do so, either because we have to have to fund something on the liability side, so
this (inaudible) is the most famous example or we do so because it's unavoidable in case
you want to restructure our asset portfolio. In that sense, the realized gains on fixed
income instruments are more happening, in the essence, unavoidable, then they are
really steered in order to achieve a certain result. Having said that, I think you mentioned a
lot about investment activities, which are ongoing. We have been selling some Germancovered bonds from Germany, in order to go into riskier assets and re-risking also on that
side. We increased slightly our equity exposure again, that's something we did and, of
course, continue to increase our engagement in illiquid assets and that's also an ongoing
activity. Overall, I think it's still fair to say that the asset risks is overall stable, we rely a lot
on diversification here and across all the various books we are having, but this increased
diversification is particularly important given the low yield environment, you have also
been mentioning.
Life mortality, your question was, if the difference between our book and the general
population, if this has changed. I think that my answer would be no, pretty stable and it's
Page 10 of 15

put in line with what we expected in the first place and then your question on Australia,
indeed this quarter was to be 91 in Australia, but I just remind you we also had already
other quarters this year, so I would not extrapolate that too much, but enjoy with us, that
we had a good quarter in Australia at this time.

Thank you. We move on to Thomas Fossard from HSBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes, good morning all. Two questions, the first one would be on Solvency II versus IFRS
related to COVID-19 losses to the risk of restarted discussion of Q2, but could you refresh
our mind on how your Solvency II ratio at Q3 is forward-looking in terms of taking into
account some of the expectations for additional COVID-19 losses especially on the life
side.

And the second question would be related as well to the outlook for life and has reCOVID-19 losses in your slide pike, your pointing to potential disability claims and some
offset from UK longevity, so could you help us to put some numbers behind, especially for
2021 and how UK longevity could be an offset in the coming quarters. Thank you.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. First, Solvency II versus IFRS, I start with life. On the life side, we did not set up
an additional for Solvency II if you compared with IFRS, also looking into the future why
didn't we do that, we have on top reserve which anyway easily covers potential
developments going forward and therefore we just didn't see any need to set up an
additional reserve, so it's all fully covered. We have an additional pike reserve, that's how
we call it anyway, for example, covering mortality risks of all. On the P&C side, the
situation is quite similar I must say, there also we enjoy pike reserves, which we have and
which are also easily covering adverse developments, by the way these reserves are not
only booked in Solvency II, we also have them for IFRS purposes. So in that sense, we
didn't see any need standing up additional reserves for Solvency II purposes, where
theoretically you would need to look a little bit more into the future because we are so
highly confident that the reserve level we are having is in any case more than sufficient.
Disability and mortality, wasn't that?

Yeah, longevity offset.

Yeah, so I think we -- what we have in our presentation, is that remark that at least so far
in the UK we are enjoying diversification between longevity and mortality, which is more or
less setting off each other, so no big impact in the UK business, at least until today and
similar we mark on disability, so far we did not see any increased disability claims. Of
course, you cannot hold that out. Also, the link is obviously a little bit more indirect than for
mortality claims, because what's happening is usually that you have some economic
downturn, higher unemployment rates, things like that, and then disability comes in, that's
something we do not see yet, but obviously, that's a risk and that's why we wanted to
mention that risk on our slide.

Thank you. We'll take another question from Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays. Please go
ahead, your line is open.

Hi, good morning, thank you. I've got two questions, the first one would be on the
frequency benefits that many of the primary insurers have seen from the COVID and now
that might continue with the second lockdown. Just wanted to see how you think about
that, whether they are starting to weigh in some buffers on the balance sheet of weather
due to the nature of the business you're right, it's not that applicable.
And secondly, just a follow up on those life mortality questions. Just trying to understand
this run rate of EUR100 million of COVID provisions in the life and health book that follows
the mortality experience. Is it therefore rational to expect it in the coming quarters until
we have some form of resolution for the pandemic, either the vaccine or something else?

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Sure. So let's start with the second question. I think what we can see is that the
development of our claims is pretty much following the reporting. You can also read in
newspaper, it is very much focused on the US. So to some extent, of course, it's not
precise, but to some extent if you follow and what happened in the US so far and
extrapolated in the future and then look at our claims numbers, I think you would not be
completely misled by doing that. Yeah, that's what I can say on mortality.
Can you remind me of your first question, please?

Q - Ivan Bokhmat

{BIO 15378004 <GO>}

It was on the frequency benefit in P&C.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yeah, so frequency (multiple speakers)

Q - Ivan Bokhmat

{BIO 15378004 <GO>}

Where do you see it -- in ERGO, where do you see it and in reinsurance, how do you
account that?

FINAL

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

In reinsurance, we don't see a lot, reason is that we have -- in many of our proportionately
sliding scales, which means that the benefit of frequency -- the frequency of benefits we
mean with the primary insurer. On ERGO side, we see some of these, but then you have
to look at them in the light of the COVID claims, ERGO also has -- so my overall
commentary was COVID-19 insignificant at an ERGO level, which includes, on the onehand side COVID claims, on the other hand some offsetting benefits, also from the
frequency side.

Q - Ivan Bokhmat

{BIO 15378004 <GO>}

Thank you.

Thank you. And we take a follow-up question from Vikram Gandhi from Societe Generale.
Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Hi, thank you for the opportunity. Just one from me, I'm much surprised that despite
significant reserve buffers, the group never really utilizes them to smooth the P&L. I
appreciate you don't want to really weaken, what is the essence of a strong balance
sheet, but I guess it would be a good messaging to the market, the management is
willing to dampen the volatility were necessary. So perhaps a word on that topic would be
helpful.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Well, I mean -- I think we could have a long debate about that. I mean is it good to
maintain a strong balance sheet or is it better to do use it sometimes. I think either way
you could be in favor of either of the two ways, so I mean -- I'm glad we agree that we
are having a very, very conservative and very reserve strong strong balance sheet in the
first place, but would I easily use that, no I wouldn't because in case additional downside
would occur, I would probably give up my options and I don't see any advantage in that.
So, we've been seeing many, many developments in the past, which you'd be easily able
to digest based on that with our strength and all these discussions are on Solvency II, we
don't have to have them because always we are strong enough anyway, so I think it's a
very comfortable position and a very good place to be at.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Either I'm connected to COVID, you would be glad to know or maybe distantly connected.
There's been a lot of talk about increased cyber losses across the industry over 2020 and
especially Q3 front losses in particular, given your sizable market position in cyber, it
doesn't appear to have affected your results, but can you give us any sense, so whether
you've observed that or whether it's called any issues in the profitability of your cyber
book, that would be helpful. Thank you.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, thank you for the question. Yeah, I must say we hear that as well, but only in a
sense, we hear it (inaudible) something, so we do not have any indication in our book of
this development, neither on the primary side nor on the reinsurance side and you know
we a write-off of cyber cover in both our primary as was on the reinsurance operations.
On the primary side, we are also that close to the customers and clients, that we in any
case should know it already if it would affect us. On the reinsurance side, there might be
potentially delays, so maybe there is something we don't see yet, but even if there was
something, I think the profitability of our book overall would be fully intact.
