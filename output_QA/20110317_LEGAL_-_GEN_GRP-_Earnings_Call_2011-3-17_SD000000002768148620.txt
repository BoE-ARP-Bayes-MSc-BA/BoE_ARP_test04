Presentation
Operator
Hello and welcome to today's Legal & General preliminary results 2010 technical
conference call. During this call all participants will be in listen-only mode. After the
presentation there will be an opportunity for questions.
I will now hand you over to your first speaker, Matt Hotson, Director of Investor Relations.
Matt, over to you.

Matt Hotson

{BIO 15471425 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Good to see a number of you on the line. We
thought this morning's results were reasonably straightforward. And I guess, the calls that
we got this morning didn't throw a huge amount of difficult problems that we have taken
into this afternoon's session. Although we have had one or two queries that we are going
to walk through first.
The same format as we have done before. We will sort of do a listen-only Q&A session
where I will read the question, and some of the technical experts who I've got in the room
with me here will answer. Then we will open up the call to any other questions that people
have got after that.

So with no further ado, we will kick off. The first two or three questions are regarding
some of the actuarial reserving and modeling, which Tim Stedman is going to answer. First
of all, on BPA data loading. What is it and how is the GBP59 million positive effect from
BPA data loading, how should we think about that going forward?

FINAL

Tim Stedman

{BIO 19448392 <GO>}

So what is it? I think most of you are fairly familiar, but when we write a BPA contact it does
take us a period of time before we can finalize the scheme data with the trustees, and
finally load that data onto our admin systems.
We don't take any material risk against that data, but until we've got certainty over it, we
hold some prudence within the reserves for just the uncertainty around the data. Once
the scheme is loaded we can release that prudence.
So toward the end of 2008 and early 2009 we wrote a fairly significant number of
schemes which we couldn't load onto the admin systems in the short term. Those
schemes during 2010 went through the loading and verification process. And so we were
able to release the prudence in the reserves and that is what you can see coming through
today.

Matt Hotson

{BIO 15471425 <GO>}

Okay, next question is on inflation modeling benefit. Where there are some numbers in
the accounts specifically what have we changed in order to produce that benefit. Tim
again.

Tim Stedman

{BIO 19448392 <GO>}

This was something that came through at the half-year. As we said then, we prefer[ph] a
rolling program of reviewing our models. In the first half of 2010 we looked at the inflation
modeling around deferred annuities, and there were two elements where we were able
to improve the modeling.
First of that relates to the inflation of benefits just in the year prior to retirement, where
actually -- the benefits stop inflating sort of six to nine months before the contract vests,
but the models were assuming that the benefits continued to inflate. So we basically
improved the modeling around that, which released some liability.
And the second thing that we did was improve the modeling around our cap and collar
benefits. These are ones where increases are capped at a certain rate of increase, and if
inflation goes above that then the cap kicks in. And in some of those we found in some
instances we are adding a bit too much inflation, sort of exceeding the cap. So we were
prudent -- and again, we have improved the modeling there. And the net effect of both of
those added up to GBP84 million.

Matt Hotson

{BIO 15471425 <GO>}

Then the final one in this area is the GBP43 million reserve release in protection.

FINAL

Tim Stedman

{BIO 19448392 <GO>}

The vast bulk of this relates to a release of margin, again, at the half-year around
improving our modeling of waiver of premium. Then towards the end of year when we
reviewed the basis for the sort of standard sort of annual review there were a few other
small items plus and minus.

Matt Hotson

{BIO 15471425 <GO>}

Okay, moving on to a question, which I think got raised briefly this morning, but a bit of
follow-up questions on it in terms of the interplay between the increase in the Euro CP
paper and the reduction in the Triple X reserves, which John Whorwood, Group Treasurer,
is going to respond to.

Bloomberg Transcript

John Whorwood

{BIO 15470378 <GO>}

The question related to actually the full effect last year of the Triple X -- the first
securitization in terms of the Triple X Group of the Potomac Dutch Auction securities. And
we financed that while producing commercial paper. So we spent a total of $360 million
on buying back notes, and that represented the $440 million par value of the total $550
million securitization. And that was financed by using CP. So the principal reason for the
increase in our CP at the year-end relates to that.
At the same time you will have seen that the nonrecourse Triple X debt on the balance
sheet relates to the Fairmac[ph] issue, also reduced by the (inaudible) we actually
purchased.
There was a gain on the buyback circa[ph] 80 million, and that was reflected in the
international investment payers[ph] which reported a figure of 28 million of the 35 million
reported in 2010 that was vested[ph] in 2009 as well.
So we did talk about in the call earlier this year about the US capital restructuring that we
are able to replace the Potomac Triple-X financing with an internal Triple-X reinsurance
solution. And that allowed us to repay the Potomac notes.

Matt Hotson

{BIO 15471425 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, John. A couple of questions on the assets backing the annuity portfolio.
One on the increase in sovereigns, or relative increase in sovereigns. Was that a Solvency
II preplanning issue which Paul Stanwick[ph] is going to pick up.

Paul Stanwick
Page 3 of 12



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C

FINAL

Thanks, Matt. The answer to that question is that we actually did the trade because we
felt it was an economically sensible trade to do, not because of a Solvency II requirement.
The basis of the trade was the disconnection in the markets between the level of swaps,
the level of gilts, and the level of credit between short-dated and long-dated assets. We
felt that long dated gilts reflected a better return over swaps than the short-dated credit
that we had.
We executed the transaction, and the reason it came out neutral on earnings is just the
way that the risk premium is reflected back in through the results.

Matt Hotson

{BIO 15471425 <GO>}

Okay, moving on to the disclosures on PIIGS Bank Tier 1 debt, and we have had a followup question on how that -- does that include the exposures within the CDO, which Justin
Brown is going to pick up.

Justin Brown

{BIO 19943344 <GO>}

First of all on the PIIGS' and the Group's coordinated bank exposures it is for debt
securities only, i.e., we do not look to the reference entities in the CDOs.

Bloomberg Transcript

We think this is a reasonable approach is the subordination in the CDO structures. I mean,
that losses on the reference entities are diluted from a shareholder perspective, and
hence are not a natural fit for the debt securities table.
For the CDOs, the (inaudible) CDOs reflect the underlying risks in the reference entities.
On this basis it is fair to conclude that the proportion of subordinated holdings in the
CDOs is not material. Therefore, the majority of the CDO portfolio will have no exposure
to Tier 1.

Matt Hotson

{BIO 15471425 <GO>}

Okay, moving on to cash flow and our cash flow disclosure, I think this is a question from
Oliver at Deutsche about the difference between the disclosure we gave last year and
the disclosure we gave this year in terms of the 2011 and 2012 VIF utilization profiles and
just trying to explain the difference. Wadham Downing is going to attempt an explanation
to that.

Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

Thanks, Matt. The difference between the numbers is almost entirely due to the change in
the profile of the models, one-off short-term capital releases, which are not included in
the operational cash generation numbers.
These items are expected to manifest in experience and/or investment variances and
augment the IGD surplus. They primarily relate to the model benefit that brought forward
tax losses in LGAS and over time should reduce to zero. The expected operational cash
Page 4 of 12



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C
Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2011-03-17

flows remain broadly in line with what was disclosed in the half-year 2010 and the full-year
2009 numbers.

FINAL

Matt Hotson

{BIO 15471425 <GO>}

Okey. Another quick one for Wadham, which was a follow-on from Andy Hughes' question
at Exane this morning on how much of the EV is annuity rated. Nigel said 2 billion. We
thought we would just check that.

Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

Yes. The disclosure you gave is for GBP4.2 billion and use of[ph] this element before cost
of capital is, in fact, GBP2 billion. After cost of capital the numbers are GBP3.9 billion and
GBP1.7 billion, respectively.

Matt Hotson

{BIO 15471425 <GO>}

Okay, on to tax. A couple questions on tax for Simon Burke. So does having the use of
losses have an impact on the EEV effective tax rate? And what ratio would be applied to
the EV results in 2011?

Bloomberg Transcript

Simon Burke

{BIO 19146780 <GO>}

Thanks, Matt. There is no impact on the tax rate and EV profit from the losses in 2010.
That is very similar to the first[ph] impact. In terms of modeling the EV results, I would use
the statutory tax rate going forward.

Matt Hotson

{BIO 15471425 <GO>}

The second one on tax -- on deferred taxes. This is one from Raghu at Citi. Reconciliation
of the GBP300 million fall in the deferred tax asset on the asset side with the changes in
the P&L, which were GBP125 million in Risk, and GBP39 million in Savings, and how does
that all stack up again? Simon Burke.

Simon Burke

{BIO 19146780 <GO>}

So those numbers refer to the movement in deferred tax in operating profit, the GBP125
million and the GBP39 million, whereas the GBP300 million or GBP301 million, actually,
movement on the IFRS balance sheet is the total. So the difference between what has
gone through operating profit and the total balance sheet movement is investment
variance.

Matt Hotson

{BIO 15471425 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. So moving back now to the final -- prepared question we've got was on
the change to the new CMIB tables. What was it, and have we adjusted other margins on
that basis? That is one back to Tim Stedman.
Page 5 of 12



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C
Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2011-03-17

Tim Stedman

{BIO 19448392 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, so the GBP59 million charge includes the cost of both updating the tables, together
with changes to the base used to reflect 2010 experience. I think I would remind you that
we took about a GBP90 million positive for experience last year. And we don't really think
that the GBP59 million charge is massively material in the context of a book of GBP25
billion.
Generally, we are happy -- or we were happy with the level of prudence in our annuitant
mortality basis. So the changes in the base tables and the parametization of the CMI
model have given a broadly neutral cost. But we think that the new tables have got a
much better shape.

Matt Hotson

{BIO 15471425 <GO>}

Okay, that's the end of the sort of pre-sent in questions we have. We've got a couple of
other ones that I got from Raghu, which we need a little bit of time to think about on
contingent loans and impact of annuitant rates on one or two things, which we will come
back to separately.
But we will now open the call up to questions if anybody else has got anything else they
want us to give a view on. Back over to you, Hugh.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Oliver Steel, Deutsche Bank.

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

A very simple question, which is, do you have a figure for total assets under management
or assets under administration? I've got the GBP353 billion that you described for LGIM.
You've got another GBP11 billion of retail and other. Does that include all of the annuity
business, all of the Savings business for which you give separate inflows disclosure?

A - Matt Hotson

{BIO 15471425 <GO>}

I can probably answer that, which is rare on a technical call, so I'll make the most of it. The
GBP354 billion in LGIM is the assets that LGIM manages. That includes all of LGIM's client
money, which is in total, I think from memory, is the pack of about GBP260 billion. That is
75% of that number.
It also includes all of the annuity assets. It includes the vast majority of the Savings assets,
although there are some Savings contracts where they have been sold with an open
market option, so there are some funds that go to other asset managers. And it includes
all of the shareholder funds as well.

Page 6 of 12



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C
Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2011-03-17

If you reconcile all those numbers together you should get to something around the
GBP354 billion. So I think the total number is the quoted number four LGIM.

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thanks.

Operator
Blair Stewart, Banc of America; Merrill Lynch.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Just one question. Just on the movement in non-cash items for Risk. It is mainly the
deferred tax movement, it went from (221) negative to (125) negative. What is the best
guidance you can give on how that number is going to move over the next couple of
years. Thanks.

A - Matt Hotson

{BIO 15471425 <GO>}

Okay, I will pass that one over to Simon Burke, Head of Group Tax.

A - Simon Burke

{BIO 19146780 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well are you asking about the impact on operational cash generation or just literally on
(inaudible)?

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

No. The operational cash generation, I think you have been clear about the GBP60 million
benefit that will drop away in 2013, if I'm not wrong. It is just really on that line item, is that
just going to gradually go down to zero or how should we model that?

A - Simon Burke

{BIO 19146780 <GO>}

I would have thought it would run at about that level for a couple more years.

A - Unidentified Speaker
I would say the core part of it will probably run down probably by 2013, (inaudible).

A - Matt Hotson

{BIO 15471425 <GO>}

So the deferred tax asset is really made up of a short-term element and a long-term
element. The short-term relates to the losses on the LGPL set-up and taking of the
increased default rates. They will run off until about 2013. The longer-term element is a
whole lot of other things, which runs on into 2020, from memory. I think we did answer
that question about this time last year.

Page 7 of 12



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C
Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2011-03-17

So I guess there is a reasonable amount of short-term of element in that -- in the Risk
part, which will fall off in 2013, and then it will be reasonably flat for a few years to come.

FINAL

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay, so it stays at around current levels for a couple of years than maybe drops down a
step, and then stays at a lower level after that. Is that -- would that be a fair approach,
probably correct?

A - Unidentified Speaker
Yes.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Super, thanks.

Operator
Greig Paterson, KBW.

Q - Greig Paterson

Bloomberg Transcript

Just two questions. One is the annuity margin was reasonably flat year-on-year, but you
put through a mortality strengthening. So I was wondering just what the other items were
that there must have been a big positive there?
The other point is, just so I can get a feel for what the change in the mortality was, I
wonder if you could say, if it was a standard 65-year-old male what is the expectation of
life now in the reserves and what was it before then on the EV as well?

A - Matt Hotson

{BIO 15471425 <GO>}

I've got a few people just scrambling through packs, just to try and find the answers. I
think the 65-year-old male numbers are in the pack, which somebody -- Tim is --.

A - Tim Stedman

{BIO 19448392 <GO>}

Page 91, I think.

A - Matt Hotson

{BIO 15471425 <GO>}

Page 91 of the pack. But Tim can just give you the quick headlines.

A - Tim Stedman

{BIO 19448392 <GO>}

Best estimate 24 years, last year 24.5. And on the reserving basis this year 25.6, and last
year 25.7. (multiple speakers).

Q - Greig Paterson
Page 8 of 12



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C
Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2011-03-17

Sorry, say that again. So on the EV there was a significant change. There was not much
change on the statutory (inaudible) side.

A - Tim Stedman

{BIO 19448392 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, broadly. If you call half a year significant.

Q - Greig Paterson
Then so why did the annuity margin not go down?

A - Tim Stedman

{BIO 19448392 <GO>}

I think the margin is made up of a number of things. Obviously, it is business mix, the price
you charge in the market. To some extent, I think we knew some of these changes were
going to be coming, so they got reflected in prices during the course of the year.

A - Unidentified Speaker
The GBP59 million is spread across the whole book, so, therefore the impact on new
business is relatively trivial. And I believe we have been probably pricing recent new
business closer to the CMIB tables, and therefore the impact is diluted even more.

Q - Greig Paterson

Bloomberg Transcript

So you pulled back your pricing (type) thing?

A - Unidentified Speaker
Yes, so the pricing effect of the new mortality tables was already in there before the
charge at the year-end.

Q - Greig Paterson
Should that not have hurt volumes quite materially or did everyone follow you type thing?

A - Unidentified Speaker
Well it clearly hasn't hurt margins.

Q - Greig Paterson
Volumes, volumes. I'm just trying to understand.

A - Unidentified Speaker
I think the militarily change in isolation would have a pretty small impact on the price.

Q - Greig Paterson
All right. Thank you.

Operator
Before we go into onto Andy Hughes from Exane BNP Paribas, (Operator Instructions) And
Andy, over to you.

FINAL

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

(inaudible) talking about shares; that was quite funny. Just a couple of questions. Just a
clarification on the EV number. So I take the GBP1.7 million net of tax, presumably I need to
add GBP1 billion required capital. So the annuity EV and total is GBP2.7 billion. Is that
correct -- out of 6.2 or 6.3?

A - Unidentified Speaker
We had a figure of GBP300 million for capital.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Just taking 4% of GBP25 billion of reserves, is that --?

A - Unidentified Speaker
It is cost of capital, not total capital.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

But I need to add -- the GBP1.7 billion is the VIF, net of cost of capital, and I would need to
add it on the required capital to get to the EV for the annuity portfolio, which presumably
is (multiple speakers).

A - Unidentified Speaker
We will clarify that for you (multiple speakers).
The numbers that Wadham quoted are the VIF, the annuity element of the VIF. If you want
a number back on the total EV, we can come back with a (inaudible) number. Your
methodology sound sensible. Let's just take it that way and just come back to you.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

The other question is following on from Greg's question, I guess, on the change in
longevity tables. You have obviously reduced prudence and the best estimate
assumptions and also in the reserving assumptions at older ages, (now) age 65.
I'm assuming that it is a net thing, so your GBP58 million is a big strengthening at younger
ages for the deferred annuities and the kind of relaxation at older ages. Could you break
down the GBP58 million and break down what is going on?
Because, obviously, it is a bit surprising that your numbers you show on page 91 actually
shows things being released. Because, obviously, you'd expect these numbers to go up
Page 10 of 12



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C
Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2011-03-17

over time as mortality improvements come in. And you've gone from 24.5 for best
estimate 65 down to 24, and from 25.7 to 25.6 on the reserving, which sort of suggests
you have released reserves, rather than added to reserves for these lines of business.
Thank you.

FINAL

A - Unidentified Speaker
As we said, the new tables changed the shape, and in our view to a better shape. We
give that 65-year-old number to try and help people out, but clearly it is not particularly
indicative of the whole range of annuitant mortality that we are assessing.
Your theories sound sensible, but we're probably not going to give a huge amount of
data in terms of breakdown in numbers below the GBP59 million.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Do you know what has happened at younger ages? Has there been a more significant
shift in the younger age. I mean, so if you're thinking about 40-year-old effectively, I mean,
has that life expectancy gone up a lot on both the EV and the reserving?
I guess the problem is, I don't -- I can probably guess what has happened to reserving,
but I don't know what has happened to the best estimate assumptions. Have they moved
to a minimum rate of 2% as well?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Unidentified Speaker
I haven't got any numbers for other ages in front of me, sorry. I think generally what we
saw when we moved from the MC table to the new CMI table was that MC seems to be
particularly penal for verily very old ages, sort of 80 and above. So that has resulted in a
shift to different ages. But Matt is right, we picked a point age. There other ages and the
effects are different across the age range.

A - Matt Hotson

{BIO 15471425 <GO>}

Well we will have to talk some more about it, Andy, if you're still concerned.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

No. It is just a bit odd, basically, because the data you have given gives the opposite
effect to the one you have actually put in terms of changing the tables.

A - Matt Hotson

{BIO 15471425 <GO>}

It is just a function of the shape of the disclosure. It is a fair point. We can think about a
better disclosure statement, which gives us more sense of the shape.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Thank you.
