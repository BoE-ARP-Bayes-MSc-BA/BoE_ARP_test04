{BIO 19080254 <GO>}

Thanks for joining us for our Q3 earnings call. Today, a very simple procedure, as always,
very straightforward, after my short introduction, we will hand it over to Jörg – or rather to
your questions. And we will go right into Q&A. And may I please ask you, as always, to limit
your questions to two per person in order to give everybody a fair chance to raise
questions. So, thanks for that. And then I'll give it back to Sylvia, and we can start with the
Q&A right away.

Thank you, sir. Thank you. We will take our first question, Nadine van der Meulen from
Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Nadine van der Meulen

{BIO 15200446 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I suppose, firstly, perhaps you
can comment on your expectations on sort of broad based pricing into next year, and

maybe not just on the loss impact areas, but also outside of the U.S., and (01:47) but
casualty, et cetera, so in different lines of businesses. Any anecdotal comments will be
very much appreciated.
And then the – yeah, and then perhaps also in light of retrocession cost, to what extent
you see that going up for you next year or maybe now with the renewals already that
you've done. And then, the second question is on Life and Health Re, that continues to be
impacted by negative captures in the U.S.. When should we expect this to turn around?
Thank you very much.

A - Jörg Schneider

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Nadine. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Our expectation for the
development of the pricing, especially in the incoming renewal round for January 2018,
overall, I must say we are optimistic after five years with very low nat cat losses, we saw
price declines since 2013, albeit at a lowering pace. In the most recent nat cat events, a
lot of capital has been destroyed; a lot will at least be trapped for a couple of months. But
there's also capital spending at the sideline. But when it comes in it, will come in with high
return expectations.
So, overall, the background for the negotiations is substantially improved. We see positive
dynamics for the worldwide insurance market. But competition is still strong. As we are at
an early stage of the January 2018 renewal season, we can only talk about trends. I hear
one or two examples each day from my colleagues where we see substantial rate
increases, but I do not want to fuel an unrealistic fantasy here. Overall, prices should at
least stay flat. That is the least we can say overall wherever we look. Price reductions will
not be accepted anymore in that market. The extent of the price increases will depend on
the individual segments and/or whether losses have occurred or not. So, the closer to the
events, the closer to Southeastern USA and Caribbean, the higher the price increases will
be. But any quantification would be unrealistic at this point in time.
With regard to the retrocession costs, they will also go up. For Munich Re, this is not a
major issue. As you know, we are a gross-equals-net writer and, therefore, also the relief
from retrocession from the enormous loss costs of this quarter is somewhat limited. And
therefore, we are not so sensitive here yet. So, we will see, we are, in a way, somewhat
opportunistic here. The more attractive the terms are the more we will buy and vice versa,
but we are absolutely not dependent. That is currently an advantage of Munich Re.
With regard to Life and Health Re, we've been doing active portfolio management for a
couple of years now, and it's, in a way, by chance that we see now a kind of accumulation
at the moment here. And if I may add, we took the most worrying contracts and
concentrated our efforts in the negotiation with the respective clients.
So, therefore, I do not expect the current pace to go on like that. We are flexible, we do
not have a budget, we do not have a timing. What you don't see in the numbers is that
we also talk with our clients on price increases. When these happen, they will typically not
have an impact on our IFRS numbers of a given quarter. So, therefore, it's very active
scene and very difficult to predict. There might be additional recaptures, but currently, as

little bit, Nadine.

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Thank you very much. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. The first
one will be on the development of your Solvency II ratio, despite the very large losses,
that is down only 3 percentage points. And I understand that you do have some positives
from the recapture in Life Re and some others. If you quantify some of that, that would be
very nice.
And then, secondly, on all of these press reports, we have been hearing about ERGO, the
German Life, the runoff portfolios, where do we stand with regards to a potential sale of
those portfolios? What is the rationale for selling those? And if you potentially give us an
idea of what the Solvency II benefit could be from a sale of those very large portfolios
that would be helpful. Thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider
Good afternoon, Paris. Thank you for your questions. First: Solvency II development. Yes, I
also admit that I saw with some pleasure that our Solvency II ratio went down by only 3
percentage points from 261% to 258% of the SCR, and this in a situation where the major
loss impact was very substantial, so clearly, north of 10 percentage point. But you correctly
quoted one of the positive countervailing effect that was the beneficial impact from the
in-force management measures in our Life Reinsurance business.
Also, we had economic earnings coming in as expected in all other areas except for
property-casualty reinsurance. And at the same time, the solvency capital requirement
declined a little due to various effects, one of the decline of the eligible owned funds as
well as decline of the SCR was due to currency effects, which were relevant in more or
less all categories of our risks.
But I would also like to emphasize market rates went down due to the increase in interest
rates and a slight decrease of credit spreads. And credit here, that should be mentioned
also, the tightening of credit spreads had a positive impact on the eligible owned funds as

FINAL

well as the positive impact with regard to a decline of the solvency capital requirement.
That was an important driver of this mitigation of the hurricane loss effects.
Second question about German Life, the closed ERGO classical book; in June 2016, we
had announced that we would separate the management of our traditional life insurance
portfolio from our new business and pool this in another organizational unit. And even at
that time, we had not entirely ruled out the sale of this business as a strategic option.
Currently, we are sounding out all the opportunities and, meanwhile, we also got first
indicative offers from interested parties, but it's much too early to speculate about the
fact whether the overall view on the topic is attractive.
Potential benefit would be reduction of the SCR. The impact of the eligible owned funds
would be dependent on the purchase price, but after diversification, the SCR effect could
be somewhere around 20% of our overall SCR. It's not so easy to calculate due to the
enormous diversification effects which play substantial role.
For IFRS, the impact would be dependent also on a potential purchase price. But, please, I
beg for your understanding that I do not want to speculate on specific numbers now
because it's much too early, and such a sale would only happen if we achieve very good
solutions, not only for the number from the number side, but also in the interest of our
clients, employees and sales forces. Therefore, it's still a long way to go with that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Jörg.

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you.

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Can I just follow up on the life recapture on Solvency II? Can you give us an idea of how
much that benefit is on a Solvency II basis?

A - Jörg Schneider
I would love to because it's very substantial. But here, again, I ask for your understanding
not to dig too deep into that because you must imagine we have an enormously high
impact on our IFRS result over €100 million just from one transaction. And you also can
assume that we wouldn't do that if it were not for a very attractive economic effect. But
this economic effect is exactly the difference between our best estimate of future
liabilities here and the payment we had to do to decline and to quantify that right after
you close the deal, that wouldn't be fair, I think. And it – take it – it's a window of
opportunity to a win-win situation due to different preferences, perhaps also due to a
different view on the future of this contract. For us, it relieves the risks from that contract
and it will also have a positive impact on future IFRS earnings. Thank you, Paris.

Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

FINAL

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi there. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So, firstly, we've obviously just
had one of the most severe quarters for nat cats on record, and this Solvency II ratio is
largely unmoved, 3 points or so. So, I appreciate you like to hold high Solvency II buffers
over and above the target range given markets and losses can be volatile. But I
wondered, has this experience of the Solvency II ratio through the third quarter changed
how you think about the buffers that you need? Does it suggest that you could hold less
and still have plenty?
And then, I guess, in that context, should – obviously, should you get rid of ERGO, the
closed book, successfully for a good price? I guess there could be a further significant
uplift in that Solvency II ratio. So, how should we think about these buffers?
And secondly, just thinking about how potential price increases could work through to the
combined ratio next year and, more importantly, the year after? I mean, theoretically, if
the underlying profitability of the book does start to improve, would you then taper
reserve releases back down from the current 6 points to the full point sort of normalized
run rate? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you, Jonny. Yes. For us, it was a good experience for the resilience of our Solvency II
position, but it just came by chance that, at the same time, when we had the losses from
the hurricanes, we had the enormous relief from the recapture in Life. We had the
tightening of credit spreads. We had a very strong performance of our equities. None of
these developments was a clear response to the hurricane experience. That means it
could have also gone in the opposite direction. But it is clear that we do not need a 260%
SCR ratio. The optimal range would be above 175% up to 220% or so.
So, I would not insist on having these high buffers. But we also have to look at the other
metrics, and one important metric is rating. The other is local GAAP balance sheet of the
parent company, and as you know, we hold an equalization reserve, which by the way was
pretty helpful in this quarter. And therefore, our distribution capability is somewhat limited
from that side, yeah. So, I'm also fine with it because it mitigates the risks and it stabilizes
our distribution going forward. But we have to look also at that metric.
Therefore, I have always said, and I continue to do so, I'm very much in favor of higher
distributions, but I rather think in terms of reliability of these distributions instead of doing
extremely generous one-time steps. And this also applies by the way for the situation
after a potential sale of the Life back book, that would be another relief that would hurt
our Solvency II ratio, but the impact on local GAAP would be minor.
Potential price increases and the relationship to combined ratio and releases of our
reserve. The releases of reserve in the last couple of quarters were not a function of our

FINAL

willingness to pep up our results. It was rather the reaction to a very impressive difference
between actually reported losses and the estimations which were in place. So, we had a
constantly positive difference between expected losses and our loss experienced for the
back book here. And therefore, what we did was more or less forced by the accounting
rules here.
We are already at the upper end of the reasonable range of best estimates in spite of
the 6% reserve releases. How will it go on? I assume that, in the long run, we cannot
persist having a 6% ratio because inflation has been low for a while, now it has increased
a little bit, and perhaps with the time delay, there will also be another spike in claims
inflation. But I'm pretty confident that the level which we indicate of 4% as being that of an
on ongoing basis, that this can be sustainable. But it's pure speculation at the moment. All
the indications we get, including our experience from the opt-in table range are very
positive. Thank you, Jonny.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, Jörg and everybody. Just sort of my two questions. One is on the
P&C reinsurance, the normalized combined ratio has been maintained at 100% for the
year. Although my expectation from earlier conference calls and conversations was that
3Q would be the period when it seasonally will be stronger. But now, it seems obviously
99% kind of level will be needed in the fourth quarter. Is there any underlying indications
that give you that confidence, because typically it should have been third quarter? So
that's the first question on the normalized part.
Second question is just on trying to understand the Life Re guidance, I mean, maintaining
this €400 million odd even though there is a €170 million recapture, so just obviously, if
there were no recaptures, the number should be much higher than the €450 million.
Could you just help me square that? And also, obviously, fourth quarter would need to be
a bit higher than the usual run rate of – or sorry, both questions on the target. Thank you.

First, PC non-life, it was more or less always 100% in this year from quarter-to-quarter, and
the volatility around that number was purely random. So, I wouldn't see a positive
movement, perhaps there's a little bit in the fourth quarter because we had a very good
renewal at 1/7, but there was also some casualty business involved. It was a mix of
property and casualty quota share treaties, and therefore, the impact does not have to
be combined ratio lowering. The impact from the hurricanes will be totally minor because
there were some backup covers, but they don't play a major role in our portfolio at the
moment. Therefore, I would be more confident for 2018 than for the fourth quarter, and I
personally expect for the fourth quarter the adjusted combined ratio, which is again in the
order of 100%.
And on Life Re, yes, if we adjust for the minus €170 million for the recapture, it looks
bright, but this also includes there's another one-off effect on which we reported in very
general terms in the second quarter which mitigated the effect of the first recapture. So,
therefore, if we adjust also for that, then we are very close to what we expected before
the year. And this also gives us the confidence that €450 million is a realistic number for
2018 nor conservative neither aggressive.

Bloomberg Transcript

We will continue seeing volatility in the quarters because, when you have an assumption
change which meets the hurdle of the IFRS relevance, then you have to build it into your
quarterly number for the whole term of the respective contracts, yeah. So, therefore, it's
an unavoidable consequence of the current accounting. It will change with IFRS 17 where
we have a little bit more economic reporting on these contracts, which is from that angle
helpful. So, therefore, my best guess, and I assume that this will be also the guidance we
will give in March is that we continue with the €450 million number.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Thank you. And can I just quickly follow up on the normalized you said you are more
confident for 2018. That is for an improving trend or for a flat trend? Could you (23:10)?

A - Jörg Schneider
I would expect an improving trend for 2018 in property-casualty reinsurance due to the
effect of the improvement of the market after the storms.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi, just one question for me. I guess from the way I read your comments on German
GAAP development, you already have strong capital position, there's no reason, in my
mind anyway saying that you're not going to do a share buyback next year. Now, before I
think about that, you and your largest payer continuing the capital returns despite these
enormous cat losses, how long do you think discipline in the reinsurance market will last
because to me it feels like there is definitely a focus on getting prices higher next year,
but actually beyond that maybe we've seen that? So any thoughts on that would be most
helpful. Thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you, Kamran. First, our capital situation under German GAAP will be affected by the
event. I can give you a little bit of guidance on that. Of the major losses of the third
quarter, €3.2 billion, a small part happened in the U.S. (24:45) with our U.S. subsidiaries, be
it in primary insurance and especially our subsidiary in Munich Re America.

Bloomberg Transcript

The buyer directly went into Munich, understood the book of the parent company, and of
that share, which remains in the U.S., it will also find its way to Munich in the form of a cut in
dividends of – in group internal dividends. That means that a part or large part of the loss
will appear in the Munich books. Part of that will be mitigated and compensated by a
release of the equalization reserve, I would guess, some half of it.
The reason why it's not more is that it's derived from difference between the high actual
combined loss ratio and the average loss ratio. And the average loss ratio is substantially
higher than the planned loss ratio. That means, let's say, half will be absorbed by the
equalization reserve, then we have a full tax relief on it because, for those losses which
happened in the U.S., we can immediately compensate the losses by a tax relief. And
same applies for the German book. That means, overall, you will see it in our local GAAP
results, but only in a very moderate way.
That means our distribution capability remains intact and there is no reason, from my
personal point of view, to cut the dividend. And there is also a continuing ability to
continue with the share buybacks. But this is not an announcement. We never made an
announcement before the month of March as far as I remember.
With regards to the discipline, the continuation of paying a high dividend and perhaps
maybe also continuing with the share buyback is a sign for us that repatriation of capital is
important also at times when you are faced with these challenges from the current loss
experience. And it's for us also part of our discipline in the market. And perhaps some of
you may have missed stronger signals and stronger wordings from us with regard how
bullish we are about price increases and that we want to grow now aggressively. We think
that we would destroy part of the positive momentum by being now too bullish and
attract too much capital. Therefore, this is also a little bit of a background.
And therefore, I think that paying off the dividend is so important. With the discipline, at
least what will happen is that the enormous loss burden will be a wakeup call that the low

Page 8 of 18

loss experienced in the years 2012 to 2016 is not normal, and that will help and that will be
more sustainable than just for one quarter of one renewal, how long, we would see.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Fantastic. Thank you so much and thank you for this lovely level of disclosure. On the
buyback, you sound more positive, which makes me think – and I may be wrong, but you
could even consider going forward at some stage a higher level of buyback than the
current €1 billion that you've done. And I just wondered if that's a better way of thinking
about the capital and the discipline and all this than a one-off or even potentially a large
deal to absorb the excess capital?
And the second is on the recapture deal, I understand that you don't want to say too
much because you just closed the deal and it would be a little bit unfair to kind of say, oh,
it was so good. But would it be fair to say that your €450 million technical guidance could
possibly improve because, as you've said, the IFRS earnings profitability is looking better
now that these deals have been done?
And then the final question is kind of asking for reassurance. There's a headline yesterday
that the head of ERGO might go and run Deutsche Börse. And immediately, I had some
calls and investors are saying, oh, but does it mean that ERGO is not on track? Are we
worried? And I just wondered whether you can give us reassurance on that front. Thank
you.

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you, Michael. First, higher level of buybacks, I would personally exclude, yeah, as I
did more or less in the past also, because in a situation where you experience these
losses, and more or less, they'll find their way into the bottom line, except for the tax
position, then this is not the right moment to say now we do more on that front, yeah.
And it's highly open whether we see attractive growth opportunities which would require
a capital or things like that.
So, I do not want to anticipate the decision whether there will be any buyback, but I would
personally not be in favor of doing more than €1 billion for the next phase between May
and April 2019. And the recapture, as I said, there had been a one-off which mitigated part
of the very bad effect of the recaptures. So, therefore, the net of this overall one-off
effect is quite high. And it is clear that there will always be volatility, and the drivers can be
very diverse ranging from pure claims volatility to reserve updates, recaptures and so on.

So, sorry, if after having been over 16 years in my current position, I've seen too many
surprises here and I've constantly heard that the old business is bad, but the new one is in
good shape. You get a little bit skeptical about that over time. I believe that we learned
our lessons from this – from especially in Life Re from the pre 2009 business, but who

Sorry, the last question, yeah. I also read that and I think it's not up to me to participate
here in the speculation. And so, I have no information of that kind. And with regard to
ERGO, at least, would not deliver a reason to step down for the CEO because the ERGO
strategy program is running well and that – and the programs are more or less in line with

Bernstein. Please go ahead, your line is now open.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you. Good afternoon. First question is on the yield. I think you commented
that the gap between re-investment running yield especially in reinsurance is narrowing. I
mean, just looking at the number, it's 2.7% running versus 2% reinvestment. So, I wonder
how quickly you will see the inflection point here coming.
And the second one is I think already asked early February but it's topical again now. The
upcoming or potential change in U.S. taxes, how would impact Munich Re?

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you, Thomas. With the yield, when you compare 2.7% to 2.0%, the 2.0% is just yield
on the fixed income part of the portfolio. And that's also another contribution from the
real assets which is higher. That is the average for the group. For reinsurance – for a
reinsurance P&C, which is the – one of the main driver of our result here, we have a reinvestment yield for the fixed income part which is 2.2%. This is due to the fact that it's a
lot of U.S. dollar investments and a running yield of 2.4%. So just the difference of 20 basis
points at the moment, and therefore, the decline will be minor, yeah. So it's converging at
the moment, that is what I wanted to express before.

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

And in Life Re?

FINAL

A - Jörg Schneider
With regard to the U.S. tax reform, many companies have large deferred tax assets, we
don't. That means, if the investment – if the tax rate on U.S. income would be decreased
by 15% from 35% to 20%, that wouldn't have a negative impact on us with regard to the
deferred part. So, therefore, we would be a beneficiary of this decline for our ongoing
return from the business – for our ongoing profits from now on.
On the other side, there are also elements in the tax reform with regard to cross-border
payments, intra-group cross- border payments, which would require changes to our
internal reinsurance structure, yes. So, therefore, it's not only a positive development, but
I would say basically it would be very positive if this tax reform would be successful.

Oh, hi, there. Two very quick questions. Your new CEO, when he started earlier in the
year, talked about one thing to ensure Munich Re was more nimble than it had been in the
past taking advantage of opportunities. I guess, this is potentially an opportunity if rates
truly are going to harden. Maybe, Jörg, could you tell us how much room there is for you
to materially increase your risk appetite, particularly for U.S. property cat?

Bloomberg Transcript

And in the past when there'd been harder markets, there hasn't been a huge expansion
of volume. Do you think things are different now and the group is truly more nimble or you
are more likely to quite significantly tactically expand your exposure in harder lines?
Second question. On the ERGO back book, I appreciate the liabilities on non-core, but are
the customers non-core? There's still 6 million policies or thereabouts, how do you ensure
the welfare of those customers if they do go to a third party or how do you ensure or will
you need to ensure that you still have access to those customers, because I'm guessing
some of them have also more profitable products?

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you, Andrew. I'll start with the second question. Yes, that is exactly what we have to
ensure. And I can't go into detail now, but this is the reason why it's a complex talk and
also a complex evaluating of chances and risks in such a transaction. Because, you're
absolutely right, it's our clients and still our clients and we take that point very serious. On
the other hand, their respective specialists do treat their customers fairly. So, they are
forced by law, they are forced by regulators and they have very good practices and a
good track record from other countries. In Germany, this market hasn't been developed
as it was, for example, in the UK.
With regard to Munich Re being more nimble, more opportunistic perhaps in a situation
like the current, yes, we are determined to be very flexible, but not stupid. We also have
to look at our risk profile. And as you know, the affected area, Southeastern U.S.,
Caribbean is that where we have already the highest risk exposure. That means, since we
run our business on an economic basis and since diversification plays a role, it's a relatively
high additional capital requirement here in our internal risk model.

Therefore, prices have to be really attractive, which we believe will be the case.
Therefore, we want to grow. I am pretty sure that we will grow, but we won't do it without
an eye on our economic steering of the business. Thank you, Andrew.

Q - James R. Oram

{BIO 19736003 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Good afternoon. This is James from Citi. I've got two questions, please. The first one,
Jörg, is on the gross versus net comment you made earlier. I can see that the ceded
share of technical provisions went up about €700 million quarter-on-quarter in P&C Re.
And I assume that that would mostly have been driven by the losses ceded from the
recent cat events. Is that not the case? But, if it is, could you go into a bit more detail on
where those losses were ceded to?
And the second point is, going back to ERGO, I can see from the report that the group's
overall head count fell by around 500 people during the quarter. And I'd assume that this
is mostly in ERGO. We've already started to see improvements in the expense ratios
there and does the drop in head count mean we should expect that churn to accelerate
into 2018? And related to that, would you say you are currently ahead or sort of in line on
expense beginning (41:02) at this stage within ERGO? Thank you very much.

A - Jörg Schneider
James, could you be so kind to repeat your first question? You...

Q - James R. Oram

{BIO 19736003 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Jörg Schneider
...caught me with the wrong foot with that. Sorry.

Q - James R. Oram

{BIO 19736003 <GO>}

Yeah. Sorry. I was just saying that I can see a sort of €700 million increase in the ceded
share of technical provisions to P&C Re from the half year to Q3. And I was just wondering
if you could tally that with your comment earlier that sort of it's a gross equals net position
for Munich Re more or less. So, that €700 million, I was assuming, was related to the
recent cats.

FINAL

And if it is that – yeah.

A - Jörg Schneider
Yeah. It's okay. Thank you. Thank you. It's too much, yeah, so there must be other reasons
behind it, which I cannot identify at the moment. But the retrocession is lower in our case.
Second, the job cuts have begun last year. We had the restructuring expenses there. We
started the negotiations with the staff councils and with the other representatives of the
staff. We came into good results of these negotiations. And the first colleagues have left
the company meanwhile, but we are not ahead of our plan. We are more or less in line
with the plan. And part of the expense drop, which you can see in the numbers especially
for the third quarter, is not only due to that fact, but rather, due to a new allocation of
expenses between the various lines of business and between the operating side and the
non-operating side, because we have a higher share of expenses booked into nonoperating because it refers to general IT matters which have little to do with the current
business, yeah. So, there is a kind of artificial effect in that. Therefore, we can't
overestimate the effect, but we are on track. Thank you, James.

Thank you. And now we'll take our next person from the queue, Michael Haid from
Commerzbank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Two questions. First of all, on retro again, you said
and we all know that, Munich Re essentially is gross or net underwriter, but nevertheless,
to my understanding, you benefited from retro in the third quarter. And can you say how
much and do you draw any conclusions from what happened in the third quarter regarding
your future level of desired retro protection?
Second question on the equalization reserve, there was a relief in the equalization
reserve after 15 years after 9/11, to what extent do you have to refill the equalization
reserve going forward from the Q3 net cat events and could this become, at some time
again, a bottleneck for your distribution for your capital repatriation capabilities?

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you, Michael. The first on retro, I envy my colleagues from the competitors for the
strong relief they get from retro. I don't envy them with regard to future expenses on
retro. That is two sides of the same coin. The relief from retro was in line with our
expectation and with our risk appetite, so it worked in a way. I would have preferred that
the hurricanes combined forces into one because that would have been extremely
Page 14 of 18

Date: 2017-11-09

beneficial for us, because then we would have had a relief of up to €1.5 billion from a
combined event. Since it was three events, it was only a minor relief.

FINAL

But the retro strategy has been recently after the storms confirmed by the board
because it's somewhat opportunistic, it has an element of continuity. And it's fully in line
with our risk appetite and it protects us especially in the most exposed areas here.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

But would you not prefer – sorry.

A - Jörg Schneider
Excuse me?

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Would you not prefer to increase your retro towards more protection against frequency
instead of severity?

A - Jörg Schneider

Bloomberg Transcript

That is an interesting remark. Perhaps that could be a learning here. But it also has a price
impact, yeah, so it's always two sides of the coin. It would increase the probability of a
relief from retro, but that would also have an impact. And we also have an aggregate
element in it, yeah. So it's a typical XL cover plus an aggregate element which worked in
our case. Otherwise, we wouldn't have a release of a couple of hundred million – relief.
Then equalization reserve, first of all, the required amount really went down as predicted
last year. But unfortunately, this was not the reason why we reduced the equalization
reserve. It was rather the difference between the actual loss ratio of this year and the
average loss ratio. And it is right that, going forward, we will have to refill the equalization
reserve especially in the line of fire. And it will be low triple-digit million amounts per year,
yeah, so for 2018 – a little bit lower than for 2019, 2020, not huge amounts, not really
game changers for our distribution capability. But the equalization reserve – how should I
say – confirms its character, yeah, but it's a very slowly moving beast.

Horvath from Exane. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

FINAL

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 18460437 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. The questions are – I have on ERGO. And my
first one is on the 2017 profitability. We are, if I'm correct, year-to-date already within the
target range for the year. What should we expect, what should we be aware of for Q4
which could lead the overall net income to stay where it is more or less? Or should you
expect to be at the very top end of this range?
And the second is, what should we think about profitability for 2018? If I'm correct, we
don't have that many indication for next year. If you could be a little bit more precise than
that, that would be great. Thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Guilhem. With regard to ERGO in the fourth quarter, I do not expect a lot of
disposal gains because they had been done in the first quarter to finance (48:54). And I
expect a little bit of a catch-up effect for the expenses for the strategy program which will
have a negative impact. There could be a low amount of the typical DAC impairments. I
do not expect it to be a lot has been done more or less in the third quarter. And except
for that, I do not see any reason of a deviation from the situation in the third quarter.
So, most probably, ERGO will stay within the range of the Q3 results and within the range
of the prognosis for the full year, which is €250 million upper end because there were
also some weather-related claims, we had some very strong precipitation losses here in
Germany especially.
With regard to 2018 for the whole group, if you had asked me until August, I would have
been very skeptical. We have appetite for selectively choosing more risk here and there,
less on the asset side than on the insurance side, that had been already communicated
by our CEO, Joachim Wenning, where we have much better expertise and data,
meanwhile, we can carefully take more risk here and there, but that is not quantum leaps.
On the other side, the investment income is slowly declining a little bit, almost coming to
an end in 2018. But now, we very much hope and I believe that there will be a positive
impact from price increases after the hurricane events. So therefore – and, sorry, yes.
Guilhem, yes?

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 18460437 <GO>}

Yeah. Maybe specifically on ERGO, the profitability for 2018?

A - Jörg Schneider
Yeah. ERGO will deliver according to its plan most probably which should be a little bit
north of €300 million, I think. But I look at up, yeah, from this – yeah, this year was higher
than expected. This should have been €170 million and now we are ahead of plan; so

between €200 million – but I will give you the number later on. Can we take the next
question?

Operator

FINAL

Certainly, sir. Thank you. And our last question is coming from Michael Huttner from
JPMorgan as a follow-up. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Hi there. It's – thank you very much for this opportunity, and it's not actually linked to the
results, I apologize here, you might decide on it's too general. But the – I listened to the
(51:55) conference call on Tuesday, and then moving in a big way to the artificial
intelligence and replacing effectively people, but also front-office people and I felt very
sensitive here, because I could be replaced by machines and with algorithms and artificial
intelligence and such.
I noticed you'd launched this new direct (52:20) machine driven, and I just wondered
whether – and this is a phishing question really, at what stage or at what level do you think
that these more automated processes could affect the – your own core business (52:36)?
Thank you. And I'm sorry it's a very general question.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you, Michael. You are talking about nexible, our fully automatic – automated
insurance company. For us, it's an experiment. First experiences are quite good. And we
built it up in just a couple of months. For us, it's kind of second option, yeah. So, it's not a
move away from our sales force driven traditional insurance company, but its second
option plus positive impulse for the remaining organization because we exchange –
definitely, we exchange experience, we exchange tariffs. This company also benefits from
the loss data and the experience of the traditional companies. So, therefore, we see it as
a tool for experimentation plus interaction with the existing organization.
I would like to revert your attention – to point your attention to the Digitalization Day we
have in about 10 days or so where we also on the 21st of November, where we will also
talk about nexible and where we'll have presentations and share our experiences and our
strategy with that regard.
With regard to Guilhem's question about the 2018 profit of ERGO, we do not make public
announcements right now at the moment. It's part of our outlook which we will give March.
But you can expect an increase from what we originally expected there, that was a
number below €200 million, yeah, €150 million to €200 million.
So, our experience for 2017 was better than expected partially driven by tax one-off
effects which will probably not repeat in the next year. Therefore, I wouldn't be too
optimistic about that. For us, much more important is the long-term development and
especially the path at the end of the strategy program and the sustainability of what we'll
achieve by that time. Are there any questions?
