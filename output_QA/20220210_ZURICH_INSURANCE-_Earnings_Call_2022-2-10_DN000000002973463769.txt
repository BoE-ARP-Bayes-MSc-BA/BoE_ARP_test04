Presentation
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Annual Results 2021 Conference Call. I am Alice, the
Chorus Call operator. I would like to remind you that all participants will be in listen-only mode, and
the conference is being recorded. The presentation will be followed by Q&A session. (Operator
Instructions) The conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast.
At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Mr. Jon Hocking, Head of Investor Relations and
Rating Agency Management. Please go ahead, sir.

Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to Zurich Insurance Group's
2021 full year results call. On the call this afternoon, we have our Group CEO, Mario Greco; and the
Group CFO, George Quinn. And before I hand over to Mario for some introductory remarks, just a
reminder that we kindly ask you to keep your questions to two per individual in the Q&A session.
Mario?

Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Thank you, Jon; and welcome, everybody. Thanks for being on the call. As we entered Zurich 150th
anniversary year, the group is an excellent shape. 2022 is also the final year of our three-year
strategic plan. We are track to meet or exceed the targets that we established back in 2019 and I
look forward to hopefully seeing you all in November when we will set out our ambitions for the
next cycle.



FINAL

As I said back in November last year, the investor update, we have had to be extremely adaptable
with the shape of the results being very different than we expected in 2019, given the impact of
the pandemic. I'm very pleased with what we have achieved in 2021. Results were among the best
in Zurich history with the highest BOP and the best property and casualty combined ratio since
2007. However, we can continue to improve from here and we believe that the trends in revenue
and earnings growth will continue at least into 2023.
Across the retail business, we are benefiting from our work on improving customer engagement,
which is evidenced by the strong net new customer numbers we have reported. Robust topline in
retail and SME, property and casualty embody the excellent life results.
Commercial insurance is reaping the rewards from its reposition in the recent years. With the
continuing strength of the pricing cycle providing an additional tailwind. We're also growing
selectively in areas such as middle market, where we are continuing our build-outs.
Farmers is making good progress integrating the MetLife business with a strong topline growth for
2021. And the balance sheet is very strong with the SST ratio at 212% and helped the increase in
the dividend to CHF22. The SST ratio is before reflecting the benefit we expect to get later in the
year when we complete the disposal of our Italian life and pension back book.
I now hand over to George.

George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Mario. I just like to highlight a few additional points regarding the strength of our financial
performance. P&C's result in 2021 was very strong with 11% topline growth and a 2% improvement
in the underlying combined ratio. As Mario mentioned, the 94.3% combined ratio is the best in 15
years. Growth was robust with both commercial insurance and retail and SME, driving growth and
it's not just rate driven but also coming from disciplined new business wins. Despite PYD being
slightly higher than our guidance range, we believe that reserve strength has further improved and
consistent with our prior comments on anticyclical reserving. We've taken a cautious view and not
fully recognized the continuing benefit of rate versus loss cost trend.
2022 should be a further year of growth and margin expansion for the P&C segment and we
expect to see a further strong improvement in performance in 2022 with the pace only slightly
slower than we saw last year.
We're really happy with the life result in 2021, which benefited from the recovery in markets, strong
growth momentum in EMEA and Zurich Santander, as well as favorable claims experience. We aim
to grow earnings in 2022 at a mid single-digit percentage from the reported growth level. Our
continued focus on protection and capital-light savings is serving as well as is our strong presence
in the bank channel.
In Farmers, the integration with the acquired MetLife business continues to go very well. The
Farmers Exchanges' GWP was up 20% including Met and 7% like-for-like. As for 2022, we expect
further growth in the high single-digit range.
The balance sheet is strong and the changes that we're making to capital allocation will improve
this further, both in quantity and quality. As outlined at the investor update in November, first is the
elimination of earnings dilution. This is not a small number as some of you have already started to
estimate. The Italian transaction doesn't trigger any significant earnings dilution and the changes
that will likely to come later this year. So hopefully this explains some of the timing. On the use of
capital more generally, our preference is to reinvest any further surplus earnings and dividend
growth, but if this is not possible we will not retain surplus funds that we cannot redeploy
resultedly.



With that, I'll hand over to the operator for the Q&A.

Questions And Answers

FINAL

Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question
comes from the line of Andrew Ritchie with Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi there. Not often I'm number one on the question queue. Okay. George, could you give us just an
update on the reduction of the inwards cash exposure? I remember the Investor Day, I think you
talked about 10% AEL, average expected loss, reduction in the US. Just where you are on that in
terms of progress? Also, I guess, has there been thinking, because obviously you've reinstated
reinsurance since then given more constrained reinsurance was available, do you think the 10%
reduction in inwards AEL is enough, or do you think you need to revisit that? So that's the first
question. Second question is simple one, why are you realized gains are so high in the second
half ? I meant -- I thought to mention of equity gains. I don't know, if that was tactical or what else
was going on? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. So, I mean, just a reminder that when we had the investor update in
November, I talked about what we were planning to do, in fact just started to do already around
some of the exposures that the US business in particular brings us. We're aiming to achieve about
a 10% reduction in the AEL. That affects a number of different risk types, includes US winds,
includes US tornado, includes California quake. If I look at the overall program, we've got about
somewhere in the mid-300s in terms of accounts impacted. We're expecting to see about 60% of
the benefit by the end of this year, remainder to come next year. And if I look at the progress
we're making, we're on track for that. I mean, we're driving it. Again, I gave a fairly high level
summary of what we're trying to do to achieve this, but for example on the wind exposed topics
we've introduced new creatings and we've got new underwriting requirements to try and direct
the capacity more towards the preferred risk. And if I -- for some classifications, we don't offer
capacity anymore. So I think we expect to see about 60% this year and 40% next and we're well
on track to deliver that.
On the related reinsurance topic -- sorry.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Yeah. No, sorry, still you are about to address that. Yeah.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. You have to trust me to remember the second part of the first part of your question. On the
reinsurance topic, I'd honestly don't see these things as connected. I mean, I think, as you've seen
from some of the US reports already, it's pretty clear the cat aggregate market is a bit dislocated. I
mean, we've taken the decision to keep our foot in the door and to see how it further develops,
but I mean reality is that -- I mean even though cat aggregate has certainly been helpful for us in
the course of last couple of years, it doesn't make an enormous difference.
But if you look at the impact of the change that we've made, so we will retain about another $100
million of exposure and that's before Yellow [ph] as a fact, that we do actually pay for it, as a
premium that you would know. So I don't think the change there is significant enough to have us
change direction on how we're trying to manage the topic more broadly. So we'll continue to do
the things we talked about in November.



Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Can I just ask --

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

On the AEL, obviously this takes time for that reduced AEL to be in place. Is there any earlier
benefit from terms and conditions on property exposed or cat exposed property? I'm talking -- I
mean, more immediate benefit on things like deductibles or routes [ph] closes your coverage. So
long term across that will -- that will affect the '22 underwriting year?

A - George Quinn

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So if you look at the market generally, this is true beyond property. I mean, it's not just price, I
mean you are seeing contractual improvements across the boards. So I mean these range from
some of the things that do help define the extent of catastrophe from a property perspective
include things like cyber, there's a wide range of things that I think benefit us. I mean we don't try
and adopt a number and to all of these, I mean even simple things like deductible. So, I mean, it's
a pretty common feature of our response of corporate to higher price to retain more of the risk.
So that takes us more of the frequency and provides, I mean, a bit less exposure to those lower
events and typically they are not (inaudible). So it tends to help us more, let's say, the attritional
and what we would describe as the large, so they can't -- the large manmade events. On the cat
side, things like -- that was closely certainly will help. It's a topic across the entire book and if I shall
think it's a benefit that you'll continue to see in performance, not through just this year and next,
but I think long after we've stopped discussing what the rate trajectory is like. We will still have
benefits from Ts and Cs.
Realized gains, so why so high? I mean, so we've made some tactical shifts in the portfolio towards
the end of last year. I mean, we don't try and constrain, we don't try and push necessarily for
particular outcomes, but the team, they haven't changed the strategic view of risk, but they did
reduce equity exposure towards the end of last year and that's one of the driver of the gains.
Probably the other principal one is that we have property on a mark-to-market basis and of course
given current trends that's generally been positive for the group. Those are the key drivers of
what's on gains.

The next question comes from the line of Louise Miles with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Louise Miles

{BIO 20765435 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, George, you just mentioned in your intro, you
talked about deploying excess capital. Just so that I can get a better understanding, in the release,
you talked about net earned premiums in the P&C business growing at mid to high single digits
next year or this year rather, how does that translate into capital consumption on an SST point
basis, because we can understand that a little bit.



And then my second question is on Slide 4, you talk about the EPS CAGR of 7.3% in the business. If
you look at the DPS CAGR, that looks like it's about 5%. Do you plan to close the gap between the
two of them? Just trying to have a think about dividend trajectory from here? Thanks.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

And, sorry, on the second part of the question, you were comparing the EPS to DTS, is that what
you were doing?

Q - Louise Miles

{BIO 20765435 <GO>}

Sorry, the EPS CAGR versus the DPS CAGR...

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay.

Q - Louise Miles

{BIO 20765435 <GO>}

...7.3% on Slide 4

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. So the -- I mean the easy one to answer is the second one, because that's a foreign currency
topic. So you've got -- I mean from -- if you look at the dividend per share and the underlying
currency of earnings, it will follow what we've seen underneath. I mean, do we at this point believe
we have a gap? I mean, I think I would argue, given we're paying the dividend, this was francs,
you've actually got a higher growth rate on the dividend than you do on the earnings at the
moment. So I'm not sure from our perspective, there is a gap to close.
And on excess capital, I mean, it's a great question. I mean one of the interesting challenges of
certainly the more economic models is that, assuming that we grow the book in a balanced way
and in particular if we don't over emphasize some of the P risks and, of course, and the question
that Andrew asked, you can see that we've clearly got a restricted appetite for some kinds of risks
at the moment. They are more capital intensive. I mean the growth rates that we're guiding to
today or 2022 don't consume significant amounts of capital. I mean it's highly diversifying across
the portfolio and large -- and if you look at our book and you look at our capital models, it's the
traditional P risk drivers that dictate consumption and very few of them are present in the growth
plans that we have for P&C for 2022. So I don't expect our organic growth ambitions to be a
significant considering our capital.

Q - Louise Miles

{BIO 20765435 <GO>}

Great. Thank you.

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you.

Operator
The next question comes from the line of Peter Eliot with Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much really. And my first question -- actually, sorry, very similar to Andrew's actually.
But if I -- I mean hopefully we won't, but if we did get another year like we did last year and are you
able to tell us roughly what the nat cat might be? So I don't say 6.5% last year, just wondering what



FINAL

that was sort of translate to 2023 if we got a similar year bearing in mind that the changes that
you've just talked about 200 [ph]?
And the second question, obviously very impressive reduction in expense ratio, we saw that
already in the half year. I mean, I think, you said that could be split, previously we said that could
split into discipline and also the sort of economies of scale that come with the topline growth. You
gave everything and sort of any more feel for how those to drive do space out? And whether we
can expect sort of continuation of that if we do get the further growth coming through that you
pointed out specifically? Thank you very much.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Peter. So if you look at the aggregate cover and we are low for the change, so it's -and we'll say for the sake of our NIM [ph], because obviously I don't want to disclose the premium.
But let's assume that the impact is a $100 million. If everything was the same using the capacity
and the aggregate as a gauge, it would be about three-tenths of a point higher. That would be the
change.

Bloomberg Transcript

From an expense efficiency perspective, I mean, I think it's become a hallmark of the group, but it's
something that we're very focused on. We certainly hurray that we got the benefit not only of what
we've done more efficient and a bit leaner across the entire group, but we've also had the benefit
of growth. I think as we go into this year and you look at the expense ratio and we break it into the
two components, so we have the acquisition cost ratio and we have what we refer to as the OUE
or the administrative overhead component, the Zurich expense parts of the expense ratio
On the acquisition side of it, I mean given the mix of business that we've currently got and the
expectations of continuing recovery of the pandemic. I think we'll see some rebound around travel.
I think we'll also see some rebound around the mass consumer business, particularly in Latin
America. They tend to be relatively high distribution cost businesses. So they probably will not jump
the acquisition cost ratio slightly. I don't expect it to be particularly dramatic, but like-for-like we
would make it slightly higher.
On the expense side, I mean, we continue to push on expenses. Let me build this trajectory
change from where we've been in prior years. I don't think so, I think the -- if I look at all of the
dynamics around expense and of course keeping in mind that about 60% of the group's expense
burden is salaries, I mean there is a certain pressure from inflationary drivers of expenses. I think,
so far, we've been able to manage that by offsetting that with efficiency gain, that's still the plan
IFRS in 2022. But what it does mean is that, I mean, probably a larger part of the expense gain will
go back to staff, because of the prevailing labor market conditions. So I would expect that volume
will be a bigger driver of an improvement overall in the expense ratio in 2022 than perhaps it was
in the last couple of years.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

That's great. Thank you very much, George.

The next question comes from the line of Will Hardcastle from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - William Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Well, afternoon, everyone. First one, just I guess with lots of moving parts, COVID catastrophe
losses, what's the extent of the favorable year-on-year development in '21? And how does this
compare to the pace of change in '20 and without pinning you to any sort of targets, I guess from
a high level directionally in pace, any color that you can give on that?



And then the second one is really big high level one, but you've had a huge upgrade it seems on
your Life BOP today. I guess a little bit more color here on what's driving it would be useful?
Thanks.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Will. So on the first topic and I think if you're prepared to look through the headline
numbers and we characterize it in the same way that we have in prior years, I mean, we think that
underlying is somewhere around the 92 mark, it would be about 2, maybe 2 to 3 point
improvements over the prior year. If you look at 2020 over 2019, on the same basis, it's probably 1,
1.5 points of improvement. I think given the cycle, I would expect us to be closer to the
improvement we saw in 2020 than 2021 just given the -- if I did rates moderated as we enter 2022
compared to 2021. I mean, it will also worth adding that the rate that we're currently seeing is 2023
relevant as much as 2022. So to the extent that we continue this through the first half of the year,
we will start to firm up precisely what's going to be delivered in 2023 already.

Bloomberg Transcript

And from a life business perspective, I mean life team -- our life business has globally done a
fantastic job. If you look at it from volumes perspective, as a proportion you rate much more of the
preferred risks, the growth -- I mean it's not quite back to the level of 2019 on a APE basis, but the
mix of what the team's achieving is far better. So we write much less of any of the business that
carry spread risk. I mean just a far more of the protection focus, the unit linked focus driven by, I
mean, a wide range of businesses on Europe, the Zurich businesses, and UK, Germany,
Switzerland, all doing a great job.
Joint venture in Spain with Sabadell, very strong joint venture; in Latin America with Santander also
excellent. I think -- I mean one of the ones that -- there's been a big driver in terms of turnaround is
the Australian life business. So as we get to the end of 2021, believe it or not, we now starting to
get very close to the business case that we committed to nearly four or five years ago when we
announced the acquisition. And I think the Australian business has more room to develop further. I
think they're quite cautious on how they position themselves at the end of last year with a leading
player in retail in the market. I expect to see further strength from them this year.
And the other thing that stands out in the results today, I mean, we've highlighted what we
described as one-offs and I think one-offs not a very elegant way to describe some of the hard
work that some of the local team is doing managing the enforced results and changes, for
example, in particular reserving positions.
I mean, it's not always something that can be predicted with high-precision, but we do have a
good track record of producing a reasonably consistent level of income from what we do in-force
management. I mean, looking at what's ahead of us, I don't really expect that to change in 2022.
Finally, we have COVIDs. It's the one place in the business where you continue to see the impacts
of the pandemic. Tends to have more of a North American and South American flavor to it. I mean
we've had slightly over $300 million of excess mortality than the course of 2021. It would be zero
this year, but it's going to be a significant step down from where we were last year. So I think if you
look at the book overall, I mean we're very happy with the progress the team has made and that's
why we've given clean guidance from the headline number without adjustment today

The next question comes from the line of William Hawkins with KBW. Please go ahead.



FINAL

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you very much. And, George, just picking up on the useful color you just gave about
the life business, I'm wondering if I could just press you more on some of the line items that are
driving this? In the absence of your source of earnings disclosure, your profit is up about $400
million year-on-year in absolute terms, how much of that has come from what would have been
the investment margin and how is particular margin, what would have been changed? And when
you're thinking about the $100 million growth, 3% or 5% or mid-single digits in place for this year,
which would be the key driver there? Is it investment margin or technical margin or maybe
something else?
And if I can append to that, I appreciate you've dropped the source of earnings disclosure
because of the other pressures like IFRS 17 work, to what extent is there any restatement of your
earnings going on behind the scenes, so that you're creating a number which is strategically more
consistent with what IFRS 17 may look like? I don't know if I'm taking a conspiracy theory too far.
Second question, please. (Multiple Speakers)

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Well, I'm not sure I understand the second, the question, what does that mean?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Presumably your earnings could be restated significantly under IFRS 17 and so I'm just wondering if
whether your new earnings figure includes any kind of implicit smoothening into the new
accounting regime. So is 1.8 a good base for what we're going to be thinking about under IFRS 17?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thank you.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

And then second question, in your guidance of high single digit growth for Farmers' premiums this
year, how should we be thinking about the actual operating profit of the management services
company? I'm not sure -- I mean on the one hand I can imagine it will be higher than that, because
you've got all the lovely synergies from Met P&C and, on the other hand, it could be lower than
that, because you still got the integration expenses and things. So do we take the volume as also
the sign of profit or if not, which way is the delta please? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah, great. So on the first one, so you're right. I mean we've removed some of the earnings we
would normally give because we have eight closes during the course of this year. I think if you look
at the sources of the improvement over the prior year and just given the change in the mix of
business, I mean, a very significant driver of this is going to be technical margin, it's coming from
business that typically carrying underwriting risk. So if I think -- I mean I think to Australia earlier,
because Australia has one of the biggest tunnel rooms compared to the prior year. I mean that's a
business that's almost entirely combination of either what Australians would refer to as lumpsum
TPV mortalities had cover or DI, both of which obviously dominated by protection features and
therefore technical margin. So there will be some of this, which is partly a recovery of markets, but I
expect the largest driver of the outcome as the improvement in mix towards technical and that
technical is driven by underwriting outcomes rather than investment outcomes.
On the second part of the question, on the -- I guess it's a different way of asking me what will
your life earnings look like under IFRS 17? All I can tell you is that we haven't done anything from a
book perspective to try and anticipate IFRS 17 at this stage and I don't expect that we will do that
during the course of the year. I mean the one thing that we did do and we talked about this already



FINAL

on the Q3 call is we did make some changes and bite to the AFR. So law is to say up the best
estimates in a way for transition for IFRS 17, so that some of the businesses that potentially could
carry more risk into the new accounting standard without more significant buffers around them. But
that's really the only thing we've done around anticipating IFRS 17 as I stated.
For Farmers, I mean I think for the management company, I mean they're obviously -- there are full
component, so I'm going to put the life company to one side a second, I'm going to put Farmers
Re to one side assuming that that has no significant impact. So we're left with, I guess, what -- was
the management company now has the addition of MetLife to it? I think the growth figure that
we've given for underlying is a pretty good guide to where you'd expect the fee income to go and
I think you need to allow the fact we still have some restructuring to do. So that will continue to
keep pressure on the margin on the Farmers what place component, which is the old MetLife P&C
business. But I think if you work off of the overall guidance that we've given for the exchange and
you are prepared to make a reasonable split between the, let's call it, the old management
company and Barclay Services and apply the two margins with a bit of a step-up on what place -- I
mean that will give you a pretty good guide to where to expect fee income to come out overall.

The next question comes from the line of Michael Huttner with Berenberg. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Fantastic. Thank you so much, and well done on the record profits in a record year. And two
questions. The cash conversion -- so it's really a way to ask what's the cash remittance growth
going to be, but if I do the ratio of cash to net profit, 85% with five-year average of 95%. So if I
imagine convergence, that is a lot of growth to come, just wondered if you could maybe share
some of the drivers of what could be? And then the second question. So Italy done -- we have a
deal, which I mentioned, in Germany as we -- end of this year. So we'll have a lot less volatility in
your -- on your assets side with lot less risk, how much do you believe in terms of CapEx or if you
imagine that you could live with lower solvency buffers? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Michael. So on the first one, on cash conversion, so the numbers are correct. We are
through the first two years of the strategic plan that we have. Ending this year, first two years, we
are very much high guidance of 45% and if you look back on a longer-term historical average, we
have been higher than that. I mean we have said today that obviously the ambition is to meet or
exceed all the targets that we've given. I think I should remind -- I mean I see no reason why it
would slow down as we go into 2022. There's obviously some continuing impact from COVID,
although it's not so significant as it was in the prior year and we continue to have pockets that we
would like to go after. So we've talked before about the fact that one of our largest entities
continues to run a capital level that's in excess of the level that we target and even though we've
been successful in repatriating that -- some of that in prior years, it continues to exhibit that
characteristic and we would intend to go and tackle that again this year. But I think I mean the
reality of those processes are that, I mean, we need to have local boards comfortable, we need to
have to convince regulators that these things make sense. So I don't expect a shift from where
that business is to perfect line with target on one year. So I think there could be benefits from this
that will flow this year, maybe also next year. So I think from a cash remittance perspective, I'm
going to obviously avoid giving you firm number, but I'm very comfortable that we'll be in excess of
the tax remittance target that we established.



FINAL

So on the second thing, so obviously we've announced the transaction in Italy, that will have a small
positive impact on the SST ratio when it closes as a smaller impact on a liquidity. But I mean the real
reason for us to do that again was the volatility that the predominant investment and that book
may created issues for us around volatility of capital. I mean, it's a challenge to take too much
beyond that, because it goes -- I'm not going to talk about other transactions that we are not
considering. I think -- I mean, we've made a commitment that we want to go further in addressing
the back book challenges that we have in the company. I think people can draw conclusions quite
easily about what that might mean. I mean there is a certain complexity when we move until the
jurisdictions again to some degree reflects also the comments around the cash topic.
So we need to work with business team, our local partners and very importantly the regulators to
make sure that all the stakeholders are comfortable with what we intend to do here.
I think the positive thing around some things that we do intend to do is that, I mean, they are not
dependent on a flow back of local capital. We've been able to put in place relatively efficient
financing structures already, really the benefit of doing some of these things is for us to remove
some of the superimposed capital requirements or, as you highlighted, to have a lot less volatility
and therefore to be comfortable operating at level of capital this lower than the one that we would
typically target today. That doesn't mean a reduction in the 160% just means where we operate
and the range above 160%.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of quantum, I'm going to resist the temptation to make any comment on that yet, but
obviously the things that we intend to do are far more significant than the things that we have
done.

The next question comes from the line of James Shuck with Citi. Please go ahead.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, good afternoon. And in terms of the underlying improvement in the combined
ratio at full year and when you think about the accident year number ex-COVID, there was a
slowdown from the first half to the second half, I think kind of 3 points or so and then 190 basis
points or so. I mean to some extent, I mean how should we could expect that and I think you've
probably got high loss picks on some of your liability lines, but when I kind of break it out into
expense and loss ratio, it seems like the biggest slowdowns on the expense ratio side, so just
some color around whether that timing differences or how to think about that slowdown? And kind
of linked to that, is -- could you split it out the other way and look at it in commercial lines versus
retail and SME, SME I think was increasing by about 80 basis points at the first half and that was flat
for the year. So it looks like the retail SME deteriorated in the second half of the year. I guess that's
kind of one thing about possible headwind for you as we go into 2022. So just some thoughts
about the retail and SME outlook would be helpful please?
And then secondly on the PYD, so I mean -- you have done recently first half of this year, second
half of the PYD these kind of at or above the top end of your target range. You are saying that you
are building margin at least in this period, so just should we be expecting that number to be
coming out at the higher end as it has done in recent times? And if you are able to comment on
IFRS 17, when it comes to P&C reserving situation. You'd like it have to reserve closer to best
estimate under IFRS 17? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}



FINAL

Thanks, James. That's a long couple of questions. So in -- on the underlying combined ratio, I mean
-- so your analytics is spot on. The one of the things I would chose off to cure as off is the fact that
we have a significant expense queuing to the second half of the year. It seems to be one of those
things we can manage to bring down the total amount we spend, but we don't really seem to be
able to fix the skew so much. I think in the scheme of things, I'm more concerned that we'd
become more efficient in total. So I'd love to tell you that we could get this thing more even, but
there is a skew into the second half and this partly driving the characteristic that you see.
And on retail SME, again, you're right about the outcome. I'd be more optimistic than you are. I
think on retail and SME, it's been a great tough market, especially for retail. I mean, we've seen a
rebound in the business and mainly driven by partnerships. So that's certainly helped us. But if you
look at the price dynamics, they are pretty flat in retail. I think just given the prevailing market
conditions in some of the challenges that are out there, I think in some markets you have started
to see an improving trends on price and I expect that to broaden across all the businesses.
So I mean I think is -- as we get deeper into this year, I'd actually expect retail to produce a
stronger performance than they have from a rate perspective than that they done by 2021. That's
also true for Farmers and the benefit that we'll get from a fee perspective, from what I think the
emerging price dynamic is in the US retail market.

Bloomberg Transcript

On PYD, so where are we going to be? I would expect us to be at or very close to the top end of
the range. As you saw last year, we struggled to keep it within the range. I mean -- and general
treasure tends to be -- to release more than to release. We've tried to be appropriately cautious
or prudent in what we've done, but I certainly thing that as we go into 2022, the high-end of our
target PYD range is a better indicator to the likely outcome than the low end.
When IFRS 17 -- I mean, it's an interesting issue. I mean you're obviously aware that there is a high - there's a great percentage of best estimate component to the choices that are made. I mean,
we have not yet been all through that process with the auditor. And I think it would be our intention
to make the argument that a management's best estimate, which will include elements that there
may be limited evidence of an historical data should still be incorporated into the IFRS best
estimate outcome. So rather than see a very large reduction than the expected outcome, I think
we're going to try and make the argument that the -- what might be perceived as margins are
actually simply reflecting the fact that the data is never perfect and we get constant reminders of
issues that can crop up that had not previously appeared in the data. So I'm hoping we won't see
that step change down and that we can maintain a similar philosophy as we move into the IFRS 17
model.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you, George. Some of my questions have been addressed, but two I
could think of. One is on the PYD that you just indicated were a little bit high end of the range 1% to
2%. What about inflation, social inflation, those topics? I mean we'll then be something that have
been considered in this sort of revised guidance if I can use that word, because that's the first
question?
Second question is just on the dividend and cash flow. So, of course, I mean I have to say my
petitions were met and consensus as well, but the payout ratio of 63%, cash flow much stronger, I
mean was the reimplement were not doing a bit more, because you didn't want to ratchet up? I



mean the dividend policy is higher of last year as well, so if you could just comment a bit about that
would be helpful? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Vinit. So on the PYD topic, as we have incorporated perspective on inflation, social
inflation, yes, I mean, on the introductory comment, I made -- I mentioned the fact that we haven't
fully recognized the benefit of rate versus loss cost trends and that's a bit of a departure from
prior years. If you look at what we've done in terms of building reserve strength in the earlier
periods, I mean, typically, we would have been releasing workers' comp reserves or something
similar, maybe autoliability in some of the European markets and maybe adding to some of the
more social inflation exposed lines in the US. I mean, this year, we've actually held back part of
again what might be perceived to be margin just to increase the level of prudence and give us
more ability to manage that topic if it becomes a magnificent. So I think we've tried to be preemptive around it and the PYD guidance considers those risks.
On dividend and payout ratio, I mean it's an interesting challenge. I mean -- I think I mean going
back to the first question from Andrew, we clearly have a relatively unusual level of unrealized gain
than the result today. So I would never simply take the headline number and base the outcome on
that. I mean, arguably, I think you could argue 75% might imply something slightly higher. I think
there is a -- I mean the several thoughts and the process that we went through, I mean, we've
looked back over the course of the -- I mean, last four or five years and if you look at earnings on
average over that period in total we're very close to 75% payout ratio. So in years where perhaps
for -- because of major losses, we've seen lower earnings and last year with COVID we saw lower
earnings, in other years which has been stronger. It has offset if you low for the passage of time. I
think we also said in the investor updates back in November, I mean, we clearly want to make sure
that shareholders' benefit and a way that reflects the improvement in earnings, but that for a topic
-- as a topic for us, it's going to be something for the end of the cycle, not the middle of it.

The next question comes from the line of Thomas Fossard with HSBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yeah. Good afternoon. Two questions on my side. The first one that will be to come back on the
reserving strengths currently at Zurich. Will you be able to comment on the level of confidence
currently that you have in your reserve compared to where it's been in the past, on an historical
level, just better understand if -- here also on a historical basis, you feel very, very safe and well
actually you're building some additional prudence level, but maybe not all of it will be required
going forward.
And the second question would be related to your debt maturity. Actually you're showing a slide, I
think it's on 41, slide pack, where in fact you've got pretty significant amount of maturing debt,
senior unsubordinated 2022 to 2024 and I was wondering how much it was potentially putting
some constraints on you to return a bit more cash to shareholders or I mean is there anything that
you could comment on the desired level of debt ratio you want to keep? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Thomas. I mean obviously as I look at the reserves, I don't have reserves for events
that I don't expect to happen, otherwise I'd be in trouble quite quickly. I think what we're trying to
do is to be consistent -- to be conservative around how we approach it and recognizing this is talk
rather than something that I'm scientifically proving. I mean, I think, in all of the last three or four



FINAL

years, even with the level of PYD that we've had from our internal metrics, the percentile, and our
reserve range has increased. I think the only time that I've seen a good day recently was Ogden,
when of course we used part of the reserve strength to deal with Ogden, all other years has gone
up and currently we would be at one of the highest numbers. I can't recall here. If I'd, probably the
highest number.
I mean, I doesn't mean to say that we've got a port that we can draw on when we wish, but what it
does is that we create more resilience around some of the risks that we all know are out there,
whether that's the inflation topic that was discussed earlier, I mean whether that's just any other
risk that can come up in the portfolio overall and that includes the social inflation or litigation topic
in the US. So there's never any guarantee, but any number is going to be enough. With the
numbers we have today is higher than the one we had a year ago and it's higher sales in the one
year before that, and I think it just gives us a measure of protection against some of the risks that
are out there.
From a financing perspective and the general question is that, could there just any constraints for
what we might like to do. Otherwise, I mean, not really, I think the -- if you look at the -- I mean we
give this simplified capital structure picture, I mean we are very close to the target levels. And if I
actually do some redemptions, which take place the other end in this year, it will actually look at the
underleveraged potentially compared to target. I mean, our aim would be to maintain around
those kinds of levels going forward. So I don't expect the -- that the financing needs that we have
over 2022 and 2023 to create any significant constraints on what we would like to do either to
invest in the business more broadly or if it comes to that to increase cash returns to shareholders.

The next question comes from the line of Dominic O'Mahony with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.

Q - Dominic O'Mahony
Hi folks. Thank you for taking my questions. Two from me. Just first one on the Farmers' outlook,
the high single-digit premium growth. I wonder if you could just give us some color on the
breakdown of that, the inorganic type -- the organic and I suppose what I'm really getting at is, any
sense of how you see that business progressing on a sort of a normalized basis into the next
several years in terms of topline?

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Dom, the second question is really just -- George I wonder if you could expand on your opening
comments on capital management.

Q - Dominic O'Mahony
In terms of the use of surplus capital to support growth, one of the things you said earlier was that
your organic growth doesn't really seem to create much strain on capital at all and so I'm sort of
wondering if you have surplus capital, it's not going to get matter too much if you wanted to sort
of fast and accelerate it organically. Is that the right way to think about it that actually we sense that
you have surplus beyond that? Organic isn't going to be the way would you deploy it, what if I
misunderstood that? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Dominic. So on the Farmers topic, I think the easiest way to think about the split of
growth, I mean if you look at the growth -- I mean we've given two numbers for last year, so one



FINAL

was, like-for-like, one is including the net. The net contribution is about 75% of the full year. So I
expect to pick up the other 25%, so that would explain a slightly higher than normal guidance
around Farmers and I'd expect both books to be growing kind of in that mid single digit territory.
I think the rate dynamic as I mentioned earlier seems to be picking up momentum in the US. It's
clear that -- I mean there are issues across the market with frequency and severity, that's going to
drive rate filings, I think, pretty much everywhere and also in some of the key markets for the
Exchanges. You've seen some people step away and maybe move more to an E&S type structure.
And I think, again, of course that has a big impact on capacity and hopefully some influence on the
regulators where rate has to be filed for us to get or for the exchange to get the required
approvals. So I think mean this should be a pretty decent year I think for both of the businesses.
But if you're trying to think of the Met part versus the Farmers Management Company, the major
part of the drive will be that 25% pickup because of the additional three months.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the opening comment I made on capital management, I think your interpretation is pretty much
spot on. So it's not zero, but if we grow the firm by 10% and we grow across -- especially across
P&C and we don't grow in the highly exposed risk categories, I mean, we're not going to get close
to a 10% capital usage type number. And if I -- I think I've said in the past that if you think of the
capital generation, I mean we have about 75% of it back. We keep about 25%. That would fund, I
mean, pretty high single -- I mean, potentially even low double-digit growth rates across the entire
firm.
So the organic -- I just don't see that being the principal way in which we absorbed the capital
levels that we currently run with. I think from our perspective, I mean, we would like to deploy if we
see things that make sense. I think we've been reasonably successful in doing that over the course
of the last five years. I mean things are not quite as active on the buy side is, maybe they have
been for sometimes studying from the types of risk that we are interested in. But I wouldn't
completely exclude the possibility as we go through the year, we'll see things that we think could
actually allow us to accelerate achievement, some of the strategic priorities, grow earnings, which
of course grows the dividend, which is the primary goal.

Q - Henry Heathfield

{BIO 19760919 <GO>}

Great. Thank you. Just a couple of clarifications really. So, well -- and interest in some accounting
movements as well. On the acquisition of MetLife and into Farmers, I mean, I know you touched on
this answering one of the questions, but I'm just -- could I get a better idea of how this business is
now changing these performance management services company, which was really just
administration services working on the back of Farmers Exchanges and now it seems the



FINAL

acquisition of MetLife, you're actually moving more into kind of an underwriting business
performance. Is that the way we should be kind of -- or I should think about it? So we've got this
MetLife business, which now sit side by side with the Farmers Exchanges and the Farmers
Management Services, FMS, Administration Management Services with both those elements, if you
see what I mean, maybe you could help me onto that. That's my first question.
And then with regard to your insurance contracts, since there has been a bit of kind of
compression in the valuation particularly within future like policyholder benefits and then in the
policyholder contract deposit, I think on the first one of those, there is the big outflow of about
$3.4 billion, which relates to the sale in Italy on Life, I was wondering just help me understand
whether that's predominantly driven by client, those occasional guaranteed spread business that
you really wanting to move away from that and move more into the unit-linked business or there is
something else that I need to think about? That would be really helpful and maybe just any color
you might just provide, any more changes in the future going forward on kind of that divestments
including that from a traditional part of business if that's the case.
And then secondly within the development of policyholder contract deposits -- sorry, that was on
the prior question on referring to page 42 in the financial statements. And then on page 43, within
the development of policyholder contract province, there is a decrease of around $2.6 billion within
both of these movements, FX at the large part play, but there is a decrease of about $2.6 billion
related to other comprehensive income. And is that -- should I just, is that really just movements in
investments that relate to the value of the investments to say and the liability, perhaps you could
just help me answer that. So that's my three questions. Thank you.

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Henry. So on the last one, can I ask you a favor. Can I have the IR guys call you back on that
one because they could only give you a better answer than I would on the call. On the other two,
on the MetLife, P&C topic, so apologies if I've left the impression that the Zurich side of the
relationship is now engaged and underwriting is note, so it continues to be a management
company structure. As you pointed out in the traditional model, we provided service for a fee and
it continues to be that on the MetLife P&C following the MetLife P&C acquisition. So Zurich is not -no underwriting alongside the exchange.

Q - Henry Heathfield

{BIO 19760919 <GO>}

Sorry, did you acquired MetLife (inaudible) that confuses us. Did you acquired MetLife -- I mean did
you acquired the underwriting part in MetLife?

A - George Quinn

The Farmers Exchanges acquired MetLife.

Q - Henry Heathfield

{BIO 19760919 <GO>}

Do you paying money for this?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

(inaudible) we do think if this is -- the exchange has bought business and we will benefit from a
stream of fee income into the future as a result of the acquisition. The exchange expects to be
compensated for giving access to that stream of business because we pay them for that as part of
this deal. So the way to think if this is that they acquire the underwriter and we're essentially paying
them for a perpetual distribution agreement. Is that makes sense?

Q - Henry Heathfield

{BIO 19760919 <GO>}

So you bought MetLife and you are providing the exchanges access to the underwriting of MetLife
and you started engaging underwriting on the MetLife acquired businesses is the other way I think

I mean if it helps, we can spend more time at the offline and go through in more detail. On your
analytics around the dynamics, I mean they are probably small and so the preference protection
for unit-linked for the non-guaranteed types of life product. And therefore, I mean, you potentially
do see some compression of asset balances over time because of that. I mean you will also see
quite low volatility because of market movements, but given the group's preference, risk
preferences and life, acquiring assets, setbacks, guaranteed life products, it's just not a priority for
us.
