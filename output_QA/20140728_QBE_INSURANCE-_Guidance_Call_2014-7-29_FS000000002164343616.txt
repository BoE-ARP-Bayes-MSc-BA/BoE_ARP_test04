MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the QBE Market
Update. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation
followed by a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being
recorded today, Tuesday, 29 July, 2014.
I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Mr. John Neal, CEO.
Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.

John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. I have our Group CFO, Pat Regan, present with me together
with Tony Jackson, our Group Head of Investor Relations.
I would like to provide some color on today's market release that comes ahead of QBE's
interim results, which is scheduled for 19 August. But before I do, can I be clear that as we
are still completing our half-year review and closure processes, questions-and-answers
today will have to be limited to matters contained in the announcement.
We are making the release today following a detailed review I instigated in Latin America
that culminated in the need for an increase in reserves of around $170 million, the vast
majority of which is for the workers' compensation business in Argentina.

FINAL

I want to take this opportunity to give you more context for the action that we've taken
and the impact it will have. The vast majority of the prior accident year claims
development in Argentina relates to the workers' compensation portfolio and follows a
detailed review of our claims reserves and an observed increase in litigated workers'
compensation claims cost arising from legislative changes in 2012 and 2013 and partly in
response to the deteriorating economic conditions in Argentina.
As a result of the review, we have also adopted new and more sophisticated actuarial
models that better deal with the changing claims development patterns in Argentina.
Having received the output of the review, the increase proposed is very considerably
higher than we would have anticipated. However, in light of recent experiences, I
considered it critical that we deal with this issue once and decisively.
Indeed, QBE's Argentine workers' compensation claims reserves are now more than 2.5
times the average that local peers hold in their statutory accounts, the litigated workers'
compensation claims.

Bloomberg Transcript

This necessary action will have an impact of reducing our 2014 insurance profit margin by
1% for the full year. There are three other items I wanted to provide further detail on
before handing over to questions and answers. And these being an update on QBE's
claims reserves generally and our prior-year claims development, our performance
expectations for the first half of 2014, and confirmation of our further announcements
scheduled for 19 August.
It is encouraging that absent Latin America, our other divisions in the aggregate will show
prior-year positive claims development of approximately $14 million. We continue to see
favorable prior-year development in Australia/New Zealand and our European divisions.
In North America, we have around $32 million of prior adverse development movement
on our crop portfolio, which is in line with industry peers, following a tough 2013. And
elsewhere in the portfolio, prior-year claims activity amounts to less than 1% on their
claims line.
More broadly, and when reflecting on the group performance for the first half, whilst
weather conditions in Australia had been benign, industry data puts the cost of natural
disasters globally at $22 billion, notably driven by flood, hail and wind events in the US and
Europe. The unusual development of flood losses in the UK over a ten-week period in the
first quarter, we estimate to have cost us $85 million more than we would have
anticipated.
And for this reason, our large individual risk and catastrophe claims cost will be 10% of net
earned premium in the first half. Indeed, this event, when coupled with a one-off provision
we've reported in Latin America today of around $170 million, contributes to the
difference between our interim combined operating ratio of 96% to 97% and the market's
expectation of a figure closer to 93%.

FINAL

Accordingly and notwithstanding the more challenging market conditions that many have
commented on in 2014, our global businesses are performing in line with expectations.
On 19 August, we will provide a detailed update on performance division by division and a
resume of our strategic assessment of those businesses we deem core and non-core,
which, through the second half, will allow us to further improve the balance sheet.
And so, in summary, whilst it's very frustrating to be reporting a further prior accident year
claims development, we do believe it was important to act decisively in Argentina and to
ensure we have reserved conservatively for the long term. Our worldwide businesses are
in good and increasingly better shape and we continue to expect to deliver solid levels of
profitability across the group in 2014.
So thank you and we're prepared to take questions on today's market release.

Q&A
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. And your first
question comes from the line of Ross Curran from CBA. Please go ahead.

Q - Ross N. Curran

{BIO 15090587 <GO>}

Hi, gents. I realize you said you're going to probably leave this for the full-year results, but
I just noticed, conspicuous in the absence are any comments on dividend or outlook for
earnings in the second half. Do you have any comments on either of them?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

I think as far as dividend, Ross, I think you're right in your opening remarks. We're still
going through the processes of finalizing the half-year results and it'll take the board's
consideration to determine any impact on dividend. I think there's no change in our
dividend policy. Remains to pay 50% or up to 50% of cash profit.

Q - Ross N. Curran

{BIO 15090587 <GO>}

And can we also assume then the European workers' comp we saw in Italy over last year,
that's all been sorted out as well?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

Yeah. The reserves on the â€“ it's, in fact, medical malpractice.

Q - Ross N. Curran

{BIO 15090587 <GO>}

I'm sorry.

FINAL

Fantastic. Okay, thank you.

Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Nigel Pittaway from Citigroup.

Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

Good morning, guys. A few questions, if I may. First of all, can you make some comments
on the source of the premium weakness because, although you're saying that FX is
adverse relative to PCP, I think it's favorable relative to the time you originally guided. So
can you just explain where the premium weakness has come from, please?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Nigel, it's simply a reflection of more challenging market conditions than we would
have anticipated turning into 2014. Notably, that's in European market on both the
international business and on the reinsurance business, particularly on the reinsurance line.
So if we're not seeing the right price for the business, then we're quite rightly pulling away
from business. It was particularly prevalent in the second quarter with the reinsurance
renewals coming in on the Japanese book and on the US portfolio.

Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

All right. Okay. And then, secondly, just on the large losses, can you comment how the
sort of new reinsurance arrangements worked and whether or not the loss was greater or
less as a result of having this?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

Yeah. The only difference really I tried to call out in the earlier remarks is that the floods in
the UK in the first quarter were quite different to a conventional loss, in that they
manifested over a ten-week period. And accordingly, the losses that are reported during
that period are all net. So there is no response from our reinsurance treaties to those
losses where you'd normally expect a singular event to go into the reinsurance program,
and that's the simple reason why, and I called the number out, the losses there are about
$85 million higher or 1%, if you like, on the allowances through the half than we would have
anticipated.
I think the only second thing I would say is that there has been greater loss activity outside
of Australia than people have perhaps anticipated, particularly in June where we saw
some pretty heavy hailstorms in Europe impacting Belgium and Germany and Central
Europe.

Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

FINAL

All right. And then just on the crop, you, obviously, flagged further, I think it was, $32 million
adverse development. You're already reporting a combined ratio of close to 103% there.
So by my estimates, that takes it up to about 106%, which I thought was impossible under
the reinsurance arrangements. So can you make some comments on that? And then also,
obviously, ACE and some of the others flagged this type of adverse development quite a
while ago, so just why it's taken so long as well to sort of advice of that?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

Yeah. I think we were early than most in terms of calling the result for crop, which was
what we did in December last year. Most of the development actually came through in the
first quarter. And I think it's the way in which the reinsurances interrelate on a state-bystate basis with the government reinsurance operations that's really causing the
difference. But you're right, the combined ratio is going to be somewhere around about
104%, 105% for 2013 in the final reckoning.

Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

All right. So I thought the cap with the reinsurance was 103%. That's, obviously, not right.

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

It depends on how the losses fall on a particular commodity and on a state-by-state basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

All right. Okay. Yeah. And then, obviously, you were talking, obviously, about having done a
detailed actuarial review in Argentina. But the impression you, obviously, gave was that
there was a global actuarial review that had been pretty detailed. So, I guess, the
question is why wasn't this picked up in the global review and are there any other areas
where you feel that you're going to have to do these actuarial reviews which could result
in further, as I called, one-off losses?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

Sure. I think the encouraging thing, Nigel, for us is that 90% of our businesses are
contained within three major divisions: Australia/New Zealand, Europe and North America.
I think as we've said before, both in Australia/New Zealand and Europe, where a
substantial majority of our reserves are held, we have and continue to be happy with the
reserve in position and indeed continue to see positive prior-year development. So that's
encouraging for us.
North America remains a division that we clearly need to keep the closest eye on. And
absent the numbers we're talking about on crop, you're talking about a comparatively
small movement of somewhere around about $15 million on the other business. So that's
encouraging too, but we've got hold of that position.

FINAL

Latin America, in particular, through the first quarter, I think the changing dynamics in
Argentina really pushed us into a very strong review of those reserves. So we just wanted
to make absolutely certain that we had got a long-term line of sight on a long-term class
of business.
And frankly, going into that review, I would not have anticipated a number anywhere near
as large as the number we're disclosing today. But having stressed that analysis, I am
satisfied that it is the right number to take. And as I think I've referred to in my opening
remarks, I think it's very important that we demonstrate that we're decisive and act clearly
until we have in taking the provision that we've taken.
I don't know, Pat, if you want to...

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, John. Hello, Nigel. I think what I'd add is, obviously, somebody joining
new, there are a few things you look for when you're trying to assess for kind of risk of
prior-year in terms of continuity, various things, whether that be people, processes, data,
systems, books of business, kind of underlying macro inflation as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I certainly sat down with the actuaries of our big business units. The data, process,
systems, et cetera, et cetera, in places like Australia and Europe are pretty stable. We're
not seeing any unusual trends in those and really any of the portfolios. The one that was
talked about a minute ago in medical malpractice, I think, as John alluded to, is more
stable now.
Clearly, the one that a lot of time and attention has been put into is North America and
then that's -not a lot I can add to what's already been talked about there. We are seeing
more stable developments on that in this six months. But as John said, clearly, that's the
one that we'll all keep a close, thorough eye on as we go forward.
The other one that was â€“ that fits that that, obviously, needed looking at and the review
has looked at is Argentina, in particular, given the long-term nature and some of the
macro and particular claims development in workers' comp there. So there aren't any
other portfolios that have got those kind of characteristics to them. So this is the one that
really needed that review and that review has now been done.

Q - Nigel Pittaway

Hi, John. I presume that's me. Apologies if this line is not clear, just getting off a plane.
And also apologies if these questions have been asked already. Could you just explain
why you had a net risk margin release (0:15:27-0:15:36)?

FINAL

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

I certainly didn't catch that, James. I wonder whether you could â€“ could you just say that a
little bit more loudly? You're very faint.

Q - James Coghill

{BIO 14006200 <GO>}

Apologies. Can you hear me now?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

Yes, better.

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Clearly. Yes.

Q - James Coghill

{BIO 14006200 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I was interested in understanding that net risk margin release of $55 million, why that's
come out of the half ? That's quite unusual for the PoA to drop at the half ? And if you
could just remind us what your targets are there for the full year.

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

Yes. So I think the simple answer is that the PoA moves around with seasonality, notably
crop. So we don't actually have any crop reserves of any substance through the half year.
Obviously, they exist at some level at the year-end and they have a beneficial impact on
the coefficient variant analysis that takes place on the PoA.
So we established a proportion of the difference between the PoA that we're showing
and 90% â€“ I'll come back to 90% â€“ is really from the crop. And we believe that our target
PoA on a full year basis of 90% will be met by year-end. So we just let that number flow in
full anticipation that 90% will be applicable at year-end.

Q - James Coghill

{BIO 14006200 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks for that. And then on the net investment yields running at 2.7%, there's,
obviously, some mark-to-market benefits there relative to what you were targeting for the
full year. Can you just clarify what those were?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

I might ask Pat to comment on that.

A - Patrick C. Regan

Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2014-07-28

FINAL

Yeah. Our running yields, to your point, would be closer to about 2.2%, I think. So the delta
between that and the 2.7% is mainly made up of a combination of both mark-to-market
gains â€“ it's not completely mark-to-market gains because we've also made some actual â€“
kind of realized gains as well. But the delta between about a 2.2% running yield and the
2.7% is a combination of mark-to-market and realized gains.

Q - James Coghill

{BIO 14006200 <GO>}

Thank you.

And your next question comes from the line of Kieren Chidgey from Deutsche Bank.
Please go ahead.

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, guys. I've got a couple of questions. I'll just step through them one by one,
if that's okay. Just starting with Latin America. When I go back to your accounts over the
last couple of years and have a look at the undiscounted top-ups, the number is quite
substantial. You had $200 million in 2012. I think there was another $140 million last year
and now we're talking another $170 million, so all up $510 million over two-and-a-half
years, which, on our numbers, suggest about 80% increase in your reserves in Latin
America.
I'm just surprised that things can be up that much. Obviously, inflation has, obviously,
pushed up and that would have contributed to a large degree in that. But can you just go
into a little bit more detail around what specifically has changed, particularly in the last six
months, given a lot of these issues have clearly been around for two years and given sort
of the comfort that you provided at the December results around being on top of those
issues?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Kieren, hi. It's Pat. I'll have a crack at that. Just to your first point, just going into detail, the
numbers that you referenced, as we said, undiscounted, the $200 million and $140 million
are slightly apples and oranges because, obviously, the $170 million is (0:19:24).

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

But in terms of answering your question, there's a number of things changing within
Argentina. Most obviously, you've got the macro environment which has changed a lot this
year, so we saw a 20% devaluation of the peso in January, the consequent impacts on
inflation. And when you're dealing with a long-tail business, and our workers' comp
business there is very long tail, we're kind of ten years-plus in many ways, that is kind of
impactful.
Page 8 of 22



FINAL

Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2014-07-28

Probably the more important thing, though, is there's a lot of changes to the underlying
claims development. So for workers' comp claims, a number of things are happening in
the industry generally there. Claims are being reported earlier. Claims are being finalized
earlier. So if you look at the development quarters for accident years, you'll see a gradual
kind of increase in finalization rates. The proportion of claims that are being litigated, it's
changing quite a bit. That's not a brand new phenomenon, but it is a phenomenon that's
certainly accelerated over the last 12 months or so. And some of that is based on these
legislation changes happening (0:20:29) has broadened out the scope of claims that
could be successfully litigated.
Now, the difficulty of this is â€“ there are two impacts. One is an increased frequency, which
we're seeing, and it should have a corresponding reduction in severity. And what we've
been really probing in the data is actually kind of â€“ we've taken what we think is a pretty
conservative position on the severity â€“ actually, we're not really going to assume that
severity comes down, and hence we book the frequency increase, but not the severity
decrease. And that really in a nutshell is why we've ended up with a big number and a
number that's quite a bit bigger than the local market.

Bloomberg Transcript

Obviously, this is something we'll continue to watch going forward in terms of whether
that decrease in severity ultimately comes through, which could of possibly, logically, it
would do. But they are the things that have been changing. And making the judgments of
the right picks on all of that is quite complex generally, but particularly in that environment.
To help us do that, we also put in a new actuarial model that we've used here in Australia
and that's, I think, enhanced our ability to make some of these selections.

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

Okay. And just to be clear around the increase in frequency you've assumed, does that
allow for further uplifts in propensity to claim and litigation just given the economy is
travelling pretty tough at the moment.

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yeah. We factored in the latest data on that. To an extent, (0:21:59) would be if you look
at the charts and they can't go up that much more, simply (0:22:02) with all of the cases
litigated, if they carried on at this current rate of increase. But, yeah, we have made what
we think are pretty sensible assumptions around that.

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

We've also taken the data back and drawn comparisons with other territories both in Latin
America and in North America, with the frequency of claimant is six to ten times the level
you're seeing elsewhere. So we've got to acknowledge that level of frequency. But as Pat
suggested, it's comfortably out of step with what you would expect, but nonetheless
we've accepted the numbers as presented.

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

Okay. Presumably â€“ whilst this has had a prior-year impact presumably, you maintain
reserves at the sort of levels going forward on an accident year basis, what impact does
Page 9 of 22



Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2014-07-28

that have on the underlying combined ratio in Latin America?

FINAL

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

So two points â€“ yeah, two points to make on that. First point is that the model that we're
looking to deploy here is really driven to look at finalization rates for claims. So assuming
that there is a correlation between inflation and interest rates, then you should not see
fringing (0:23:08) movements in the claims central estimate prospectively. So that's why
we've taken the action we have, is the first point to make.
Second point to make is that we're actually going through the process of back allocating
the changes we've made to the applicable accident years. We had a look at the
performance backwards and forwards. What I can say is that the business will still have
been profitable and will still be profitable going forwards. It's a very obvious thing to say
because, of course, the corollary of inflation rates that are running close to 40% is interest
rates are around about 25%. So you're getting a significant return on the assets that
you're holding. But that's an analysis we're still completing in some detail. And again, in
that respect, I think we'll update the market more fully on 19 August.

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The only other thing I'd add to it is stating the obvious. This is very long-tailed stuff. So the
reserve increase, you really do need to appoint a multiple accident years. I'm going to
give you a sense of that. For our 2002 accident year, there's something close to 15% of
claims still not viable. Obviously, it's very long-tailed stuff. So that the reserve increase for
comp is, will be applied back over multiple accident years.

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. The other question, second one just on your large claims, experience in
your reinsurance covers around that. John, just to be clear, are you still sort of â€“ would you
budget 8.5% of premium for the first half ? Are you still running this first half, second half
differential? And related to that, if you have had more large individual claims in the first
half, are you approaching your deductibles on your group aggregate covers which should
allow you to have a better large individual result in second half ?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

Yeah. I think the first point I would make, Kieren, is that when we do the budgeting for
large individual risk and cat claims, we tend to look at them across the full 12 months. And
what we've done historically is, because of the greater propensity to weighting for cat
losses in the second half, particularly in Q3 with the North American hurricane season, and
that's why we said indicatively you look at a greater propensity for low decline for the
second half than the first half. But, certainly, in budgeting terms, we tend not to look at it
on that basis.
So I think that the short answer to that is I am satisfied that we've got adequate
allowances set aside to both large individual risk and cat claims. There's nothing that's
changing my mind in that respect. And equally, I'm happy that the reinsurance structures
are appropriate to the portfolios that we underwrite.

FINAL

On the large individual risk claims, we've just got, as I've called out, just some unusual risk
claims that have presented because of flooding over an extended period of time, just
meaning the way you might normally have expected a conventional risk type loss to be
responding â€“ to be asking your reinsurance treaty to respond, that's not the case in this
instance.
I don't see any reason for that to put us outside of our allowances. It hasn't at the half
year and it won't at the full year in terms of the allowances that we're carrying. So, no, I
don't see a particular issue with the large individual risk claims being of a size that will
require the aggregate covers to respond.

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

I'm just sort of asking whether or not you've eroded enough of your, sort of, deductible
on the aggregate cover, so that if you do have more in the second half, you're getting a
high degree of recoveries on this?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

No. As at the moment, I would say it's a hard number to call. But at the moment, I would
say the cost of large individual risk claims are not at a level that would require the
aggregate to respond.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

Okay. All right. And then finally, just on the â€“ following up on an earlier question around the
premium pullback, just the particular areas you cited such as reinsurance in various classes
in Europe, at a very high level, have the returns you've been making in those areas where
you've significantly scaled back over 2012 and 2013 already been substantially below your
underlying expectations at a group level? And therefore, as you exit those, there's sort of
a positive margin mix impact for the group more broadly or is it just there's been such a
significant change in rates this year that were delivering okay and now they won't going
forward?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

Yes. I think there's three things, I would say, in this space. I think if you look in the
reinsurance that â€“ our combined operating ratios have been absolutely superb, particularly
following a quite (0:28:07) year in 2013. So we certainly expected some pressure on price.
I think that pricing reductions, and you see some of them here in Australia, (0:28:17)
renewals, we've seen them on the Florida renewals in July are greater than we perhaps
anticipated. In which case, then we'll just be a bit quieter in those books of business.
And I think equally, as we note, pricings in the London market seem pretty competitive for
a period of time. And you would be hoping at this stage in the cycle, you'd see prices
moving up. That's not the case. I metaphorically shrug my shoulders at that. That's our job.
We're meant to cope with market conditions and I think we are coping with market
conditions, frankly, with the results that we're putting out.

FINAL

Two other areas I'd reference, one will be closer to home. I think in the Australian market,
we saw pretty hectic competition around the July renewals, to be honest with you. So if
you look at our premium throughputs in July 2014 versus July 2013 for the industry, it's
down, showing you that price competition there is pushed quite hard. But, again, I think
we're happy with the performance of the portfolio.
And then the third one I'd call out is really in North America as we said, we grapple with
right-sizing the lender-placed insurer and particularly the lender-placed components of
QBE FPS. We have seen some falling volume there as the US economy recovers. And you
just see default rates falling, and therefore, less business coming from the lender-placed
space. So that's been a factor as well. So those are the three callouts, I would say, that are
having an impact on top line.

And your next question comes from the line of Ryan Fisher from Goldman Sachs. Please
go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ryan Fisher

{BIO 3487027 <GO>}

Thanks, guys. Obviously, a lot of questions and there's a lot of answers of what I was
going to ask. But on the GWP, I just wanted to check, given that I gather some of the
reinsurance is sort of 1H biased with GWP, should we just annualize â€“ roughly annualized
the shortfall from the first half ? Or are there any half-on-half issues we need to take into
account?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

I don't think there's any dramatic seasonality that is worth â€“ it's more the underlying
business points that John referenced. The only one actually that we did try and highlight in
the back of the release was there was an FX impact on both GWP and earned premium in
the first half, so that contributed. So you can make your own conclusions about FX rates in
the second half. But other than that, I don't think there was anything particular seasonal. It
was just general business trading.

Q - Ryan Fisher

{BIO 3487027 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And just a final question. Just picking of the big picture thing, so you've
commented that, and correct me if I'm misinterpreting any of these things, but you've
commented that you're still fairly happy with the 10.5% large loss budget. You've indicated
in the release that your expenses are trending at least on track for what you're hoping. I
think, John, you indicated that, and I think, Pat, you as well, indicated that you're pretty
happy with reserves post Latin America for the final â€“ please, you confirm those three
things.

But also on capital, that's sort of the final leg, how are you feeling about the capital
position and the gearing at this point?

FINAL

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

So I'll deal with all four and Pat might want to jump in. I'd say the first one, yes, I'm very
happy that the allowance is at 10.5% of net earned premium, the large individual risks, that
are appropriate. I see no reason to change that. And I think when you do get chance, if
you could detail on 19 August division by division, our underlying performance is indicating
an improvement in performance which I think would support that those allowances are
right and appropriate.
Those are the cost-out programs. I think as I've said before and I'll continue to say, those
are exceeding expectations. So we're very happy that they will deliver at least in lines with
the market expectations.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think on the reserve point, yes, we do believe that we've covered the reserves now,
disappointing that is and frankly frustrating as it is, to be dealing with the Argentine issue
today. I think that's evidenced by the stability we're seeing elsewhere in the book.
On the fourth issue, of course, as you can sort of see with a simple hinge of metrics, our
capital position will inevitably improve during the half year, not least because we're still
talking about making a profit of around $390 million. So capital is actually improving and
gearing is going down. But it is our intention to give a very full update on our capital plans
and indeed our reference core and non-core businesses at the half year and it's probably
best to leave any further discussion on that until 19 August.

Q - Ryan Fisher

{BIO 3487027 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. But nothing dramatic on the capital front at this point?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

No, nothing today.

Q - Ryan Fisher

{BIO 3487027 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, John.

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yeah. The other thing I'd add to that, John, as we alluded to there on the capitals, gearing
has got better in the six months as we've made money. So that's what helped. I think
we're fairly comfortable we want that to continue to trend down over time. And we think
there's some intelligent things we can do in the core and non-core review that will very
specifically help that.

guidance at this point, is that correct?

And your next question comes from the line of Daniel Toohey from Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Daniel P. Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Good morning, guys. Just a few questions. Firstly, on Argentina, with the recent â€“ sort of
the recent top-ups, I thought we already had a buffer that we've put in there over and
above what was necessary just to insulate against any adverse development. So can you
confirm sort of what that buffer was, and so it's clearly that would â€“ obviously move
through that buffer and exhausted that on top of the $170 million?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

Yeah. I think, Daniel, what that might be is â€“ and we've done some cross referencing as
part of the process here of looking at how the local market behaves and how they
reserve, we've always reserved on a significantly more conservative level on a per case
basis for these litigated claims than the local market has.
So the decisions that we've taken today have further â€“ if you like, further widened the gap
between the reserve position that they would hold and we would hold. I hasten to add in
saying that, I think we've taken the right and appropriate steps. It's not a reflection of that
being any more or any less than that.

Q - Daniel P. Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Okay. And on the core and non-core components, is the long-tail volatile business in
emerging markets, is that core or non-core?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

I think if you turn to this â€“ let's deal specifically with the workers' compensation book in
Argentina. It's a book of business that we've underwritten since 2001. We do think our
Page 14 of 22



Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2014-07-28

approach is different for the local market in terms of the way in which we select risk, price
for risk and reserve. And as I hinted earlier on, whilst there's clearly some further
improvements we can make at the front end of the business, it is profitable and has been
profitable for us.

FINAL

Q - Daniel P. Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Okay. The high individual risk losses, it seems to be â€“ there's a recurring theme with
respect to that. There always seems to be some unusual risk claim and at a frequency
which is probably higher than expected and it's been, I guess, that for a little while. How
are you going about fixing the underwriting position on some of these broker facilities or
areas where you might be â€“ have historically been exposed to some weakness?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. It's a good question. Perhaps the one thing I should've been clear on and haven't
been clear on so far is that the frequency of large individual risk losses is down. And that's
the point that's encouraging me that, whether it be the underwriting decisions that we've
taken in Europe â€“ and as you know, we've withdrawn from some lines of business. All the
decisions we've made as we look to reset North American business into the commercial
specialty space, I think on the underlying performance, are telling me that we've made
the right decisions.
In terms of where the market's expectations were or consensus expectations on our large
individual risk and cat costs through the first half, I think there were just a couple of
features that are probably â€“ make consensus come to a different conclusion than us, one
of which was the sort of unusual nature of the way in which loss is presented through in an
extended period of flooding in the UK through January and February. I think the second of
which is probably not having the broadest line of sight over the loss activity in the US and
notably in Europe in June. I think the losses are perhaps bigger than the market expects.

Q - Daniel P. Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Okay. Can you comment on the risk margins or the adequacy thereof of risk margins in
Europe?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

Yeah. I think in â€“ risk margins generally, it's a good point really because I think we need to
remind ourselves that we're always talking about the claims central estimate here and
we're still talking about risk margins of around about $1.5 million is about the central
estimate that we're talking about. And as I referred to earlier, we've not changed our sort
of average target from one year to the next of a probability of adequacy of through 90%.
On the European business, I might ask Pat to comment specifically on that.

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

We'll give the group number today and we'll give you more specifics, obviously, as we get
together on August 19. I'd refer back to is generally what we're seeing outside of
Page 15 of 22



Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2014-07-28

FINAL

Argentina, specifically, is pretty stable claims development across our major portfolios.
And that certainly includes Europe. And I think we said in the release today, we actually
saw positive prior-year development coming out of Europe. And actually, it wasn't â€“ that
wasn't the negative loss of ups and downs. It was pretty stable across all of the major
portfolios.

Q - Daniel P. Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. And just a final question then on the cost-out story. Obviously, it looks to be
running ahead of expectation. Clearly, your expense ratio is better than budget, but your
top line is down. As we look ahead, is there a risk â€“ are we really, sort of draw a line in the
sand on the benefits, given if we are moving into a tougher market, are we more likely to
see some of those savings traded away to preserve or retain sort of business?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No. You won't see the savings traded away. I think, yes, there is a risk if your top line falls
that the ratios will go up in percentage terms. I think what I'd say in addition, though, is
that the business is now pretty well versed in terms of managing costs and taking cost
out. And there's no reason why we can't continue to take costs out of the business if
income falls. And that's exactly what we will do.
So, I think the biggest impact for 2014 on cost-out will actually come through â€“ sorry,
they're starting to see the benefit of the cost-out program come through in 2014 on a net
basis. The actual benefits would exceed the investment in costs. In 2015, the important
point to remember is there's no further cost or investment in the program. It's then all
benefit. But as we're saying earlier on, I think if we do see pressure on top line, then
there's no reason why we can't correspondingly take cost out.

Q - Daniel P. Toohey

And your next question comes from Siddharth Parameswaran from JPMorgan. Please go
ahead.

Q - Siddharth Parameswaran

{BIO 15037291 <GO>}

Hi, John. It's Siddharth from JPMorgan. A couple of questions, if I can. Just one on
reserves. I'd like to just clarify, the $170 million in Argentina, is that a number net of the
discount rate change as well? So, presumably, that would have gone up?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Hi, Siddharth. It's Pat here. The $170 million is actually Latin America, the vast majority of
which is Argentina. It is net of the discount rate, yes. So we've made a little footnote in the
release. What we've moved to now is an explicit linkage of both discount rate moves and
claims inflation moves in Argentina specifically.
Page 16 of 22



Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2014-07-28

Those two numbers are always close to 30%. So you end up with some crazy math unless
you look at them on a net basis. So the $170 million is after capturing both the discount
rate and the claims inflation.

FINAL

Q - Siddharth Parameswaran

{BIO 15037291 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. Can I just ask, Pat, about your comments about the US
reserves. It seemed that that was the one market where you still had some residual
concerns. You said you were quite cautious still on how the experience was emerging. I
was wondering if you could just give some comments on what you're seeing in terms of
how the latest accident years, in particular, are trending.
I think from previous comments, I think those are meant to have been reserved more
conservatively than they had in the past. I was just wondering if you'd give some
comments on particular lines that might still be causing some concerns and how the latest
years are trending.

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

(0:42:50) comments, I think, particular set of genius that they're a little bit a statement of
the obvious. The development patterns on the business we're writing now is pretty good.
We're seeing business come through broadly, as you would expect us to see.
I think the kind of the data and the information the team's got around that now is better
than they've had historically, both in terms of business that we kind of are directing
through brokers and are the ones that come through MGA. So I think that's all kind of
good.
But, inevitably â€“ I'm not suggesting we've seen negative development, but, inevitably, just
are a little bit more uncertain on things like the things like the program (0:43:30) just by
the nature of that type of business. That's true of every book run of book of business of
that type. So that's naturally something we'll keep a close watch on. There's nothing new
on flagging in terms of the development patterns around that. But there's much higher
level of complexity in that kind of book.

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

I think, in reverse, if you turn the positive on that, I think whilst there's lots of movement in
crop, I think that's been pretty well flagged across the industry. Absent the crop
movement, the numbers we're talking about in North America in prior are really
comparatively small compared to their income to almost be incidental.

Q - Siddharth Parameswaran

{BIO 15037291 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. Could I just ask a question on rates as well? It seems like a lot of
the rate pressures you're flagging, John, seem to be â€“ seemed to have occurred in the
latter period in the half. So would it be imprudent to assume that some of those
pressures would manifest themselves in the second half in a greater way than they
manifested themselves in the first half ?

FINAL

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

I think the â€“ I'll take the longer-term view of that. I think it's more prevalent for 2015 than it
is for 2014 in many respects. In Europe, I think a significant proportion of the business is
written. So, in terms of the drop in income, I think much was anticipated. It's also important
to remember in Europe that Richard Pryce and the team have taken a pretty tough line in
determining what they think is core to their business. And they have actively discontinued
some lines of business. That work is now complete. So I think that's the activity that you're
seeing. So in the first half of 2014, you've seen the remediation activities really drive the
impact on income and some FX. I think the pricing pressures, which you're seeing in the
marketplace, which would be the hope that you'd see price move in Europe, but looks like
being delayed, and clearly you're seeing price increases getting close to zero, marginally
above zero in Australia, I think, will have an impact on the thinking that we might have for
premium expectation for 2015.

Q - Siddharth Parameswaran

{BIO 15037291 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. Okay. And one last question. Just on what the implications, if there is a credit
rating downgrade at all, are there any lines of business you may not be able to write
business in or that you may face some GWP pressures?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think on the basis of what we're discussing today, again, it's important to remember,
we're dealing with an issue which frustrates us, but impacts our profit, reduces our profit
at the half year. We don't see that impacting our financial strength ratings with any of the
major rating agencies, so we just don't see that as an issue.

Q - Siddharth Parameswaran

{BIO 15037291 <GO>}

Yeah. But if at some stage, there was an issue, are there any class of business where the
credit rating is particularly important to write the business that you currently write?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

I think it's â€“ it's rated independently. Obviously, the LMI business has its own independent
rating, which as you know is AA minus. So it's above the rating that applies for the group.
Their rating was just recently affirmed two weeks ago. But that rating is quite sensitive, but
we don't see any issues there.
I would say, generally, if you took an abstract view, then you could write a predominantly
commercial portfolio with an A Standard & Poor's rating, but that's not what we're setting
out to do. We're looking to maintain an A+ rating and an A rating where they invest. But as
I said, I don't see any issues that we're discussing today that should impair those rating.

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

I'll just refer you back to the comments John and I made earlier on, as well as the increase
of â€“ improvement, I should say, in gearing for the first half. We are going to talk you
through the core, non-core and how we see that kind of improving capital ratios going
forward. So that's much more, the kind of the intention and direction we have (0:47:47).

Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Dive from Filo Capital (0:47:58). Please
go ahead.
Good morning, guys. Following on from an earlier question, can you give me some
indication of the historic profitability since 2001 of the Argentinean workers' comp
business? So, obviously, tomorrow morning, the bears and the (0:48:10) investors are
going to be asking me why QBE is involved in this business, which should appear to be
sort of quite far away from your sort of core geographic markets?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

It's quite a complex exercise. I wish didn't sound like I'm avoiding your question.

Q - Operator
No.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

I think â€“ the first couple of things I'd say is, you need to apply the, albeit sizeable reserve
strengthening clearly, back over a number of accident years. So the amount you're adding
into it any individual accident year comes more in the kind of 15%, 20% increase in the loss
ratio.
Secondly, historically, this business has been viewed as very profitable. Clearly, it's a bit
less profitable. But, previously, you'd have been thinking of combined ratios in the
probably 80s.

Q - Operator
Right.

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Thirdly, as John referenced, it's not a particularly satisfactory or completely satisfactory
answer. You've got elevated â€“ with a higher claims inflation, you have higher investment
income. So the effect of that does mitigate to an extent the higher combined ratio. So
you've still got a business, albeit double-digit ROEs, albeit no way near as profitable as
either we'd like or historically we have thought of it as.

Q - Operator
Okay. And so, going forward, what are your plans for this particular business given the
environment is quite unfriendly?

Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2014-07-28

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. I think in terms of reserve position, we do think we've dealt with that absolutely in
the positions that we've taken.
In terms of our pricing of the products, we are already the most expensive in the
marketplace locally. Our risk selection criteria are very different, very individual, so we do
risk survey every risk on the new (0:50:05) inflection. And we've had a good look at those
processes just to make sure they're as tight as they need to be.
We'll have a second look at pricing just to make sure that we're getting the right levels of
return. Pat's referred to the business will be achieving attractive return on equity. We just
need to make sure those returns on equity are appropriate in a high inflation environment.
So we'll have a look through on pricing in that respect.
The thing I would say is, with the action that we've taken indeed over the past two years,
our market share has fallen by that 30%, 35%. So, we have already acted in advance with
the conditions that we're looking at today in Argentina.

Q - Operator
That's it. Thank you.

And your next question comes from the line of Brett Le Mesurier from BBY. Please go
ahead.

Q - Brett Le Mesurier

{BIO 5909278 <GO>}

Thank you. A few questions. Is the Australia/New Zealand division the only one to make
the 10% insurance margin target in the first half 2014?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Well, I don't think we've given â€“ we haven't given out the specific combined and insurance
margin today, Brett. Obviously, we'll get into that on August 19. But I think we â€“ basically, as
we said in the result, we talked about a couple of specific items, really most of which
relates to Latin America. Europe, Australia, and North America are pretty â€“ and Asia, I
should say, are performing pretty much in line with our expectations.

Q - Brett Le Mesurier

{BIO 5909278 <GO>}

Right. And in the announcement, it said that the European business was doing the same
as it was last year, I think it said, which was an insurance margin of about 5%. Is that the
correct interpretation of your words?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

We were talking specifically that the combined ratio is broadly in line with last year. Again,
we'll give you the insurance margin when we get to the â€“ when we get to the half year. I'd
imagine it to be a little bit more than 5%, but we'll give you that number.

Q - Brett Le Mesurier

{BIO 5909278 <GO>}

FINAL

Now, given that you're confident that you've got the right reserves in all your geographies
and given the central catastrophe claims, large and catastrophe claims number that you
use, I don't really understand why you're not confident about giving an insurance margin
number for the second half of 2014. Is there something else that's going on?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

No, there's nothing else that's going on. We're literally updating the market today as
we're going through the processes to consolidate our half-year result. And as part of that
process, we'll always get through in detail division by division with their updated forecast
for the full year. So it's just not appropriate today to be giving the sort of â€“ detail that
information when the work is not yet completed. So it's as simple as that.

Q - Brett Le Mesurier

{BIO 5909278 <GO>}

When did the actuarial review in Argentina start?

A - John D. Neal

{BIO 20988613 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The actuarial review really flagged late Q1. We'd involved our group actuarial team and
the local actuarial team. So the group actuarial team has actually been down there four
times. Literally, the information, as presented today, was consolidating both with internal
and external actuarial review yesterday in terms of the final number it will come to.
And there's a number of options there, Brett, particularly if you're changing from one
model to another. Do you take the new model in its entirety? Do you blend the two
models? Do you favor (0:53:47) taking the reserving? So there's quite a lot to consider in
the final reckoning. And frankly, I think because of issues that we've been discussing
particularly over the past 12 months, I thought the only thing and right thing to do, take the
action, take it up and take it today.

Q - Brett Le Mesurier
