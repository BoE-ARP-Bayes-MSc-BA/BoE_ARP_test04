Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Earlier this morning, we
announced fourth quarter net operating income of $1.58 per share, with strong results in
both property lines; while personal auto saw weather and pool losses impact its
performance. Our ﬁnancial position is very strong with CAD 970 million of total excess
capital, while our book value is up 7% to $42.72 over last year. Top line was up 3% in the
fourth quarter despite us taking another early lead in pricing across all lines and
provinces. On an annual basis, premiums grew 5% on the back of growth initiatives,
including bolstering our brands, launching new product oﬀerings, and making leaps on
the digital front.

Bloomberg Transcript

We see more of the same in 2017 from a growth point of view. While commercial lines
were impacted by continued diﬃcult conditions in the west, we beneﬁted from the
introduction of new sharing economy products, the expansion of our specialty lines
division, and a favorable rate environment. We delivered a combined ratio of 92.5% in the
quarter, thanks to very strong results in property. Personal auto results were disappointing
with a combined ratio just above 100%. We experienced some choppiness in this
segment in part because of industry pool and early onset of winter. Regardless of these
factors, we ﬁnd this performance unacceptable.
And as we said last quarter, we do not yet fully reﬂect the impact of rate increases in the
pipeline, and the reforms implemented last year. Going forward, these beneﬁts combined
with our action plans in auto including more rates should bring signiﬁcant improvements
in 2017. Our operating return on equity was 12% in 2016 despite signiﬁcant catastrophe
losses. When comparing ourself to the industry as of the third quarter, we outperformed
by a margin of 670 basis points on ROE above our target of 500 basis points. So let's now
look at our fourth quarter results in a bit more detail.
So personal auto grew 3% on a combination of customer experience improvement and
recent rate actions. The combined ratio deteriorated 4 points to 100.9% as we
experienced higher frequency from early winter conditions, losses from industry pools,
and lower prior-year development. We continue to address cost pressures in this segment
with rate increases across the country. In Ontario, we raised rates another 4% eﬀective this
March on top of the 3% applied last September. This rate momentum combined with our
claims action plans, tighter risk selection and continued beneﬁts from reforms are
expected to drive mid single-digit improvement as these actions are orient throughout
the year.
When it comes to the industry outlook for personal auto, we continue to anticipate a
rational competitive environment with low to mid single-digit growth in the coming 12
months as rate increases are implemented to address cost inﬂation. In personal prop,
premiums grew 7% as new products and continued rate increases were deployed in
favorable market conditions. Our proﬁtability remained very strong with a combined ratio
of 75.6% in Q4, and 91% for the full year after absorbing our country's costliest natural

disaster on top of severe summer storms. With healthy top and bottom lines, this segment
is very well positioned for 2017.
In terms of industry outlook for personal property, we see no change there. We expect
recent weather events will prolong the ﬁrm market conditions with mid to upper singledigit growth over the next 12 months. In commercial P&C, diﬃcult conditions in Western
Canada, and robust rate actions taken in competitive markets led to a decline of 3% in
premiums. That said, this business continues to deliver solid proﬁtability with a combined
ratio of 89.4% for the quarter despite catastrophes and ﬁre-related losses well above last
year's. On a full year basis, our combined ratio of 90.2% even with elevated catastrophes
was in line with our low-90%s target.

Bloomberg Transcript

Commercial auto premiums grew 8% in the quarter, mainly from our sharing economy
products. Although the combined ratio of 101.9% was driven by prior year large losses, I'm
encouraged by the underlying performance improvement, which improved by 5.2 points
in the quarter as we continued to implement corrective rate actions. On a full year basis,
our combined ratio was 94.6%, 4.4 points better than last year, another sign that we're on
the right path to reach our low-90%s target in this segment. With respect to the outlook
for commercial lines, markets remain competitive across Canada and particularly diﬃcult
in the west. Therefore, we expect low single-digit growth in the coming year.
In summary, overall, we delivered 92.5% combined ratio in the quarter, a decent result for
a fourth quarter on the back of a very strong result in our property lines. Personal auto was
a drag on our performance in Q4, clearly, but I'm conﬁdent that the actions we're taking
will have a positive impact over the next few quarters. We're also making very good
progress on several of our strategic initiatives. In distribution, for instance, we extended
our direct-to-consumer business with the acquisition of our partnership with National
Bank. Under the agreement, belairdirect will underwrite all policies distributed under the
National Bank's brand, representing approximately $50 million in additional premiums or
0.5 points of growth.
On the digital front, we enhanced our telematics oﬀering with the new mobile application
that improves customer experience but also adds to our data collection capabilities. Now,
speaking of data, we expanded our industry-leading data analytics capabilities with the
launch of the data lab. The mission of the lab is to expand our competitive advantage by
doubling down on our focus on artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning, while
expanding our massive proprietary (08:13) data sets with external data sources including
those from Telematics. Our Claims team was busy as well with the launch of our Toronto
Service Center in the fall. We now have three locations across Canada with the fourth in
Montreal scheduled to open in April. Results so far are positive with higher customer
satisfaction level, and an estimated 15% reduction in cycle times.
And ﬁnally, we continue to do well on the people front. We were named the platinum
level Best Employer by Aon for second year in a row, and a Top Employer for Young
People by Mediacorp. We believe that building engaged teams with a customer focused
mindset and is key to maintaining our competitive advantage. So in conclusion, while Q4
results were below expectation, our overall performance for 2016 was solid in light of the
elevated catastrophe losses. Our property lines performed well, our commercial auto is

FINAL

improving, and we've already introduced signiﬁcant proﬁtability measures to address our
personal automobile business in the near term.
We expect growth momentum to continue in 2017 as we pursue our investments in
customer experience and distribution. And ﬁnally, our balance sheet is solid with $970
million of total excess capital. So with that in mind, we increased our quarterly dividends
by 10% to $0.64 per share, the 12th annual increase since our IPO. So I'm conﬁdent that
our actions and discipline will continue to help us outperform the industry's ROE by 500
basis points, and grow net operating income per share by 10% per year over time.
On that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Marcotte.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Charles. Good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, net operating
income was $212 million driven by the strength of our property lines, stable investment
income and growing distribution activities. The auto lines were a source of pressure on
our underwriting results, though actions are underway to deliver material improvements
in 2017. Our operating ROE was 12% despite 2.5 points from CAT losses above our
expected run rate. We closed the year with $970 million of excess capital and our book
value per share grew 7% from Q4 last year. Our combined ratio for the quarter was 92.5%,
a 4 point increase compared to last year's stellar results.
We attribute the increase as follows; 3 points from weather driven frequency and CATs; 1
point from industry pool losses; 1 point from large losses in commercial property, mostly
ﬁre-related; and 1.5 points of expense savings. The remainder is prior-year development,
which was a bit lower than last year but in line with historical levels. Our expense ratio
improvement in the quarter was due to lower proﬁt sharing commissions on the back of
softer underwriting results and lower general expenses due to cost management. Our
distribution income grew 9% in the quarter to $24 million and reached $111 million for the
year in line with our latest guidance.
As we said on the last earnings call, we expect distribution income to grow north of 15% in
2017, with the usual seasonal variations. Our investment portfolio continues to deliver
consistent investment income, $104 million in the quarter, slightly below last year as
expected. Although average net investments increased 6% to $14 billion from operating
cash ﬂows and mark-to-market gains. This was oﬀset by a lower reinvestment yield. We
continue to expect investment income to decline marginally in dollar terms over the next
12 months.
Our Q4 non-operating results improved $47 million, thanks to realized gains on our
common share portfolio, reﬂecting the rebound in equity markets. Rising interest rates led
to unrealized losses on our fair value to P&L bond portfolio, which were largely oﬀset by
the favorable impact of a higher discount rate on our claims liabilities. Our eﬀective tax
rate was 23.7% in the quarter, 6 points higher than last year, due mainly to the reversal of
a tax provision recorded in Q4 2015. In summary, we reported quarterly earnings per
share of $1.27, 13% lower than last year, as our operating results declined mostly on the

back of weather and pools, while our non-operating results improved materially as equity
markets rebounded.
Finally, a few comments on our ﬁnancial position. Our balance sheet remains very strong.
Our MCT stands at 218%, 3 points higher than at the end of Q3, driven mainly by capital
generated from operations and the phasing of new MCT guidelines. Our total excess
capital amounted to $970 million at the end of the quarter, and our debt-to-total capital
ratio was 19%. Our investment portfolio's unrealized gain position improved $11 million in
the quarter to $269 million, driven by signiﬁcant improvements in our common and
preferred share positions, oﬀset by unrealized losses on our AFS bond portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our capital deployment strategy remains unchanged, prioritizing regular dividend
increases, investing in growth opportunities, and using share buybacks as an additional
capital management tool. This morning we announced a 10% dividend increase to $0.64
per share per quarter, our 12th consecutive annual increase. This represents a 12% annual
growth rate since we IPO'ed in 2004. During the year, we deployed nearly $300 million of
capital towards growth opportunities, including broker acquisitions, investment in
ventures, and the acquisition of the partnership with National Bank. With this latest
acquisition, combined with the integration of CDI acquired in 2015, belairdirect has
materially grown its footprint and is capable of serving customers from coast-to-coast.
We believe consolidation of the P&C industry will continue, both in manufacturing and
distribution, here and abroad. Our troops are experienced and ready to tackle
opportunities as they arise, so is our balance sheet. On buy backs, we lost our program
one year ago, and repurchased nearly 0.5 million shares for approximately $44 million at
an average price of $88.54. While our priority is to invest in growth opportunities, we feel
that buying back shares at times in the market price may not fully reﬂect intrinsic value is a
responsible use of our capital. Therefore, we plan to renew the normal course issuer bid
upon our expire related this week. This renewal does not signal any change in our
perception of the opportunities for market consolidation.
In conclusion, with strong underlying results in property lines, we continue to focus our
eﬀorts on improving results in personal auto with our usual discipline and energy. We
believe the actions we are taking in our auto lines, combined with the strength of our
property lines will drive improved results over the next 12 months. Our earnings have
proven the resilience to adversity during the year, thanks to the strength of our insurance
operations across the country, the contribution of our distribution and investment
activities, and our investments in growth, innovation and technology. With these
advantages in mind, we are looking forward to 2017.
With that, I'll return the call back to Samantha.

FINAL

Your ﬁrst question comes from the line of Geoﬀ Kwan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is
open.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Hi there. I know this is more of a short-term-type question, but as I'm thinking about Q1
results, can you kind of talk about what you're seeing across kind of maybe, even just kind
of general comment, because I think from a weather perspective, at least out here in
Vancouver, the weather has been pretty brutal, unless you like to speed skating on the
side street. In Toronto, though, I think it's been relatively mild. Calgary, I think, it's been a
little bit mixed. But just wanted to get any comments you have on what you're seeing so
far this quarter.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So in fact, being the lead sponsor of the national speed skating team, we do like to speed
skate on side street, but prudently. Patrick who's sort of overseeing our Claims – well, not
sort of, he's overseeing our Claims operation, can give you maybe a perspective on the
level of activity we've seen so far in the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yes. So in January, we've seen, as any January, some variations in weather but no big
events so far. We've had a few ice storms; we've seen some in Atlantic, a good example
yesterday here in Toronto. But none of those events, single events have reached what we
consider a CAT.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

But it has had some impact on general frequency, but nothing unusual for January.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No. Nothing of concern there, and I think service is pretty good as well. So no important
concerns on our part there.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay. And just my other question was, you had I think was about $19 million in
restructuring-ish related costs. Can you just maybe provide a little bit of color – because
you also mentioned some expense management initiatives, maybe some color as to what
you're doing on that front and kind of some color around the size of the booking in Q4?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. Geoﬀ, we're really focused in terms of building an advantage when it comes to
segmentation and claims management. It's been our big focus. We don't talk about
expense as much, but there's a fair bit of focus inside to run the operation as lean as we
can, and constantly sort of challenge ourselves on the status quo. And I think there's been
a fair bit of that in the past few months. I'll ask Louis to give you a perspective. So we do
outperform meaningfully from a combined ratio, and from an ROE point of view. And if
you dig in the numbers, and particularly by channel, and for the broker suite of the
business, as well as the direct business, the thing you'll notice is we also outperform on
expenses meaningfully in each of the channel. And I think that's the way to look at this
because of mix-related issues. That being said, Louis, why don't you give us some color
on some of the moves we've made to remain agile and eﬀective as a shop?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Sure. Thanks for the introduction, Charles, on this topic. So we are continuously managing
expenses, of course. And as part of our usual process, we did take a few actions back in
the fall, and essentially driven that streamlining some of the management structures inhouse. So we did take some action that led to a bit of a restructuring costs. It's in the $10
million, $13 million range, and that's what you see in the non-operating results, Geoﬀrey.
So that was booked in Q4, executed in Q4, and we'll have a slight positive impact in 2017.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Great. Thank you very much.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good morning, Kai.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

So ﬁrst question on personal auto, in recent year, you've seen some U.S. players basically
reporting higher frequency and some high severity. I just wonder, from your perspective,
do you see any underlying trends, what's your assumption on the loss cost trend going
forward, and what pricing have you taken or planning to take in? And when do you expect
the margin will see meaningful improvement? How soon will we see that?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. If you take a full-year perspective, Kai, the frequency in personal automobile is
down 0.4%. So, there's not meaningful pressure on that front. If you look at the severity for
Page 7 of 21



FINAL

Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2017-02-08

the full year, it's up close to 2%, and we've been talking about general inﬂation starting in
2015 across the land, which has led to us ﬁrming up our view on the past, as well as taking
rate actions. I'll ask Darren to give a bit of ﬂavor on the full-year perspective in automobile
insurance. Then I'll ask him to give you a sense of what's in the pipeline in terms of
improving what we think is not a good performance in that line, and sort of ﬁne line of
improvements. And probably worthwhile hearing Patrick as well on some of the things
we're doing in claims because when we look at performance, pricing and rate level is one
thing, segmentation is something else, risk selection is another part of it, claims
prevention and so on. So Darren, why don't you give us a sort of 2016 perspective?

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. Thanks, Charles. So as Charles mentioned from a frequency standpoint down
slightly in the year versus the prior year. Obviously, as we saw in Q4, we get a bit of noise
from quarter-to-quarter. So literally, essentially the increase we saw in frequency in Q4 was
totally weather driven. So other quarters obviously, we've seen a favorable impact from a
weather standpoint relative to the year-on-year quarter. So frequency, relatively ﬂat, but
we still see, as Charles mentioned, the 2 points in severity. So there still is a little bit of
inﬂation within the system, and varies very much from coast-to-coast. We've taken and we
mentioned, obviously on the Q3 call in terms of some of the actions we're taking from a
rate standpoint, we are continuing to push further on that front. We received approval, as
Charles mentioned in his opening remarks, for further increases in Ontario.
To give you a sense of the rate momentum that we have currently within the portfolio, and
I'll quote some January 2017 numbers here. We had a 3.9% rate increase in the month of
January, just going. And this compares to a written, and I should say, that's a written rate
increase. This compares to a written rate increase in Q4 impacting our result of 2.2%, and
an earned rate increase of just 1% in Q4. So this illustrates the current rate momentum that
is building within the portfolio in 2017. Now, in addition to that, as I mentioned, we have
rate increases coming in Ontario, and we also have a number of other rate increases that
have been currently ﬁled with the many rates approval authorities across the country.
So when we look at the rate momentum that's building, obviously, there is a little bit of a
lag between the written and the earned, and that will narrow through 2017. So in
combined with the rate increases, the segmentation, and advancements in UBI, et cetera,
together with the Claims' action plan, obviously we'll continue to see impact and beneﬁts
from the Ontario reform, also into 2017. Now, we're conﬁdent that even though we may
see a little bit of choppiness early in the year, we're conﬁdent that we'll see improvement
in our results in the mid single-digit range in 2017. We'll see a little bit of choppiness as
our action plan is already baked in towards the second half of the year.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And just in rates, we expect to earn a good 4 points, just in rates. And so there's more
action taking place, maybe a good opportunity to us, Patrick, to give us a very brief
window into what's in the pipeline in Claims.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Page 8 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

FINAL

Sure. So the claims action plan that we've started to build over, I would say, the past six
months with some actions already in place in March coming 2017 is expected to produce
also another 2 points roughly of improvements on the bottom line for personal auto
speciﬁcally. It involves four main themes; the ﬁrst one is tighter indemnity control. This is
enabled by our new national IT platform, so better controls within the system on a
national basis to reduce indemnity. The second one is accelerated leverage of our data
analytics in the ﬁeld of subrogation, fraud detection and supply chain management.
There's quite a few initiatives there that will also help us reduce our cost. And then we
have speciﬁc action plan by coverage for longer tail lines (26:17) injury. We are increasing
staﬃng to address some of the trends we're seeing speciﬁcally in Alberta that involves
higher, more surveillance and more proactive settlements of claims early on in the
process. And ﬁnally, on accident beneﬁt, it involves a lot around the management of our
Rely Network. We see good beneﬁts from a cost perspective when our clients elect to go
through our Health Rely and this we have additional initiatives up on that front as well for
big arrears.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. That's great, very comprehensive. Then my follow-up question is on the industry
pool. Because this fees is probably less of your control. I just wonder, will that getting
worse before you get in there or (27:10) basically there continue to be a point of drag on
your combined ratio in 2017?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

So I mean, from a pool standpoint, maybe a little background, there's two elements of the
pool. There's one element, which is the facility association. Now SI (27:28) as we like to
refer to it is the market of last choice for the industry. We assumed back from the Facility
Association our market share proportion of underwriting performance. The other element
of pools is what we call the risk-sharing pools. So this is where the industry and individual
companies, it's a mechanism whereby we have the ability to seed underpriced risks, what
we deem to be underpriced risks to this industry pool, and then we assume back a
proportion of the total pool.
Now, those two pools do represent a very small portion of the total industries. So not too
sure we could sort of say that they reﬂective of overall performance. Now, we deﬁnitely do
see noise in the pools from quarter-to-quarter, as you've seen in our results over the last
few years. We will have some quarters like this quarter in Q4 where we've had some
unfavorable development. We've seen other quarters where we're seeing signiﬁcant
favorable development. The pools themselves operate, and we get quarterly updates
from their actuary with updated reserve valuation. So that obviously can generate some of
the noise. Sometimes there's a timing mismatch between maybe where we may recognize
something from a PYD or a current action year development standpoint, there may be a
timing mismatch for the pools as well. So we don't see that the pools is for the longerterm drag, but deﬁnitely from quarter-to-quarter, we will see deﬁnitely noise in 2017 just
like we saw in 2016 and prior years as well.

FINAL

Yeah. I think in the fourth quarter, the drag was 3 points roughly when you put current
accident year prior year from pools. Only year-to-date in personal auto, it's 0.07%. And I
think Q4 was probably a function of a good pool performance in Q4 last year versus a not
so good pool performance this year. Not are really worried about the pools being a
meaningful drag like we experienced in the quarter for the full year next year, but there
might be some choppiness there.

Your next question comes from the line of Meny Grauman, Cormark Securities. Your line is
open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Meny Grauman

{BIO 15238080 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Just going back to personal auto, just a broader question in terms of
when you see a quarter like we saw in Q4, what gives you conﬁdence that you are taking
the right steps to adjust those problems? I guess, another way to ask it is, could you say
that maybe the measures are not strong enough, and so how do you gauge that? I know
it's probably an art and a science together, but I'm just wondering what your perspective
is on that.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, I think that – I'll take this one, Darren. At a high level, how do I comfort myself that
we're being proactive enough, and I would say that, I look at what's in the pipeline in
three diﬀerent buckets at a high level. The ﬁrst bucket is what we're doing in terms of
pricing, risk selection, claims, improvements, and so on. And I think that's what Darren
and Patrick have talked about. And these are things that are baked in the system. I think
the fact that there's four points of earned rates, that's easy to execute upon. I mean, you
put it in the machine, it goes out and then you manage your retention basically. The
claims piece is not as easy to execute upon. But there's a fair bit of things in the pipeline
and the claims guys are really good at executing. So on that ﬁrst angle, which is what we
do, there's more than mid single-digit worth of meat in the system. So that's point number
one.
The second lever is reforms. So part of the issue now is there have been reforms in the
past few years, meaningful reforms in the spring, in Ontario, further reforms in June. And
we have yet to see the full beneﬁts of those, though we're very conﬁdent about the quality
and the nature of these reforms, and there might be more this year. How much is that
actually worth, I'm not sure, but I know it's worth something. And part of it we've reﬂected
in pricing earlier in June to work with the government, to reﬂect the impact of what we

Page 10 of 21

FINAL

think is pretty good work on their part. So that's the second bucket that gives me
conﬁdence that inﬂation will be in check in part in Ontario for sure.
And I think the third bucket – and this is a much tougher one to asses, is the fact that our
teams in the ﬁeld are dealing with many changes at the same time, are becoming more
eﬃcient, are processing claims faster. And that is also to a certain extent reﬂected in the
numbers, which gives me a fair bit of conﬁdence that between the actions we're taking,
the impact of the reforms and the fact that our folks in the ﬁeld are probably processing
claims faster, and that might point to some deterioration, which is in fact, process-driven
as opposed to ultimate cost-driven, I think, it gives me a reasonable degree of conﬁdence
that we will see mid single-digit improvement in 2017.
It's important to keep in mind in all of this that personal automobile is a long-duration
product, and that it is a regulated environment. And that there's a lag between the data
set you can use to price the product, and the moment at which the product is actually
consumed, that is when the claims is paid. That in itself in personal automobile is a source
of uncertainty and it's certainly from quarter-to-quarter. It's not surprising to see some
noise. Now, the better you are at identifying trends, segmenting the business, the more
aggressive you are at taking action and being ahead of the market, the more you
outperform. That's what we've done in the past 20 years here at Intact, and I think these
past few months and the coming year will be very much about that. And we try to overexecute on what we control, and beat our competitors in the exercise.

{BIO 15238080 <GO>}

And then just to clarify, you talked about the timing in the previous question, but sort of, I
guess, an important time mark for you would be sort of the middle of the year. If you were
to see a lack of progress in the middle of the year, that would be a time where you would
reappraise the situation and not earlier. Is that a fair assessment of how did you look at the
timing?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

We do that every week, to be honest with you. I mean, we monitor the progress in the
ﬁeld. We monitor the progress in claims. And we reassess weekly, at the latest, on a
monthly basis. This is how we run the business. I think there might be some choppiness in
Q1. There might be some choppiness in Q2, but the execution will be monitored very
closely on a weekly basis. And there are a number of things that are given, like rates for
instance, it's just running in the system. And I think Darren's point, which is, when you
compare the earned of 1% (35:47) in Q4, the written of little more than 2% in Q4, and
when you look in January with the series of rate increases, the written is close to 4%, I
mean, this is just happening. So we reassess frequently, I think, for sure when we hit June,
I'm hoping that those things are well ingrained and upgrade in momentum.

open.

FINAL

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks very much. Two questions. One, I think you talked about a reversal of the tax
accrual in the quarter. I wondered if you can quantify that what that was, and if this – what
we should see the tax rate, which I think the operating tax rate, which I think was 23% in
the quarter, what we should see at that going forward, because it's a little bit higher than
what we've trended at. Then I have a follow up.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Sure. In fact, the reversal occurred in 2015 (36:54) comparative. So we have a big jump
from 2015 to 2016, and that's because we had reversed a provision in 2015.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. I misunderstood. And then my second – so do you think the 23% tax rate we're
seeing on operating basis right now seems to be...

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No. That's a bit high. I would say there's probably a point to 1.5 point here that is quarterly
ﬂuctuations. So I would not expect that to trend going forward. I'd be much more in the
21.5% by 22% range on an ongoing basis.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. And then, I really think this pool stuﬀ was causing a lot of noise in the quarter year.
Just looking at it, what it was in the fourth quarter – of 2015 it was only $6 million and all
over 2015 there was $6 million loss in pools. And then the fourth quarter of 2016, we had a
$24 million loss from pools, and that was half of the entire 2016 loss. I think, really this
noise from the tax and the pools really caused a lot of the maybe some of the confusion in
the quarter. I'm wondering if you can help us model what pools should be going out.
You've got $48 million for 2016, and as I said $6 million for 2015. How should we think
about that going forward, because obviously this is causing some volatility, and it's not
really necessarily attributable, Charles, to your business.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. No. Fair enough, and I think the pool would look at their provisions and their
ﬁnancials maybe on a diﬀerent frequency than we run our own business. I think, Tom, next
week is the Investors Day. And you know what, I will commit to sort of provide better
guidance at the Investors Day. We'll devote the speciﬁc question on it. And give us a
week to sort of think about 2017 in that regard, which is not something we have spent a lot
of time on. I think we totally understand, 2016 I think we're comfortable with the overall
provisioning of the pool at the end of 2016, but we'll spend a bit of time and take a
perspective view of the pool and put that on the table at the Investor's Day. Does that
work for you?

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Good morning, Charles. Could you just put a ﬁne point on this guidance you're oﬀering
on personal auto? You're saying that the improvement could be mid single-digits in 2017
relative to 2016. I think that's the way I've interpreted it. So if I'm going to use the current
your claims ratio in 2016, about 76.6%, I think I'm close to what the actual number is. Are
you suggesting that could be 500 basis points lower in 2017 full year?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Pretty much, yes.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That's signiﬁcant, because that would take us back to the levels that we saw, say in 2012
and 2013, which are pretty good years. So you're saying you can reverse pretty much
everything, the deterioration we've seen throughout 2015 and 2016, in one year?

A - Charles Brindamour

I think we're certainly have lots in the pipeline, Mario, that I feel will create some
momentum throughout 2017.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

That's helpful. The reason I want to clarify, just it seemed like a big commitment to take it
down back to what we saw in 2012 and 2013, and I appreciate that a lot of it could be pool
related. It just seem like a big statement, and I wanted to clarify. Thank you.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. I think there are CATs and things of that nature that took place, but I think we're
closing the year with a 100% combined ratio. This is far from the level at which we operate
that business, and we think there is mid single-digit improvement, all else being equal.

line is open.

FINAL

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning. First question is related to the uptick in volumes that we've seen
over the past couple of months here. I'm just wondering given your forecast that
investment income is going to continue to decline into 2017 modestly. If rates were to stay
ﬂat, where would the inﬂection point be for investment income to start picking up given
the maturing bonds reinvested at a higher yield?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So at this point, we see it, as I said, moderately decreasing. What we've estimated, it
would take probably a 35 bps, 30 bps increase for us to have that investment income
stable. So we need that level of points to bring it to stability. In terms of inﬂection point, I
assume you're talking about time?

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And given the turnover of the portfolio, we're probably in the, I'll say, north of more than
12 months. Probably, at least, I would say, nine to 12 months out.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Okay. And so just to conﬁrm then, it would be 35 basis points from where we are today or
from the, I guess, the average yield of 2016? Or what would be the base for that?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

End of 2016, where we closed 2016.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Where we closed 2016. Okay. And just a quick question on the National Bank and Sun Life
relationship. How will that be broken down by line, I guess? Could you give any – a little
bit more color around with that relationship is going to bring in terms of the $50 million in
premiums written?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So this was a 50/50 partnership. And so the 50 is incremental premium we're picking up
by taking over that partnership. It's white label agreement. belairdirect is running the
business through National Bank, it's through of Sun Life. I think the Sun Life sort of a
smaller, in fact much smaller impact than this acquisition. It is of course a personal lines
deal, and weighted towards personal automobile, 60% to 70% personal auto, the rest
personal property. And it's Québec only in the case of National Bank. We love the
Page 14 of 21

strategically really good, and we'd like to work with National Bank. They're a good

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Holden, CIBC. Your line is open.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. So ﬁrst question is related to commercial P&C, so we saw a bit of a downtick in
premiums written year-over-year, as you highlighted that related to Western Canada.
Wondering how we should be thinking about that business in terms of premiums written
for 2017 given some of those macro factors versus some of the initiatives you're doing in
specialty lines?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Go ahead, Alain.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Okay. Well, when we look at the growth or the minus 2.9% in the quarter, like we said,
some of that is driven – there's a bit of timing issue but very small, 0.3%. We've got some
action coming up from proﬁtability action where segmentation and risk selection has led
to about 25% of the explanation for the reduction there, which is about 0.7 point. And the
economic drag – and I think that's the part that's probably the most diﬃcult to predict or
see where it's going, the economic drag in the quarter is probably in the 40% to 50%,
explaining that reduction in growth. And we see the same thing at the industry level.
When we compare, like the industry, our performance compared to the industry, we don't
have the Q4 result but we have our experience at the end of Q3. At the end of Q3, we
were reducing by 1%, but the industry at the same period of it was reducing by 2.3%. And
in both cases if that was the biggest drag was really coming from economic condition in
Western Canada. Our view when we look at it, and we look at it combining commercial
auto and commercial P&C together, is really to see that going forward this will operate at
a very low single-digit growth in 2017.

FINAL

Okay. And then my second question would be related to belair. So you've invested a lot in
new technology, invested a lot in advertising over the last of couple years, particularly
targeted at the Ontario market. So just looking for an update on, I guess, realized growth,
and then also growth appetite for the year ahead.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. I think the last two years in the direct channel with a number of acquisitions, the
brand being deployed from coast-to-coast, we've just ﬁnished the integration of CDI,
Canadian Direct Insurance, which improved our position in Alberta. We feel pretty good
about the level of that platform and its performance, like it's doing really well. The growth
in 2016 in the direct channel was 11% and 7% if you were to exclude the impact of CDI. So
for me, a business that's doing well from a combined ratio point of view with that growth
proﬁle, I think that's pretty good. And quite frankly, I've been happily surprised by how
well these guys have established the brand in the new markets they're in. And I've been
happily surprised by how much response we've had from customers to the new digital
innovation we've launched, new quick quotes and various service platforms where the
response has been stronger than what I anticipated.
So I think that this is a business unit that is growing north of mid single-digits. I think that
the CDI impact certainly won't be there in 2017, but this is enough for a single-digit
growing business. That being said, we're thrilled by the progress we're making in Intact
Insurance and the progress we're making in BrokerLink, like BrokerLink now is
approaching $1.2 billion, the margins are very strong, you're seeing the distribution proﬁt
of $114 million pre-tax at the end of 2016. Keep in mind, this is a new business generation
machine that feeds Intact Insurance. And the growth in our broker distribution business,
Intact Insurance, is also quite good, and we're prepared to support that growth – as much
growth as we can in Intact Insurance because these guys are doing well. I mean Intact
Insurance has grown close to 4% in 2016, which is faster than the industry. And I think
when I look back at the year, certainly, would have loved to have made bigger acquisition,
but from an organic growth point-of-view, we've grown close twice the speed of the
industry. So when you are close to 20% of the market and you outperform from an ROE
point of view by 670-basis point, if you can grow organically, almost twice as fast as the
industry, it's good place to be regardless of the distribution channel you're in. That's sort
of how we look at the world.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks for that. And hopefully at the end of 2017, the message will be a little bit
diﬀerent on the big acquisition (50:40) or glad we did a big acquisition in 2017. Thank
you.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. I think that the message we want to have at the end of 2017 is about personal
automobile performance.

Q - Brian Meredith

Yes. Thank you. Charles, the ﬁrst question here, I noticed that your language with respect
to your outlook on commercial price environment is changed. You took out the
commentary about ﬁrming market or ﬁrm market. If you can give us a little color behind
why you believe that you're now going to see a ﬁrm market?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. I think, as I mentioned earlier, we've been four years worth of rate increases,
generated 13% rate increases in what was a ﬁrming market to a ﬁrm market, to a market
that has been still competitive throughout with pocket square, where we could take – or
meaningful pockets where we could take action. I'll let Alain give you a bit of color on that
market. And Brian, I think it's important to understand that we're in the small to mid
space, and a meaningful presence in specialty lines that is doing quite well. So why don't
you, Alain?

A - Alain Lessard

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Yes. So if I look at where we see what we see in the market, a little bit like Charles
explained, the market was competitive. But we saw throughout the year lots of pockets on
places where type of risk, where we saw rate increase, more underwriting action, selection
from our competitors. This is still continuing. But at the same time I would say that by the
end of the year, this was happening to probably a lower extent than the beginning of the
year. Throughout the year, we've continued to basically increase rate. And in fact, when I
looked at the rate increase in the fourth quarter, it's about 3% that we've passed through
on the renewals. And yet, at the same time, our retention has almost not dipped. We saw
a small dip in the last quarter of less than 0.5 point. And that's part of what we're doing on
both the segmentation and the selection and some corrective measure ourselves on
pockets of the risk. So that is what we think the market remains competitive. It's still open
to some rate increase, but maybe a little bit less. On our case, we're continuing to pass
the 3% rate increase. Our aim is to continue to protect our margin and improve our
portfolio. And basically, if I look at what's happening right now, we're going to be earning
the rate level of what we'll be earning in the next 18 months, we'll to continue to rise.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Right.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think, Brian, just to put things in perspective, when I look at our retention in December,
it's 89.3%. It is a little bit lower than what it was a year before. The industry is still in the
rate increase environment. I think there are indices that point to that. But I think we're just
being cautious with the words we use. We like what we see in the market. There's always
people who do crazy things, and that's ﬁne, that's part of how one outperforms. But at the
end of the day, we're focused on growing earnings and we will see rate increases go
through the system even though the performance is getting pretty good. I think the
industry's performance in commercial lines is not great.

A - Charles Brindamour

Yeah. Just nine months, but...

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Yeah. We have just nine months, but we outperformed in fact the industry on a loss ratio
basis by 15 points. So that would put basically the industry results north of 105%, 106%.
That's fairly aﬀected by Fort McMurray, but there is not really – this will continue as a
pressure point on the industry to continue to have some rate increase.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. So I guess, Brian, I sort of use that as a key data point to say this is not a soft
environment by any means. If anything that people look at their performance closely, you
could expect the industry to take a ﬁrmer view. But because we've seen the retention dip
a little bit we're sort of cautious with our language. In the meantime, you'll see rate
increases go through your system.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Thanks. And then my next question, Charles just curious, in the past you've kind of
mentioned that a possible area of acquisition would be small commercial in the U.S.
Given the changes we've seen in the administration and kind of the political climate here
in the U.S. and some of the things that the administration has talked about doing the
economic growth et cetera, et cetera, has that changed at all kind of your views with
respect to that type of an acquisition?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No. I think that we're in this for the long run, and we feel that this is an environment where
we can bring something to the table, given we have close to a 25% market share in that
space in Canada, and outperform at least our Canadian competitors. We are not well
positioned to help Canadian businesses who do business in the U.S. for sure, but I think
the opportunity set in the U.S. is signiﬁcant. We've studied that for a long time, and what's
happening in the near term in the U.S. is not changing our view of the opportunity there.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great. Thanks. Good morning. One quick question. I don't know if Louis wants to address
this next week, but what's the pricing ﬂexibility on the industry pools?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So there is two diﬀerent setup. One is what we call the risk-sharing pool, which is
companies feeding (57:35) some of their own risks in the pool. That's all done at the
company's ﬁled rates. So your question really applies to what we call the Facility
Association, which is a separate insurance company. We actually manage half of it,
roughly, on behalf of the industry, and we receive a fee to manage that unit. And there,
the facility in most jurisdictions would have to ﬁle rates the same way an insurance
company would. But regulators understand that the facility has to have the highest rate in
the market because it's the market of last resort. If the facility didn't have the highest rate
in the market, you'd end up with lots of risks in the facility, and that would be bad market
dynamics. So I would say, in general, there is reasonable ﬂexibility. Patrick, who's running
claims, you're involved on the board of the Facility Association, maybe you want to give a
perspective.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Well, you're absolutely right, Charles, on the FA which is, what we call, the last resort. It's
to ensure availability of auto insurance for everyone. So it's really, the idea is not for it to
compete with private insurers. So it's always the highest rate in the market. And it's based
on ﬁling. There is not in our jurisdictions that we can fully reﬂect maybe what would be
normal cost of capital and the rates, but beside that small margin globally we ﬁled, the FA
ﬁled full indications. And that's not the source longer term, I would say, of the last
because we ﬁght for it. It's more – the pools though is each insurer ceding the risk that
they believe they were not able to have enough rates. So the portion of their (59:40) on
that overall it is deﬁcient. But on the other hand, when we count pools, we also are
exceeding ourselves, our worst risk in there is beneﬁt from that. So overall we'll come
back as you see Charles next week with probably more details. But I don't expect long
term the total of those two things to be signiﬁcantly (01:00:03).

FINAL

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

That's very helpful. My second question. I guess, if you look at the full year personal
property results from the perspective of – I guess, underlying attritional non-catastrophe
weather losses in major catastrophes. Can you talk about how those compared to
expectations broadly?

A - Charles Brindamour

Yes. So personal prop closing the year at 91% with Fort Mc in there, I would say, is
probably slightly better than what we would have expected. And we would not have
expected Fort Mc. I think we've talked about the fact that we want to position ourselves to
do well and good in bad times. And I've told investors, for us that sub-95% in bad times.
So when you look at 91% and Fort Mac in there, plus a decent load of CAT, I think that this
is better than what we had anticipated. Maybe you want to give some more color, Darren,
because while I say that we're still moving the needle from a rate and risk selection point
of view in that line of business.

A - Darren Godfrey

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

No. Absolutely Charles. So when we look at Q4, I mean, top line was up 7.5% in the
quarter. And there is some (01:01:37) about 3 points of rate. But we are also still growing
units as well, close to 5 points of unit growth. So that's the line of business that, yes, we
have taken some strong action in the past both in terms of rate but also in terms of
product. But we're continuing to grow and really outgrow the industry within that line of
business as well. We have taken further action in particular targeted segments. We have
taken a little bit of further action in Alberta with respect to hail and our coverage around
hail, again, following another tough summer from a hail storm standpoint. So we're
continuing to grow our margins in targeted segments where we feel that we need to
create maybe further sustainability in terms of the product.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. Exactly. And I think – look, the reality is with personal automobile performance
being subpar as far as we're concerned, we're not in the mindset of letting margins go to
grow in other lines of business, even though those other lines of business are good. I
mean, this is the practical reality of running an insurance company, at least like ours.

FINAL

Thank you for ﬁtting me in. Just a clear follow up on the PYD commentary in your
management discussion and analysis. You said fourth quarter PYD of 3 points is in line
with your long-term expectation, for the full year was about 5 points, that's remain
consistent with long term historical levels. So are you expecting 3 points or 5 points going
forward?

We've talked about 3 to 4 points. Every time this question has been asked, I think in the
past few years, I said this is how you want to look at the future even though it's been 5
points, 6 points, 7 points in the past few years. I think 3 to 4 points is the right way to think
about that.

Great. Well, thank you for the clariﬁcation.

There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.
