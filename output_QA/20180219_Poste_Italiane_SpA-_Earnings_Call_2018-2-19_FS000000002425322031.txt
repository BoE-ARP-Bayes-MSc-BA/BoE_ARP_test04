Good day, and welcome to the Poste Italiane Full Year 2017 Preliminary Results
Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matteo Del Fante, CEO. Please
go ahead, sir.

Matteo Del Fante

{BIO 6237992 <GO>}

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We're pleased to present the 2017 preliminary
results of Poste Italiane. As you know, I was appointed CEO in May last year. We have all
worked hard since to lay the foundation of our strategy. We're presenting our preliminary
results today ahead of the Capital Markets Day, allowing you to focus on the new plan
starting from a base of sheer (00:00:55) results. We have already delivered key
milestones such as the agreement with the unions, the partnership with Anima, and the
agreement with CDP to revamp our business.
2017 ended with a sound €689 million net proﬁt, increasing by 11% compared to previous
year. On a normalized basis, the progression is even stronger at 42%, and a net proﬁt of
€722 million. Operating performance improved signiﬁcantly by over 20%, excluding nonrecurring items, resulting in EBIT of €1.1 billion. As promised, we conﬁrm the distribution
of 80% of our preliminary net proﬁt, corresponding to a dividend of €0.42 per share, up

8% from 2016. I look forward to seeing you the 27 in May (sic) [February] (00:02:06), next
week, when we will have the pleasure to introduce my management team that I have
strengthened by appointing the right people with the right experience both from inside
and outside the organization.
Moving to slide number 3, here you have an overview of our key ﬁgures by business unit.
As mentioned during the nine months result presentation, we launched a new business
unit for Payments Mobile & Digital, which would be responsible for the development of
the payment system where we are the market leader in Italy. We intend to consolidate our
position, leveraging on the opportunities coming from the digitalization which is
changing the way people use these services. In Financial Services, revenues were broadly
ﬂat compared to last year, net of the disposal of the BdM-MCC bank. Operating proﬁt
decreased mainly due to higher provision for risk and liabilities related to real estate
funds. On a normalized basis level, 2017 EBIT would have been slightly higher than last
year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Insurance and Asset Management revenues increased by €0.6 billion or 2.4% versus last
year thanks to our simple and attractive life products. Operating proﬁts show a robust
32% growth year-on-year, mirroring the positive performance of life, gross written
premiums, and the growing contribution of non-life and asset management products.
In Mail and Parcels, segment revenues were down by €191 million or 5% to €3.6 billion. But
considering the positive one-oﬀ in 2016, the reduction is lower of about 2%, which is
slightly above our expectations. This reduction is in line and relates to traditional main
volumes mitigated by increasing parcel revenues. In 2017, operating proﬁt was down €80
million or 18.4% due to a one-oﬀ revenue eﬀect of €108 million. Closing 2016, we had a
universal service obligation especially in the last quarter, and second reason was a one-oﬀ
cost of €23 million in Q4 of 2017 related to a ﬁne from the antitrust which we are
appealing against. Net of this regulatory one-oﬀ eﬀect, operating proﬁt of Mail and Parcel
improved by around €50 million versus 2016, conﬁrming the restructuring.
Moving to slide number 4, total ﬁnancial assets increased by €40 billion to €506 billion,
which is 2.7% up versus 2016. The mix remains balanced, with an increase in postal bonds
compensating the decrease in postal saving books and a material increase both in our
current account deposit and life product technical reserves. Let me highlight that we
continue to beneﬁt from a strong track record over the past years in increasing our assets
under management. We're conﬁdent that we will keep this pace going forward,
leveraging on our ability and quality products and the country's largest distribution
network. Customers trust our brand, our people, and our proximity, and we're going to
continue to serve them in the best possible way, preserving the solidity and sustainability
of our business.
Let me now hand over to the CFO, Roberto Giacchi, who will comment on each speciﬁc
business unit results. Thank you.

Thank you, Matteo, and good afternoon, everybody. Let's now move into each speciﬁc
business unit results, starting from our Financial Services revenues evolution on slide
number 5. As you all know, BancoPosta is an asset gatherer, a capital-light business
supported by transaction banking and distribution of third party products. Overall,
revenue in 2017 were resilient, with one-oﬀs oﬀsetting each other, namely capital gains
from the disposal of our stake in BdM-MCC bank, Visa and MasterCard. In particular, third
parties' product distribution and transaction bank fees were resilient on a normalized
basis, excluding the eﬀect of the disposal of MCC. In 2017 we accounted for €54 million
lower revenues. Postal savings fees amounted to €1.6 billion in 2017, in line with 2016.
Interest income and gross capital gains were stable at around €2 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving to slide 6. Let's now look into the speciﬁc current account. On credit account
deposit, let me point out the following major items. An increase in average deposits to
€56 billion from €50 billion in 2016, up 12%. A solid customer base with over 6.3 million
current accounts. A decrease in interest income of €32 million or 2.1% versus 2016, more
than compensated by higher capital gains. The average return, excluding capital gains,
decrease by 40 basis points. At year-end 2017, unrealized capital gains stood at €1.6
billion, whilst as of today they have reached €2 billion mainly as a consequence of the
spread decrease. The portfolio duration has also decreased from 5.5 years in 2016 to 5.2
years in 2017.
Let's now move to postal saving collection on slide number 7. In 2017 average postal
saving deposits decreased by 1.4% whilst fees were resilient at €1.6 billion. In the second
half of the year we started new commercial activities, reversing the negative trend
experienced in the ﬁrst half of the year. As already communicated in December, we had
also renewed our agreement with CDP, with favorable terms to mitigate the negative
trend of postal savings and to increase the fees we received starting from the beginning
of 2018. Going ahead, to maximize the level of fees, we need to reach speciﬁc annual
targets. Overall, these targets are pragmatic, and we're conﬁdent to be above €1.8 billion
fees already in 2018, leveraging on our stable customer base with over 30 million postal
saving books holders at the end of 2017.
Let's now move to BancoPosta regulatory framework and capital position on slide number
8. In terms of BancoPosta capital adequacy, let me stress four major key points.
BancoPosta regulatory framework continues to be fully aligned to European Union
standards. 2017 CET1 ratio reached 17%, well above the minimum regulatory requirements.
2017 leverage ratio stands at 3%, in line with the regulatory requirements. In 2018 we will
implement a recapitalization of BancoPosta to align the leverage ratio to the stricter
internal rule. Full year proﬁtability recorded a remarkable 28.4% return on equity. All of
this coupled with a zero lending risk proﬁle makes BancoPosta a unique superior returns
fee-based revenues players in the Italian ﬁnancial industry.
Let's continue with transaction banking revenues on slide number 9. The cards and
acquiring business contributed €274 million, increasing by €49 million, more than
oﬀsetting the decline in payment fees. Other banking services were stable at around €370
million. This factor is undertaking a deep transformation to digital payment. And as you
will see during our Capital Markets Day on February 27, we will also leverage on our new
division to maximize the opportunity from this segment. We are a leading player in

FINAL

payments and we can leverage on our positioning, our skills, and our capabilities to seize
the material market opportunities arising from this business in the coming years.
Let's now move to the transaction banking volumes on slide number 10. Here you can see
several KPIs to better understand the drivers of our transaction banking business. The
cards and acquiring business reported a very solid growth both in terms of cards and
transaction value. This is deﬁnitely a growth area both in terms of revenues and margin.
With respect, I would like to mention the continuing success of the PostePay Evolution
card that at the end of 2017 had more than 5.2 million cards issued since the launch in July
2014; around 1.6 million new cards in 2017 alone. Today we have around 18 million active
PostePay cards. Within payments, bank, and money transfer business, payments slips
declined by 4.2% whilst bank and money transfer transactions grew by 5%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's now look at an overview of the digitalization process in transaction banking on slide
number 11. Allow me to take this opportunity to highlight the achievement we reached so
far in our digitalization process. In 2017 we have reached 15 million registered users, plus
20% versus 2016. And our mobile apps have been downloaded 15 million times, plus 50%
versus 2016. The digital channels are currently used by more than 1 million clients daily.
Taking also into consideration our retail postal network, 1.5 million daily visitors, we can
count on more than 2.5 million customer daily visits. The transaction value using our apps
reached €2.3 billion. I believe everybody is able to appreciate this remarkable number.
Let's move to slide number 12, key metrics for our Insurance and Asset Management
business. Operating proﬁtability increased by €204 million thanks to stable subscription
fees in life insurance and private pension plans along with higher management fees
related to technical reserves. On private pension plans, it's worth mentioning that in 2016
we booked an extraordinary item worth €57 million. We recorded a positive and
increasing contribution on P&C technical margin thanks to the signiﬁcant growth in gross
written premium. Also, asset management is showing a 42% increase in subscription and
management fees due to the relative increase in assets. It's worth mentioning and overall
reduction in cost of approximately 2%. This allows us to post a 32% increase in operating
proﬁt, reaching €814 million.
Let's now move to Insurance and Asset Management gross written premiums on slide 13.
In 2017 group gross written premium increased by around €0.5 billion to a total of €20.4
billion, up 2% from 2016. As you can see in the slide, this growth has been recorded in all
our products: life, private pension plans, and P&C products. At the same time, our
customer base has grown substantially in all three business areas, reaching 3.6 million
customers in the life business, 0.9 million customers in the private pension plan business,
and almost 1 million customers in P&C business. In particular, we have beneﬁted from
double-digit growth in our non-life premium, whose results will increase going forward in
a relative underpenetrated market. The combined ratio fell to 56% from 76% percent in
2016 thanks to an improved loss ratio from lower claims and a reduced expenses. The
continued growth of our life business is conﬁrming Poste Italiane group as the number
one life insurance in Italy.
Let's now move on slide number 14. In 2017 life premium net inﬂows where equal to €9.4
billion. The signiﬁcant outﬂow in class III is attributable to €3.5 billion maturities on capital

guaranteed products. Furthermore, let me underline that our 2017 lapse rate was equal to
2.89%, decreasing 3 basis point versus last year, a ﬁgure which is far lower than the
market benchmark of 6.7% registered in 2006, highlighting our loyal customer base.
Let's now move to slide 15. Group technical reserves increased by €10 billion, up 9%
percent from 2016, beneﬁting from the continual growth of insurance business. Our
realized capital gain reached €8.2 billion, a reduction from €9.3 billion at the end of the
2016. This value will allow us to continue oﬀering higher than market returns to
policyholders, strengthening our market leadership. With regards to our investment
portfolio breakdown, the increase of investments in multi-asset funds, which moved from
14% at the end of 2016 to 19% in 2017, conﬁrm our diversiﬁcation strategy towards a more
adequate risk to return proﬁle. At the same time, the average minimum guaranteed in
class I policy has been reduced from 1% to 0.9%. Bear in mind that the current class I
policy we are selling have no minimum guaranteed return, while the return realized in
2017 is in line to 2016 at 3.03%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's move to slide number 16. Asset Management increased by close to 10% year-onyear, reaching €8 billion, with the customer base increasing by 22% to more than 660,000
customers. As you can see, with lower bond market investment return, our customers' risk
return proﬁle have shifted towards more balanced/ﬂexible and equity products. The
recently signed agreement with Anima that includes a broader product oﬀering and
extensive training from our network is more suited to oﬀer these products to our
customers. We are convinced that we will boost our position in the asset management
space in the coming years.
Let's now move to slide number 17, an overview of Solvency II. Regarding Solvency II of
PosteVita at the end of 2017, eligible own funds were equal to €8.5 billion, up €0.5 billion
versus €8 billion at the end of 2016. The increase of eligible own funds is mainly due to
higher business and a higher interest rate environment. On the other side, the Solvency
capital requirements increased from €2.7 billion to €3 billion at the end of 2017.
Consequently, the Solvency II ratio for PosteVita at the end of December 2017 is equal to
280% versus 295% registered at the end of 2016.
Let's move to slide number 18, cross-selling. In this slide you can see the results of our
monitoring program that has been internally established relative to the cross-selling
index. This index is a clear measure of our ability to extract value from our customer base.
This index will be a key driver for Poste Italiane future strategic growth. As you can see,
the index is showing a solid growth quarter-after-quarter. We will be focused on keeping
this growth going forward as a key driver of our industrial plan.
Moving to Mail and Parcel on slide number 19. Parcels revenue increase to €693 million,
up about 6.7%; mitigating the Mail revenues decline now standing at €2.7 billion, down by
8.8%. This percentage is aﬀected by one-oﬀ revenues in 2016 from universal service
obligation, a €108 million year-on-year eﬀect of regulation. Without this eﬀect, this one-oﬀ
eﬀect, the Mail revenues reduction would have been about minus 5%. Infrasegment
revenues, stable versus 2016, are mainly related to BancoPosta distribution commission.
Bear in mind that we have a positive one-oﬀ for €180 million from the higher parcel
service obligation in 2016 and a negative one-oﬀ of €23 million related to the provision

made in respect of the Italian antitrust authority ﬁne against which we are appealing.
Operating proﬁtability improves thanks to our managerial action and cost discipline.
Let's now move to slide number 20 with some details on the Mail and Parcel business.
Parcel volumes increased by almost 17% year-on-year, up to almost 113 million pieces,
conﬁrming the positive trend driven by the growing e-commerce penetration in Italy. In
2017 main volumes reach 2.2 billion items (sic) [3.3 billion items] (00:25:52), down 7.7%
versus the same period last year, mainly due to a substitution eﬀect. Mail repricing tariﬀs
has allowed us to mitigate the decline in revenues. Parcel price reduction is related to the
strong increase of B2C e-commerce ﬂows which, as you all know, have a lower revenues
pet unit index.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's move to slide number 21 to discuss group operating costs. Overall group operating
costs fell by €268 million, down by 3% versus last year, as a consequence of our
continued cost management discipline. With regard to cost management action, we are
streamlining the group organization, processes generating structural savings, savings
which are decreasing the group cost base. We are continuing our early voluntary
retirement incentive policy, in line with previous year, with particular focus on the Mail and
Parcel division. Lower labor costs for €137 million are due to lower full-time equivalent, in
particular in the Mail and Parcel division.
Let's move to slide number 22. As you have seen in the previous slide, total labor costs
are down to €5.6 billion or minus 2.4% thanks to the reduction in the average number of
employees from 141,000 in 2016 to 138,000 in 2017. Let me also remind you that at the
end of December 2017, approximately 4,700 people left the company thanks to our
voluntary early retirement plan. The results in term of head count reduction for the 2017
highlight management eﬀectiveness to reduce on an ongoing basis the work force. We
will discuss these trends in greater detail during our Capital Markets Day.
Slide number 23. Net income for the period was equal to €689 million versus €622 million
in 2016. On top of the already commented EBIT evolution, this performance is related to
net ﬁnancial loss equal to €56 million composed by positive net ﬁnancial income for €38
million, and Alitalia and Atlante write-oﬀ for €94 million, taxes for a total consideration of
€378 million, corresponding to a tax rate of about 35.4%. Excluding the abovementioned
one-oﬀ eﬀects, net proﬁt would be €722 million with an increase of 42% versus last year.
Slide 24, the new management team believe in investments as an enabler for the
transformation we are going to implement at Poste Italiane. As a consequence, group
CapEx was €467 million in 2017, up €16 million. The majority of the investment program is
mainly related to information technology and digital platform to the development and
redesign of postal and logistics mechanization systems and to investment in workplace
safety. This ﬁgure show the management commitment to speak (00:30:25) our
transformation program, which will also be tackled during our Capital Markets Day.
Slide 25, the industrial net cash position reached €1.029 billion at 21st December 2017. The
biggest moving parts are capital expenditure and net dividends, showing that after
rewarding our shareholders, we are able to generate fresh resources to be invested within

the company in order to remain competitive and to anticipate our customer changing
behavior and mix.

FINAL

Finally, let me quickly walk you through our new segment reporting in the next couple of
slides. Poste Italiane transformation has already begun with a comprehensive review of
our divisional organization, enhancing visibility and transparency on key value drivers for
each business division.
In terms of the key changes, a new Payments Mobile & Digital division has been
established. Asset Management shift from Insurance to Financial Services to better reﬂect
its role within BancoPosta focus on wealth management products. Mail and Parcel is now
known as Mail, Parcel & Distribution, reﬂecting the distribution revenues received from
the other business segment. By February 21, we will publish on our website an Excel ﬁle
with our data on full years 2016 and 2017 according to the new perimeter in line with our
plan and our disclosure going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide 27, you can see how Insurance business will be reported. On this slide, we
highlight another change, which will be in place already starting from our Capital Markets
Day and that we will apply on an ongoing basis going forward in our ﬁnancial
communication. In line with best market practice, premiums and ﬁnancial income in the
Insurance business will be reported net of technical reserve and other expense already
starting from our presentation in Q1 2018.
Moving to slide 28, you can see here the eﬀect of the implementation of the new
perimeter on the way results will be stated. The main diﬀerence is the way Insurance
revenues will be present, net of technical results, besides the changing mix from Asset
Management moving into Financial Services will be implemented. Based on 2017
numbers, total revenues in Financial Services will be equal to €4.956 million instead of
€5.245 million. At the same time, the new business unit, Payments Mobile & Digital will
command €586 million of market revenues for 2017.
On slide 30, you can see the new EBIT breakdown, and the new Payments Mobile &
Digital division carved out from the Financial Services and merged it with PosteMobile will
record €195 million for full year 2017. The Financial Services will encompass the Asset
Management business so that on 2017 ﬁgures, it will show an operating proﬁt of €646
million.
This is in summary the segment view (00:34:59) we are going to work with over the
coming years. That's all for our results. Thank you for your attention. Let me hand over to
CEO, Matteo Del Fante, for some closing remarks.

Matteo Del Fante

{BIO 6237992 <GO>}

Thank you, Roberto. So, we have presented today what we consider strong operating
results in management vision (00:35:30) year where we kept the pace of cost discipline,
we kept the pace of our voluntary early retirement plan, and we kept the pace of investing
in CapEx.

FINAL

In July 2017, we committed with investors with stable dividend and a stable dividend
policy, and today, we're keeping up with our promise with an 8% increase versus 2016. In
the meantime, we closed two agreements with unions, one important update of the CDP
distribution contract and reached a positive agreement with Anima, our strategic partner,
which was appreciated by investors in terms of market reaction.
I think now, we can take questions from investors and analysts, and if possible, if we can
limit two question maximum per person, and we would then, obviously, have more time
to expand our strategy next week on the 27th of February in Milan. Thank you.

Thank you. We are taking the ﬁrst question from Kunal Zaveri from JPMorgan.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

This is Ashik here from JP Morgan. I'm on using Kunal's line. Good afternoon by the way.
Just a couple of questions. One is on Insurance business. It looks like your technical
reserve went up by 10% in 2017 versus 2016, whereas the management fee that has gone
up is around more than 25%. So, can we get some color on what's going on that? Are you
trying to increase the margin on an ongoing management fees and Insurance?
And secondly is if I look at the current account average return without capital gains, it
went down by 40 basis point in 2017 versus 2016, so 3.1% going down to 2.7%. Is that a
good run rate going forward as well, the decline, assuming interest rate remains where it
is at the moment? So, any thoughts on these two questions would be very good. Thank
you.

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

I take the ﬁrst question on Insurance. The management fees actually is a percentage of
technical reserve and is currently stable. So, the increase that you have seen in
management fees revenue is basically based on the increase of technical reserves. So, we
didn't change the percentage of the management fees, just that increase the amount, the
total amount of technical reserves.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. But if I look at the technical...

...reserve on slide number 15, it went up by 9%, whereas management fees went up by
25%. I think what I might be missing is the average technical reserve might have gone up
more than 10%. Is that the case?

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

I mean, the total increase of technical reserve has a diﬀerent composition of classes. So,
it's an increase in class I products, an increase in class III products. The overall eﬀect of the
increase is the one that you see on revenues.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. Got it. Yeah.

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Then going to the interest income, the reduction of the interest income and the
reduction of the yield is due to the interest rate environment that we are facing. And as
you will see at our Capital Market Day, we have carefully forecasted the interest income
for the coming years, and we will show exactly the trend that we are expecting for the
coming years for interest rate and capital gains (00:41:00).

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. So, probably I'll wait for that. Yeah.

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

Yeah, we have also to remember that if we are taking around €400 million to €500 million
capital gains per year in our income statement, what remains as an average
yield to the portfolio even in stable markets is trending down, but this is going to be
detailed (00:41:29) in our ﬁve-year plan.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

Yeah. Thanks. That's all what I look for. Thank you. Thanks a lot.

Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. I have a couple of questions. The ﬁrst one is on the Insurance
business. I was wondering if the derisking you were making on government bonds is over
given that the amount is still there at 66%. And linked to the life insurance, I noticed there
is not any longer (00:42:08) business activity to higher interest rates. If you could give us
an update on your solvency ratio in the case of 50 bps higher level of rates.
And on asset management, given that you gave us the picture of ﬂows in postal savings in
ﬁrst half and in second half last year, if you could give us also the level of inﬂows or
outﬂows in asset management products and mutual funds in ﬁrst half and second half last
year. Thank you.

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

So, question about sensitivity. An increase for 50 basis point on government spread. Their
market value of investment decreased by €3 billion. The own funds level decreased by
about €500 million. The solvency ratio level moved down from 280% to 247%. If we have
an increase of 50 basis point of spread corporate bond, the market value of investment
decrease by €600 million about (00:43:46), the own funds level increase by €146 million,
and the solvency ratio level moves from 280% to 293%.

Q - Gianluca Ferrari

{BIO 15042989 <GO>}

Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Matteo Del Fante

{BIO 6237992 <GO>}

On the derisking of the technical reserves is keeping its lower base. We are deﬁning our
strategic asset allocation for 2018, but clearly, current market condition and very high
valuation in most of the asset classes are not pushing for an acceleration of that, but in
terms of your last question, I would probably keep it, move to the next question, and if
possible, we'll try to answer you before the end of the call.

Q - Emanuele Borghetti

{BIO 19118661 <GO>}

Yes. Good evening to everybody and congratulations for the results. A couple of
questions from my side. The ﬁrst one is on the cost of labor that you booked some one-oﬀ
related to the bonus for the workforce in the fourth quarter. And if you could provide us

Q - Giovanni Razzoli

Bloomberg Transcript

Good afternoon. And I apologize if my question were already answered during the
conference call but got the press release quite later. So, my ﬁrst question is on the
performance of the Mail and Parcel division in the Q4. If I'm not mistaken, there is a slight
deterioration in Q4 compared with the Q4 of 2016 even if I net the EBIT performance of
the €23 million of one-oﬀ. I was wondering whether my understanding is correct or if
there is something else.
And if you can share with us what was the extraordinary cost related to the early
retirement plans in the Mail and Parcel division for the Q4. And another question on the
Insurance performance in the Q4, which looks extremely strong compared with the
previous quarter and also with last year of 2016. I was wondering whether there have
been some acceleration in terms of investment portfolio strategy impact in the Q4
performance. Thank you.

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

Okay. So, let's start from the Q4 performance. The Mail and Parcel division in the Q4
experienced a decrease of revenues for €123 million, Q4 2017 versus Q4 2016. Also, bear
in mind that here, we have had in the Q4 2016 the €108 million extraordinary one-oﬀ
related to universal service obligation.
EBIT was also deteriorating by €39 million, Q4 2017 versus Q4 2016. Again, here we have
on top of the €108 million one-oﬀ, we have also the €23 million ﬁne. We have (00:49:23)
in 2017.
Very good (00:49:28) the performance of the Insurance and Asset Management business,
revenues were almost stable, but there was a strong increase in EBIT. EBIT was in the
Insurance and Asset Management business in the Q4 equal to €284 million versus the
€200 million in 2016. So, plus €84 million.

Thank you. And now, we wonder whether this performance in the Q4 of the Insurance and
Asset Management is also reﬂecting some one-oﬀs or non-recurring contributions of
some kind.

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

FINAL

Sorry. It was not clear. Can you say it again, please?

Q - Giovanni Razzoli

{BIO 7269718 <GO>}

Yeah. Sorry. I was wondering whether this strong acceleration that you have mentioned in
the Insurance and Asset Management EBIT performance in the Q4 is reﬂecting some nonrecurring contributions of some kind in terms of either performance of the portfolio,
investment portfolio or...

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

So, I tried to understand – I mean, your question is if we have non-recurring item in
Insurance you mean?

Q - Giovanni Razzoli

{BIO 7269718 <GO>}

Yeah, in the Insurance, you've mentioned €284 million of EBIT, which is up €85 million (sic)
[€84 million] (00:51:09) year-on-year.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

In Q4, we have not accounted extraordinary item in Insurance. So, they are all ordinary
numbers.

We are now taking a question from Matija Gergolet from Goldman Sachs. Your line is
open. Please go ahead.

Q - Matija Gergolet

{BIO 3561672 <GO>}

Yes. Hello. Good afternoon. Two questions from my side. The ﬁrst one is relating to
Parcels. Just in the fourth quarter, if I did my numbers correctly, I think you had a decline
in revenues in Parcels as well, which is perhaps a little bit surprising given that there
should be fairly good growth opportunity in Parcels particularly on the Christmas season
with the growth in B2C. Could you elaborate a bit what happened there?
And then secondly, just in terms of exceptionals in this quarter, so you talked about, okay,
last year, the €108 million of extraordinary compensation, the €23 million ﬁne. Then can
you talk about the Mastercard capital gain that was booked in this quarter, €91 million or
Page 12 of 16

was there something that I was missing from the past? And if there was any other, say,
exceptional items that you think is worth (00:52:35) for this quarter? Thank you.

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

FINAL

On the ﬁrst question, on page 19, we speciﬁed that Parcel revenues are growing from
€649 million to €693 million, so that's an increase of €6.7 million.

Q - Matija Gergolet

{BIO 3561672 <GO>}

Now, okay, but if you look at your nine-month ﬁgures, I think for your nine months, you're
already €41 million ahead. Now, you are €44 million ahead, which is, let's say, fairly
(00:53:20) ﬂattish or in a market we should be growing quite nicely.

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

I mean, we have had a very good quarter in 2016. The Q4 was very good in 2016, and we
have had a good quarter also in 2017. On top of this, we had to consider that we have had
a labor strike in our express courier business unit that at the end, generated a revenue
loss or about €15 million. So, adding this €15 million, we have had a more solid growth
quarter-on-quarter.

Q - Matija Gergolet

{BIO 3561672 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

We have always to keep in mind that this kind of labor strike are quite common in the
industry, and we have been aﬀected in the last quarter as well as other competitor has
been aﬀected. Going to the other question that you made, the one-oﬀ recap (00:54:43), I
can tell you that Mastercard was accounted in 2017 for €91 million and that in 2016, we
accounted for the Visa sale, and the capital gain account in 2016 was €121 million. So, the
net eﬀect is minus €30 million

Q - Matija Gergolet

{BIO 3561672 <GO>}

Okay. And so, can I just on that Visa, Mastercard, do you have any shares outstanding of
those two or is that now all gone?

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

We have a limited amount of shares still outstanding in Visa, but it will take several years
before that we can dispose and monetize. So, it's both immaterial and not an item that will
materialize soon.

Q - Matija Gergolet

{BIO 3561672 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

We are now taking a question from Elena Perini from Banca IMI. Your line is open. Please
go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Elena Perini

{BIO 4202240 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. I have only one last question about the combined ratio of the P&C
business because I couldn't get the properly the ﬁgure about it. And I was also wondering
that if on the decline of the last ratio, there were some extraordinary items or one-oﬀ and
so on (00:56:43)? Thank you.

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

Yes. So, as I said before, the combined ratio fell to 56% from 76% in 2016, thanks to an
improved loss ratio from lower (00:57:04) and reduced expenses ratio. Loss ratio had
lower claims than expected for 7% and for 7% of the overall loss ratio, we released claims
reserves coming from the previous year. So, overall, the loss ratio improved by 14%. The
expense ratio improved by 6% and this was mainly related to the cost discipline within this
company. So, the sum of the two, the 6% of the expense ratio and the 14% of the loss ratio
moved the combined ratio from 76% to 56%.

We are now moving to Anna Adamo from Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Anna Adamo

{BIO 16893946 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you for taking my question. My ﬁrst question is on BancoPosta. You mentioned
during the presentation that you are looking to recapitalize BancoPosta in order to boost
the leverage ratio higher than the current 3.1%. And could you share with us how much
would be the size of this capital increase and how will it be ﬁnanced? That's my ﬁrst
question. And my second question is on the sensitivity of PosteVita solvency ratio to
government spreads. If I look at the same sensitivity, which was disclosed at the end of
last year, your sensitivity was much higher, was 115 percentage points, 400 basis points
(00:59:06) of widening of the spread. And now, it's only 60 (00:59:12) . So, what have you
done to basically reduce the sensitivity of this Solvency II that much? Thank you.

A - Matteo Del Fante

{BIO 6237992 <GO>}

I'll take the ﬁrst one on BancoPosta. As you know, we already did the capital injection in
BancoPosta in 2017 for €110 million. At the Capital Market Day, the 27th of February, we
will give you a full description and detailed description of the capital structure of the
group and the capital required by BancoPosta to sustain its business development. For
what it concerned your second question, the reduced sensitivity is basically related to a
more diversiﬁed portfolio of investment activities.

Q - Matija Gergolet

{BIO 3561672 <GO>}

Yes. Hello. Good evening. One more question from me quickly just on the portfolio of
government bonds in your Financial Services. Could you provide us a sensitivity at yearend to change in spread and to change in interest rates, maybe what will be the change in
capital gains for roughly 100 basis point change in interest rates or spreads, please as of
the end of December? Thank you.

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

You're referring to the investment portfolio on which...

Q - Matija Gergolet

{BIO 3561672 <GO>}

Yeah. (01:02:23).

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

...sensitivities. Yeah, what kind of sensitivity you're looking for?

Q - Matija Gergolet

{BIO 3561672 <GO>}

If you have like 50 basis points of change in the spread and 50 basis points of change in
interest rates.

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

Yeah, I think what we can do the best way to answer this question is the following if you
agree. We can tell you that today versus the ﬁgure we posted in the presentation, the
capital gain is above €2 billion and that in terms of sensitivities, we are running even
Page 15 of 16

dimension. And we will give overall scenario sensitivities next week on the overall
portfolio if that's satisfactory for you.
