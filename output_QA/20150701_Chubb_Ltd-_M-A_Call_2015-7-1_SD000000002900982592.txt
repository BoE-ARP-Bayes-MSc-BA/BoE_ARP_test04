Good morning. Thank you for joining us on such short notice. I am delighted, simply
thrilled, to have the opportunity to share this historic moment with you, as we announce
the joining together of two of the great companies in our industry. This is a combination
occurring out of strength. We are both great on our own. But the complementary and
compelling strategic nature of this combination is the opportunity to create so much more
together. This is a growth story. Let me take a little time and describe the compelling
rationale for bringing together ACE and Chubb, again, two world-class insurance
companies.
I'm going to begin on slide 4. This kind of captures it all, with -- in a very general fashion.
This transaction simply advances our strategy in a meaningful way and represents an
outstanding opportunity to create significant value for both ACE and Chubb shareholders,
our companies and our policyholders. We are combining two great, high-quality
underwriting companies to create a very well-balanced, broadly diversified, global leader
in property and casualty insurance with greater earning power and substantial future value
creation opportunities.
Our companies have complementary and exceptional strengths in product, distribution,
customer segments and underwriting cultures. Where one of us is not present, the other
is. Where one of us is strong, the other is even stronger. Add to that, the increased data
and insight we will gain paired with our respective skills and experience, will drive
profitable new growth opportunities in both developed and developing markets around
the world. The combined Company will be so well-balanced with a greater presence and
capabilities in product areas that have less exposure to the commercial P&C cycle.
In addition, we will have a substantially greater invested asset base that will benefit from
an eventual rise in interest rates. ACE and Chubb have complementary cultures. We are
both underwriting companies and share a passion and discipline for underwriting
excellence, as well as outstanding client service. This underwriting passion and discipline
have consistently produced world-class levels of profitability. We are confident we will only
make each other better.

As we look more closely at the financial benefits of the combination, we expect to realize
significant efficiencies in the shorter-term and greater revenue growth medium-term that
will drive returns and create opportunities to invest in our business in terms of more
technology, products, people. And geographic presence, further improving our
competitive profile. Consistent with our track record and disciplined approach to M&A, this
transaction creates significant value for shareholders. First, through immediate accretion
to earnings and book value per share. Looking out, the transaction is projected to
produce double-digit EPS accretion. It's ROE accretive and will generate a double-digit
ROI by year three. Additionally, the ROI will exceed the companies' cost of capital by year
two and tangible book value per share will return to its current level in three years.
Finally, with aggregate total shareholder equity of nearly $46 billion and assets of $150
billion, the balance sheet of the combined company will have exceptional size and
strength. In a word, we will be so well-positioned to take advantage of both growth
opportunities and significant efficiencies to deliver greater growth and earning power
together than the sum of the two companies separately.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let me now spend a few minutes reviewing the terms of the transaction. As you see on
slide 5, under the agreement, Chubb shareholders will receive aggregate consideration
valued at $124.13 per share in stock and cash or approximately $28.3 billion. This is the
equivalent of $125.87 per Chubb share using ACE's 20-day volume weighted average
share price for the period ending June 30, 2015. Specifically, Chubb shareholders will
receive an aggregate consideration mix of approximately 50% stock and 50% cash, which
equates to $62.93 per share in cash and 0.6019 shares of ACE stock.
The consideration represents a 30% premium to Chubb's closing price of $95.14 on June
30. On a pro forma, fully diluted basis, ACE shareholders will own 70% of the combined
entity and Chubb shareholders will own 30%. We expect the transaction to close during
the First Quarter of 2016 following the receipt of customary regulatory and shareholder
approvals. The combined organization will operate under the Chubb name, an
acknowledgment of the distinctiveness and recognition of its brand particularly in the US.
Our companies share a great mutual respect. We are both conservative in how we take
and manage risk and how we manage our balance sheets.
Chubb has so many talented people who will be a great addition to the ACE family. I and
my colleagues look forward to welcoming them and working with them. Upon completion
of the transaction, I will serve as Chairman and CEO of the combined company. John
Finnegan, Chubb's Chairman, President and CEO will serve as Executive Vice Chairman
for External Affairs of North America and will assist me with integration efforts. I look
forward to working with John. I also look forward to leading this new organization together
with ACE's current Executive management team and colleagues from Chubb.
Four Chubb Directors will join the ACE Board. The combined company will remain a Swiss
company with principal offices in Zurich. Chubb's headquarters in Warren, New Jersey will
house a substantial portion of the headquarters functions for the combined companies'
North American division, as well as a number of our major businesses; while ACE will
continue to maintain a significant presence in Philadelphia, where its current North
American division headquarters is located.

As I mentioned earlier, we intend to finance the cash portion of the transaction through an
aggregate cash consideration of $14.3 billion funded by cash on hand and new senior
debt. The cash consideration is a combination of $9 billion of cash on hand between both
companies and $5.3 billion of new long-term debt. Regarding the stock consideration, we
will be issuing 137 million shares of ACE to Chubb shareholders with a fixed exchange
ratio of 0.6019 ACE shares for each Chubb share based on ACE's closing price yesterday
of $101.68, which I consider cheap. This consideration represents approximately $13.9
billion. With that, I will now turn the call over to John.

Thank you, Evan. You and your team have built a great company at ACE. We're delighted
to be partnering with you to create a new leader in the global commercial, specialty and
personal P&C industry. We believe this transaction will deliver strong intermediate and
longer-term value to Chubb shareholders. As Evan mentioned, Chubb shareholders will
receive total consideration of $124.13 per Chubb share and cash and ACE stock,
representing a 30% premium to Chubb's closing stock price yesterday, June 30.
Following the close, Chubb shareholders will own 30% of the combined company, giving
them a meaningful stake in an even stronger global P&C leader.
When Evan and I first discussed the possibility of an ACE-Chubb combination, we both
saw a lot of potential benefits. But as our discussion progressed, it became increasingly
clear that the strategic fit, immediate value creation and superb prospects for the
combined company would in fact be compelling. We have complementary capabilities,
assets and geographic footprints; combined with a larger, stronger balance sheet, we will
be even better positioned to compete and win in the market environment in which size,
global reach and differentiated capabilities are increasingly key to long-term success.
At Chubb, we have great respect for ACE and its management team. I'm pleased and
proud that ACE has recognized the strength of Chubb's brand and the attributes of
quality and service it represents and has chosen to adopt the Chubb name and brand for
the combined company. ACE has also committed to add four of Chubb's independent
Directors to the Board of the new company. In conclusion, we are convinced that this is a
compelling transaction for Chubb. Now, I will turn the call back over to Evan.

Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Thank you, John. Again, what makes this transaction exceptional is that it's both
strategically compelling and financially compelling because of the attractive shareholder
returns. As outlined on slide 8, we expect the transaction will be immediately accretive to
EPS and book value per share. By year three, the transaction will be accretive to EPS on a
double-digit basis and will be accretive to ROE. It is anticipated that the ROI, again, will
exceed ACE's cost of capital within two years resulting in a double-digit return by year
three. Tangible book value per share will return to its current level in three years.
We expect goodwill payback will be realized in approximately 5.5 years. Looking at further
-- at future value creation and savings, we expect to realize approximately $650 million of
annual run rate expense savings by 2018. These savings will result from duplication in

FINAL

corporate overhead, functional areas and overlap in operations. We will improve the
competitive profile of the combined enterprise. The company also expects to achieve
meaningful growth that will result in substantial additional revenue. After all, this is the
strategic purpose of the transaction.
Together, we will grow revenue and earnings more quickly than the sum of the two
companies separately. We expect by year five earnings accretion will be balanced
between revenue and expense-related synergies. The efficiencies created will provide
greater flexibility for the company to invest in people, technology, product, distribution
and geographic presence, again, ultimately enhancing the competitive profile of the
company.

Bloomberg Transcript

Slide nine demonstrates how well our two companies fit together and how our
complementary strengths will create a company with superior product offerings, many of
which are less sensitive to the commercial P&C industry cycle. In the US, where Chubb has
a major presence, the combination makes us a leading insurer of commercial business in
the large corporate segment to the middle market with a broad variety of coverages.
Chubb's strong distribution relationships in the US, through independent agents, will
complement our traditional strength in P&C brokerage.
Outside of the US, ACE is a premier global P&C insurer with a presence in 54 countries
and a broad product, customer and distribution capability. Chubb is a more US-centric
company with operations in 25 countries which will complement and significantly deepen
ACE's global presence and capabilities. Globally, depending on where we find
opportunity, the combined company will serve commercial customers of all sizes from the
largest corporations with complex multi-national exposures to the middle market and
small commercial companies.
The company will have a significant and complementary presence in personal lines that
serve the insurance needs of individuals and their families. In addition, the combined
company will have a leading position in professional lines globally, as well as one of the
largest excess and surplus lines in specialty product portfolios in the industry.
Let me give you simply a glimmer through three simple anecdotal examples of how our
strengths complement each other. First, Chubb will enhance ACE's product and
underwriting expertise in the upper middle market. Secondly, ACE will provide more
products, particularly specialty, to serve middle market clients. Third, together our
strengths will enable the combined entity to pursue both the small and micro markets
around the world.
Importantly, another reason for this -- this combination is so attractive is our shared
commitment to underwriting profitability and superior financial performance. As you can
see on the chart on slide 10, both of our companies' combined ratio has exceeded our
global and North American peer set over the past 10 years. This is a testament to a
common, relentless, disciplined approach to underwriting standards. Complementing
sustained long-term underwriting profit, the combined company will also benefit from a
substantially larger fixed income-oriented invested asset base, as interest rates rise.

FINAL

As I said, ACE and Chubb together will create a global P&C leader with highly
complementary business lines, distribution channels, customer segments and
underwriting culture. As you can see on slide 11, the combined organization will have a
number of leadership positions in the industry. It will be the number one global P&C
insurance company by P&C underwriting income, the number two US publicly traded P&C
insurer and the fourth largest global insurer by book value and operating income.
I mentioned this briefly before. But together we will become the second-largest
commercial lines insurer in the US and the leader in high net worth personal lines
coverages. ACE is deeply committed to and has a great track record building and
managing businesses in Asia and Latin America. Together, our presence will be further
enhanced in these fast-growing developing markets where together, our companies write
$7 billion in total premium.

Bloomberg Transcript

Slide 12 is a great visual depiction and provides a breakdown of the increased size and
breadth of our product offerings and how each organization will contribute to the
combined companies' business segment. As I said, the combined company will have a
broad product offering for commercial customers of all sizes. This includes professional
lines such as: D&O and professional liability; risk management; all forms of excess and
primary casualty; workers comp; property; marine; aviation; and energy.
In commercial lines, Chubb has a larger US professional lines and surety business,
contributing 62% to the combined companies' net premiums. While ACE has a greater
international presence, contributing nearly 75% of net premiums. Otherwise, the
contributions for commercial lines are quite balanced. On the personal insurance side, you
can see Chubb's much larger contribution in US high net worth with nearly 70% of the
combined companies' net premiums. On the other side of the coin, the combined
companies' personal lines business internationally as well as our global A&H and life areas
benefit primarily from contributions from ACE.
Together, the combined company will be substantial in size and strength by any measure,
as outlined on slide 13. For example, as of December 31, 2014, on an aggregate basis,
gross premiums exceeded $37 billion and operating income exceeded $5 billion. The
combined company had cash and invested asset investments of approximately $107
billion and total assets of approximately $150 billion.
Slide 14 provides another way to look at the combined companies' extensive
diversification by both geographic presence and business line. I happen to like that slide a
lot. But turning to slide 15, we have always emphasized the importance of maintaining a
conservative and flexible capital structure. As a combined company, on a pro forma basis,
at 12/31/15, shareholder equity would be nearly $44 billion with total capital of about $57
billion. In terms of leverage, the combined company will have a pro forma debt-to-capital
ratio of 20%, which we expect to decrease over time.
In summary, this transaction offers a highly compelling story for our combined shareholder
base as well as the clients we serve and our distribution partners across the globe. At
ACE, we have a clear long-term strategy that we have patiently pursued both organically

FINAL

and through acquisitions. We have built with determination a presence and capability to
produce sustained long-term growth and peer-leading shareholder returns. We are first
and foremost builders. Insurance is a long-term business. We are patient. Consummating
this transaction will certainly accelerate our growth and earning power.
We have been good stewards of shareholder capital through the years, as the slide on
the last page demonstrates. Through industry cycles and major risk-related events, ACE
has performed at a consistently high level including good book value per share growth
and strong operating ROEs. It's a track record that stands up well over any reasonable
period of time on both an absolute and relative basis.
Upon closing of this transaction, we will have created a global P&C industry leader with
superior product, customer and distribution channel capabilities, greater growth in earning
power and substantial opportunities for value creation. I am very enthusiastic, in fact,
beyond words about the benefits that this transaction will bring ACE and Chubb and all of
our stakeholders. Thank you, again for your time today. I will now turn the call back over to
Helen.

Cliff Gallant, Nomura.

Q - Cliff Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

Congratulations. It's quite a deal, very compelling. I was wondering, when you think about
just the management of such a large organization, could you compare the management
structure of ACE to that of Chubb? Organizationally, what kind of changes do think you're
going to have to make to the Chubb organization? Then, secondarily below that, what
have you done to identify key people at Chubb that you need to keep? How do you
incentivize them to stay?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Sure. First of all, there is nothing more important to John and me than retaining the best
across the two organizations. This combination is going to create more opportunity
because of the growth potential for the good people across both organizations. We know
who our good people are. We have a lot of respect and a lot of regard for them. We are a
meritocracy. We reward performance. All those great performers, we will motivate and
retain them to the team. The management structures of both companies are a bit
different but they make sense for each organization. While we are making plans for
Page 7 of 20

integration, it's premature to discuss exactly how the organization will look. But it will
follow -- I can tell you that the organization structure will follow commonsense strengths of
each company.

FINAL

Q - Cliff Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

Okay. When I think of both companies -- you don't sell cookie-cutter products. There's
always a specialty aspect to both companies. It's always been a strength of the franchise.
But when you get -- can you get to a point where you are so big that you lose some of
that strength? I would think there might be opportunities for niche players to try to nip at
your heels a bit. Maybe one off, that's not a big deal. But collectively it could be
meaningful.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

You know what? That will always happen. When ACE was -- 10 years ago, when I could
manage ACE from line of sight; one hand you could ensure underwriting excellence in a
very deliberate, clear fashion. As ACE got bigger, I've heard that question over and over
and over again. How do you manage -- I mean we've talked about it for years. How do
you -- as the organization will grow on a global basis, how do continue to manage
underwriting excellence and quality excellence across all of your business lines, across the
globe?
I think we have demonstrated that we have the management talent. We have the
organizational structure in how we organize ourselves. We behave like a small company
though we are large. We have the ability in terms of the flow of information in all the
checks and balances that we have. You know what? Chubb has the same thing. As we put
this together, I'm not worried about that part. When you get at the part of people nipping
at our heels, well, this is a competitive market. It is a market-oriented economy. If you are
good and you have capabilities and you're compelling in the marketplace, then have at it.
We always welcome competition. I'm not concerned about that. But when you look at the
combination here, in products, even that we overlap in, there are so many areas -- like,
take professional lines. ACE is great at the upper middle market and the large account.
Chubb in particular at the middle market and into the upper middle. So it's
complementary to us. When you look at it on an international basis, you find the same
thing. That's just one small example. Frankly, we are just going to cover more of the
marketplace landscape together. We're going to be nimble. We're going to be efficient.
We are going to be entrepreneurial. We're going to maintain that hallmark of ACE.

Q - Cliff Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

Impressive. Congratulations. Thank you.

Congratulations on the deal. First, I just want to see if we could get your perspective on
what the initial dilution the tangible book value per share is?

Jay, we'll get that for you in a minute.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. Then one of the things I wanted to touch base on and I'm sure we will see
this in the proxy. Can you tell us a bit about the -- how the transaction came about? Was
this ACE approaching Chubb? Was Chubb shocked at all?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well these things happen when the moment is right for both. We approached them a few
weeks ago. We put the deal together rapidly but thoughtfully. Because it made so much
sense to both sides for all our constituents.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Okay. Then, if you could give us a bit more insight on the potential revenue synergies?
Why you feel those would come about in the combination?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Oh, yes. ACE, when I look at it -- I'm going to give you a little broader vision of this. When I
look at the combination where it is so compelling to me about -- it's about
complementary strengths that will drive that. I look at Chubb in the United States, such a
great middle market company with a large agency distribution. It's selling traditional
middle market product and some specialties. ACE has been building a retail middle
market specialty presence. We'll combine that with Chubb's middle market. We will put so
much more product that ACE has broadly across the organization through that distribution
to those Chubb customers that we can add more product offering; that we can add to the
agents who have within their portfolios more product to serve customers that they have
today.
On another side of the coin, ACE is good in the large account and upper middle market.
We are very good. But some of our product offerings aren't as broad as they could be.
Chubb's capabilities will add to that. Just think commercial auto and workers comp, where
ACE is not great and present in that. That will benefit us. When I look across the globe. But
including the United States, we've been endeavoring in the small commercial and micro
business, both on a wholesale and a retail basis. Chubb, itself, has been contemplating
Page 9 of 20



Company N ame: Chubb L td

FINAL

that. Together, we will drive into those markets on a global basis in a very meaningful way
between ourselves.
When I look at some of the overlap in businesses, particularly -- and I'd said this earlier. If
you take professional lines or some of the other businesses -- we actually -- we overlap
but we don't overlap that much. We're both extremely present in the area but one is
more dominant or more present in the larger end and the other more present in the
smaller end. That will be complementary to us. I think that gives you a few examples.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

It does. Thank you, Evan. Phil, I don't know if you have that --

A - Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

I do. That dilution is about 29%. Initially, we expect that to recover to the same level in
about three years.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

In three years.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

When you have a chance, if you could give us the components of that. That would be
helpful.

A - Phil Bancrof t

Sure.

Ryan Tunis, Credit Suisse.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

My first question is just on the pro forma tax rate of the combined entity. Should we be
thinking about the Chubb earnings as tax-affected at what we're used to modeling for
ACE?

A - Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

No. I would expect you to use the rate that you would have used for Chubb. We don't see
any significant change in our tax rate.

So no tax efficiencies from the Chubb deal despite the fact you're keeping the same
jurisdiction for domicile?

A - Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

That's right. Maybe some around the margin --

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Around the margin, nothing material.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Then I guess just thinking about the Fireman's Fund deal. One thing I think that's sort of
interesting about this one, is you guys have spent the better part of the last few year's
trying to build a competitor to Chubb. I guess, are you more confident now than you have
been that you can't really build an agency juggernaut in personal lines to compete with
Chubb there in high net worth personal lines?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Of course not. Are you kidding me? We have built a good personal lines business and a
good business in the high net worth that's a dynamic open area within the personal lines
marketplace. I think ACE did a great job with it. We've been building. I think the
combination of the two will be compelling.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Understood.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

A lot of compatibilities. It will be in efficiencies.

Q - Ryan Tunis

Got you.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

We've been good competitors.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

I guess the last one is just -- any early reaction to the Chubb reserves? Was there any
contemplation of recovery built into their -- in your valuation for Chubb?

A - Evan Greenberg

Would you say that again?

Charles Sebaski, BMO Capital Markets.

Q - Charles Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Just, I have a question on the high net worth personal business. I know, Evan, after the
Fireman's Fund, you talked about the growth potential for you guys in the US in that
space. Now with the combination of Chubb and its market-leading position, what's the
growth potential in that space given the now -- scale of the combined entity?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good question. We sized that marketplace as in excess of $40 billion or more. There are
lots of companies that are serving the high net worth space from: Allstate -- you saw
them talking about it in the paper the other day, to State Farm, to ACE and Chubb and
AIG and a whole plethora of players. I see tremendous opportunity. I mean, you see what
we are combined, about $5 billion. I see tremendous growth opportunity in that area.

Q - Charles Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Excellent. Then on the cost saves on the future $650 million that you identified, is this just
standard fixed cost overlap? Or anything in particular on where that might be coming
from?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

On the cost overlap, look, it comes from -- we have redundancies in so many functional
areas, everything is two by two, both domestically and internationally. Understand, that
this transaction -- the first compelling nature of it is not the cost efficiencies. It's the
growth opportunities that we see. But at the same time, we see a great opportunity to
improve our competitive profile, while at the same time preserving and coveting the
cultures and the franchised strengths that make each company great. But the simple fact
is, there is tremendous redundancy between the two across functional areas, across
corporate overhead areas and within structures -- statutory structures. So we're going to
create an elegant organization over time.

Q - Charles Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Then finally I guess, just regard to the debt and the financial leverage. I know the pro
forma is a bit higher than either company was running solo. Do you think this organization
just will have the opportunity to run a bit higher debt leverage? Or do think it comes back
down over time just conceptually? We'd appreciate any thoughts.

Even at the outset, we're well within the range that will be targeted for our ratings level.
So we're not concerned about the leverage. As Evan says, we would expect it to drop
over time.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

Congratulations on the deal. Quite amazing. I wanted to ask -- some of the assumptions
with respect to accretion of the deal or just the success of the deal. Are -- any of those
underlying assumptions dependent on a particular market environment for the industry?
Or -- you've already mentioned interest rates. But if you could kind of go through your
thoughts as to what the sensitivity we should look at for how well this all works out in the
end depending upon what happens with pricing and things of that nature?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Hi. Paul, you've known me a long time. I am a realist. I hardly make strategy and plans
based on what I wish things would be. We face reality and what it is. We all know where
the marketplace is today. We understand the surplus capital, the amount of capital that is
sloshing around. We understand the moderate economic to low economic growth in the
world, the kind of interest rate environment we're in.
We understand the shape of the balance sheets of the industry. We understand what
drives cycles. So we face reality. I can guarantee you, as we looked at the few years out of
this thing and looking out a prolonged period. We looked out, one, two, three, four, five
years. You don't do something like this -- it's not a bolt-on where you're looking at it for a
year or two. But we're realists, as we looked at it. Our assumptions were based all around
that.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

Well that's fantastic. Could you -- what do think of as the current cost of ACE's capital at
the moment?

Operator
Meyer Shields, KBW.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Evan, you mentioned a couple times that this will enhance your competitive positioning. I
think that's clearly true. But I was wondering whether there are specific expectations in
terms of pricing that this allows? In other words, can you maintain your current returns at
pricing 2% below where you are now? Or 5%? Or something like that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Meyer, I didn't think of it that way. It's a far messier marketplace than that. It all varies by
line of business and by geography. The one thing you know, we will not allow premium
underwriting to destroy book value. So we will always underwrite to an underwriting profit.
One of the things I want to tell you that I think a lot about, the combined data of both
organizations along with the skills and experience in complementary areas -- you just
imagine it.
If we manage this right, over a period of time, it's going to give us so much more insight
into risk and into dissecting risk into more granular cohorts. Given our skills and insights of
underwriters, the ability to use those insights -- to use that data. Then with the distribution
power of the two and the geographic presence of them -- well, there you go. That's the
way to think about it. It's a fool's game to think about, well, I have this -- maybe I've got
another 0.5 point or 1 point because I took out some expense and that will -- that's a
fool's game.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. No. That's helpful. That makes sense. Does the much larger investment portfolio
allow for any change in allocation by class?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

It's premature to say that. But as you can imagine as we put the two portfolios together
and given the construct of ACE as Chubb comes in, our corporate structure, et cetera and
where assets and capital are located, there will be a thoughtful view on allocation of the
invested asset. As you know, we are both conservative in how we manage it. We take -we both have operated under a philosophy that we take a lot of risk on the liability side of
Page 14 of 20

the balance sheet. We are levered the liability side. So therefore, it's both policyholder
and shareholder money we're investing. We will do that -- we'll continue to do that in a
conservative way.

Q - Thomas Mitchell

{BIO 22121384 <GO>}

First of all, I know it's a little early to think about it. But is there any reason to think that you
would continue share repurchases after the closing of the deal given the amount of debt
you are taking on?

A - Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We don't expect to for some time. We'll manage the capital as it emerges. But as I said,
we all believe that the combined companies will generate a significant amount of capital.
We'll manage it over time. But for the near-term, we don't see any buybacks.

A - Evan Greenberg

Just on slide 6, you have got some statements on deck, you think cash on hand is $9
billion. I was wondering where that's coming from because when I looked at the combined
balance sheet, I get about $1 billion worth of cash on hand. So I was wondering if some of
that's undrawn debt commitments.

Is not literally cash. It's undeployed capital in both of the companies. So right -- while we
have our undeployed capital invested in our investment portfolio, it's available to use for
acquisitions or buybacks or whatever.

Thanks. Then last one, just on the ROE accretion -- So the EPS accretion you're talking -pointing to in that year three. Wondering what number you're using for that because I look
at consensus on Bloomberg, there's only one number up there. Or if it's only one analyst
providing a number?

Yes. We're not providing that number.

So --

Bloomberg Transcript

Congratulations on a landmark deal. I was curious looking through Chubb's financial
statements to some extent -- you said you've been working on this for a couple of weeks
but you're very confident about the cost savings. Can you talk about the process you went
through on identifying the cost saves? How much is going to occur in the underwriting part
of the business versus corporate expenses and what not? Do you have any granularity
there?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No, Josh, we've given as much as we are going to give on that. But what you can imagine
is, this isn't our first time going around this. We are quite experienced at M&A. We
understand how to do analysis in this regard. We have experienced people in doing that.
We have a very good process both pre-acquisition, during acquisition transition and postacquisition. We are quite thoughtful in how we imagine all this. That's as far as I'm going to
go now on that subject.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

No. That is fine. Legally, are there any things going to be to think about in the Swiss
domicile given the proportion of business in the United States? Or the changing of the
name? Are there any considerations that we should be aware of ?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No. There's not. There's nothing -- it will be status quo.

Larry Greenberg, Janney Capital.

Q - Larry Greenberg

{BIO 16478161 <GO>}

Congratulations to both organizations. Clearly, you both believe that the time is right to
combine given where each of your respective organizations are in their life cycles. I'm just
wondering if you could put the timing of this deal in context in terms of property casualty
industry structure today. Is there something about the industry today that makes this a
more compelling transaction than perhaps it would have been five years ago or 10 years
ago?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. That's a good question. I think there is, to me. The industry -- the world is more
globalized than it was a decade ago. That is simply a trend that is going to continue. When
you look at financial markets, how they've globalized. Technology and what it does to
allow knowledge and people and data to move around the world so rapidly. When you
look at what technology has done in so many industries and is doing in ours to give an
opportunity to create insights, new businesses, different exposures and an ability to
manage and have a competitive advantage with the insights around all of that.
When you look at the value particularly because of the way the world is moving online of
brands and the meaning of brands and how they are created and how they are
recognized. To me, those are just a few examples of, we're not in the same world today
that we were a decade ago. The playbook you use today is not the same one that you
would have used precisely then. We're in a world of low growth. We're in a world of low
inflation. We're in a world where economic realities of countries are interconnected to
each other. I think that is a world that we're going to be in for quite some time. I think
that's a reality that we need to face. I think all of that is part of the backdrop, in my own
thinking, when I think about the compelling, strategic nature of this transaction.

FINAL

Yes. A couple of questions. I guess, one is will the Chubb business be available to be
ceded through ABR rate?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Oh, I don't -- well, yes, is the answer in the general term. But I have to be honest, I've
hardly thought about that.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Okay. I guess a question for John Finnegan. The question came up about where we are in
the cycle. But the question for you really is, why now for Chubb? Was there anything
particular that caused you to sell to ACE?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

No. I think that the answer is that after discussion, Evan's proposal made a lot of sense.
We worked hard at it. We came up with what we thought was a compelling transaction.
We weren't driven by timing in particular. I think, as Evan says, there are some more
reasons today that you might want to do a merger of this type than maybe five years ago.
But we weren't out shopping it, this was a proposal that came to us. We thought it was a
very good one. So it was driven more by the nature of the proposal, the nature of the
company we're merging with and the economics of the deal and the strategy going
forward.
