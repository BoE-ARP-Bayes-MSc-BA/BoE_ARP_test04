{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Richard, thanks very much. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for
joining us on what I know is a very busy day for all of you. As you've seen from this
morning's press release, the Group's made a very strong start to the year. We've got good
growth across all the businesses and it's important to remember that this is against a prior
year quarter that was largely unimpacted by the pandemic. The performance
demonstrates we believe both the strength of the business and the successful positioning
of the Group to take advantage of growth opportunities as the world emerges from the
challenges of the global pandemic. In the ﬁrst quarter, our P&C business continued to
perform well with topline growth of 14% driven by the strength of commercial insurance.
The pricing momentum in commercial insurance remained strong. All regions are seeing
higher levels of price increase in the ﬁrst quarter than you saw a year ago.
And we expect the current pricing conditions to continue through this year and to next
supporting further improvement in the underlying accident year loss ratios. Life and the
farmers businesses have also performed well with a focus on unit linked and protection
products leading to strong growth in new business value. And while the Farmers
Exchanges, which are of course owned by the policyholders, saw a return to growth even
before the inclusion of the acquired MetLife P&C business which will add to growth from
the second quarter. Balance sheet remains very strong with the Swiss Solvency Test ratio,
and this allows for the acquisition of the MetLife P&C business even if it didn't in the ﬁrst
quarter, at 201%, well above the target levels that we communicated back in February.
Before I give you some thoughts about the remainder of the year, I just want to comment
there has been no change to the level of COVID-19 P&C claims net of frequency beneﬁt.
So, this remains at the $450 million net ﬁgure level that we reported back in February.
Looking ahead, it seems clear to me that given the strength of the ﬁrst quarter that we'll
be perhaps a little cautious in our guidance for the P&C net earned premium growth. If
you remember, Richard and I stretched the deﬁnition of mid-single digits and I think even
now so that it's more likely to be in the upper single-digit range compared to what I had
indicated back in February. On the claims side, you would have seen in the press release
that we've got a higher than usual level of nat cat events in the ﬁrst quarter, primarily the
Texas freeze. And so assuming that all things are equal, i.e. we have the usual nat cat
experience for the remainder of the year, that would add about 1 percentage point to the
combined ratio overall for the year.
In life, the ﬁrst quarter saw some additional mortality level that was similar to the second
half of 2020 with about $120 million driven primarily by the UK, US, and Latin America.
Mortality has been improving steadily as the lockdown measures and the successful
rollout of vaccination programs has led to signiﬁcant improvements and that's particularly
true in the UK and the US. To look ahead for a second, I think the strength of the ﬁrst
quarter trends and the continuing improvement in the underlying P&C margins gives me
and all of us great conﬁdence as we look out to the remainder of the year.
With that, I'll be happy to take your questions.

Questions And Answers

FINAL

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). The ﬁrst
question comes from the line of Jon Hocking with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Hi there, I've got two questions please. Firstly on inﬂation, there's a lot of data points
ﬂying around about how much inﬂation we're seeing particularly in areas for construction
so lumber costs et cetera. Wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing
there and how you expect it to impact the results. And then secondly, I just wonder if you
could give a little bit of color please in terms of the rate increases, particularly in the US
rate increase ex workers' comp and if you give us a callout [ph] on the line. That would be
very helpful. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks very much, Jon. So on the inﬂation topic, maybe just to remind everyone of
something I said in the past. And I think if you look at our books, I guess most people
perceive the inﬂation risk around workers' comp. We've talked in the past about the fact
that we -- I mean we don't have a mark-to-market view of the inﬂation assumption. We
tend to have quite a backwards -- backwards is the wrong way to express it, but we've got
a longer time series in the assumption. We go back several years. I think we've also
highlighted that we haven't fully taken A versus E, actual versus expected, on the workers'
comp side so that gives us some measure of protection. But I think it's a topic that
everyone needs to keep in the front of their mind. On the lumber cost topic, I mean I think
the only immediate impact we see other than the fact that it will appear in some of the
claims that we've already incorporated in Q1.
I mean the most obvious place where I see it is that I think for the ﬁrst time, it's come up in
the -- our assessment of the Texas freeze topic. So as we've been looking at the potential
cost of that, but we've allowed for some of the price inﬂation that we've seen around
some of the things that will be required to repair some of the damage that we've seen.
From a price perspective, I mean it's another strong quarter. I think in commercial, this is
the ﬁrst straight quarter of double-digit rate increase. If you look across the various lines
of business, I mean the picture is not very diﬀerent compared to where it's at Q4. I'd say
that property and liability are slightly down compared to where they were. So, I think I
talked back in February about the fact that they were both reasonably deep into the 20%
plus territory. They're both now from our perspective around the 20% level, workers'
comp only slightly weaker.
And so I mean overall, I mean I think the move that you've seen and it's only US
commercial down from the 18 points that we reported back in Q4 than to 14% in Q1. I think
if you adjusted out for workers' comp, you'd be somewhere slightly north of 14 points. I
think if you look at the book more broadly, there's a couple of things that are relatively
important to bear in mind, I mean the US market has a relatively continuous renewal
pattern. Europe's a bit diﬀerent so you tend to see a bit more seasonality. Q1 is typically
Page 3 of 16

FINAL

pretty heavy Germany and Switzerland and those markets have quite diﬀerent pricing
dynamics from the UK. So I think when we see what happens at Q2, I think you'll still see a
very strong market and potentially I think you'll see Europe come up again in Q2 because
the UK has a much more signiﬁcant impact on April 1. So, overall I mean trends are really
pretty good. We expect this to translate into underlying -- underwriting improvement.
And of course when we get to Q2, I'll give you a more thorough update on that.

The next question comes from the line of Peter Eliot with Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go
ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Two questions, please. The ﬁrst one just on the guidance, George.
Obviously you mentioned that now you're thinking you were too cautious on the P&C
growth. I'm just wondering if you could sort of highlight any of the other areas in the
guidance outlook that you gave at full-year '20 where you sort of changed your view over
the next -- over the last three months. That's question one. Question two, just on the nat
cat impact, just sort of help us understand the impact. I'm just wondering whether you've
allowed for any seasonality in that or whether it's just as simple as saying plus 1 point for
the full year equals means that you're sort of plus 4 points over the normal budget for Q1.
Just to understand that. Thank you very much.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yes, great. And, so on the guidance topic, I think the -- I think if you look at -- I mean what
we're seeing internally and you allow for the comments -- I'll come on to the nat cat topic
in a second. But if you allow for the press release commentary around nat cats and you
allow for the COVID topic, I think we still expect to be roughly what we had planned for
even before that. So, I think it was the same that the underlying trends are probably
stronger than we anticipated, which is -- it's less relevant this year potentially because of
the impact of the Texas freeze, but it's a strong sign for next year. So, I think the
underlying improvement is important. On nat cat impact, so we do allow -- I mean when
we look at what we anticipate in each of the quarters, there is a seasonality pattern to it so
it's not pro-rated. And essentially simply what we've done for the time being is just look at
the excess level for Q1 and add that to our expected levels for the remainder of the year. I
mean that shows like the most transparent way to do it, but you guys can make your own
assumptions about what that means for the remainder of the year. But I mean for the time
being, we've seen a -- I mean typically one of the later quarters deliver I mean quite
signiﬁcant nat cat loads and that's why we made the commentary that we have.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Great. Thank you very much.

The next question comes from the line of Andrew Ritchie with Autonomous. Please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - Andrew Ritchie

Hi, there. I wonder just on North America P&C growth if I back out the eﬀect of crop, the
underlying growth is a bit behind rate. Is there still remedial actions going on there? Has
there been a signiﬁcant change in retention or is this just possibly still COVID overhang
eﬀects; something particularly on workers' comp. sort of payroll eﬀects which presumably
are still coming through? That's the ﬁrst question. Second question, just remind me would
the Q1 Texas freeze loss count towards global aggregate nat cat? I'm not sure I can
remember if all events count towards that or whether there is a big franchise deductible
on those kind of events. And remind me does that global cat aggregate cover around
calendar year? Thanks.

A - George Quinn

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Andrew. So on the ﬁrst one, I think when you break out the North American
numbers and obviously the crop price change has had a pretty signiﬁcant impact. I think
the reason why you maybe don't see all of what you see on the North American business
isn't so much the impact of COVID. I'm sure there's still some of that in the number. I
suspect that a more signiﬁcant driver is probably the fact that the actual exposure that we
take at these price levels is less. So the -- I mean if you think of the way the corporates
tend to approach it, I mean certainly they have the same budgetary constraints that we do
and it's a pretty common response to this type of pricing environment that people will
increase deductibles, maybe buy a bit less cover. So, you've got these two things partly
oﬀsetting each other. But net net, it still means that you have a much higher quality
commercial book in North America. On the Q1 Texas freeze, so the answer is yes and it's a
calendar year cover so -- and if you can imagine, this thing certainly passes the franchise
requirements for the global cat aggregate.

The next question comes from the line of Will Hardcastle from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - William Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Hi, Good afternoon, guys. Just two quick ones to wrap up those questions. What industry
the loss assumptions have you seen therefore in the Texas windstorm? It sounds like it's a
bit of a bottom-up. Regarding your lumber comment, have you used the top-down view
as well? And then on the second one, I guess given the extent of the rates and credit
spread beneﬁts in Q1, have sensitivities to rising rates from here moved signiﬁcantly
versus the ones you provided at the full year?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So on the ﬁrst one, Will, I mean as always it's a bit of both. So, it's a relatively unusual
event. I've been talking to the claims team a few weeks ago and actually we had some
experience from the tornadoes last year. So, we got some clients that have been
impacted both by the tornado and by the freeze. So, we've got a bit of insight into how
some particular properties are exposed to particular loss. So I mean the way the team
have done it for the time being because there's not a lot of -- I mean they haven't been
fully through the loss adjustment process. So at this point, we've taken the notiﬁcations.
The team have looked at some of the experience from last year and they've come up with
ranges. The thing is driven by -- and it's not a really shortlist that we're talking, I mean a
couple of tens of actual events tend to drive the overall outcome.
So, we've focused mostly on those to try and look at bottom-up from the perspective of
notiﬁcation and top-down from a knowledge of that particular exposure or property. And I
think as I mentioned earlier in response to Jon's question, I mean we have added a few
additional things for example to incorporate some of -- and it's not really demand side
inﬂation, I think it's more the commodity and the recovery from the COVID driven inﬂation
topic around lumber -- about commodities in general. On sensitivities, I mean we haven't
updated -- I mean they will have moved because they're not entirely linear. It just would
be wonderful if this things was completely (inaudible), but of course we all know that's not
true. But I think for now given that the Q1 move is mainly driven by interest rates and I
think almost the entire market move is interest rate related. I mean the non-linearity is not
so important then for that particular topic.

The next question comes from the line of Vinit Malhotra with Mediobanca. Please go
ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Just a follow-up, George. There was a comment in the press release
about mortality and just wondering whether you were trying to suggest that we should be
more cautious about mortality than back in mid-Feb or I think you did say that there
wasn't much of a change, but just wanted to cross-check that? So, mortality guidance.
And the second question is more about when we are hearing more and more about
semiconductor shortages and those kind of things aﬀecting car manufacturers and I don't
know what else. I mean are you seeing some of those sight of second order claims and
business interruption or other areas, which could be COVID linked sort of? So, just curious
about that. Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks, Vinit. So I think on the ﬁrst one, I think there's two oﬀsetting eﬀects. So I think
if you -- if I look at mortality now compared to what we were expecting back in February, I
Page 6 of 16



FINAL

would say that UK, US is probably slightly better than we were anticipating. Certainly the
decay pattern that we can see is faster than we had anticipated. Having said that though,
we're seeing more from Latin America particularly Mexico and Brazil. Having said that,
looking at the strengths of the life business overall, I don't think it changes the overall
outcome. So, I mean the comment I made at the top of the call around the underlying
trends on the P&C side. The underlying trends. actually on life look pretty good too. But I
mean the reason for giving the guidance was -- I mean within the life segment, it will be
visible. I mean (inaudible) has referred to just given the impact of it. However, the
underlying business is actually doing pretty well and certainly play bit stronger than we
anticipated back in February.
On semiconductor shortages and some of the shutdowns and other issues that we've
seen. I think it's a pretty complex topic from an insurance perspective and I think the risk
actually cuts both ways. Because in theory I mean if you're more directly exposed to the
semiconductor sector, any damage in networks is going to be a bit more expensive
because of the BI consequences. On the ﬂip side on the recipient end because of the
short time working or the other restrictions, I mean arguably the gross income level might
be lower. So, I think it's really hard to draw a very clear conclusion. Depends a bit on
maybe how the book is positioned overall, but I mean I suppose everything, there's a few
positives and negatives and those two are the most obvious to me.

The next question comes from the line of James Shuck with Citi. Please go ahead.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, George and everyone. On the solvency position, you said 201%. I
appreciate that number is quite volatile and you have a ﬂoor number of 160%, but you
don't have an upper end range anymore. But under the old ZECM basis if we just apply
the same kind of multiple and relationship between SST and ZECM, then 201% would be
at the top end of the previous range. So, just trying to get a feel for at what stage do you
see yourself as having surplus capital? I know you're going to tell that it's volatile and it
can come back, presumably there's some things you can do on the life back book that
might take out that volatility and should actually even add to the SST ratio if you were to
do things around that. So, any update and thoughts around the surplus capital potential.
please, Secondly on crop insurance. So I just want to be -- can you just remind me how
you book the combined ratios up to half year and then the true-up that you have in the
second half of the year? Obviously very high increase in commodity prices. Does that
mean that you're sort of expecting similar combined ratios on that crop business, but it's
an issue? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Okay. So on SST -- so I suspect if we were looking at ZECM, we would be through the top
end of the range. I think we gave a number back in February and it feels to me we've had
Page 7 of 16



Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

a bigger move than that. I think when we think about surplus capital, we just think about
capitalization in general. I mean the priority is really then the thing that you highlighted
and that's about where is the money and what's it doing at the moment. So, I mean we're
very active looking at capital allocation. I want to avoid. I'm always talking about it rather
than actually producing evidence that we've done something about it. But that's going to
be a very important priority for us this year and I certainly hope that as the year goes on, I
can actually report on some tangible progress. Now I mean what do we do especially on
the day that we get it? I don't know yet.
I mean obviously our priority would be to I mean put it back into the business and
hopefully actually earn a higher return on capital that's more consistent with the rates that
owners would expect us to earn on the capital they provide us. It's too early to say at this
stage. So, priority for me is a combination of making sure we have allocated -- capital
allocated as rationally as we possibly can within the normal constraints and I think we'd
also like to bring down some of those sensitivities. I mean I think it's pretty clear that from
a model perspective, some features tend to dominate the risk landscape and I would like
it if some of those movements were a bit smaller and we are thinking about how we
would achieve that. On the crop insurance side, I mean it's an interesting one.
I think from -- I mean from a purely ﬁnancial perspective, the stuﬀ tends to all be written in
Q1 and then mainly through Q2, Q3, and into the early part of Q4 when typically the yield
and revenue topics are worked out. I mean given where we were last year underlying on
the combined ratio, I mean crop would probably end up -- there's no change to our
expectation in terms of that crop proﬁtability. It's not a line in our investment income for
obvious reasons, but it would probably change the upper end of combined ratios -- of
loss ratios in particular for our book. So, you may see a small impact from earning through
more crop premium. But again as I said, I mean given the improvement we're seeing on
the commercial side, I don't really expect that to be visible.
Maybe just a last comment on crop risk. I think -- I mean in general, I think the moves on
prices -- I think it's generally a positive topic overall. I mean the actual crop cover has a bit
of complexity between the price it struck at planting and then the price it's achieved in
the market. I mean obviously we've actually had a pretty decent planting season so far
and the market conditions give farmers every incentive to get the stuﬀ into and out of the
ground. So too early to make any forecast, but I mean crop certainly doesn't start the year
in a bad place.

Thank you. Can you talk about MetLife? How much this will add this year and next? Just to
remind us because it seems to happen a bit quicker? And the second is on the runoﬀ. I
suppose I'm asking -- is this 400 million or whatever you had with COVID going to come
out of runoﬀ. But maybe you could just say whether you've changed the expectations or
not. I think it's between 1.5 and 2.5. Are we now in the middle of the range in expectation
or...? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Mike. So the -- on MetLife, I guess we've closed it out probably a couple of
months and quicker than we expected. So if you go back to what we said before, I mean
there's a -- from a Zurich money perspective, we've got about 2.3 -- just more than $2.3
billion investments. We've got some restructuring that will be incurred between us and
the exchanges through the remainder of this year and it will have a positive impact on
income for the management company as we go through this year. It will obviously
depress the reported fee level, but you'll see more fees. I think if you look out over 18
months, you should start to see that relatively clean sort of about 10% return on that 2.3 -just over $2.3 billion investment. So you'll see some this year, but you could have to wait
about 18 months to see the clean run rate. On runoﬀ, no change to guidance around that
topic. I think we've tried to be reasonably cautious on what we've guided to over the last
several years to maintain some consistency and predictability around the topic and from
what I see and what we've been doing in Q1 -- not only in Q1, but actually through the last
couple of years, no reason to change that. So, still anticipating 1% to 2%. Somewhere in
the middle of the range would be ideal, but certainly 1% to 2% is my expectation.

And there's no -- sorry. There's no -- It feels like COVID claims have been over-reserved, is
that -- looking at reinsurance certainly?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, I think it's too early to reach. There's a number of litigation topics running and while
I'm not concerned about the risk around those topics, I'm not really convinced there's a
huge amount of conservatism in the numbers that we have. If you look at I mean what
we've booked, I mean it's predominantly actually Europe which is kind of unusual given
it's a commercial topic. I mean the outcomes that have taken place in a number of key
markets. So, I mean it'd be great if we did see some of that reverse. But I mean our clients
don't anticipate that at this stage and certainly haven't reﬂected any of that in any
guidance around the expected level of runoﬀ from reserves.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

Thank you. Good afternoon everyone, just like couple of questions. First of all is with
respect to farmers -- sorry, with respect to Solvency II. Last quarter if I remember you
missed the solvency ratio by 6%, this time it is better by 6%. Can you give us some moving
parts? I mean I guess it has to do interest rate, but again some color on that would be very
helpful as to what drove a signiﬁcant increase or say how much is the macro beneﬁt here.
And secondly, I mean you mentioned in terms of combined ratio or say in terms of losses - cat losses 1 percentage point higher because of the cat losses. Would you say that all
these price increases that are coming through this year will oﬀset that versus the
expectation that you had at the beginning of the year or would you say that this 1
percentage point incremental cat losses is just like a negative on a net basis or would you
say there are oﬀsetting factors so that we don't need to change our combined ratio
forecast which we would have, let's say, yesterday? Any thoughts on that would be
helpful.

A - George Quinn

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yes. Great, Ashik. So on the SST number, I mean I need to be careful because I think on
prior Q1 calls I've given quite a lot of detail that almost was an earnings release. So I'm
going to be covet [ph], I don't want to give too much detail. But essentially there are only
three moving parts of any relevance this quarter. There's the economic proﬁt that we
generated. I mean you can always assume that that's somewhat impacted by the impact
of the excess nat cat losses and the Texas freeze topic we've been discussing throughout
the call. You've got the dividend accrual and plus or minus those two things are close to
oﬀsetting each other. And in the middle of it all, I've got interest rates and that's about it, I
don't really -- there might be other smaller things, but they're really not as signiﬁcant as
those other two.
So this quarter at least, the movement is actually relatively simple and straightforward to
follow. On the combined ratio. I have a bit of a challenge that of course I need to know
exactly what everyone forecasts for the combined ratio for us for the year. if I say generally
that -- I mean certainly if you'd asked me -- if we had this discussion back in February and I
looked at my plan for the year, I mean do I now need to add 1% to the plan for excess nat
cat losses in Q1? I do not so I've clearly got more rate coming through than the plan
anticipated and that will help absorb some part of the nat cat impacts in Q1. But I mean
we're highlighting it for the sake of transparency.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. So, it's fair to say that some part of this 1% extra drag would be oﬀset by the rate
increases. We are not going into the aesthetics of that number like whether it's 0.5% or
1%, but at least some part of that will be oﬀset, okay.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

That's an excellent summary.

The next question comes from the line of William Hawkins with KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - William Hawkins

Hello. Thank you very much. George, can you just speak to what was the Texas freeze loss
that you booked in the ﬁrst quarter? I'm sorry if I'm being foolish, but I know your
guidance you give for the full year, but a lot depends on what all the other experience
was to actually back out what the hit was. So, could you be a bit clear about the dollar
impact of the Texas freeze? And then on farmers, 4% growth relative to what that business
has been achieving in the recent past is quite an interesting acceleration. You've made
reference to the new business volumes in the commercial rideshare business. But I
wonder if you would just brieﬂy talk a bit more about what's happened there and do we
now plug in 4% for the full year or are there any kind of base eﬀects or seasonality issues
that we need to be aware of or if anything, is it maybe even accelerating and it could be
high by the year-end?

Yes, great. So on the ﬁrst topic I'm going to resist the temptation to give you a dollar
number. I mean the main reason for doing that is the net impact of cats that's important.
So if you look at the thing overall, North America is high versus planned or expected cat
impacts for Q1, Europe is low. The two don't fully oﬀset each other, but that's why we end
up with 1 point. So I mean from that, you can work out the Texas freeze is slightly higher
and there's a slight positive from a European perspective. Farmers growth in Q1, so I think
you're right and of course we're comparing this quarter to same quarter last year, which if
you look at the dynamics, the rideshare companies tend to be quicker to react and
anticipate. So, there's already some impact of GWP -- on GWP and the Farmers numbers
at Q1 last year. I mean the more kind of the pure retail side of it obviously reﬂects actual
experience.
So, we've seen rideshare bounce back in Q1 of this year. So, that's a much larger
contributor to the 4%. That's important because of course the fee beneﬁt of that is lower
to the management company than the broader retail positioning. But I mean we've seen
good growth on both sides. We do expect it to increase as you go through the remainder
of the year. I mean if you look at the diﬀerent dynamics, I'm going to MetLife P&C to one
side for a second so that will be an overlay on top of the whole thing. If you look at it, I
mean we're going to have an absence of prior year negative which will drive growth that
we report for the year so the refunds that exchanges delivered to customers mainly in Q2
last year and the obvious return of fee that that triggered for the management company,
you won't see that certainly in Q2 so that will have an obvious impact.
From a rate perspective, which is the main driver at the moment, if you look across the
book, I mean, auto pricing in the US is pretty competitive. So if we are seeing growth or if
the exchanges are seeing growth, you're seeing it more in non-standard which obviously

is not the bulk of the book. It's on the same proportion. Homeowners is much stronger.
But again if you look at the rest of this year, we expect the 4% to rise and not because of
rideshare, a combination of what's happening in the absence of negatives from the prior
year, underlying dynamics around pricing. And then on top of all of that, we'll have
MetLife P&C come in as of Q1 -- sorry, Q2.

The next question comes from the line of Michael Haid with Commerzbank. Please go
ahead.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Two questions. Retail ﬁrst. While you had strong
price increases in commercial, which is deﬁnitely more important to you than retail, both
premium volume and pricing in retail appeared under pressure in the ﬁrst quarter. It's
correct to have nominal price increases in retail of round about 1%, probably below loss
cost inﬂation. What are your thoughts on retail at the moment? In the last call, you already
indicated retail is not that part of the business you want to particularly grow. Second
question, you published the SSCR report so if I may, I would like to ask you a question
about Zurich Deutscher Herold and the solvency more general. If I remember correctly,
you apply the standard model for the solvency calculation which cuts the negative interest
rates at zero. In addition, you applied a 16-year transitional as well as a volatility adjuster
for your solvency calculation. Excluding this, your solvency ratio is still comfortable at
170% level. How comfortable you feel about the capitalization of Zurich Deutscher Herold
from a purely economic perspective. And do you have any reInsurance protection in
place? Just to make sure is the fact that you apply the standard formula for Deutscher
Herold does not aﬀect your Zurich SSC ratio? Right.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, thank you, Mike. The second one is a bit complex. So, we'll do the ﬁrst one relatively
quickly. So I think your summary on retail rate was one caveat. I think the market
condition, I mean you guys can see it certainly more broadly than I can with all the
diﬀerent companies you all follow. But it's a sector that's generally more under pressure at
the moment. So I think it is -- but obviously it's not producing either the margin expansion
or the growth that we're seeing on the commercial side. Now that doesn't mean we're
negative on retail, I mean just a reminder that what we said strategy for the current
economic cycle, retail was a signiﬁcant part of it. And while we're prioritizing growth in
commercial currently, we are trying to make sure that we make the investments, we build
the capabilities. we really have that customer driven focus around retail. So that when we
start to see the turn in the retail market, we are well positioned for that. But it's absolutely
true that it's a more challenging market than commercial currently.
On SSCR. I mean your summary of the diﬀerent components is good. The choice of type
of model for Solvency II has no impact on SST and in fact I think as you've heard us
Page 12 of 16



FINAL

discuss before from an SST perspective, we apply an internal model across our
businesses. When economic -- so how do we feel about the capitalization of Zurich
Deutscher Herold? I think we feel pretty good that the company is we believe wellcapitalized for the risks that it carries. And I think if you look at on a local basis, maybe
you'd be more positive for the positioning of the organization. The challenge is and I
guess this is at the heart of your question -- when we look at it from an internal economic
model perspective or a Solvency II -- sorry SST economic model perspective, it looks a bit
diﬀerent. The volatility is higher, the return on capital is lower. I think I mean that's
certainly something we want to look carefully at whether we have alternative ways to try
and manage that risk.
From a protection perspective, we don't have any signiﬁcant economic reinsurance in
place and the primary path that we've taken over the last several years is really around
ALM. And so more swaption, more long-dated ﬁxed income in the portfolio. But I think
even there, we try and be careful that you don't go from one extreme to the other. But I
mean certainly the business is all capitalized and it's local market. But when we overlay
our own view of the world, it brings a sensitivity and a level of return that I wouldn't say
we're entirely comfortable with.

The next question comes from the line of Hanif Farooq from Credit Suisse. Please go
ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. Thanks a lot. First question, we're starting to see commercial US players
seeing the beneﬁt of rate for those that have given us the numbers in Q1 and that's only
potentially going to accelerate plus obviously yields are going up. So in that context, what
are your latest thoughts on how long you think this pricing cycle is going to go on for? I
have another question, but just some thoughts will be interesting. And then secondly on
SST, I think like a normalized kind of growth in that number based on if you take out
COVID for 2020 is probably like 7 points to 8 points a year, that's economic proﬁt minus
dividend. Given life margin, especially pricing and MetLife, do you think that goes up
materially this year on an underlying basis? Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Excellent question. So on the ﬁrst one, I mean recognizing that it requires maybe even just
psychic capabilities that I can't really play into. I can only tell you what I can actually see at
the moment. So, we've obviously reported the eﬀects for Q1 and we -- I can already see
April numbers and April numbers given me signiﬁcant conﬁdence about the continuation
of the relatively high level of rate that we've seen so far. So -- and April is quite an
important date for both US and UK. So, we've seen a small drop come into Q1. April, let's
break it for me and we'll see what May and June bring us. I think if you look a bit further

and you look at all the things that are out there, I mean you talked about the interest rate
topic. We've talked earlier on the call about inﬂationary issues that I think are really ahead.
I mean there are evidently signiﬁcant risks still in the market as are evidenced by a
number of fairly obvious events over the course of the last few months. I mean there's an
element of what's happened in the commercial market, which is simply trying to get the
level of return back to a level that's commensurate with the risk. When do we reach that
point? I'm not convinced it's imminent so I don't expect the market to completely roll
over. I do expect we'll start -- we'll continue to see the market maybe ease in a few areas.
But the gap between headline price and loss cost inﬂation is still very substantial and I
expect us to maintain a substantial gap through the -- through all of 2021. 2022, we can
discuss later in the year. You said you wanted to come back, Hanif?

Okay. On the 7 points to 8 points so I mean given there's a predictive component for that
and the one thing that -- I mean we're in a quarter that is relatively light on P&L and
particular bottom line information. I want to get -- I think I want to avoid that after three
months of the year a signal an expectation that the economic proﬁt generation has
materially shifted. I think it's a topic we should come back to later in the year, but we've
clearly had a very good start to 2021.

Today's last question is a follow-up from Mr. James Shuck with Citi. Please go ahead.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Well, thanks very much for the opportunity. I'm just keen to know. One of your peers
mentioned about claims inﬂation slightly picking up in Q1 and in their model, they cited
model changes and increase in litigation funding costs. So, just interested to know
whether you saw that in Q1 and also if you're able to comment on any large loss
experience that we may have seen just given those frequency impacts in the quarter. And
then secondly, just quickly on the debt leverage. You obviously issued debt for the
MetLife deal taking you above your kind of historical run rate. What's the intention with
that debt? Ultimately will you pay it down and return to more normal levels? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So on the -- so on loss cost trends so we just completed the Q1 piece of work. I mean
within it, there are moves within the overall lines of businesses and the whole picture is
not vastly diﬀerent from the one we talked about last year. I think you also need to be
Page 14 of 16



FINAL

careful that the amount of data that we have from last year is deﬁnitely impacted by some
delay in activity. So for example from a liability perspective, I mean it would be relatively
easy to get carried away positively. But for the time being, we've hailed everything on the
basis that there's just delay in the information coming to us. But I mean by and large, the
overall -- our overall view of loss cost inﬂation hasn't really changed. Large losses, I'd say
large losses instinctively -- I think this is one of the better large -- sorry, better large loss
quarters that I can remember. I mean equally we're not extrapolating that into the
remainder of the year either. On debt coverage intention, I mean it's -- the ﬁnancing
structure has had an abundance of caution. You will see us bring it back down to the
levels that you are more familiar with for us.
