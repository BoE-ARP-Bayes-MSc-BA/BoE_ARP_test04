Presentation
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Q3, 2013 results conference call.
For your information, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to
turn the conference over to Janne Flessum, Head of IR. Please go ahead.

Janne Flessum

{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

Welcome to this presentation of the Third Quarter results for Gjensidige. As you probably
have seen, we have also released today our new capital strategy and therefore, our CFO,
Catharina Hellerud, will very briefly comment on the key takes from the Q3 numbers first
before our CEO, Helge Leiro Baastad, spends most of the time commenting on the new
capital strategy and updated financial targets.
Then we will open up for the Q&A session afterwards. In addition to Helge and Catharina,
we have also our Chief Risk Officer here today, Jostein Amdal, and our EVP for Strategy
and M&A, Mats Gottschalk, and they are present in the room to answer your questions
afterwards.
But first, I'll leave the word then to Catharina Hellerud.

FINAL

Thank you. I will start with some brief comments to the numbers. The insurance
operations delivered strong results in the quarter. The underwriting results ended at a
solid NOK853 million, which is the best underwriting results ever for Gjensidige in that
quarter.
This is an improvement in profit performance of NOK73 million compared to the
corresponding quarter last year and, as you remember, the Third Quarter last year was a
very good quarter.
The improvement in profit performance is primarily due to fewer large losses amounting
to NOK111 million less in this quarter than in the corresponding quarter last year.
There is also slightly higher run-off gains this quarter. There is a good underlying
profitability in the portfolio, but with underlying claims' costs that are in a more normal
level compared with what we saw last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

It is particularly pleasing that the good profitability is combined with a solid increase in
earned premiums. At Group level, premiums increased by 6.5% in the quarter; 4.1% of the
premiums are measured in local currency.
The retail bank continues to improve its good profit performance. The retail bank
continues to show good volume growth which, together with reduced funding costs,
resulted in higher net interest income.
At the same time, operating expenses are under good control in a period of increased
activity, which resulted in a reduced cost ratio for the bank.
Pensions and savings also developed in a (profitable) direction in the quarter as a result of
good growth. Together, the retail bank and pensions and savings contribute a profit
before tax expense of NOK63 million in the quarter, compared with NOK28 million in the
corresponding quarter last year.
The investment portfolio yields a satisfactory return of 1.5% in the quarter, on par with the
corresponding quarter last year.
Together, this has resulted in a profit before tax expense of NOK1.7 billion for the quarter
compared to NOK1.6 billion in the Third Quarter last year.
The combined ratio for the general insurance operation was 82.5% in the quarter,
compared to 82.9% in the Third Quarter last year.
The cost ratio ended at 14.8%. This is unchanged from the corresponding quarter last
year.

Company Ticker: GJF N O Equity
Date: 2013-10-22

The loss ratio was 67.7%, which reflects what I have already commented about the good
underlying profitability level for the portfolio.

FINAL

Adjusted for fewer large losses and slightly higher run-off gain, the underlying loss ratio in
this quarter was 2.5percentage points higher than in the corresponding quarter last year
and is now within what we characterize as a normal level for a Third Quarter, where we
have very good figures and low claims frequency levels in 2012.
Some products stood out in the quarter, however. Within property, the quarter was
characterized by some large losses, especially within the western part of Norway as well
as fires. This resulted in a slightly weaker start of the quarter. This also applies to
agriculture, where we also saw a larger portion of large losses or -- sorry, of fires in the
quarter.
These are random effects that can arise from one quarter to the next. Our perception of
the long-term trends remains unchanged.
And with that, I will leave the word to Helge Leiro Baastad to comment over our new
capital strategy.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Catharina. Then I continue on page 16 and, as a start, I want to remind you that
Gjensidige's strong capitalization of today is a result of focus on operational efficiency and
reasonable priorities or allocations through the past decade.
In 2002, the equity was NOK4.7 billion, so we have had a (value taking) journey the last
ten years.
Good capital management has been high on the agenda. The listing in 2010 gave us
access to a capital market that enables us to have different capital structure, going
forward.
We are finally ready to present today a new capital strategy and an update around our
financial targets and, as you can see on slide 16, the Board has adopted four important
main elements related to this.
First and foremost, the new capital strategy and proposed extraordinary dividend; new
dividend policy; new return on equity targets; and, finally, redefinition of Storebrand, as
you maybe understood last week when we sold 4% in Storebrand.
Then moving on to page 17. Let me take this opportunity to remind you what we have
achieved since being listed on the stock exchange late in 2010. Good operations as the
result of increasingly efficient processes and good and increasing competitiveness, and
our average combined ratio of (88.5%) during this period.

Page 3 of 19



Company N ame: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF N O Equity
Date: 2013-10-22

The underwriting result increased from around NOK800 million, in the years prior to the
listing, to NOK2.2 billion in the last 12 months.

FINAL

The return on equity has been above the target of 15% before tax expense, and we have
paid total dividend to our owners of more than (NOK8 billion), corresponding to a
distribution percentage of around 80%.
The total share return in the period has been (NOK111 billion) closing yesterday.
We know our taking result in a more expedient capitalization of Gjensidige and will
strengthen the basis for further value creation in the time ahead.
Moving on to page 18, the Board proposes, as you have seen, that NOK3 billion of excess
capital should be distributed as extraordinary dividend in May 2013. Any further excess
capital over and above the capitalization target will be paid to the shareholders, over
time, in the form of extraordinary dividend.
By capitalization target, we mean capitalization that is adapted to Gjensidige's strategic
targets and appetite for risk at all times. The Group shall maintain its financial freedom of
action, but without this being at the expense of capital discipline.

Bloomberg Transcript

S&P A rating target will still be the most binding capital requirement for Gjensidige. We
will, obviously, continue to monitor the capital situation from all possible perspectives and
we will adapt accordingly if one or the other requirements becomes more binding.
The Board has decided that capital corresponding to 5% of the rating requirement shall
be retained as a technical buffer in addition to the capital that must be retained in order
to secure an A rating. This shall compensate for short-term fluctuation in the capital
situation.
(Above) that a strategic buffer shall also be retained to secure financial flexibility relating
to changed framework conditions, organic growth, and minor acquisitions that are not
financed by retaining earnings and the stabilization of ordinary dividends over time.
You have maybe seen that we also, in the Third Quarter, acquired a small company in
Sweden called Solid, or a part of Solid with motor and home insurance. So this is a good
example, in addition to Gouda which we acquired in the Second Quarter. And if you look
at what we have done the last eight years now, it's in average one acquisition every year.
It's important, in this context, to underline that Gjensidige's growth strategy, as you
understand, remains unchanged and that there will still be a lot of flexibility in Gjensidige's
balance sheet that can be utilized easily.
Some comments related to our largest owner, Gjensidige Foundation, on page 19. The
Gjensidige Foundation, our largest owner, have endorsed the proposal of the

Page 4 of 19



Company N ame: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF N O Equity
Date: 2013-10-22

extraordinary dividend. The customer dividend model continues and is strengthened after
the distribution of the dividend.

FINAL

Firstly, the Gjensidige Foundation will continue to pass on its share dividend from
investments in Gjensidige to their members, which is our general insurance customers in
Norway.
Secondly, the Board of the Gjensidige Foundation have adopted that extraordinary
dividend from Gjensidige will be managed to strengthen the value creation in Gjensidige
and contribute to increased stability in future customer dividends. This is related to the
extraordinary dividend in the Spring 2014, and also extraordinary dividends in the future.
Customer dividend model distinguishes us from our competitors and contributes to
strengthening loyalty among our customers in Norway and our attractiveness in the
market in general.
A new market research from Third Quarter this year tells us that 9 out of 10 our customers
are familiar with the customer dividend model, and as many as 3 of the 4 existing
customers say that the customer dividend is something that makes them want to continue
to be customers in Gjensidige. If only 4 out of 10 non customers are not familiar with the
model, we see an increased potential for it attracting new customers.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then to the second point on page 20, new dividend policy from the accounting year
20014.
The Board has adopted a new dividend policy that shall apply from, and including, the
2014 accounting year. The main target of the policy is that Gjensidige shall pay high and
stable ordinary dividend to its shareholders. We must accomplish that at the same time
that we operate in an industry in which major fluctuations in performance may occur. The
dividend level cannot, therefore, be entirely separated from underlying developments.
We have increased the lower dividend level to 70% of the profit after tax expense over
time, in order to support more stringent capital discipline in the time ahead.
At the same time, we have removed upper ceiling so, in other words, Gjensidige shall not
build unnecessary capital buffers. Any new excess capital that is generated will, therefore,
be distributed in the form of extraordinary dividend, going forward.
On page 21 some comments regarding the accounting year 2013. For the accounting year
2013, we propose an extraordinary dividend, as you have heard, of NOK3 billion and
NOK6 per share. In addition, there will be paid an ordinary dividend based on applicable
dividend policy.
We have previously distributed as much as 80% of the result after tax, as a consequence
of our strong capitalization. Given the proposed extraordinary dividend, it can be

Page 5 of 19



Company N ame: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF N O Equity
Date: 2013-10-22

expected that the ordinary dividend for 2013 will be lower than previous years, but within
the range of 50% to 80%.

FINAL

Once again, the calculation will be adjusted for impairment loss on Storebrand in the First
Quarter, which was NOK611 million.
Thirdly, on page 22, new return on equity targets. The Board has adopted a target for the
return on equity after tax expense of minimum 15% from, and including, 2015. The target
takes into account Gjensidige's chosen business model. As you know, we have a broader
platform in Norwegian market with our own pension and saving business and our own
bank for the private market. Secondly, still a robust capital situation and thirdly, our
ambition to secure a stable and predictable value creation.
Apart from the return on equity and dividend policy target, the other financial targets
remain unchanged, including the combined ratio target of 90% to 93% and the cost ratio
target of 15% by 2015.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, on page 23, some comments regarding our shareholding in Storebrand. As you
know, we reduced our shareholding in Storebrand to 20.11% before the weekend and
redefined our investment from strategic to financial investment.
Gjensidige's strategy is, first and foremost, being a profitable general insurance company
in the Nordic countries. Our risk appetite and willingness to invest is, first and foremost,
within our core business. In Norway, this strategy is supported by targeted distribution of
products within bank, pension and savings from our own platform. Our investment
strategy is, first and foremost, meant to support our general insurance business and shall
not be a basis for added risk exposure.
We make it clear that the client contribution and guaranteed products are not products
that we have strategic or financial appetite for. We see that the changes in the traditional
pension market will take a long time and that defined contribution will continue to
represent a large part of this market, going forward. Storebrand is no longer regarded as
a strategic investment for us. Again, with a basis of what is Gjensidige's strategy.
(We have done well) as a financial investment. We managed with focus on optimization,
value creating. Going forward, the direction is clearly communicated with the down sale on
Friday. However, we are not in a hurry.
And with that final word, we can start with questions.

FINAL

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Just a few questions regarding capital. First of all, could you maybe highlight or give us a
bit more details on the level of the strategic buffer, i.e., why did you end up at this
number?
Secondly, what made you change your view on Storebrand to change it into a financial
investment?
Then thirdly maybe, if I try and backtrack your capital buffer level, I might be a bit greedy
but, after all, you do promise a NOK3 billion extraordinary dividend but still it seems like
you're left with quite a lot of capital also as you might end up a bit lower, I understand, on
the ordinary dividend for this year. And also, I understand that you could still issue a lot of
subordinated capital within the S&P requirements. So why exactly did you end up with this
rather conservative capital buffer level still? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Jostein Amdal will start with the capital questions, and I will finalize with your question
regarding Storebrand.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Okay. I think your first and third questions need to be seen together. It's correct that there
still want to be fairly solid and robust capitalization. Gjensidige has always had this position
and we think it's value creating to have the sort of muscles that you need to have to be
direct also in a downturn. And I don't think you should be afraid that we'll end up too high
because we imposed this capital discipline on us; also true the return on equity target,
which we raised to 15% of the tax.
We're not going to disclose specifically how we arranged that -- arrived at that number or
any ranges for the strategic buffer, but it's there to be a protection, both against a
regulatory environment that might change, either the (order) regulators or the rating
agencies. And also to be a source of financing for small acquisitions that we are not able
to finance through the retained earnings every year. And thirdly, as a buffer against the
larger (volatilities in the) capital position than a technical buffer can handle.
Also for your question about the subordinated debt or otherwise, we're not going to
comment specifically on that but, again, defer to the return on equity target which we will
do what is required to reach.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Regarding Storebrand, we had commented Storebrand through several years now and
it's a long journey actually. Our first investment was back in 2006.
Page 7 of 19



Company N ame: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF N O Equity

FINAL

The situation today is completely different, compared to the situation in 2006, and
Storebrand is a different company today. They have increased their position outside
Norway when they bought SPP in 2007. It's a completely different macro situation,
different interest level and the risk of Storebrand is completely different today, compared
to what it was some years ago.
Why? Just why now? We had been waiting for more visibility related to regulation and we
see that, in EU and also in Norway, they're postponing their changed regulations. So we
wanted -- and the capital strategy are linked up to our position in Storebrand so we, in
addition to the capital strategy discussions in the company, we saw that it was necessary.
We had to reclassify, redefine, Storebrand as a clear financial investment and we did that
now during this fall together with the Board of Directors.
So today, Storebrand is a clear financial position run by (or with the) Chief Investment
Officer. So it's out from the Boardroom and out from my desk; it's into the financial Chief
Investment Officer to handle that position, going forward.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Just a small follow-up then. Is it then fair to assume that, in the strategic capital buffer,
there are still some buffer left to cover the last 20% exposure to Storebrand which will
then be reduced, over time?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No. That's not part of the reasoning.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Per Gronborg, Danske Markets.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

I'll continue a bit along the same lines, also on the strategic capital buffer. You're now
paying out an amount. The remaining part, is that basically what you need as of today for
regulatory or for S&P, plus the 5% buffer, plus your buffer capital for potential acquisitions,
or will there still be room for maneuvering within this one?
My second question, on your 15% return on equity, you're not saying it's your return on
equity -- so you're not saying it's your combined ratio target. Does this imply that by 2014
you will have divested (technical difficulty)

A - Jostein Amdal

Page 8 of 19



Company N ame: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF N O Equity
Date: 2013-10-22

FINAL

In the logic of how we built up the capital target, it's like you described. It's a buildup of
the S&P requirement, the technical buffer to handle short-term volatility, and then the
strategic buffer which, in addition to what you mention as preferred for acquisitions, it's
also for to meet regulatory uncertainty and (distributing) dividend, over time. I think that's
the answer to your question there. I lost you a bit on the last part, some connection
problems.

A - Janne Flessum

{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

Can you state the other question once again, Per? I believe you can move on, operator.

Operator
Matti Ahokas, Handelsbanken.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Two questions, if I may? Following the sale of the Storebrand stake, will there be an
impact on the S&P capital requirement or not, and what kind of impact would that
potentially be?

Bloomberg Transcript

Then just to clarify, the capital gain from Storebrand, I seem to remember, it was like
(NOK32.5 million), that was the book value, so is that the correct figure and should we be
using that in the Fourth Quarter?
And also, if I may, looking at still the dividend side, you say high and stable dividends, but
you don't say rising dividends. How should one look at this? Is that any kind of -- is that a
statement that you don't state that the dividends would preferably be rising, or how
should I interpret this statement on the dividends after 2014? Thanks.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

(Jostein) will take the first one, and I'll try the last one, Matti.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I'll do the first one on S&P effect. The capital charge effectively of an affiliated company in
the S&P model is 27% of the market value of the company and, of course, we need to
reinvest the proceeds of the sale, so the net effect will be around NOK130 million from
that disposal.
The second question regarding the book value of the shares I think Catharina should
answer.

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yes, I can give a comment to that. Of course, if you look at the portfolio of Gjensidige in
our books today, there are some elements that have been booked directly towards
equity, in prior periods.
Page 9 of 19



Company N ame: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF N O Equity
Date: 2013-10-22

And when you look at the gains and losses on transactions, going forward, and also, this
transaction, there are some elements that are reversed in the same way, and it will not
have the effect directly on the P&L.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

FINAL

So how much will the effect on the P&L then be?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

On this transaction, it's around NOK40 million.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Regarding our new dividend policy, we state high and stable, and you're asking if we're
not using the word, growing. What I would say connected to that is that, based on our
business model and our growth target, the consequence should also be growing.

Bloomberg Transcript

But bear in mind that we state clearly still growth, or profitability before growth. We
operate in a mature market, which indicates not highly growth, going forward. But based
on what we see today regarding growth, and what we expect for the future, it will be
growth in the business model. And of course, as a consequence of that, you will also see
growing dividend.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. If I just may, finally, to follow up on that? Why did you come up with this policy now,
because we've been talking about it many quarters? And at least in the summer, you
seemed to be pushing it a bit forward. What was the main reason that you were able to
clarify the capital policy so much sooner than originally anticipated?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

We had a discussion after Second Quarter, and we started to work with this. And when we
then saw the picture, we wanted to release that sooner or later, instead of waiting to
Fourth Quarter or a Capital Market Day in the spring next year. Better to celebrate
(Christmas) also when you have it behind us.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

That's great. Thanks a lot.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

FINAL

Helge, I'm sorry, I just go back on the dividend question. Sampo and Tryg, two of your key
competitors, target, clearly, an increase in dividend year after year. Sampo has been
increasing it for five years in a row now, and Tryg has started last year with this policy.
I just want to fully understand what you're saying, because the press release doesn't say
that, but you now use this word. Is it a commitment that we should look at dividend per
share growing, leaving aside extraordinary dividend, or how you see that? That's my first
question.
The second question, it's actually more operational. Your top line continues to grow pretty
nicely. Can you give me a clue of what we should expect going into 2014, what kind of
price hikes you're planning, particularly on the private lines?
And actually, also the outlook for the Nordic segment, because I continue to see, quarter
after quarter, you're taking in a lot of clients here in the Danish semi-commercial segment.
And it would be great with some more comment. Thanks.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Gianandrea. I will start up with the first question, and Catharina is preparing the
second one. Jostein will also help me out.
The commitment you can read from the statement, the dividend policy as from 2014. It's
stable and growing, and secure -- no, it's high and stable. And to secure a high and stable
dividend, we also commented that related to the strategic buffer. So that's a strong
commitment.
What I said is that, with the growth we see now and the growth we expect, going forward,
a consequence of that will also be growing dividend. But the commitment is high and
stable, and it's not (a roof ), it's 7% as a ceiling.
So we haven't looked too much actually on what If and Tryg, and the others have done;
we have actually seen what's sustainable over time for our Company.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I could fill in (a comment on that), it's related to the capital discipline or capital
optimization we're talking about. That means that if we continue to deliver the results on
the top line growth that we have done, then that will also feed through to the dividend.
And I think that's the same for If and Tryg, these results need to be produced before
they're shared with (shareholders).

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

If I'm allowed to follow up on that, it's slightly more complicated than that. Because at the
moment, let's make the assumption, just for the sake of it, that in 2014, you pay out

Page 11 of 19

Date: 2013-10-22

FINAL

whatever is remaining of excess capital, and you're in a normalized capital position. What
happens if you have one year of a couple of storms, or if capital markets drop
substantially, then obviously your P&L will be hit. And if your dividend policy, it's reflective
of your earnings power, meaning your reported earnings, then obviously your dividend will
fall pretty sharply in a situation like that. While some of your competitors are, more or less,
telling us at this point that they will do whatever they have to do to grow the dividend.
And that's a bit of a different statement, if I'm allowed to say so.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

We'll prioritize to have a solid financial position also after such an event. That is part of the
dividend policy. But given the risk management, or including the reinsurance program we
have in place, we are fairly confident that we can deliver the profit targets that we have
stated.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I think Gianandrea should have one answer.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

You had a question regarding the top line or the premium growth. We do not guide, of
course, on premium growth, going into 2014. But what we look at, and what we have
been doing now for some years, is to have price increases which are in line with what we
(see as) underlying claims inflation. And that's the same kind of thinking that we have
going into 2014 as well.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

And the underlying claims inflation, is it still a fair assumption that we're talking about 4%,
5% then for motor and housing contents, which was the case for this year?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

That's the case for this year, Gianandrea. We will, as I said, not give any specific comments
on what we're looking at for next year, at this point.

FINAL

Sir, two questions on capital, and one on the operations. Just going forward, the potential
for -- there's a slide where you mention that, going forward, you would continue to pay
excess capital above the target capitalization at extraordinary dividend.
And so, how would you guide us towards thinking about that, if I can ask? Because at the
moment, it looks like the NOK4.6 billion S&P capital excess over a buffer. Then, you've
taken out NOK3 billion, leaving you with NOK1.5 billion, roughly, and then, you obviously
pay out a large portion of your regular earnings. So I just wanted to understand how much
more upside there is on that. So that's the first question on capital.
Second question on the new ROE target, if you could please clarify again any comments
that you have made earlier in the call. Also, on what were the thoughts around leveraging
the balance sheet? Because obviously, the ROE is higher than in the past, but it's not as
high as some of the peers, also, given where the price to book ratio is. So please can you
comment on leveraging?
And lastly, just on frequency in commercial lines, which we've been hearing from your
peers. I'm just curious that you haven't mentioned something about agriculture claims in
the Third Quarter, but in the previous quarters, you've also written a bit about
municipalities and those lines which you are pruning. So if you could comment on the
operational claims frequency on the commercial side, it will be great. Thank you very
much.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Okay. You're asking the three questions. And the first one, as I understand, is a question
how to create new excess capital. Secondly, the return on equity targets. Jostein, maybe
trying on the two first ones, and we have to think of the last one. I don't think we
understood your final question 100%. It was about agricultural claims in the Third Quarter?

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

It was about commercial claims frequency in general, but I picked up the comment you
mentioned.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Okay. Then, Jostein, start off with how to create new excess capital.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

You need to go back to the way we built up capital targets. The first two items is the
capital requirements from the S&P model and the technical buffer. They are clearly fixed,
although there are things that influence the capital target, of course, depending on the
level of risk we're taking on the balance sheet.
But then, (the thoughts), to answer your question really, in the reasons behind the
strategic buffer, where we say these are related to regulatory uncertainty, to acquisitions
and the (smoothening) of the dividend. And our dividend decision regarding extraordinary

dividend will always be forward-looking. It will be based on our assumption of the future. It
will then be changed, so the different strategic buffer. I think that's --

FINAL

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Sorry, just to clarify; in a year's time, if when you've paid your NOK3 billion which you have
planned, and assuming that you are out of the 20% of Storebrand, what should be the
excess capital, then?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I won't comment on that (at this stage).

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay. All right. Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Second question, leverage. It's again the return on equity target. We will do whatever it
takes to settle that return on equity target, given the other limitations there on the capital
situation, which is focusing on a solid capital position also, going forward. I think that's
enough on that one.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

You also asked about the loss ratio or the frequency level within the commercial line. (On
a capital basis) I would comment that (over the year) as I also commented earlier, that we
have a good profitability level in our (commercial segment).
So there are no specific comments regarding frequency. We have a more normal situation
than we saw in 2013 -- 2012, sorry. But two comments. One is that the level of large losses
are on a very low level this quarter, compared to what we expect.
And of course, the commercial segment is, of course, the segment where you will expect
a large portion of the large losses. And (also), as you've said, in the agriculture segment
we saw some random effects now regarding some large fires in this quarter.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

All right. Thank you very much.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

I forgot to ask you before, I think Jostein was making the example before that if you
would have to dispose completely of the Storebrand stake, and then reinvested it in

FINAL

whatever kind of asset, it would have free up around NOK130 million of capital, if I
understood correctly.
But I'm just -- (I mean, quick and dirty), I was looking at the value of the stake right now in
the market. At NOK35 per share it's around NOK3.2 billion. If I take 27% of that, I'm
around NOK850 million, which should be the total free-up. And I guess I need to net that
off, because you're going to reinvest it in whatever kind of other asset. But how do I go
from NOK850 million to NOK130 million? it seems enormous. I'm not quite sure if I follow
that.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I'm sorry if I was unclear about that. The effect I mentioned was related to the down sale
on Friday only.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

All right. Would it be fair to assume that -- do you have appetite for having more equities
on the balance sheet? Because if not, if you just reinvest this money in either cash or
some high-rated securities, most of this NOK850 million ought to be available capital, if I
could use these words.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Back to your financial targets to deliver 50% return on equity by 2015. Your combined ratio
target is unchanged. If I look at your figures, if you make a 10% profit on your underwriting,
make 3% on your investments, make some NOK300 million on your other assets, that will
leave you slightly south of NOK4 billion, meaning it would generate 50% return on equity
that only allows for a capital base of NOK15 billion -- sorry, of NOK20 billion.
Does that math seems reasonable, or are you assuming a higher long-term investment
returns than 3%? What might I be missing in this equation?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Don't think we should comment on that.

These are financial targets that we have launched with the market. Not that we do not

(multiple speakers)

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

We are very committed on delivering on this target.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

May I rephrase my questions? Previously you had a target of generating 15% pre-tax; now
you have a target of generating 15% after tax. Your combined ratio assumption is the
same. What has changed?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

The capital base, of course, has changed, paying out the NOK3 billion in excess capital.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

We also see growth in profitability in the support activities, and we'll do whatever it takes
to deliver on the remaining part of the 15% after tax.

Q - Daniel Do-Thoi

Just three questions from my side here. Firstly, on the development in written premiums,
up 6.5% year on year in the private line. I just wanted to know if that was as a result of
strong underlying sales, or if there was any effect for acquisitions within those numbers?
Secondly, the amortization charge, at double the normal run rate; just wanted to see
where that was coming from.
Then lastly, my third question was on the match portfolio return. Just wanted to know
what the reinvestment rate was on that portfolio, and whether the higher run rate was just
the result of realizations during the quarter. Thanks.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

First question was related to growth in private, was that?

Q - Daniel Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Premium written in private. I have that at about 6.5% year-on-year growth.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

You're talking about private segment in Norway?

Q - Daniel Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Yes. The private segment, yes.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

The growth in the report, reported for the whole segment, is 6.5%. But the private
segment in Norway, it was 4.8%. So was your question related to the private segment in
Norway?

Q - Daniel Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, I'm looking at the key figures on page 28 of your report, of the premiums written,
rather than the premiums earned are just the underlying trends in the private business in
Norway, yes?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

There are no acquisitions included in those figures, no. That's (correct). It's organic growth.

Q - Daniel Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Okay. That was the question. Sorry.

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

And you also had a question regarding the amortization that were increased by around
NOK30 million this quarter. It's about a final impairment of trademarks that we had in
Denmark, which is now booked at zero. It's a one-off.
And if you look at the match portfolio, and the bonds that are (capped) at amortized
costs, the reinvestment rate, or the average reinvestment rate, during the Third Quarter
was 4.2percentage.

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Just a follow-up question on one of the ones asked earlier. In terms of keeping the
combined ratio targets the same, and increasing the return on equity target, and
deployment of capital and returning it to shareholders, how does that factor into your
decision, in terms of redistributing excess capital to shareholders?
Then just a quick second question on the corporate center reinsurance line. It turned
positive in this quarter, and I was just wondering what was driving that. Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

(I'll) take the first part of the question, and the dividend, or the returning of the money to
shareholders is based on the capital target, and the dividend policy that I have stated.
So it's not that the return on equity (goes down) the dividend policy as such, it will be the
dividend policy as we have stated. But the effect will be that a high dividend will increase
the return on equity, going forward. I guess that's (it on that).

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

If you look at the corporate center and the reinsurance, you know that we are a seller of
reinsurance through the Norwegian Pari Mutuel; that's a part of Gjensidige's distribution
model, and we are also a seller of reinsurances through the Norwegian (Pari approved).
And the net effect this quarter was profit, and that's also, of course, due to very large
losses, and no large losses hitting the corporate center this quarter. So there are no large
losses that were affecting the results in the corporate center.

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.
