Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. And then
we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions today are several
members of our management team.

FINAL

And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.

Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Good morning.
We had a really good start to the year highlighted by excellent premium revenue growth
globally, powered by our commercial businesses, double-digit commercial P&C rate
increases, and expanding underwriting margins leading the record ex-CAT underwriting
results and simply world-class margins. It was an active quarter for natural catastrophes,
due primarily to the winter storm losses in Texas. So even with that, we produced a really
good calendar year combined ratio, which speaks to our improved risk adjusted
underwriting returns.

Bloomberg Transcript

The published P&C combined ratio was 91.8% and included catastrophe losses of 9.1
percentage points compared with 3.3% last year. The current accident year combined
without CATs was 85.2% compared to 87.5% prior year. The 2.3 percentage point
improvement was made up of a point of loss ratio with the balance related to the
expense ratio.
Adjusted net investment income in the quarter was $930 million, up about 1.5% and that
excludes private equity gains which most other companies include. On that basis,
investment income grew 50%. In some core operating income in the quarter of $2.52 per
share was down $40 million from prior year to $1.1 billion, while net income of $2.3 billion
was up significantly over prior year's $252 million. Phil will have more to say about the
expense ratio, CAT, prior period development, investment income and book value.
Turning to growth and the rate environment. P&C premiums were up 9.7% globally with
commercial premiums up 15.6%, and consumer lines down 2.5%. Foreign exchange had a
positive impact on growth of 1.6 points. The consumer lines result included negative
growth in global A&H, flat revenue, and international personal lines and about 2.5%
underlying growth in North America personal lines. We continue to experience a very
strong commercial P&C pricing environment globally. And based on what we see today,
I'm confident these conditions will endure.
Chubb was built at all aspects over years to capitalize on these conditions. In North
America, commercial P&C premiums grew almost 15%. New business was up 21.7% and
renewal retentions remained strong at 95% on a premium basis.
In North America, major accounts and specialty business, net premiums written grew
about 17.5% or about 15% excluding year-over-year impact of large structured
transactions. Our middle market and small commercial business grew over 11%. Overall
Page 2 of 19

Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2021-04-28

rate increases in North America commercial were up by 14.5%, while loss costs are
trending up about 5.5%, though it varies up or down depending upon line of business.

FINAL

Let me give you a better sense of the rate environment. In major accounts, risk
management related primary casualty rates were up almost 8%, general casualty rates
were up 34.5%, and varied by category of casualty. Property rates were up nearly 20%,
and financial lines rates were up almost 21%.
In our E&S wholesale business, property was up 15.5%, casualty and financial lines rates
were up 25%, and our middle market business rates for property were up 16%, casualty
was up 12%, excluding comp with comp up 1%, and financial lines rates were up 18.5%.
In our international General Insurance operations, commercial premiums grew over 20%
on a published basis or 15% in constant dollar. International retail commercial grew about
17.5%, and our London wholesale business grew 38.5%. Retail commercial growth varied
by region, with premiums up over 26.5% in Asia/Pac, 22.5% in Europe, with equally strong
growth in both the U.K. and on the continent. Our Latin America commercial lines business
returned to growth in the quarter, with premiums up 4.7%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Internationally, like in the U.S., in those markets where we grew we continued to achieve
improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. And overseas gen, rates
were up about 14.5% with a loss cost trend of 3%, though that varies by class of business
and country. Rates were up 14% in our international retail business, and 20% in our London
wholesale business.
Keep in mind, these outstanding commercial insurance growth rates in the U.S. and
overseas were achieved in spite of the headwinds we faced from negative exposure
growth due to reduced business activity. On the other hand, consumer lines growth
globally in the quarter continued to be impacted by the pandemics effects on consumerrelated activities.
During the quarter, there were signs of recovery beginning, breaking consumer down
between A&H and personal lines. Our international personal lines business produced
modest growth of 1.2% on a published basis, fundamentally flat, constant dollar. While our
international A&H business shrank 3.7%.
Travel globally, both business and consumer-related remains depressed and that hits A&H
hard. While our direct marketing and group employee benefits A&H business is beginning
to pick up modestly. If we exclude the travel business, our international A&H business
grew almost 2% on a published basis.
We expect growth to continue to improve as the year goes along, though predicting the
continued impact of the pandemic in Asia, Latin America and Europe is difficult. Net
premiums in our North America high net worth personal lines business were up about
2.5%, excluding reinsurance reinstatements, auto renewal credits in California, and wildfire
exposure-related cancellations.

FINAL

As I have said before, this outstanding franchise is about customers who choose Chubb
for the service and richness of coverage and we're willing to pay for them. These client
segments, which are at the heart of what we do, grew 8% in the quarter. Overall portfolio
retention remains strong in high net worth at over 94% and we achieved positive pricing,
which includes rate and exposure of 11% in our homeowner's portfolio.
Looking ahead, we have been and are taking continued action to shape this portfolio. To
that point, we're taking ongoing action to reduce our wildfire exposure in parts of
California as a consequence of our inability to achieve adequate rate and terms for the
coverage. This will have an impact for the remainder of the year of about $50 million or
about 1.25% impact on our growth rate.
Lastly, in our Asia-focused international life insurance business, net premiums plus
deposits were up over 18.5% in the quarter. In sum, as I have said the past few quarters or
longer, we are in a harder-firming market for commercial P&C in most of the world. The
rate environment in my judgment is irrational and necessary to response to years of
industry underpricing, and a more uncertain risk environment today driven by climate
change, the litigation environment and cyber-related exposures.

Bloomberg Transcript

Given our years of data and analytics capabilities and underwriting know-how, we know
what rate we need in order to achieve an adequate risk-adjusted rate of return from
underwriting, and that is the objective. And it is a relentless focus. Though we're never
perfect, some lines are there other have a way to go. Virtually all of our commercial P&C
lines of business continue to achieve rates that exceed loss cost, and so margins continue
to improve.
As you can see, we're off to an outstanding start to the year. My colleagues and I are
confident in our ability to grow our business and continue to expand margins. And as I
said, I expect that as the year progresses, our sizeable consumer business will return to
growth. Our organization is focused. It's mission-driven. The quality of Chubb's service
and consistency is a widely recognized differentiator. They are the well head of our
reputation. We are leaning into the current favorable underwriting conditions and
capitalizing wherever we can get paid adequately to assume risk and volatility. We are
growing exposure. Our people are energized and focused. And we have all of the
capabilities in place to grow our company profitably, while increasing shareholder value.
In light of recent events concerning the Hartford and for the sake of absolute clarity, I want
to reiterate once again, our enduring views concerning M&A and capital management. We
look at lots of deals every year, different sizes, small to large, different geographies and
product areas.
And we pull the trigger infrequently. We have lots of optionality. We have made 17
acquisitions over the past 15 years, and have an excellent track record of advancing the
company's capabilities, while creating shareholder value. Our approach is steady and
consistent. We are extremely patient, disciplined, and the money is not burning a hole in
our pocket.

FINAL

If we believe a transaction will advance our strategy and further what we are building
organically and is good for shareholders, we won't hesitate to pull the trigger. As regards
surplus capital, we're again very consistent. We hold capital for risk and growth, both
organic and non-organic, beyond that we return surplus capital to shareholders.
We are highly confident about our future and wealth creation prospects, and we approach
the Hartford from that position of strength. This was another opportunity to create
additional value and would not distract us from capitalizing our organic growth opportunity.
With that said, the purpose of today's call is to discuss our first quarter financials and our
company's business. I'll now turn the call over to Phil, and then we're going to come back
and take your questions.

Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Thank you, Evan.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our financial position remains exceptionally strong. Our balance sheet includes a $121
billion AA-rated portfolio of cash and invested assets. We have over $74 billion in capital,
stemming from our superior operating and investing performance. Our operating cash
flow remains very strong and was $2.1 billion for the quarter. Among the capital-related
actions in the quarter, we returned $871 million to shareholders, including $352 million in
dividends and $519 million in share repurchases.
Adjusted pretax investment income for the quarter of $930 million was higher than our
estimated range, and benefited from increased corporate bond call activities. While there
are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, we expect our
quarterly run rate to be approximately $900 million. Our annualized core operating ROE
and core operating return on tangible equity were 8.2% and 12.8%, respectively for the
quarter.
Separately, as Evan mentioned, we continue to present the fair value mark on our private
equity funds outside of core operating income as realized gains and losses instead of net
investment income as other companies do. The gain from the fair value mark this quarter
would have added 3.1 percentage points to core operating ROE.
Book and tangible book value per share decreased by 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively, for
the quarter due to unrealized losses of $1.9 billion after-tax in our investment portfolio
from rising interest rates. This loss was tempered by adjusted realized gains of $1.2 billion
after tax, mainly from the mark-to-market gains in private and public equities and in our
variable annuity reinsurance portfolio.
At March 31, our investment portfolio remains in an unrealized gain position of $2.8 billion
after tax. Our pretax P&C net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $700 million from
severe weather-related events globally, including $657 million of losses from the storms in
the U.S. We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $192 million pretax

FINAL

or $156 million aftertax. The favorable development is worth approximately 20% in long
tail lines, principally from accident year 2017 and prior and 80% in short tail lines.
So there was no change to the previously reported aggregate P&C COVID-19 losses, the
majority of which remain as incurred, but not reported. For the quarter, our net loss
reserves increased $1.1 billion, and our paid-to-incurred ratio was 77%. The P&C
administrative expense ratio of 8.6% in the quarter, improved by 70 basis points over the
prior year, about half related to onetime items that we don't expect to repeat. Our core
operating effective tax rate was 15.5% for the quarter, which is within our expected range
of 15% to 17% for the year.
I'll turn the call back over to Karen.

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. And congrats on the nice quarter, again Evan, appreciate it the
time hear. I guess I want to focus first on -- you sound still very bullish on commercialize
and exposure growth that you want to push for. You said last quarter, commercial line size
lags, this quarter you're confident that conditions will continue or endure. I guess with your
numbers that you gave on pricing and loss trends, there's still quite a bit of a gap there.
That's good. A little bit narrow than what you said prior.
But I guess, two-part question is, how adequate are current rates across the Board? It's
hard to imagine they're not. And then I guess, and -- say, you want to push for exposure
growth still. So is commercial lines still the place to push given what might be a narrowing
gap in the rate versus loss trend?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

It's funny how people think about rate right now. And this obsession with our rate
increases, decelerating the rate of increased decelerating, accelerating? Where is it?
What are you trying to achieve? You're trying to achieve a risk-adjusted return, which
translates to a combined ratio that is at least adequate to return a good risk-adjusted
return. So let's call that 15%, or it depends on the line of business, let's call it 15%.
And as you approach that, as you achieve it, do you need to keep increasing rates? So
you ask yourself that question. And you need rates to remain there, you got to achieve at

Page 6 of 19

FINAL

least loss cost. We're achieving. We have more and more of our portfolio and its
proprietary, so I will not go into what percentages of the portfolio are at a proper riskadjusted return in terms of combined ratios on a policy year and accident year basis, and
we measure both of them. And with that, in total, look at the overall level of rate increase
and look at the margin between the rate and exposure -- and loss cost.
Now with that, let me go a step further for you because of this obsession about this.
When I look at the third and fourth quarter last year, and I measure the first quarter
against it right now. And I'm taking the time on this question because I know all of your
colleagues or most of them have this question on their minds.
When I look at the level of rate increase, this quarter measured against prior. Okay.
Property in North America in aggregate, got rate increases in the mid-teens which is about
2 to 3 points lower than it was in -- when I look at the average of the third and fourth
quarter last year. Property has been getting rate on, rate on, rate on rate. When I look at
primary casualty, the rates are up, they're higher than they were on the average.

Bloomberg Transcript

When I look at excess and umbrella, the rate of increase is flat with the average of the
quarters. When I look at financial lines, the rate of increase is flat with prior quarters. When
I look at marine, it's up. When I look at aviation, it's flat to down. When I do this
internationally, kind of the same trend, property down 2 to 3 points, but the rate of
increase from what it was the other 2 quarters. Primary casualty is flat. Excess and
umbrella, the rate of increase is flat. Financial lines, is up. And marine is down. So, no sorry
marine is up, and aviation is down a little bit.
So you know what, I think that gives you guys as much color as I can give you and to
answer that question that -- from every angle I can that I know is on everyone's mind. You
know what, the conditions are excellent. Thank you very much for the question, Mike.

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. That's helpful. Conditions are excellent. So that leads to this one. Frankly,
I'm not even quite sure how to ask it, Evan, but I'm curious to hear what you can say. Not
even asking about Hartford, but specifically at all. But just in general, I mean, clearly, there
was some capital to be deployed there. And as you said, we're not going to hold in our
pocket, you're very infrequent, you pose very infrequently.
If something like that size is off the table and in the conditions are still pretty right. I guess,
how should we think about where to go from here for maybe another capital deployment
round of authorization versus more organic or just kind of what can we expect for what
was possible to be used there and, how it might be used in the near term?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

What you can imagine, Michael, is steady as she goes. We have clear minds, and we're at
rest. We adopted our buybacks from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, and we will -- we will
actively resume that. We had to take a pause during the -- this episode with Hartford and

Page 7 of 19



Company N ame: Chubb L td

beyond that, steady as she goes. We got capital for risk and opportunity, and we are
patient people.

I don't know what they're talking about. I don't know --

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

FINAL

Greg, they're just rumors.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

So one of the areas that you've spent time in previous calls talking about is the expense
ratio because it has -- it showed improvement last year because of, in part, some COVIDrelated T&E savings and things like that. And then it still seems like it's on a general
pathway of improvement. So I was wondering perhaps if you can give us an updated view.
When we look at these other companies that we follow, most of them try and map out of
between a 40 to 70 basis point operational improvement in their expense ratio year-in,
year out. I'm wondering if you can just give us an updated view on your expense ratio.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Most of them are bloated. Look at our -- look at our expense ratio in absolute terms
versus others, our operating expense ratio. And North America is in the single-digits, and
continuing to head marginally lower. And it will, through efficiencies, which I have talked
about numerous times that with technology and in all forms. So I won't go into it in great
detail but analytics, robotics, straight-through processing, et cetera. We are on track to
continue to drive efficiencies in the operations.
And the same in overseas general, the difference there is, you're across 50-some-odd
countries. And so, by its nature, you have a different expense structure, and it continues
to improve. So we're growing our P&C business, the commercial businesses, at a rate far
in excess of growing operating expense, operating expenses up marginally, so we're
leveraging against that. Both exposure and policy count is up, but you also got the added
benefit, which drives the ratio down of simply price increase that feeds in there also.
It runs a lower acquisition cost then does the consumer lines business, but it runs a higher
loss ratio. That's just axiomatic and true, but that business will continue to operate in the
range that it's in that you see right now, up or down a couple of tenths of a percent in my
mind as we look forward.
The consumer businesses will come back. And as they come back, they have a higher
acquisition cost, the operating expense, so the internal expense ratio will go down
because you will have more volume returning against it.
But the acquisition ratio, which will remain steady within the line, it will become a greater
mix of our total. And so that will go the other way. It's just natural. And -- but that business
then runs a lower loss ratio. The margins are excellent, as you know. So maybe that gives
you the color you're looking for.

Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2021-04-28

Indeed. Thanks. And my follow-up question, yes -- boy, so many different areas I could go
in, but I'm going to focus on operations. You said in your prepared remarks that loss cost
trend was running around just above five points across the book. And then during your
comments and in your response to the previous question, you talked about really some -really robust rate actions being taken across certain lines of business, like general
casualty, financial lines, things like that. Should I think about the loss cost trend in those
lines is running higher because of the rate you're able to achieve? Or is that just an
industry loss cost trend that you're able to get the rate you're getting?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Let's see if I answer it this way for you. The marketplace in terms of rate is striving the
marketplace, because you operate within the marketplace. Is striving for two things; and
that is, you have those who have a hole to fill, because they have deficiency in lines of
business. Remember, the industry operates like a giant or retro.
And then they also need rate for adequacy today. That's the marketplace. If you have
operated at adequacy along the way, you don't have that first part, that hole to fill; and
achieving market rate, you're achieving better than adequate. And that benefits you. We'll
see -- we're in a -- we're certainly in an active loss cost period when you remove the
transient impact of COVID. And so, we'll see how it all plays in terms of margin. We play
things conservatively.

Bloomberg Transcript

But we are receiving rate that ensures the portfolio will achieve adequacy in terms of riskadjusted rate of return across the book. And if we have more than that, well that will just
speak for itself over time.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Got it. Thanks for the answers.

We'll go next to David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. Good morning. Evan, I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the loss cost trend
in North America commercial. It sounds like that's ticked up a bit to 5.5, sounds like it's
been ticking up. I guess it's obviously a minor detail given the amount of rate that you're
getting and continuing to earn in above trend. But wondering if you could just talk about
what you're seeing that's driving that increase? I know there's a lot of moving pieces, mix
Page 10 of 19



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2021-04-28

and everything else. But just sort of wondering if maybe you can just elaborate on what
was driving the increase in the loss trend?

FINAL

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes. And my God, you're looking at about 0.5 point change. So let's just keep it in
perspective. You have a couple of things. So in the short-tail lines, you have non-modeled
cat loss that is on an accelerated trend. Everyone sees it. You know that. I'll move on from
there. But that finds its way into -- if you're prudent, in your expected loss cost.
Secondly on the casualty side, given the litigation environment and across different lines
of business, you know we have watched and have talked about it endlessly that it is -- the
loss cost environment there is not benign; and so, as we always relentlessly study our
trends across each class, we reflect it over a period of time in how we view loss cost, and
we react very quickly, particularly if there's any bad news. We react very slowly to good
news. And so it's those two that are -- conspire between short and long-tail.

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Got it. That's helpful. Was there anything in the quarter or, I guess, some of the courts
started to reopen. Was there anything specifically on the litigation environment that you
saw during the quarter? Or it's just more a reflection --?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No. Not. David, no news in a quarter. We just do study that we look at -- we're looking at
years past, and trending forward. When you think about these things, they don't -- you
don't react to -- loss cost trends aren't based upon news of this or that in any given
quarter. They're based on a more stable period of time and a much bigger data set,
obviously.

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Yes. Got it. That makes sense. Thanks for that. And then I wanted to switch gears a little
bit to the international life business, another good quarter, strong sales there, up 14%
constant currency. I was hoping maybe you could dive into the different regions between
Asia and LatAm, and what's driving success there in each region. And maybe just stepping
back a bit, just talk about the opportunity here. And if you think M&A is a lever that you're
evaluating to maybe increase scale in any of these markets.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

So, great question. The business is overwhelmingly Asia. Latin America, think
predominantly Chile, and Banco de Chile and our partnership with them. And Chile is a
great market, but Chile has truly been suffering from COVID, and the lockdowns. And
while it's a very good business, it has some headwind in terms of growth related to that.
But it's coming back and that'll continue to do very well. It's bank distribution, both branch
and direct marketing related. It's more credit-related-type products and short-term than it
is long-term product, though there is a mix of that in the portfolio.

When you go to Asia, the growth is coming predominantly, right now and in this quarter,
Vietnam, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, doing well. And our business in Korea, getting
better, but it's small, and it will take a while to cash shot up. What's not consolidated in
those numbers, but we -- that we add as a line item because we don't have over 50% yet
is the increase in LatAm [ph], which is doing well. And by the way, we are on our path. And
it's at a very sensitive moment, so I don't want to talk about it much, but that will
consolidate. I'm confident we'll finish what we got to get done to be able to consolidate
one time. And that life business is growing well.
So the organic growth -- and those are agency-based businesses for the most part, with
some direct marketing as well, particularly in Thailand and bank distribution in Taiwan. But
if you look at Vietnam, Thailand, Hong Kong, China, and those are predominantly -- those
are agency businesses, where our agency force is growing. These are long-term
products; guarantees are extremely low, like in the 1% to 2% range. And there's a healthy
mix of savings and protection product. And that business is -- we built it from dust
predominantly. And it's cast in a shadow. It's a few billion dollars now. And I see great
growth potential for that.

As regards M&A, I made the statement when I came to the end of my commentary, I said
we have lots of optionality. We have optionality when we're looking at opportunity. What
that means is across product lines, across geographies, across customer segments, and
that includes the life insurance business. And if we found the right thing and it was
accretive to our strategy and was good for shareholders, we wouldn't hesitate for a
minute. Thanks for the question.

We'll go next to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi thanks. Good morning. My first question is tying together some of the comments we've
heard throughout the call. Just in terms of market conditions, Evan, you still seem pretty
positive there. And then as we think about the rest of this year, right, we'll have -- the
economy continues to improve, so exposure growth should pick up. So, as we think about
your commercial businesses, both within the U.S. and internationally, given the dynamics of
maybe some stabilization to slight deceleration in pricing, but --

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

So, what's the question, Elyse?

I guess the question is, I'm trying to understand, should we think about -- as we think
about premium growth within commercial, should we think about that being stable relative
to the Q1 and perhaps even improving as we get the economic improvement picking up
from here?

FINAL

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I don't -- there's nothing on the horizon that I see that tells me we're going to really
decelerate in the commercial area. It varies by business as we look at it. But we're feeling
very good about it.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. Then my second question, Evan, as I was reading on your annual
letter, you made mention of social inflation. I know throughout the call, we've kind of
brought it up in terms of just what we're seeing today. But there's obviously issues that
the industry is dealing with it. It goes back to many, many decades. And I was just hoping
to kind of get your updated view, kind of elaborate on some of the -- what you mentioned
in your annual report, if you guys think of about some of, kind of, the looming issues that
the industry, yourselves and others are dealing with today?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes. It's not a new issue to us. We've been on top of it for a while. The reviver statutes,
they produced lots of notices. They then start to ripen, and you get facts, and you're able
to match them up against coverage's that were in force at a period of time. And as they
do, we recognize any live we have been and continue to recognize liabilities that we have
against those. And that is all baked into our published loss ratios that you see.
The reviver statutes have been open for a period of time. And so, in most all jurisdictions,
the reported notices of circumstances have decelerated tremendously from when they
first open up. There are some states that are continuing to consider opening up reviver
statutes and theirs. And so this is an event that the industry deals with over time. These
things evolve over time.
I might add, we're very sympathetic to those and it breaks your heart where you see the
circumstances of children abused by adults sexually, and where they're for real. And then
on the other side of the coin, the trial bar is a money-making machine. And there is -- that,
combined with new technologies of social media, and litigation funding, they see it as
another dog bowl to eat out of. And there is also a lot of suspect and specious behavior
that is involved here. And our job is to tease out what's real and defend against anything
that we suspect is just for ill-gotten gains.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

We'll next go to Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. So I'm a bit obsessive in my nature. So I hope you can indulge
another question on rates.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Only if it's not asking me to be redundant, Yaron. Don't ask me to do that.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

I'll try.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Ask me something new.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

I'll try. So you expect market conditions to hinder. I think that we are seeing more lines
achieving rate adequacy. As you pointed out, we're in 30-year rate increases in excess of
trends. Interest rates have increased. So why wouldn't Chubb specifically or the industry
more broadly, be willing to give up more rate for volume as we look at the year ahead?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

That doesn't make any sense to me at this point. Look at combined ratios of most -- look
at the loss environment and I'll tell you what I think the industry overall is not in a place
where it has achieved adequate risk-adjusted when you consider both things I talked
about.
And by the way, we are driving. I can't speak about the industry, but I'll tell you what,
Chubb is -- just look at it. Chubb is growing exposure. We're achieving rate and we are

growing a lot of business because it's at prices that we think are adequate to produce an
adequate risk-adjusted return. Our new business was up over 20%, well; and our renewal
retentions are high. We're growing. We're growing market share because the pricing is
right. You're in a risk business. Pricing is an adequacy is where you start. That's as good as
I can give you on. Beyond that, you're overthinking it.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

That's very helpful. And clearly, you guys are growing off of a very large base to begin
with. So -- yes, no other questions on that front. I guess switching gears a little bit. We've
heard some talk about potential tax reform. I realize these are very early days here. But
can you maybe share your views on corporate tax reform, its potential impact on Chubb
and Chubb's positioning?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

You know what, I don't know enough. And we have both the corporate tax rate that could
go up. They're talking 21% going to 25% or 28%. We'll see how that plays. And then
secondly, you've got guilty and be. And then you've got the notion of a minimum global
tax rate, multilateral agreement with OECD. All of these plates are spinning. The green
book is not yet out that would tell us any detail of what's in the tax reform or the tax
increase. Heck, it's not a reform proposal. And so we don't even know what the
administration is yet proposing other than in headlines. And so we really can't speculate at
this point. We just don't know. And when it comes out, we'll have a better sense. And then
it's got to run the gauntlet in Congress. And we'll see from there. So, I can't speculate at
this point, yet.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Fair enough. I appreciate the thoughts.

We'll go next to Brian Meredith with UBS.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks. A couple of them here quickly for you, Evan. The first one, if I look at the rate
activity that you've been generating in the last several quarters in North America,
commercial. And then the 5.5% loss cost inflation. You do the math and you get a lot more
underlying loss ratio in your booking right now. Is that because of your just conservatism
with respect to potential social inflation trends? Or is there something else that we're just
not thinking about?

Brian, I don't know what you're thinking about. I don't know what you guys are thinking
about, but we have always operated the company conservatively, and I'm not going to -I'm going to stop right there.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. And then second question, I'm just curious if --

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I will say this to you. Let's see. We produced over 2 points of margin improvement. It was
accident year combined ratio of 85.2%. My god, world-class.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

No doubt. I completely agree. The second one, just sticking with North America
commercial, written premium -- net written premium growth, really attractive in the
quarter. Gross written premium growth also kind of increased. But clearly, you're seeing
some benefits from just lower ceded premium. Any change in kind of the reinsurance
strategy as we head into 2021?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, not a change of strategy. Not a change of strategy. It varies by line of business.
There's mix within there. And then, there is also within some lines of business, we have
increased our net appetite.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. Make sense. Thank you.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

The more exposure, we have better spread of risk.

We'll go next to Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey, thanks. Good morning. My question was just on sort of a language from the
statement that you guys put out last week, just looking for some clarification. There's a
Page 16 of 19



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2021-04-28

comment where you said -- and this is involving the Hartford. The path to your transaction
would have been engagement coming from the Hartford on the terms of our last
proposal. I guess my question is, is that just a general comment about your desire to do
friendly M&A? Or are you trying to say something about that being your last proposal?

FINAL

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Look, the chapter with the Hartford is closed. We have moved along. And beyond that,
Ryan, I'm not going to now engage and talk about past events.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Understood. That's it. But I -- in terms of like thinking about M&A now, I guess, it's been
five years since job. Back then, I think the big gating item was you didn't want to dilute
tangible book value per share. I'm just trying to understand, as you think about M&A
targets, has any of your thinking evolved in terms of what's most important financially? Is it
earnings accretion? Is it still mainly accretion or dilution to tangible book value per share?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

First of all, Ryan, with all due respect, your comment about tangible book is a nonsense
comment. It was dilutive to begin with to tangible and then it powered its way out of it.

A - Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Almost 29%.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

And so I don't know what -- how you're thinking about it, it's hard to do M&A that isn't
dilutive to tangible. And then the question is, in the first moment, and then the question is
how accretive is it, and how quickly do you return? So, with all due respect, I don't think
you're thinking clearly.
Number two, let me make one -- I'm not going to go into Chubb's metrics of what's most
important. That's not important here. And by the way, every deal has its own signature.
And so, you wanted to fit on a bumper sticker and it doesn't work that way.
But I'm going to make one comment about M&A, today. EPS accretion, when you use a lot
of cash, is a midget lift. That's really easy. And I don't miss that one, whatsoever. None of
us do. So that's the easiest metric. That's not what it's about when you measure wealth
creation value. Thank you very much for the question.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. Two really quick ones, I think. One, Evan, should we infer anything significant about
reinsurance pricing from the fact that gross written premiums were down year-over-year?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

No.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Second question, I was hoping you could comment on non-travel actions and help
pricing.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

On accident and health pricing?

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Yes, please.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Non travel. Yes. Meyer, it's -- remember, we don't do a lot of health insurance. It's
supplemental health and accident business. So, it's fundamentally stable and actually up a
few points. Rates have been moving up, particularly in the corporate travel area, the
commercial business. And in our direct marketing business, it's very steady.
