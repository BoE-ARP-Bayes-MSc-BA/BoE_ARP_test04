Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday evening we
announced third-quarter net operating income of CAD1.61 per share, an increase of 59%
on the back of stronger underwriting results. Our top line was up 1% driven by personal
property and specialty lines. Growth in personal auto and commercial P&C was tempered
by our rate actions taken ahead of the market.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the combined ratio 91.8% is a good overall result for the third quarter. While we
beneﬁted from lower catastrophes underlying performance in personal property and
commercial P&C, it is very strong and improving. We also continued to see beneﬁts from
rigorous expense management. On the other hand, personal auto remains a drag on
performance, and I'll come back to these results in a moment.
We also closed in the quarter the OneBeacon acquisition, putting in place a strong
platform for long-term North American growth. And following the closing of OneBeacon,
we ended the quarter in a strong ﬁnancial position, with MCT above 200%.
Our operating ROE improved to 13.3% for the last 12 months and our book value per
share is up 12%. When comparing ourselves to the industry at the end of the second
quarter, we outperformed on ROE by 550 basis points. We expect to increase that
advantage in the coming months.
So, let's look in more detail at our results by line of business.
Personal auto growth was muted in the quarter, as our rate actions, taken ahead of the
market, are resulting in some top-line pressure, as we expected. Despite our rate and
other actions, the combined ratio was disappointing. Prior-year claims development was
unfavorable by 3.2 points, reﬂecting a couple of actions this quarter.
Firstly, in response to pre-reform trends observed earlier in the year on long-tail claims,
we performed a detailed ﬁle-by-ﬁle review and increased reserves. We followed this with
an actuarial review of the auto portfolio and took a more cautious stance, leading to
additional net reserve strengthening. With these reviews now complete, we're in a much
better position going forward.

FINAL

The underlying auto performance deteriorated 2.2 points year over year, mostly
attributable to pools and the impact of the net reserve change we recorded. Overall, our
view is that the auto combined ratio run rate is currently in the upper 90%s. This is higher
than we expected, given the actions taken so far, and certainly not an acceptable level of
proﬁtability.
While we've largely eliminated inﬂation so far this year in this segment, we expected a
reduction in severity. It has not materialized as physical damage costs have risen more
than anticipated. To address this, we're increasing our actions. We plan to take further rate
increases across the country and to add to our claims management and segmentation
initiatives. With the plans already in place, the further actions to come, and strengthened
reserve levels, we're strongly committed to bring personal auto combined ratio back to
the mid-90%s in the coming year.
When it comes to the industry outlook, we've seen rate increases now in many markets
this year. We also see expansion of the industry risk-sharing pool and our non-standard
auto business is growing. These factors point to a ﬁrming market condition across the
country, and so we expect mid-single-digit growth for the industry in the coming 12
months.

Bloomberg Transcript

In personal property, premiums grew 4% as rate increases were deployed in favorable
market conditions. The combined ratio of 85% reﬂects excellent underlying performance,
which positions this line very well going forward. With a combined ratio of 92.4% year-todate in personal property and an average sub-90% for the three years prior, we believe
this line of business is priced to take into account the ongoing levels of natural disasters.
The industry outlook for personal prop remains unchanged. Elevated catastrophe losses
year-to-date support continued ﬁrm market conditions with mid-single-digit growth
expected over the next 12 months as the industry continues adjusting changing weather
patterns.
Looking at commercial P&C, on top line we see rate increases ﬂowing through in select
segments, while conditions overall remain competitive. This line of business continues to
produce excellent results. Excluding the unusually-high favorable prior-year development
from diversiﬁcation, this business delivered an impressive combined ratio just over 80%.
Our pricing and segmentation actions are paying oﬀ nicely and this line, too, is wellpositioned moving forward.
In commercial auto, premiums grew 5% on the back of multiple initiatives, in specialty
lines in particular. The combined ratio for the quarter was very strong at 86.8%. We
continue to drive our proﬁtability actions to deliver a sustainable 90% combined ratio in
this line of business.
In terms of outlook for commercial lines in Canada, we expect low single-digit growth in
the coming year as markets remain fairly competitive across the country.

FINAL

Turning to our recent strategic expansion, we closed the acquisition of OneBeacon on
September 28, few months after announcing it, combining the strength of our specialty
teams in Canada as well as in the US to create a leading North American specialty lines
insurer. Under leadership of Mike Miller actions are well underway to grow the business
and leverage the stability of IFC's ownership and expertise that will be provided to
OneBeacon and its distribution partners.
New growth pipelines are now open with underwriting desks on each side of the border
supporting customers with businesses in both countries. We're leveraging the
OneBeacon industry-leading expertise by introducing new specialty products in Canada
as well. We recently launched an entertainment product and technology products will
follow in the coming weeks.
Our OneBeacon proﬁtability improvement plan is also in progress. The company has
exited both programs, as well as architects and engineers lines of business. We're also
using Intact's analytics and segmentation to take underwriting actions in select other lines.
Our proven claims practices are also gradually being deployed in the US.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then additional synergies are being realized and risk mitigation is in place, both of which
we will describe in a moment. We are increasingly conﬁdent that our plans will bring the
US combined ratio to a low 90%s level within 24 to 36 months to deliver mid-single-digit
run rate accretion to net operating income per share by the end of 2019. This is before the
growth upside we now see from being able to serve new customers across borders and
export our products North and South.
Early observations on US market conditions following closing are better than anticipated.
We remain focused on Canada, though, where we continue to accelerate our customerdriven strategy. Leveraging our growing digital talent pool, belairdirect launched its
mobile app, while Intact expanded its telematics oﬀer via mobile. We completed the
rollout of our online client center from coast to coast, simplifying our customers' lives
while gaining eﬃciencies.
We also began the roll out of our next generation of advanced pricing tools with the
launch of our ﬁrst machine-learning rating algorithm for automobile.
In conclusion I'm pleased with the underlying performance and continued momentum in
personal property and commercial line. In personal auto, the reserving actions we've
taken position us well, while proﬁtability initiatives will improve our results in the coming
year. We're already rolling with OneBeacon, which opens up signiﬁcant growth pipeline
for our business.
Our ﬁnancial position is strong and momentum is good as we execute with a customerfocused mindset. I'm conﬁdent we have the strategies in place to deliver on our ﬁnancial
objectives to outperform the industry ROE by at least 500 basis points, then grow our net
operating income per share by 10% per year over time.

Before I ﬁnish, I want to take a moment to recognize our people. From coast to coast, our
folks are engaged and work tirelessly to improve our performance, widen our advantage,
and expand our leadership, and I want to thank them as they really make a diﬀerence.

FINAL

And with that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Marcotte.

Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles. Good morning, everyone.
Third-quarter net operating income of CAD219 million was CAD82 million better than last
year. Our results were driven by lower cat losses and strong underlying performances in
personal property and commercial lines, but disappointing results in personal auto.
Earnings per share grew 37% to CAD1.25, driving operating ROE to 13.3%. Our book value
per share increased 12% year over year and 10% since Q2.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our ﬁnancial position continues to be strong. We closed the quarter having completed
the OneBeacon acquisition with an MCT above 200% and approximately CAD1.2 billion in
total capital margin, a new metric we use as a measure of our consolidated capital
strength. Debt to capital was just below 25%, exactly where we were aiming at
announcement. We still expect to bring our leverage back to 20% within two years.
There were two signiﬁcant items that impacted our reserves this quarter. Firstly, the
acquisition of OneBeacon required us to harmonize our actuarial practices which were
previously based on Canadian standards. Our revised approach is aligned with IFRS and
the practices of global P&C peers. Now that we have operations in Canada and in the US,
we recognize the beneﬁt of risk diversiﬁcation between lines of business and between
countries, leading to a reduction of claim liabilities.
The second item is the strengthening of reserves Charles described earlier, which
reﬂected a more cautious approach and impacted mostly personal auto. Although these
two items are independent of one another, they can be looked at in isolation as they both
are essential in assessing the overall adequacy of claims liabilities.
Together, they had a net positive impact on underwriting income of CAD39 million, or 1.9
points of combined ratio. This beneﬁt is unevenly distributed between lines of business
and half of it is included in prior-year development and the other half in current year.
Let me provide some additional color on personal auto, where we remain very focused on
improving performance.
Our action plans are delivering as expected with earned rates up 4.4% in the quarter and
written rates up 6.5%. Our segmentation actions are also translating into an improved mix
of business and a higher-quality portfolio, which ultimately will lead to a lower loss ratio.

Page 5 of 26



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2017-11-08

FINAL

Despite this progress, the underlying loss ratio remains above our expectations, mainly
due to the higher prices for parts and the time needed to replace them.
The combined ratio is elevated at 105% for the quarter and 102% year-to-date. If we
normalize for the net reserve change, prior-year development, and pools, we see the
combined ratio running in the upper 90%s. Between the existing action plan and further
actions being taken to tame claims' cost inﬂation, we expect our combined ratio to
progressively improve towards a mid-90%s target in the coming year.
Our cat losses in the quarter were well below last year and below our expectations. On a
year-to-date basis, however, cat losses are still elevated. With the addition of OneBeacon,
we are increasing our guidance for cat to CAD275 million. We still believe 75% of cat
losses will impact personal lines and about 50% are likely to occur in the third quarter.
Our rigorous expense management had a noticeable impact on our results, with a 1.6
point reduction in the Q3 expense ratio and 1.8 points year-to-date. This was driven by
lower variable expenses and cost-saving initiatives.

Bloomberg Transcript

At the same time, we continue to invest in our brand, in customer experience, and in
technology.
Turning to distribution income, we added CAD30 million of operating earnings in the
quarter, bringing year-to-date growth to 19%. However, our full-year forecast for 2017
growth is unchanged at 15%, as indicated last quarter, given a reduction of variable
commissions. Net investment income of CAD101 million was essentially unchanged from
last year, as the beneﬁt of higher invested assets was partly oﬀset by the continued low
rate environment.
Now turning to OneBeacon. As the transaction closed at the very end of Q3, our US
operations had no impact on our underwriting and operating results for the quarter.
However, there were a few items which did impact non-operating results.
We had about CAD30 million in integration costs, including the net cost of the adverse
development cover. There were CAD23 million in investment gains related to the US
book value hedge. Going forward, gains and losses on this hedge will ﬂow through OCI.
OneBeacon's balance sheet is now fully consolidated with ours, after converting it to IFRS
and into Canadian dollars. We reﬂected the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities,
including strengthening of reserves at closing. Between the adverse development cover
we purchased and the strengthened reserves, the risk of our results being impacted by
adverse development from OneBeacon has been signiﬁcantly mitigated.
With the acquisition behind us, we are totally focused on improving the combined ratio to
the low 90%s. Our proﬁtability improvement plan is based on three levers. Charles
covered our progress in the lines of business, as well as our claims initiatives. On the third

Page 6 of 26

Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2017-11-08

lever, expense synergies, we expect to generate $25 million of savings within 24 to 36
months.

FINAL

After nine months in 2017, we estimate OneBeacon's normalized combined ratio to be in
the upper 90%s, which is our starting point to measure progress. Our proﬁtability
improvement plan is expected to deliver 6 to 8 points of enhancements and generate
mid-single-digit accretion to IFC's operating income within 24 months.
Let me provide some additional detail on OneBeacon and its contribution to our results
going forward.
OneBeacon will be reported separately as a stand-alone line of business. Its results will,
therefore, be readily available in our reports. OneBeacon's direct written premiums will
increase IFC's top line, starting in Q4 2017, and we expect the impact to be in the midteens. The addition of OneBeacon's investment portfolio to IFC's will provide CAD50
million annually, Canadian dollars, in incremental investment income.
And, ﬁnally, on the tax side, there's minimal impact from the addition of OneBeacon to
our operating eﬀective tax rate in 2018. It should remain in the 20% range.

Bloomberg Transcript

After reﬂecting the acquisition on our balance sheet, our ﬁnancial strength metrics remain
strong. We introduced the metric, capital margins, to reﬂect our consolidated capital
level. It is similar in concept to our previously-disclosed excess capital and is well deﬁned
in our MD&A.
With a capital margin of CAD1.2 billion and a debt-to-total capital ratio below 25%, we
remain ready and well-positioned to participate in Canadian consolidation opportunities
as they arise, both in manufacturing and distribution.
In conclusion our Canadian business is showing its resilience thanks to the diversity of our
businesses. Our property lines are performing very well. Commercial auto is improving
and we are near our targeted low 90%s run rate combined ratio. Personal auto remains a
drag on our performance, but we are not relenting on our goal of getting the combined
ratio to the mid 90%s.
Our North American specialty business is on solid footing, giving us a strong presence in
the US and in Canada. Our transition plan with OneBeacon is well underway and we are
beginning to deliver on our targeted combined ratio improvements. We remain focused
on delivering on our ﬁnancial objectives, growing operating earnings over time, and
outperforming the industry on ROE.
With that I'll return the call back to Ken.

Thank you, Louis. In order to give everyone a chance to participate in the Q&A, we would
ask that you kindly limit yourselves to two questions per person. If there is time at the end,
you can re-queue for a follow-up. So, Kierstan, we're now ready to take questions.

FINAL

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And your ﬁrst question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead, your line is open.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good morning, Kai.

Operator
Kai Pan, your line is open. You may be on mute.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Hello, can you hear me?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning Kai. Yes, absolutely.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Yeah, I'm sorry, we were dealing with new phones here.
So my ﬁrst question is on personal auto and on the higher physical damage. So, just can
you give a little bit more detail about like when do you ﬁnd it out and what action you are
taking, and your ability to raise rates and what time -- like a timely fashion? And what give
you comfort that you can improve the personal auto combined ratio to 95%-ish in the next
12 months?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thanks for your question, Kai. I think we've seen physical damage inﬂation for a few years.
Our action plan anticipated to address those and I think in the past, say, nine months
we've seen that trend pick up a bit. Therefore, the need to increase our action plan.
If I look year-to-date in aggregate at the automobile performance, severity is up 0% in
aggregate. Frequency is up 1%, in part because of winter conditions in Q1. So, what we've
done so far is largely, in my mind, broken the back of inﬂation in aggregate. But given the
actions we've taken to improve the quality of the portfolio and the risk selection, we
would have expected, actually, a reduction in severity.

Page 8 of 26



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2017-11-08

FINAL

And so as we dig to ﬁnd what is upsetting that expectation, we realize that there is more
inﬂation in PD than we anticipated, say, nine months ago. Therefore, the need for greater
action.
Now, I'll ask Patrick to give you a bit of color as to what we're seeing in physical damage
and some of the actions we've taken so far in the past year or two, and what's in the
pipeline. And then we'll ask Darren to get into pricing and underwriting, and why we feel
good about our ability to take the combined ratio in the mid 90%s.
So, Patrick, why don't you give it a crack?

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Sure. As Charles mentioned, the cost pressure on physical damage that has accelerated
recently is only on the severity side. We've seen the cost of parts and the complexity of
repairing or replacing those parts go up, so also additional labor cost in the repairs. This
clearly points to the general sophistication of newer car models and the general
technology advances in cars.

Bloomberg Transcript

Just to illustrate, I guess with simple examples, what we're saying, I could just mention the
accelerated number of cameras and sensors of all sorts that we see, for example, in
mirrors, bumpers, and windshields. And when you think of those three parts in particular,
they are often the ﬁrst ones getting damaged in car collisions so -- and we've seen the
trend on those things accelerate in newer car models.
So, clearly, direct costs that are coming from those parts, but also indirectly it increases
other parts of the overall indemnity. When you think of rental costs, when it takes more
time to repair, those costs go up as well. Same for the percentage of total losses. So,
we've got more to repair, more cars are deemed total loss and that adds to the cost
pressure.
And, ﬁnally, it also adds pressure to towing and storage fees, because when it's more
complex repairs, it's tougher to identify upfront if they will be repairable or should be
deemed total loss right away, and we see more storage and towing around costs that we
can address.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And I would say, Kai, overall, this is not a new observation. I would say that the breadth of
the impact on stuﬀ like storage, towing, and rental days are certainly bigger than what we
anticipated six to nine months ago. We've been on that trend for a while, but clearly need
-- more needs to be done.
Why don't we talk about pricing underwriting, what it means in practice, Darren?

FINAL

Sure. Thanks, Charles. So, from a starting point, where do we see the current run rate
today? So, we've done a lot of -- obviously, as we always do -- a lot of bottom-up analysis
from an actuarial standpoint. Looking at our current trends that we see from a claims cost
standpoint, where we're at from a rate standpoint today, normalizing for cat pools, et
cetera.
We see our current loss ratio run rate in the mid 70%s today. You throw on top of it
expenses, takes us into the upper 90%s. So, when we look at our outlook around mid
90%s anticipated within the 12 months, what are the actions we're going to look at from -to bridge that particular gap there?

Bloomberg Transcript

So, ﬁrst comment I would make, though, is that much of the 2017 actions that we're
undertaking today, whether that be rate increases, segmentation, risk selection, claims, et
cetera, we'll continue to earn into 2018. We will be looking to make further improvements
into our risk selection models and re-underwriting the worst segments of the portfolio as
we continue into 2018, as we have done actually in 2017. But we will be ﬁling further rate
increases from coast to coast, with a very strong bias from a segmentation standpoint to
better reﬁne our rating to reﬂect the trends that we're seeing from a physical damage
standpoint.
As Patrick alluded to, augmenting our claims action plans to really address the residual
inﬂationary pressure we see today. So, when we look at it from a rate standpoint, we are
expecting roughly 4 combined ratio points of improvement through rate increases that
will earn into 2018. What I should say, though, is that of those 4 points, 3 points are
already in the bank today from rate increases that we've already taken in 2017. So, 75% of
that improvement from -- purely from a rate standpoint is already in the bank today.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

By "in the bank" we don't mean earned today, but rather rolling in the system to be
earned next year. So the risk of getting those 4 points is small, given that 3 is already in
the bank.

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles. And further to that, when we look at our non-rate actions -- so in other
words, risk selection, underwriting, claims, et cetera -- together with our augmented
claims action plan, as Patrick has described, when we look at that net of our expected
claims inﬂation, we're expecting to see a further 1 point of improvement in combined
ratio. So that gives us, essentially, a 500 basis point improvement. So, if we're starting
from an upper 90%s position, that positions the portfolio quite well to achieve a mid90%s within the coming 12 months.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Great. Thanks so much for the details. My follow-up question is on the other three
segments, which underlying results have been excellent. I just wonder how sustainable
are those results going forward.

FINAL

Well, I think that, overall, you look at personal prop -- let's start there -- you'll recall, Kai,
previous quarters people were saying are you pricing this properly and can you make
money in home insurance. Combined ratio year-to-date is slightly above 92%. The
average combined ratio in the past three 3 years, including the Fort McMurray year was
sub 90% and there's still momentum in terms of protecting those margins there.
So, is a combined ratio sub 95% in bad times and in the upper 80%s, low 90%s in
personal prop sustainable? I think that's what we've shown in the past 3.5 years.
If you look at commercial lines, it's been running steady in the mid-80%s. If you look at
commercial auto, we said we would get in the 90% range. It's been there now for a
number of quarter, there's actions to support that. So, I think in commercial P&C you want
to strip the extra favorable development that's taking it in the 70%s. We don't think this
thing is running in the 70%s, but it certainly has a strong momentum to stay in the 80%s
for a while.
I'll ask Darren to give a perspective of the marketplace in personal prop and some of the
things we're doing there, quickly. And then I'll ask Alain to give a perspective of our
performance in commercial P&C and commercial auto, and his perspective for those lines
of business going forward. So, Darren.

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles. So, from a personal prop standpoint, we continue to see ﬁrm conditions
in the marketplace pretty much coast to coast, reﬂecting the new reality of natural
disasters that we see.
Thanks, Charles. So, from a personal prop standpoint, we continue to see ﬁrm conditions
in the marketplace pretty much coast to coast, reﬂecting the new reality of natural
disasters that we see. So, we continue to -- as Intact, but also from an industry standpoint,
we're continuing to see low single-digit rate increases ﬂowing still through personal
property. We don't see that abating and we expect sort of the growth to be in that sort of
mid to upper single digits moving forward, from a personal prop standpoint.
Obviously, we've made a number of our product changes within the last few years and
that's creating that sustainability, as Charles alluded to, from a product standpoint.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thanks, Darren. Alain?

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Well, when we mentioned in the commercial lines P&C, we are in a competitive market
that remains competitive, and in such a market for us, it's very important to protect our
margin, our underwriting margins. And currently, we -- despite the competitive market,

Page 11 of 26



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2017-11-08

FINAL

we are passing rate increase in commercial P&C to the tone of slightly less than 3% and
these rates will continue to earn over the next 12 to 18 months.
On top of that, if you look at the growth and the mix of our portfolio, if I were to separate,
if you want, that portfolio into two pockets what risk -- where we think these are very
proﬁtable risk, the part would currently be growing at about mid-single digits. And the
other part, which is risk where we think there are still some action needed, this part is
shrinking considerably double digits. So, the mix of our portfolio is changing towards
more proﬁtable risk. And this, again, will be earned in the next 12 to 18 months. So, I think
we're in a position to keep protecting the underwriting margin going forward.
On the commercial auto side, a lot of our -- we have got rate increase still in the pipelines
that -- that will continue to earn in 2018, and a lot of our eﬀort on that portfolio was
focused on trucking business where we have double-digit rate increase in 2017. And,
again, that has changed the mix of the portfolio and going to be continued to be earned
in 2018. So, I think we're in a good path to operate that in the low 90%s.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you very much, Alain.
Just in aggregate, Kai, I mean when the inﬂation picked up in auto a little more than a year
ago, I mean it was very clear to us that not only did we need to put in place a robust
action plan in automobile insurance, no matter what, but it was also equally important to
protect or expand the margins in the other lines of business, given how, at the time,
important automobile is. Now, it is less today following OneBeacon. And it was also
important for us to take expenses out of the system to absorb the uncertainty of
automobile insurance. This is very much what we've done.
And I think, to your question, are these performance in other lines of business
sustainable? I mean, we've managed those lines to make sure that it is sustainable as this
point in time. In aggregate, we're trying to outperform the industry's ROE by more than
500 basis points. We're certainly there and I expect this to increase in the coming year.
We want to grow our net operating income per share, and so it's an earnings growth
strategy that we're pursuing. There is growth pressure by line of business, which we're
comfortable with, because there's plenty of growth for us to come. If you look at personal
property, you look at all the upside there is in Canada in specialty lines, plus what we think
is a good market environment coming into the acquisition of OneBeacon, I think that on
both fronts when I look at our two big ﬁnancial objectives over the next 24 months, we're
in pretty good shape there.
Last point I'll make is 13.3% operating ROE is not good in our mind and, therefore, we are
working hard to make sure that A), we improve auto, but we protect the margins in the
other lines of business. Even if we're hitting the two big ﬁnancial objectives that we've laid
out.

Our next question comes from the line of Tom MacKinnon from BMO Capital. Your line is
open.

FINAL

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks very much. Good morning.
Question on the prior-year development. I think the guidance now is 2% to 4% of opening
claims reserves. I think historically, Charles, you may have been talking this to be more of
like a 3% to 4%, and it actually has been trending higher than that. I'm wondering if you
can describe what drove this guidance and if you can explain that in the context of
bringing in OneBeacon, whether that had anything to do with it.
And what -- how should we be looking at this in terms of lines of businesses? Especially
given the fact that your comments about strip -- we should strip out the extra favorable
development we're seeing in the commercial lines. Are you insinuating then that the main
reason for this decline has to do to -- we shouldn't expect the high levels of favorable
development we're getting in commercial lines going forward?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No. I think that your question is pretty astute, actually, and you partly answered the
question in asking it. I've been pretty consistent talking about 3% to 4%. We have
outperformed that for many of the past few years. We could highlight a number of
reasons why we were above 4%. Our view is that this range is certainly not out of whack
with where the future is going.
I think the reason why it's 2% is because OneBeacon is new to us and, therefore, we'll
need to learn a little more about OneBeacon in the coming period before we can
develop a perspective that the long-term range is 3% to 4%.
Now as you know, new country, new liability proﬁle. The duration of OneBeacon's
liabilities is actually pretty short: it's 2.3 duration. Liability, as you also know, we have cut
the adverse development potential of that business for accident year 2016 and before by
increasing reserves and buying PYD cover. But it's new to us, we're taking a cautious
stance. We see 3% to 4% for the Canadian business and we're adjusting our guidance
downward because of the addition of OneBeacon, essentially, at this stage.
With regards to commercial lines, I think my point, Tom, is that you shouldn't see
commercial P&C running in the 70%s. And commercial P&C is the line that was most
favorably impacted by the diversiﬁcation beneﬁt that Louis has been talking about.
Therefore, I'm cautiously saying, hey Tom, just think about that line of business in the
80%s as opposed to the 70%s, because of this one-time beneﬁt in that segment.

Yeah. Darren, can you take this one?

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yeah. So, in the quarter itself, so Q3 of '17, there was an unfavorable pools impact of 0.4.
When we look at Q3 of '16, it was 1.3 to favorable, so there's a delta of 1.7. But as I said
before, we do tend to see that noise and bounce it around from quarter to quarter. And
as I said before there, Tom, year-to-date it's 0.4 favorable over (multiple speakers).

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. So, appreciate all the detailed answers on personal auto.
Given the trend towards more complex components in cars, the proportion of cars with
those complex components will only increase over time. So, I guess what I'm interested in

Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

is how you view pricing and segmentation going forward versus just necessarily catching
up with historical trend.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah, I think that's right. And when we look at the proﬁle of the car pools by province, we
actually see diﬀerences in trends by province.
Yeah, I think that's right. And when we look at the proﬁle of the car pools by province, we
actually see diﬀerences in trends by province. So, it is here a question of pricing and risk
selecting properly to address this trend going forward, having, I think, addressed the
claims issues.
So, Darren, maybe you want to share your thought process on that?

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. So, you're right, Paul. I mean, obviously from a rate increase standpoint we'll tackle
from an absolute standpoint, but what we've also -- we're doing is a lot of detailed
analysis from a segmentation standpoint. So, we've identiﬁed a number of variables that
we have within our rating structure that we could probably dial up from a segmentation
standpoint. We've identiﬁed a number of new variables that we can reﬂect within our
rating, which is really targeted on PD.
The net outcome of all of that is to really drive a mix change, to drive a change in the new
business proﬁle, to drive a change in the renewal proﬁle, as well, too. To really target from
a rate standpoint, from a segmentation standpoint those the particular vehicles that are
driving the excessive trend -- and it's mostly related to technology -- and sharpening the
pencil maybe on those that are not so much driving that particular trend.
So it really is around driving segmentation. Obviously, absolute rate level, yes. But driving
segmentation to pursue a better quality of new business proﬁle moving forward.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And really reﬁning how we classify those vehicles to a greater degree of granularity than
what's been done in the past.
I think claims can be an important lever as well, that same claims practice, so I'll let Patrick
give you a bit of perspective on what can be done in claims to break that trend going
forward.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. I mentioned earlier what's causing the trend, but in terms of how we can
help reducing it in claims there are a few things we can do. And it's somewhat linked to
what Darren was mentioning on the risk selection and segmentation parts, because this
trend is not happening at the same pace on all types of vehicles, on all models. And when

Page 15 of 26

FINAL

we look at our rely [ph] and the network who's repairing the cars, there's quite a bit of
diﬀerence between those who are specializing in certain types of repairs and others.
In terms of action plan of what we can do in claims to support all the eﬀort are a few
things. We can -- we are improving our appraisal controls and guidelines so that we more
quickly identify the types of repairs we're facing. Sending the cars to the best-performing
shops for the particularities of the claims we see, we can better estimate the total amount
of the repairs early on. So, we determine quickly if it will be a total loss, if it will be
repairable, and save on all those other costs I was referring to, so rental, storage, and
towing.
Overall, by working closely with our networks, we see opportunities to reduce the cycle
times on both repairs and total loss, which have savings as well under rentals. So, those
are few of the examples we are implementing at the moment in claims.

Our next question comes from the line of Geoﬀ Kwan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line
is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Geoﬀ Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Hi. Just back on the personal auto. I just want to make sure -- kind of summarizing, I
guess, everything that you've been saying is, you've been pricing in for what you've seen
from PD issues in the past, but maybe because, over time, more people are getting
vehicles that have more technology and it's maybe a bit of a learning experience here, is
that's really what's been driving the claims issue. And now you're just kind of reacting to it
and adjusting accordingly for that. Is that appropriate or --?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, I don't think it's just the fact that the proﬁle of the car pool is changing. I think that
when you start to observe a trend, there is a period where you wonder if you're seeing a
trend. Then there is a period where you are actually thinking you have a trend and you
want to granulize your understanding of it, and there is a period where you know you
have a hard trend.
And I think that we've identiﬁed the fact that we had a hard trend in the last 18 months
maybe, and I think what we're seeing now is that this trend was stronger than what we
anticipated. And this is combined with the fact that over the past two years, while this
happened, the car pool changed as well. Therefore, the importance of segmentation and
adapting the claims work that we've been doing.

Okay. And just the other question I had was it's diﬀerent types of vehicles, generally
speaking, but is there any spillover that we should be thinking about on the commercial
auto side, particularly as you get more into the ride-sharing and that part of the business?

FINAL

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Well, we're not seeing the same kind of level of trend on the car, because the mix of our
portfolio is a mix of trucks, heavy vehicles, and personal car, and the personal car part is
relatively small compared to the rest of the other vehicles. So, we're applying the same
kind of review and things like this. It's going through the same claim settlement aspects,
but we're certainly not picking up the same kind of trends to the level we're seeing in
personal auto.

And our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. A couple questions here for you.

Bloomberg Transcript

The ﬁrst one, back in the personal auto, what are you seeing from the competition right
now? Are they having -- taking similar actions and trying to push rate at this point, or are
they still kind of lagging behind you? And maybe some lost market share here going
forward for you guys as you address these severity issues?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So, I would say Brian, the picture for me has changed meaningfully in the past quarter in
that regard. We are, though, a full year ahead of our peers with moves, depending on the
jurisdictions, that are quite signiﬁcant, and in some jurisdictions we've been at it for two
years. So, I think that you won't see top-line pressure for another six months would be my
guess.
But I will let Darren talk about some of what we're seeing, both in rates, as well as what we
call residual or substandard market.

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yeah. So, if you look at the market, there's probably 20, 25 players that we're competing
against every single day. If we look at recent activity, I would say even within the last three
months or so, and what we're hearing about what is potentially coming into Q4, I would
say probably a third of the market has started to move from a rate standpoint.
So, as Charles alluded to, yes, we're still continuing to be ahead. We're still continuing to
be a little bit counter-cyclical. However, we are starting to see some of that momentum
coming from a rate activity from the competition.

FINAL

As we talked about Charles comments before around the risk-sharing pools, we're seeing
meaningful growth in the risk-sharing pools, which is a little bit of a sign of markets
starting to use those pools to manage their overall exposure, which talks to a little bit in
terms of adequacy as well.
And, obviously, Ontario, with our own non-standard, Jevco, we're seeing meaningful
double-digit increase in unit growth right now, or at least in Q3. So, again, that is a sign
for us of hardening within the regular market. That's the traditional we've seen in past
cycles, whereas markets tend to get harder, it starts to ﬂow through the non-standard,
ﬂow through the residuals, and then ultimately, drives into rate increases as well, too.
So, we are seeing momentum, Brian, but we're looking to see, moving forward, what the
rest of the market's doing. But it's looking better positioned today than maybe where we
were on our last earnings call.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Great. And then, the second question has to do more with OneBeacon. Charles, I'm just
curious. One, what are they seeing right now with respect to pricing in the US and what
their outlook is?
And then on top of that, from your perspective, you're right now in a position right now
for a period right now at OneBeacon where you're trying to improve your combined
ratios. Do you have the ability, are you comfortable at this point, if there's an opportunity
in the US, to grow some market share at this point or to take advantage of a ﬁrming
pricing environment? Are you in a position you can do that at this point?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, totally. So, your ﬁrst question is: What are the teams seeing in the US? As you know,
the tone has changed meaningfully in the US commercial lines market. And in particular in
property at this stage. We're seeing a change and our folks in the ﬁeld will attempt to take
advantage of the changes taking place and certainly test the market as much as possible.
And I view this as an opportunity.
I think that the beauty of the improvement plan at OneBeacon, Brian, is that there are two
lines of business that we're shutting down. Most of the lines of business are doing really
well and our in full capacity to go and take advantage of a changing marketplace. There
are three lines where we are a proﬁtability action plan with very strong teams, and I think
that a changing environment will help us do what we want to do in these lines and
potentially grow as well.
So, I have mentioned to investors before that one of the things that I was impressed with
OneBeacon, beyond the team and the strategy, is the fact that the platform is saleable,
and we certainly intend to test that organically in the coming year as I hope market
conditions will improve in the US. So, I would say spent a fair bit of time with the teams in
the US in the past month or six weeks since closing and I'm quite encouraged, not only by

Page 18 of 26

the proﬁtability improvement plan that is rolling already, but equally with our appetite to
test what I think is a changing market condition.

Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great, thank you. Good morning. If I can continue on the OneBeacon theme.
You talked about raising the reserves on OneBeacon as part of the harmonization process.
Does that also imply that before the impact of rate changes and the discontinued
programs that we should anticipate a higher sort of underlying loss ratio for this business
compared to what OneBeacon had reported?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No, because the strengthening we've done to these reserves is done on the lines of
business primarily that we're exiting, a big chunk of the strengthening is on the lines that
we're exiting. So, when I look at the business in the past, excluding those two lines, and
the business going forward, it's pretty consistent and the results in most of these
segments this year have pointed in that direction.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, that's very helpful. And second, also on OneBeacon, should we expect more
retention of its direct written premium because the overall base is bigger and more
diverse?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Not clear to me. I think that in the lines of business which we're committed to we'll do
everything we can to protect our portfolio. Hopefully, the market conditions will allow
that.
What do you mean by retention? Just so I'm clear. Do you mean the customer retention or
the reinsurance retention?
Maybe you're on mute, Did you mean --?

FINAL

So, I think that the lines of business that we're committed to will go on growing in the
marketplace and taking advantage of the market conditions in which we operate,
probably consistently with what they would have done anyways. I think where the growth
upside certainly comes in, in the near term, is the fact that we have put in place crossorder desks, both in the US and Canada. This has been an impediment to our growth in
Canada in the past, which I'm hoping we're unlocking now, and the early signs are
positive.
We brought a technology product in Canada from OneBeacon, an entertainment product
from Canada in OneBeacon. And I think the growth potential the cross-order and these
two products, when you put that in relationship with the size of OneBeacon, when you
leverage the impact distribution in Canada, I think that will be a meaningful needlemover, for sure.
So, hopefully, I've answered your question and, hopefully, you'll come back on the line.
When it comes to reinsurance retention, if that was your question. Their retention is 20
million right now and we will integrate the OneBeacon program within our program
throughout 2018.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Yes, hello. Good morning. My ﬁrst question is related to the impacts of Harvey and Irma
and maybe even potentially the wildﬁres in California. Is there any long-tail impacts from
exposure in those states to those events in OneBeacon?

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

I would say it's fairly limited. The place where they had the most exposure would be Texas
and the type of damage is business interruption, but the expectation is not very long tail.
And it's been picked up, been properly reserved up until closing, so the expectation is
not any long tail.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

It is small, as we anticipated, and we feel very well reserved at this stage. And still subject
to the reinsurance threshold of 20 million that's OneBeacon had originally, so I don't
expect bad news from those elements at this stage.
And I think, in aggregate, diversifying our natural cat exposure by being more exposed to
commercial lines and broadening our geography was, you know, part of an upside of the
transaction we've done. And I think, in an absolutely extreme context like the one we've

Page 20 of 26

seen in the US, we were really pleased to see how OneBeacon faired very well in that
context.

FINAL

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Okay, great. And my next question is related to the capital structure and the debt-tocapital ratio currently at 24.7%. I understand the target is 20%. Can you refresh me on why
20%? And is there something about the A rating that is absolutely critical in the longer
term, rather than maybe even a BBB+ or something along those lines?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So we established that some while back as the optimal level, because it was the lowest
cost of capital to maintain an A-, BBB+ rating level and that's how it was established. So
we (inaudible) there and we're comfortable where we are in terms of the rating structure,
and that comes with the 20% leverage ratio.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

We've said that in case of acquisition we'd be very comfortable getting in the mid-20%s,
but eventually we'll take it back to the 20%s. I mean, we have those big ﬁnancial
objectives and then we have a certain risk appetite. And our thought process initially,
when we established the 20% was that within what we think is a cautious risk appetite, a
20% debt to total cap structure allows us to outperform the industry by more than 500
basis points, run the business in the mid-teens ROE, and give us ample room to grow
those earnings by at least 10% over time. It is at the slightly cautious end of the ﬁnancial
services landscape in Canada, but certainly not out of whack with it, and there is no
intention at this stage to modify that structure.
The other thing to keep the minus is we're using preferred shares, which one has to take
into account when you look at the overall capital structure of an organization. And our
usage of preferred share also leads us at the lower end of the debt -- pure debt to total
cap ratio.

FINAL

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Well, we've set up the module calculations, so these will be applied going forward in the
same methodology, if you want. So, I wouldn't expect a material impact like we've had
this quarter, but that number is maintained, as we had in the past, with our risk margin. So,
it evolves over time, but it's not one where we completely change it. We have to apply the
same approach on a going concern or going-forward basis.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, I would say this comes with a range. This was the ﬁrst time really that we reﬂected
diversiﬁcation in establishing our provision for adverse deviation. Our bias was to take the
cautious to determine where that point was and very much in our historical reserving
philosophy.

Q - Meny Grauman

{BIO 15238080 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks for that. And then if I could just ask another question on OneBeacon, just also
clariﬁcation. As you go from the high 90%s to the low 90%s in terms of the combined
ratio, you talk about synergies as one area of improvement. I'm wondering, I'm not sure if
you've mentioned it before, but how much of that reduction speciﬁcally is tied to
synergies? If you can quantify that.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Sure. So I shared earlier the dollar amount of synergies we're aiming for at $25 million.
Now what our improvement plan calls for is to -- which is a growth of [ph] about 2 points
of combined ratio. But recall our entire plan with the three levers is aiming for 6 to 8
points, which will go from the upper 90%s to the low 90%s.

Q - Meny Grauman

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

FINAL

Good afternoon. Just, Charles, I'll try to be quick here.
I'm looking at the growth in written insured risks in personal auto over a very, very long
stretch. I think the -- I have information going back about 14 years. And there are very, very
few occasions when the written insured risks in personal auto actually decline year over
year. It happens very, very rarely.
Given the trend we're seeing from the sort of high single-digit growth in written insured
risks that we saw, and you see that in '15 and '16, particularly around that time you became
a lot more conﬁdent with telematics. It sort of trended down to almost zero now. Could
this be one of those occasions, short-lived that is, but one of those occasions where the
written insured risks in personal auto sinks below zero?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Could be, yes. Yeah.
I think, Mario, it's not just about rate. There is various digital experiences. We have a
broad distribution strategy, but it could be below zero for a short period of time and we'd
be comfortable doing that if it helps us get to where we want to be from a combined ratio
point of view.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

And then, just on telematics speciﬁcally, and I am certainly no expert in this. But, is it fair to
say that telematics really hasn't lived up to all the hype? Speciﬁcally -- like, couldn't
telematics have been somewhat helpful in giving you an earlier signal of what was
happening?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think telematics -- I'll tell you, telematics has lived up to our expectations, quite frankly.
First, the appetite for consumers to embrace telematics is higher than what we thought.
Second, the loss ratio of customers who choose telematics after the discount is better
than the average loss ratio. And then, the ﬁeld of segmentation that we have gathered in
the past three years with 3.7 billion, 3.8 billion kilometers driven and the machine learning
we were able to do on that is very signiﬁcant.
The upside of that, in my mind, will be for the coming years and then the opportunity to
interact with customers has changed meaningfully. So, it has lived up to what we were set
to do with telematics, per se.
Could we have used telematics to a greater extent to better understand these trends in
physical damage? Not clear to me, Mario, because it is primarily severity driven. We've
used telematics to try to understand frequency changes. We've tried to understand, if
people drove more, what impact would it have on frequency and so on. Harder to
leverage on severity, per se.

I think that the government has demonstrated, Mario, a lot of appetite since 2010 to
improve the product, per se. And so, if I look backwards it's hard for me to question the
will of the government, in Ontario. I wouldn't say the same thing in all jurisdictions, but
we're talking about Ontario.
They have hired last year and did work most of this year, gentlemen called David
Marshall, who used to run WSIB, who has identiﬁed a number of what I think are common
sense recommendations. The main one being let's get cash out of the system and let's
focus on care, which would take a lot of incentives for all sorts of people to play in that
system. And I think the government is thinking about his recommendation very seriously
as they look at the next months. Therefore, I think there is will.

There will be an election in the spring and what it does to will, I'm not sure. But they're
certainly -- they have shown their willingness and they're actively engaged thinking about
that would be my read on the situation.

And our next question comes from the line of Doug Young from Desjardins Capital
Market. Your line is open.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Good afternoon. On personal auto, there was CAD31 million negative prior reserve
developments and curious how much of that related to the physical damage? How much
related to the older ﬁle, more older ﬁles, so pre-2016, moving into the cat loss bucket?
And it's the latter component that I'm more curious about, because that's a bump I think
you had in Q2, and just trying to get a sense of where you stand with that issue.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. So the bulk of the PYD is long-tail-natured claims and a non-negligible portion of
that would indeed be cats. Cats, which have been trimmed, as far as I'm concerned, in the
June 2016 reform, which we think are pretty good, at least based on what we observed so
far.
And I think you have a couple of things there. You -- if I just talk about cat -- and it's not
just cat, it's long-tail-natured, bodily injury-type claims, cats being an important portion of
that in the Ontario marketplace. I think we've seen -- in the legal system, you have two

years to report a claim and then one year to serve it actually. And we have seen for
accident years like '13, '14, '15 a bit of late reporting on big cats, and then we went back to
many of the cats that were open where there was a risk of psychological damage to
actually strengthen our position.
You look at PYD, and the number you've quoted is small, but if you look at the actual
increase in reserves in the quarter in long-tail lines automobile Insurance between IBNR
and case reserves, this is a number that is much bigger than that, which helps us with our
conﬁdence of adequacy in that segment for these lines of business sitting here today.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

And so, Charles, just listening to you talk about this, I mean, we've seen some progressive
deterioration in the personal auto prior-year reserve development over the last few
quarters. I mean, as we go into 2018-19, do you think -- I mean, should we move back into
positive developments in personal auto?
I mean, should we move back into positive developments in personal auto? I mean has
this -- have these issues been dealt with, in your view?

Well, the reserves have gone up meaningfully. I think these issues have been dealt with.
And when I look progressively or prospectively, the reforms, in particular in Ontario, are
meant to limit that sort of outcome to a greater extent, yes.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

A - Charles Brindamour
