Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our announced strategic
acquisition of Validus group, a company many of you are familiar with. This acquisition is a
significant step forward in executing our strategy to pursue profitable growth. The $5.6
billion acquisition is immediately accretive to EPS and ROE, in addition to being a great
cultural fit.
Validus provides our General Insurance business unit with diversification across our
products, distribution, and geography, and this diversification should lead to capital
efficiencies. The transaction has little execution risk to us as it remains minimal integration
given that it will operate as it does today within General Insurance. The combined
companies position AIG with the capital, cash flow, and underwriting opportunities to
deliver profitable growth. You'll hear more from Peter shortly about how the Validus
operations complement AIG's General Insurance business.
Strategically, it provides a strong reinsurance underwriting operation, an immediate
presence at Lloyd's, additive specialty lines expertise, and a skill set around third-party
capital throughout AlphaCat, which introduces new possibilities to AIG as a risk originator.
As part of AIG, Validus has greater opportunity to expand profitability.
In addition, Validus has successfully applied technology and data as a sustainable
competitive advantage. Their ability to assess property risk through proprietary CAT
modeling is just one example of how they've leveraged research and analytics to enhance
underwriting profitability. This too fits nicely with our technology and data strategies.
Validus also brings to AIG additional talent with proven underwriting expertise. We know
the Validus team well, and have tremendous respect for their accomplishments and their
record of consistent underwriting results. The depth of their talent stands out among the
Bermuda insurance companies. Importantly, this transaction makes both companies
better.

I'll now turn it over to Peter Zaffino, who will speak about Validus' underwriting and other
capabilities. Peter?

FINAL

Peter Zaffino

{BIO 15942020 <GO>}

Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. My comments today will focus on the
distinctive capabilities of Validus, the strategic fit between Validus and AIG, and the
opportunities we see for driving profitable growth by capitalizing on the assets of our two
firms.
Turning to slide 4, which provides a breakdown of Validus operations across reinsurance
and specialty markets; let me walk you through these four business units and explain why
we're excited to bring each of them into AIG. Validus Re is a leading global reinsurer with
an extremely well-regarded underwriting franchise, focused on treaty reinsurance with $1.1
billion in annual premiums. The business has performed very well since it was formed in
2005, following severe catastrophe losses caused by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma.

Bloomberg Transcript

Property treaty is the largest component of the portfolio, but they have broadened their
reinsurance capabilities over time and effectively managed their exposures. Together with
AlphaCat, an insurance-linked securities asset manager with approximately $3.4 billion in
assets under management, Validus has a comprehensive reinsurance offering. We are
confident that these businesses can leverage AIG's scale and expertise to accelerate
their growth in the coming years.
Shifting to the specialty markets, let me start with Talbot which is the 11th largest Lloyd's
syndicate with approximately $920 million in annual premiums. We are pleased that AIG
will re-enter Lloyd's, which broadens our global distribution network and provides new
growth opportunities. Talbot Syndicate 1183 is highly regarded with a number of strong
franchise in the Lloyd's market across marine property and political risk.
In addition to Talbot, Validus brings AIG two distinctive U.S. specialty businesses. Western
World is a U.S. property and liability insurer focused on small commercial customers. It
generates approximately $400 million in annual premiums, operates in both excess and
surplus lines and admitted markets and has a strong presence in the binding authority
business where their proprietary rate, quote and bind system provides access to
wholesale brokers and their distribution. Western World provides AIG access to small
commercial clients that we typically do not serve through Lexington, our own E&S
platform.
Crop Risk Services or CRS is a leading provider of crop insurance in the U.S., representing
approximately $550 million in annual premiums. CRS is a USDA-approved crop insurance
company and provides an excellent entry point into crop insurance where we currently do
not have a presence.
Cutting across the four segments of the portfolio, the Validus team will strengthen our
core underwriting capabilities within AIG. They bring distinctive thought leadership in
catastrophe modeling and research, expertise in physical and data sciences and
Page 3 of 19

FINAL

innovative approaches to underwriting analytics and risk management that we will be able
to utilize at AIG.
Turning to slide 5; the acquisition of Validus is expected to increase General Insurance's
net premiums written by approximately 11% in attractive lines that are strategically
complementary and bring diversification to our existing portfolio. The reinsurance
operations of Validus generate 53% of its gross written premiums and the insurance
operations generate the remaining 47%. Following the acquisition, reinsurance is
expected to be approximately 3% of AIG's General Insurance business on a pro forma
basis.
The reinsurance premiums from Validus Re and AlphaCat will be a large contributor to
General Insurance and will provide AIG with a new platform to participate in the
reinsurance and alternative capital markets. The domestic U.S. businesses of Validus
comprise Western World and CRS, each of which bring an additional element to balance
our North American General Insurance offering, and I've already mentioned the benefits
of reentering Lloyd's through Talbot.

Bloomberg Transcript

In summary, this transaction brings AIG capabilities in markets in which we wish to grow
and allow us to offer more comprehensive solution to our customers. In turn, AIG's global
scale, balance sheet strength, and extensive client and broker relationships will provide
Validus with new growth opportunities through the sourcing of new risks and by
broadening the breadth of its product offerings.
As Brian mentioned, we do not anticipate a wholesale integration of the Validus
operations into our own business. We want to ensure that the Validus team maintains their
momentum and preserves the innovative culture that has served them so well over the
years, but we will do everything possible to allow Validus to capitalize on the benefits of
being part of AIG. At the same time, General Insurance will maintain our focus on
improving our own strategic financial and operational performance.
Turning to slide 6; Validus has an industry-leading management team with a track record
of strong performance and a culture of underwriting excellence. Looking at their results
over the last 10 years, Validus has consistently been a top performer and delivered an
average combined ratio of 84%. Until the CAT activity this past year, they have a returned
a positive underwriting profit every year since 2007.
Validus has also managed the reinsurance cycle well by managing their aggregates and
exhibiting very good underwriting, as well as utilizing the capacity provided by AlphaCat
and shifting the Validus Re business mix, as rates had softened in the property cap
market. The majority of the leadership team has been in place since its inception. Brian
and I know them well and have worked with them for many years. We're excited to
welcome this group to AIG. I think the cultural fit is terrific.
We expect the business unit leaders at Validus will remain in place following completion of
the transaction. Kean Driscoll, CEO of Validus Re; Lixin Zeng, CEO of AlphaCat; Peter
Bilsby, CEO of Talbot; Jonathan Ritz, President of Western World; and Brian Young,
Page 4 of 19

President of CRS. I look forward to working closely with this leadership team in the months
and years to come.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Sid.

FINAL

Siddhartha Sankaran

{BIO 17003278 <GO>}

Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 7; as Brian mentioned
earlier, the total deal consideration is $68 per share for each common share of Validus, or
approximately $5.6 billion in aggregate that AIG will pay for with cash on hand. We will also
evaluate opportunistic financing alternatives closer to the closing date.
The deal value represents roughly 1.5 times Validus' cap book value at the end of 3Q 2017.
The transaction will be immediately accretive to AIG's earnings per share and ROE,
neutral to book value, and modestly dilutive to tangible book value. While there will be
some expense synergies over time, this strategic transaction does not require integration
savings to enhance AIG's top and bottom lines, and provides an attractive return on
investment.

Bloomberg Transcript

Validus' earnings will allow us to accelerate the usage of our existing net operating losses.
At this time, we anticipate making a 953(d) election that will make Validus a U.S. taxpayer.
Also, given the enhanced diversification and risk profile that Validus brings to us, we
expect capital optimization benefits to emerge over time. Following the standard
regulatory and shareholder approval process, we anticipate the transaction will close by
the middle of 2018.
Moving to slide 8; we expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity profile
following the transaction. The combined companies' leverage ratio will increase by
roughly 50 basis points, given the relatively small amount of Validus debt outstanding.
Total capital for the combined company will be greater than $96 billion including over $73
billion of common shareholders equity, pro forma at 3Q 2017.
I would also note that we remain confident in the comments we made regarding reserve
adequacy at our 3Q earnings call, and look forward to providing you an update when we
release earnings on February 8. In addition, we anticipate releasing our revised financial
supplement this week, consistent with our new organizational structure.
With that, I would like to turn it back over to Brian for some closing remarks before we
start the Q&A.

Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Thank you, and I think you've seen from the comments that I've made and Peter and Sid
that this is very exciting for us. It's a tremendous addition to our company; brings the skills
we don't have and we just can't wait to get the Validus team in part of the family. And with
that, I'd like to go to Q&A, operator. Can we take some questions?

Q&A
Operator

FINAL

Certainly. We'll take our first question from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse.
Please go ahead.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey, Thanks. First of all, just for Brian, I guess if you could talk just a little bit more about, I
guess, how this deal just came together. Why, I guess, you chose to go down the route of
E&S reinsurance as opposed to admitted lines carrier and a P&C or even a life insurance?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, Ryan, well, I've been asked a lot of questions about what kind of acquisitions am I
interested in, what would we do; and we have a lot of white spaces, a lot of businesses
that we don't do and, therefore, concentrated in fewer than – too few, let's say, for my
liking. So, we're not in the reinsurance business. I know that business well. I've been
involved in running reinsurance companies or advising them for a long time, and I
particularly like the reinsurance business as additive to what we do.
I've been interested in getting the Lloyd's platform. We don't have one, and I think it is an
important strategic asset to any general insurance company, so we were interested in
that. And of course, there are other component parts to it. It does have E&S. True. It's got
a crop business. We don't have crop. It's a terrific business. So, there are just a lot of
pieces to this company that fit us perfectly like a glove. And that's why I chose it. It's a
great company too, and probably the most important thing is the people in it are terrific
underwriters and managers and executives. And so, they make us better.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Okay. And I think Peter said reinsurance is now 3% of your business, but it's half the
premium on this deal. You seem to like it. Can we expect that 3% to grow over time? Do
you think that reinsurance over the next few years will become a larger percentage of the
overall premium mix in AIG in that 3% referenced?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, I think it's going to grow at its own pace. The rest of the General Insurance is going
to grow. So, it's kind of hard to say which one's going to relatively win in this. What I do
believe is this movement of originating and then placing risk continues to grow, and their
AlphaCat capability is an important part of who they are. So, I think reinsurance will
certainly continue to grow at its own pace, but I do think this AlphaCat capability has great
growth potential.
Okay. Can we go to next question?

The next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. My first question, just given that you guys are announcing this deal of a
certain size at the start of this year, Brian, do you see yourself as done with large deals for
the rest of 2018, or can you just talk to us about how you think about the M&A potential
and pipeline for AIG from here?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, this is the deal we're doing right now, let's put it that way, and we're very interested
in making sure that it goes to completion. Deals, M&A, it's a funny animal. First of all, you
have to have a certain perspective. In other words, there are things that you think belong
in a company you should look for those. And then it becomes very much a product of right
time, right place, right people, and so it's very hard to predict. So, we will continue to see
what's out there, but this is the one we're doing right now and it's got all our attention.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank you. And my second question, in the slide and, Sid, you remarked about
accelerating the utilization of the DTA with this deal. Can you just talk more about that and
how we should think about that? And, as we think about this enabling AIG to utilize you're
DTA faster, is that something that we should take into account when considering the
valuation that you're paying here?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Go ahead, Sid.

A - Siddhartha Sankaran

{BIO 17003278 <GO>}

Great. Yeah. Well, as I said, Elyse, we anticipate making a 953(d) election that will make
Validus as a U.S. taxpayer, so it'd be taxed at U.S. corporate tax rate. And hence, their
earnings will be applied against our DTA and, in turn, tax sharing payment. And yes, as we
think about doing transactions, we do look at them on a cash basis and we do evaluate
the impact on book value inclusive of the present value of that DTA. We think that's a
unique variable for us and an important driver of economics and cash flow.

A - Brian Duperreault

FINAL

Yeah. Good morning, everyone. I'm curious to know whether you have a view of the
property CAT reinsurance market. We just had three tremendous U.S. storm losses in 2017
and, I mean, it depends on how (00:19:10) you think, but it looks like pricing hadn't gone
up very much at 1/1 renewals, maybe you disagree with that. Do you expect in doing this
deal that long-term property CAT pricing is currently depressed?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Let me take that, and maybe Peter will have a follow-up, but I think, certainly, the property
CAT pricing did go up, I mean, less than people speculate it. The real question is, is the
pricing of property CAT today commensurate with the risk being taken, and I believe that
the returns that they're getting are reasonable. The retro market went up more. I mean,
when you look at how you put a portfolio of property CAT together, you've got to think of
both elements as you protect yourself.
And I say, net-net, I think the property CAT business is reasonably priced. And I think my
experience over – gee, I don't know how long I've been looking at this stuff – 20 years – by
and large, the property CAT market has held itself at a reasonable to very good levels in
terms of returns on equity or returns on risks. So, I don't see – that's a very disciplined
group. I don't see that changing.
Peter, would you add anything?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter Zaffino

{BIO 15942020 <GO>}

No. I agree, Brian. The only thing I would add is that their product line mix has decreased
property CAT since 2010 to 2017. So, the mix of their overall portfolio is more balanced.
And then, what we mentioned in the prepared remarks is that, depending on what the
trends are in the industry, we have both opportunities to pursue through Validus Re or
AlphaCat. So, there's opportunities for growth, I think we're going to be well-positioned
and capitalize on that.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And, okay, and you don't think there's any – what did you say?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

I just wanted to get a follow-up.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yeah. Yeah. And in terms of risk, you guys are obviously a very large insurer, does that put
at a disadvantage of people not wanting to reinsure through you because you're a
competitor of theirs?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

No. No. If that was the case, it's ended a long time ago. I think we're in an industry where
we will compete one day and partner the next, reinsure each other. It's the nature of the
Page 8 of 19

industry and who we are, and I think it probably enhances Validus' position in the
marketplace, not decreases it.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thanks very much. I was hoping you could provide a bit more insight in terms of how the
deal came about. Was Validus essentially put up for sale, or did AIG approach it?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

I think you're going to see – you read all about it, don't you, in the filings that come out
afterward. I'll just simply say that I initiated it.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

All right. I appreciate that. Thanks. And then two other quick ones. There was a comment
in the prepared remarks about the confidence in AIG's reserve adequacy. So, does that
mean we should not expect a fourth quarter charge?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

I'll refer you to what I said at the third quarter call. So, those comments hold until we do
our fourth quarter, let's put it that way.

Our next question comes from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning. First question is, before this Validus acquisition, there are
some news about your interest in talk with Voya, I just – and also a couple Australian
property like (00:23:15) assets. I'm just wondering, are there other opportunities that you
might be interested that could add capability or growth to AIG?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, I'm not going to comment on any speculation. The earlier question, I did say, there
are still things that I would like to add to the company to balance it out that would be
great, strategic fits. And over time, I hope that I can do that. So, yeah, there are other
things that we'd be interested over time. Do you have a follow-up?

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Yes, I do. Maybe for Sid, is that, can you talk a little bit about your capital position in
term of both cash as well as potential, sort of, debt capacity that you could do – sort of,
like, what capacity do you have without raising capital if there's another deal coming?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Go ahead, Sid.

A - Siddhartha Sankaran

{BIO 17003278 <GO>}

Well, I think, first of all, as Brian said, we're focused on this deal. But we believe post the
transaction, the balance sheet remains very strong. We have a good leverage profile, we
have good free cash flow profile, and capital ratios are at target levels. So, we'll evaluate
each of those variables down the line if there's something else to discuss, but I think we
feel very good about how the balance sheet is positioned today and the future.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

FINAL

Thanks and good morning. Just two quick questions. Number one, I guess longer term
now that Validus Re has a bigger balance sheet, if you were to look into the future, why
shouldn't we assume it becoming a bigger platform and competing with Swiss Res and
Munich Res?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, that's quite aspirational. I think Validus has shown a tremendous ability to compete
with them now. I think they're second to none in the marketplace. Certainly, with this
combination, they are clearly in a different space. And to the extent that we can use that
intelligently, we will. They've got the people who can do it, so that's something, yeah, we
like to see happening, but without forcing it let's put it that way. What else would you like
to know?

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Yeah. One quick follow-up, and this was asked in a different way. If you go back and look
at Sompo when they acquired Endurance, and then Endurance went on to acquire
Montpelier Re, I guess, when you look at your balance sheet and you look at the
marketplace and if I look at your pricing commentary, why or why not look at – why
wouldn't you look at some tuck-in acquisitions down the road amongst the smaller
Bermuda space?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, that's an interesting question. I have in the past put two CAT companies together,
two reinsurance companies together; it's not like I haven't done it. But we're
concentrating on this one, and then we'll look to see what things remain for us to do in
terms of filling in other areas that we need to fill in. So, I think I won't say any more than
that.

Next question comes from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill.

Q - Jon Paul Newsome

{BIO 3522950 <GO>}

Good morning. I want to ask you about sort of overall CAT risk and whether or not adding
Validus changes how you need to think or want to think about CAT risk for the overall
portfolio. Certainly, this last year seemed like there was a lot of CAT risk at AIG and this

Page 11 of 19



Company N ame: American I nternational Group I nc
Company Ticker: AI G US Equity
Date: 2018-01-22

might be adding it or is it really adding it and if you could just sort of address whether or
not...

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

FINAL

Sure.

Q - Jon Paul Newsome

{BIO 3522950 <GO>}

Just sort of accretive to CAT risk or is it something that's a little bit more complicated?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

It's far more complicated. It's so complicated, actually. I'm going to ask Peter. Peter is our
reinsurance expert. Peter, can you take this one?

A - Peter Zaffino

{BIO 15942020 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. Certainly participating in the property CAT market is going to add more CAT risk to
our overall portfolio. Having said that, Validus has been a terrific company in managing
their own aggregates through reinsurance and retro. They've done it in a very creative
way. So, we're going to understand the different return periods and how it will overlap
with our own portfolio. And then on our own earnings call, we'll take you through our
philosophy in terms of how we're buying reinsurance for property CAT going forward with
AIG. So, we'll be taking less risk than we have in the past. And so, the combination of both
organizations should not add significant exposure on a net basis to our portfolio.

Q - Jon Paul Newsome

{BIO 3522950 <GO>}

Yeah. My second question, maybe you could address sort of a concern that maybe that
buying something that's in General Insurance could be a distraction to the – what's
probably the most important thing which is fixing the Commercial business.

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Yeah. Let me start and, Peter, I'd like you to supplement. So, I did not want to do a deal
that would take us away from the major task at hand, which is fixing the core. This one
doesn't. For the most part, there's no overlap. Reinsurance, Lloyd's, they continue to
stand alone. We don't do the crop business. So, there is some perhaps in the Western
World component, but as Peter outlined earlier, there are some things that they do that
we don't. So, it's very, very small, this overlap. Peter?

A - Peter Zaffino

{BIO 15942020 <GO>}

Yes, Brian. I mean just to elaborate on what you said, if you look at the one that you
outlined in Western World that could have an overlap, if you look at their binding authority
business, which I outlined in my opening remarks, that is the largest and most successful
part of their business and the average account size is around 2,000 premiums.
So, when you look at Lexington that plays way up market, we won't have much overlap if
at all when you look at that in the crop business in the United States. And then, Talbot

brings us opportunities to see even broader business than perhaps we would've seen on
our own by having a syndicate within Lloyd's. So, I think they actually present us with
opportunities for profitable growth and very limited overlap, so therefore, very little
distraction in the United States.

Good. Next question, please.

Next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks. Hey, Brian, Peter, Sid; a couple questions here. First one, can you talk a little
bit what you think the IRR in this transaction is going to look like here going forward? I
mean, if I look at your stock right now trading at, call it, 11 times with theoretically
depressed earnings, it would just seem like the returns on repurchasing your shares
would be better than buying a single-digit on return equity company right now with a
pretty significant premium to book value.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, let me say that I believe that acquiring companies that are well-managed and
strategic with a long-term track record, a very profitable underwriting and growth is what
I'm going to pursue. And to me, long term, it is much more strategic than stock
acquisition. But, anyway, Sid, can you talk about the IRR?

A - Siddhartha Sankaran

{BIO 17003278 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean I alluded to this earlier. I mean I think, first, we start with strategic benefits,
but then if you really look at this deal on a cash basis, we're not going to give you a
number, but you got to look at the earnings, the capital, and the tax benefits, which we'll
keep you updated over time, and we think this is an attractive ROI.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. And then lastly, Brian, you do have a lot of experience at the property CAT
reinsurance business. I'm just curious, what do you think of that business today in a kind of
long-term kind of return prospects of it, vis-à-vis kind of when you originally made your
first acquisition of property CAT?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, in the day, when we made – when I first got into it, there wasn't alternate capital like
there is today and that's changed the landscape. So, reinsurance isn't going away;
property CAT reinsurance, absolutely, is necessary for all of us in the business. The
question is, how do you shape your offering to match the kind of capital that's out there,
and what kind of returns that capital is looking for?

FINAL

So, in Validus, we have a company that does that extraordinarily well. They take risk on
their own balance sheet, they use AlphaCat, they'll use retro, and I think the skill set
doesn't go away. How you apply it, you've got to be creative in taking the kind of capital
and matching it against cost of capital, and they do a great job. So, to me, this is a
statement about our belief in the future of this particular component of the insurance
world.

Q - Brian Meredith

Good. Next question?

Operator
The next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks. Just to clarify, so Validus will become a U.S. taxpayer under the deal. Is that
increased tax rate the source of the faster utilization of the deferred tax asset, or is there
a benefit besides that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Hey, Sid, could you do that?

A - Siddhartha Sankaran

{BIO 17003278 <GO>}

Yeah. So, yes, it will become a U.S. taxpayer. So, think of it, after-tax rate will be subject to
20% U.S. tax, effectively. And then, as you know, on those profits that are applied against
the net operating loss DTA, we don't pay cash tax, right, so we send a cash tax payment –
tax sharing payment up to the holding company from the entity. So, you got to look at the
cash implications here when you think about tax for us.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Fair enough. And then in terms of capital which I think both you and Brian mentioned
before, what's the time line for lower capital requirements, as you add in the Validus as
sort of better core profitability compared to where AIG has been? How long does that
take to translate into lower capital requirements?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

How long is a piece of string, I guess. I don't know. We'll begin the process. It will play out
over a period of time, but we immediately start to – when we acquire it of course, we got
to wait 'til the deal finally closes. But those capital redeployments and efficiencies we'll be
working on immediately after the close. Sid, can you add anything?

The next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Evercore.

Q - Thomas Gallagher

{BIO 3311667 <GO>}

Good morning. Sid, just a few quick questions. Can you comment at all on the range of
EPS accretion. I know, you said it's going to be immediately accretive. Can you give a
range? And also does this change – accelerating the DTA utilization, does that change the,
I think it was $7 billion DTA impairment guidance you had given previously?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Go ahead, Sid.

A - Siddhartha Sankaran

{BIO 17003278 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, these will be pretty easy answers, Tom. On the first one, no, unfortunately I
can't give you guidance. We don't provide that. On the second one, this transaction in and
of itself doesn't impact the re-measurement of the DTA. And when we file the 10-K and
earnings at year-end, we'll be able to give you a final estimate around that remeasurement of the DTA that we had provided earlier.

Q - Thomas Gallagher

{BIO 3311667 <GO>}

Thanks and just a follow-up, the $5.6 billion of cash, is that all on balance sheet cash or
does that include some of what you expect to generate during 2018?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Sid?

A - Siddhartha Sankaran

{BIO 17003278 <GO>}

Yes. We don't map the funds directly, but, yeah, of course, right now, we have sufficient
cash on hand to execute the transaction as of today. And then of course, we generate
incremental free cash flow over the course of the year. So, we'll obviously re-evaluate our

Page 15 of 19

cash flow projections and be opportunistic in the market around funding alternatives as
time evolves.

We have a follow-up question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Two quick follow-ups. One, just in terms of the Lloyd's business
that you're acquiring. Can you just talk to the pricing and market outlook there and the
growth potential that platform brings to AIG, a little bit more color please?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Okay. Peter, please do that.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter Zaffino

{BIO 15942020 <GO>}

Sure. Thanks, Elyse. Certainly, it really does depend on line of business and it depends on
where you play. When we look at our classes of business within Talbot, it is significant.
There's really only one which is the energy onshore to a property that's above 10%. And
so, it's a very diversified portfolio. And so, I think overall rates, when I look at the overall
Lloyd's, I mean, have been moving in a direction of positive. But again, it's just – it's a really
tough question to answer because it depends on the demographics and breakdown of
the overall portfolio.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then my second question, in terms of Validus, their book of business and
we know that retro rates are, as you said Brian, going up higher than traditional
reinsurance rates. How do you think about the reinsurance purchases you might make on
Validus' book over the coming year? Would you buy less or more just given the bigger
balance sheet that the combined company will have?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Validus is really, really good at looking at its overall structure and applying retro
appropriately. I think they're going to teach us something. We're not necessarily going to
teach them something about that. Yes, we do have a larger balance sheet, true, and
you're really talking more about the CAT business, and as Peter said earlier, they have a
broader base of reinsurance than just the CAT. So could, we take more cat? Yeah, we
could. Maybe we'll use the retro market and it's not as much. And it really all depends on
Page 16 of 19

the circumstances. And that's where the Validus team is remarkable to making those
decisions as they come up and you have to do it as they come up, as you're constantly
looking at a dynamic CAT portfolio.

Q - Jay Gelb

Okay. And then, just my other follow-up is on AlphaCat. How much larger do you think that
could be under AIG's ownership?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Interesting question. They've got 3-plus billion dollars under management now. We see
others who have larger portfolios. I think, can we attract assets and feed those assets with
appropriate risk? I think we can. I think there's a real prospect for a tremendous upside
there, but I don't want to speculate about how big it might be. But I'm very positive about
this one.

Q - Jay Gelb

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks. Peter, you mentioned that there's not much integration necessary, but I'm
wondering whether there's an opportunity to take some of Validus' management maybe
shore-up elements of Legacy AIG that needs a little support. Is that a reasonable way to
think about this deal?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, that's an interesting point. I said they're creative, they make us better, and to the
extent that they can handle more, they're going to get more. So, absolutely. Absolutely.
