Frdric de Courtois
Thank you. Good morning to you all. I would like first to welcome our new Head of Investor
Relations, Giulia Raffo. And I'm sure all of you know Giulia, we are extremely pleased to
have Giulia on board in Generali, together with a very strong Investor Relation team.

FINAL

Thank you very much for the very kind introduction. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to
our Q1 2019 results conference call. My name is Giulia Raffo, and I'm here with our General
Manager, Frederic de Courtois; and our Group CFO, Cristiano Borean. Before we open up
the Q&A session, I would like to hand over to Frederic and Cristiano for some opening
remarks. Thank you very much.

Frdric de Courtois
Thank you, Giulia. Some comments from me. First, we are very pleased with the Q1 result.
Of course, these are only Q1 results, but we are very pleased with the results. We are
pleased because they are strong industrial results and because they are absolutely in line
with the targets of our new plan.
A few comments on the quality of these industrial results. First on the volumes. So
volumes are accelerating. We continue to see what we have seen last year which is a
good growth on the P&C side with more than 3% growth and we are pleased with this.
We had during the first quarter, as you may have seen a very strong net inflow. So at more
than EUR 4 billion. And we are also happy with this. So we see a trend of accelerating
growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second comment on the margins you have seen and I'm sure you'll have some questions
on this, that globally margins be it on the P&C side or on the life side remain at the
highest level. So this growth -- this accelerated growth I've just discussed about, does not
impact in a negative way the technical margins and we remain extremely focused on the
technical margins.
Third comment and I'm sure you will also have questions on this, it's not totally easy to
read the result of the -- of our asset management business and we'll come back to this
later. But let me just tell you that we are on track with our plan and we confirm our targets
on the asset management.
Last but not least, we continue to reduce costs and the Q1 is in -- on track with the targets
that we had announced at our Investor Day. And we see benefits in having a stronger
growth and continuing to reduce the absolute amount of costs.
Thank you. And I give the word to Cristiano.

Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. And thank you for Frederic. Frederic just mentioned, we are
very pleased with these results, as they confirm our focus on value generation and the
profitable growth.
Before, we open the Q&A, I would like to spend a couple of words to explain the main
drivers of the Solvency II ratio movements during the quarter. Out of the total delta of 10
points, we can isolate seven points, driven by the expected implementation of regulatory
changes. Specifically, we have one point impact from the lowering of the Ultimate Forward
Page 2 of 17

FINAL

Rate as required by EIOPA 3 percentage points from EIOPA changes of the reference
portfolio which we use to discount the liability as well.
And three percentage points from the treatment of the French IRP business agreement
we had with the regulator. A part of this seven points, when we look at the other part, our
normalized capital generation contributed to more than four and half percentage points
or if you want to compare after dividend accrual, around 3 percentage points. So, the
partial redemption of subordinated debt, in line with our deleveraging strategy costed us
one percentage point.
The positive impact of M&A, net of acquisition was below 2 points. I recall you we had
acquisition in the first quarter. Financial variances had a negative impact of around 6
percentage points, mainly driven by the combination of the following industry rates and
the widening of the Italian BTP spreads.
I would like also to add the effect of having Generali Leben in the 31st of March, accounts
had a one percentage point impact negative. And I hope this is helping explain the bridge
between the two periods. I would like to conclude, adding that our estimated group
solvency ratio at the end of April stood at 212%, also benefiting from the amount in gross
sale of Generali Leben.
Many thanks for your attention. Let's now open the Q&A session.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)
(Operator Instructions) Operator, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. The
first question is from Peter Eliot with Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Sorry to start on solvency, but that was very helpful those moves
you just gave us. I guess within that, the market movements were a little bit more than I've
been expecting, based on the sensitivities that you had disclosed. I'm just wondering if
there's any particular reason there or if you think that the sensitivities that you last
disclosed are still quite in the current environment? This will be the first question.
the second one, just looking forward on the solvency, I believe that new proposals after
the end of this year the country VA will kick in at lower levels. If those -- that's correct and
those regulations, were already in place today. Can you say what benefit you would get
on your ratio from that? I assume the sensitivities would then be the sort of plus or minus
7 percentage points in both directions once that was enforced?

FINAL

And then finally, separately, I was wondering if I could just ask on the asset management. I
mean I guess the earnings growth was a little bit -- it was up, but was a little bit slower
than we've seen or given the development where we've seen there, and I'm just
wondering if you could perhaps comment on -- you said it was difficult to read. I was
wondering if you could give us a bit more help in understanding sort of economically the
progress there? Thank you very much.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Thank you very much Peter for your questions. So let's start from the first question which
is the market movement likely higher than expected in your sensitivities. So, let me try to
clarify that the driver for the drop on the market variance is as you know the interest rate
sensitivity.
And then, as you know, our sensitivity on the BTP movement which is calculated on the
movement of the swap rate above the swap rate, had a little higher effect than what was
there explained in the sensitivities.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second question related to the fact of the country VA kick-in level. I'd like to recall
you, as you know that what is going to be approved by year-end '19 by the local regulator
having it been proposed by the European commission changes, is not a change of the
mechanism per se. It's just a change of the threshold above which in you activate the
mechanism. What does this mean, from the sensitivity standpoint, what happens is that
you would have a lower attaching point of movement, asymmetric movement between
the reference portfolio of EIOPA and the BTP. That will trigger this.
But, sensitivity speaking, we have some sensitivity as we said in the benefits at the level
of the seven percentage points should not change. But on the solvency of Italy, CEE would
have triggered a better value starting from a lower spread movement on the BTP. And as
you know the trigger point has been decreased from 100 basis point to 85 basis point.
Then I give the word to Frdric for other question.

A - Frdric de Courtois
Good morning, Peter. On asset management, as I said at the beginning it's not totally
easy to read these results. So the increase of 5% of the operating results and of 24% of
the net results, just to focus on the operating result. The first factor that you need to have
in mind is that we have not consolidated in the Q1, our new boutique and especially
Sycomore. And we will do it for the first half, but we haven't done it for the Q1.
If we had consolidated the boutique in Q1, the increase of the operating result would have
been 10% instead of 5%. So as you see the first part of the answer. Second part of the
answer, as you know that we are focusing more on private assets indeed for Generali
balance sheet or for third-party asset management, there is some seasonality in the fees
we received especially on private equity and real estate, and it also has an impact on the
Q1 results.

Page 4 of 17



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2019-05-16

So to conclude, we absolutely confirm the ambition of the asset management and the
linear progression of the results of the asset management business, until over this year
and the coming years.

FINAL

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

That's correct. Thank you very much. And could I personally just come back quickly on the
second, one the country VA, I can probably go into the sums. But just wondering if you
could confirm whether that would kick in at current levels? And also are you able to
quantify the benefit that you would get from that equivalent so?

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Hi, Peter. So just try to clarify this point. Also the answer for the first question on the
asymmetric movement in the market. In the sensitivities you use to show the movement
of the BTP, being each sensitivity, a stand-alone sensitivity than above the swap curve,
when you have the cross effect of swap rate decreasing, the corporate bond decreasing,
changing the reference portfolio weight of EIOPA -- of Italian BTP as it happened in the
review of the first quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

you have a cross effect of joint movement, which are against the potential threshold
activation. So just to clarify that this would have not triggered at the first quarter and this
would have not triggered even at the levels you are observing today. And this is the
reason why you get this extra sensitivity, because this has not been triggered. I hope I
answered your point.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Yes. I think I was just looking for the benefit that you would get the step of discontinuity as
and when the country period kicks in, but I can follow up offline.

A - Frdric de Courtois
Principally on the sensitivities as we disclosed there.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
The next question is from James Shuck with Citi. Please go ahead.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Good afternoon, everybody. A few questions from me, please. Firstly,
the outlook for the tax rate at the group levels you flagged the reduction in the Italian
rate. So I think your effective tax rate has historically been about 34% going forward, kind
of maybe a little bit less. But just keen to know what the guidance is that tax rate going

Page 5 of 17



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2019-05-16

forward, please? And whether that has actually been captured already in your at least 6%
EPS growth target?

FINAL

Secondly, as I've mentioned, third again, I think you split out third party AUM and the total
AUM I think that includes Banca Generali. Could you give me the actual assets under
management that relate purely to BAM division only please?
And then just thinking about how the margins on those assets have developed in the
quarter. I think there were some plans to increase the charging on some of the insurance
assets, so I just want to see whether that's come through at Q1, please.
Next question was around the acceleration growth point, but particularly on the Life side.
As you mentioned you've seen the net inflow very strong in the quarter EUR 4 billion or so
up about 60% year-on-year, it seems though that unit linked were down, lapses have
done a bit better and you're selling more traditional product, which is not necessarily the
product that you want to be selling. And as a result of that, the only business value is
actually down slightly in the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

What's the outlook for the new business value growth going forward, please? It seems to
me that you're saying lower margin things except that maybe unit-linked might come back
a little bit, but it seems a bit of a struggle to see the accelerated growth coming through
in the life business value.
And just very final quick one. Can you tell me the contribution to operating profits from
Generali Leben please in 2018. Now that deal is closed. Thank you.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Okay. Hi, James, it's Cristiano. So first point, the effect you're seeing in this quarter is as
we explained, driven mainly by an effect of the lower taxation in Italy our a component
and a lower -- a higher base of deductible earnings in China. This is a movement on the
quarter, you should not focus only on the tax rate of this quarter. The guidance stays
always in the 30% to 33% range, and this is the range onto which we built the plan and
there is no change on the party related to the -- on the plan related to this.
Then, related to the second question on the Asset under Management and non-third
party, I'm not sure if I get your point. You would like to have this split between Banca
Generali and the Assets under management third party? yes. I give the word to Frederic.

A - Frdric de Courtois
Hi, James. On the third party asset management, just to tell you, we had EUR 72 billion of
third party asset management at the end of the year and it moved to almost EUR 84
million, so it's a plus EUR 12 billion. Then the Banca Generali impact out of this is EUR 3
billion, so about one quarter of the increase. Then I do not give you the split for the
quarter on the inflow the market value and so on, but, I guess, I hope I was clear in my
answer.

FINAL

Then moving to the life net inflow, yes, so you're right. The life net inflow has been
extremely strong. You're also right that we've sold less unit-linked in Italy and in France
compared to 2018. This is obviously due to the impact of financial markets at year-end.
Interesting to see that it was not the case in Germany. We've continued to increase unitlinked sales in Germany which by the way is a good sign on the integration of our channels
in Germany.
An additional comment on fees -- two additional comments on fees. The first one is that
the protection sales are extremely strong, so in Q1 we've increased the new business and
protection by 13%. And by the way we see the technical margin -- the positive technical
margin flowing in, in the P&L on that. So strong protection sales.
And my last comment which is something that we're going to discuss next week in
London, you know that, especially in Italy, we sell more and more product only with
maturity guarantee So what I would call ultra capitaliized with very good margins.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

I guess why is the new business value not growing?

A - Frdric de Courtois
The new business value is not growing, because of the lower unit-linked business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. On the last one -- on Gel --

A - Frdric de Courtois
On Gel, James, I hope to be clear. Being disposed entities, the impact of Generali Leben
in the 2018 results on operating profit was zero, because it was fully accounted under IFRS
5 principle. So this is the way we account it. I hope I gave you the clear answer with the
figure of the year-end result disclosure.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Yes. Maybe I'm misunderstanding it, but the -- if I look at the German life divisional results
for 2018, I thought they still had the Generali Leben in it. If I'm not correct?

A - Frdric de Courtois
No. It is not correct. When we do the comparison like-for-like, we always make the
comparison ex IFRS 5 entities, in order to allow you to have the best comparison in the
trend between the entities, which are now in the group what would have been their
contribution last year. So I think, it is a fair way to represent it and I recall you last year
results from Leben was also impacted from changes in asset allocation, which is not the
recurring value result you can extract, as we already discussed with you in the year end '18
results.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

FINAL

The 424 million operating results at Generali Leben -- sorry German life was reported in
2018, I agree you changed the like-for-like when you report. But it seems like the reserves
are still included at the full year 2018 and it seems like the profits are included in the
operating result. Maybe I can take that off-line if I need to.

A - Frdric de Courtois
No, James but I confirm you, it is not that we can go on off-line. It's really the straight and
strict application of the IFRS principle. Really the moment I sign or I have the knowledge of
the high probability to have this realized. I have to take this in this IFRS specific category,
which is final net contribution and take everything out from the operating results
contribution. That was already done in 2018, after the signing and so everything has been
clear about.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Okay. That's great. Thank you very much.

Operator
The next question is from Andrew Ritchie with Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

I wonder if you can give us a bit more color behind the strong non-life result. The
combined ratio was kind of flattish year-on-year, despite the fact, I think in Q1 '18, you had
a very, very benign man-made kind of average nat cat. So just a bit more color that manmade experience, what is the experience on the combined ratio would be useful.
Second question, stock rates. German bond yields are back to the lows of 2016 pretty
much. What -- has there been any change in the group's reinvestment strategy year-todate in terms of geography, generation or any other measures you're taking to further
address the decline once again, back to the lows in reinvestment rates? Thanks.

A - Frdric de Courtois
Good morning, Andrew. I'll start with the technical profit and the combined ratio. So, I'll
comment on the claims ratio, but the basic necessity is that the current year claims ratio,
excluding cat and man-made -- is actually -- so attritional if I may say is actually improving
by 0.8 points, so let me give you a bit more color on this.
The first comment is that you are right. We had a quite benign quarter on cat, so we had a
positive impact on cat. Then we had a negative impact on man-made. We have some
more man-made compared to last year -- first quarter last year. And last but not least, we
had in the first quarter less result on previous years. So if you restate everything again
current year attritional claims ratio is improving to Q1 last year by 0.8 points.

FINAL

Andrew, it's Cristiano for the second question. So indeed, rates are low and we are
managing strictly according to our investment strategy as announced already during the
strategic plan. For your information, if we just compare the current year quarter-overquarter all on the book, excluding the disposed entity because I would like not to talk
about the sensitivity of Leben being not an issue of Generali anymore.
We are basically stable current yields. We are matched against our liabilities in our duration
and we are pursuing the strategy to invest in more private debt and infrastructure as
announced, which is important for us to keep some premium above the bond. And above
the Bond itself you may be having seen the result of the allocation on German governing
bond of the group. We are absolutely not big investor in this asset class. So, we are
basically matching the liabilities. Keeping the real asset strategy live and managing the
dilution. Also thanks to what Frederic said on the technical side, we are working with a very
profitable saving business underwriting with the new products, especially when we were -the one mentioning in Italy and the strong new production as well with the organization in
Germany.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

The next question is from Niccolo Dalla Palma with Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.

Q - Niccolo Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. So a couple of questions on the business on the P&C side. So Q1 saw
3% growth after, I think six years of negative reported growth, I appreciate the like-for-like
in constant perimeter. But is it -- are you happy to say is the turning point and just making
sure that levels of Q1, if we start extrapolating that? Or is there anything specific to Q1?
And within that, Italy is things have turned the corner as well. Are you happy with that,
going on for a bit more? Is the market disciplined enough not now to grow again a little bit
in motor? So anything on outlook there will be helpful.
And on the life side, you mentioned on the flows in Asia and France, the lower surrender.
Is there anything structural to this? Or was it just specific to the quarter? And lastly, a bit on
Solvency II. Can you just quickly remind us of the future impact of the pension treatment
for coming years? Just a refresher of that will be helpful.

A - Frdric de Courtois
Good morning, Niccolo. So, on P&C top line, so we're happy with the growth that we have
of 3.1%. A few comments on this. The first one on Italy. Italy is starting again to grow. We
had 0.7% growth in Italy, which is linked to the fact that we -- the average premium -- the
average motor premium in Italy is now stable and unlike last years, which is good news.

Page 9 of 17

FINAL

Plus the fact that we have taken over the deep fleet contract in Italy for the state vehicles
and which we know well because, we had it before so we know that it is a profitable
contract.
So the Italian situation has improved on volumes. Apart from Italy we continue to see
relatively strong growth across the board, this is especially the case in Australia. And see,
France is growing well. If I had one explanation, but it will be too simple, I would say that,
our strategy to sell modular products including more guarantees and services is giving
some results. But I wouldn't say that this is the only explanation.
On the life side, so I'll comment in Asia and I'll let Cristiano comment on France. So, in
Asia, we had very strong business in the Q1. So more or less, if I look at the net inflow, the
net inflow in the Q1 is increasing by close to EUR 900 million, and let's say that it's half a
more premium than last year and half less surrenders. So why do we have less
surrenders, because in fact last year was exceptional, the Q1 last year was exceptional,
because we had a generation of product coming to maturity. So we had a lot of
surrenders last year. So I would say that this quarter in China is more normal than the
quarter last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Maybe last comment on China, before I give the word to Cristiano. So you know that in
China, the Q1 based on how the Chinese market works is very much linked to beginning
of the year campaigns and very much focused on savings products, which are less
profitable than what we have all over the year.
In other words, we've sold in China in the Q1 more savings product and less protection
product that we usually do and it will be smooth over the year as we are starting again to
sell more protection products and less savings products and it had a negative impact
from the NBV in Asia and one of the group.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Thank you, Frederic. To complete the second question on France. Is it structural lower
surrender rate? I can confirm you, since last year, I mean, 2017 changes, I think it is a very
structural change coming from the fact that the tax benefit after September 2017 has
been different in the product.
So, the people having older product are less prone to surrender, because there is less
benefits to open up a new contract after. So, from this point of view, we deal this as a
structural and unfortunately this behavior has not been accounted for in our solvency II
models, because on the contrary, what happens is that the regulator asked to, let's say a
little bit strengthened the dynamic behavior of the policyholder. And apparently even
when you look at your new business value, you have a much higher elasticity, versus the
interest rate movement. But the one that you are really observing in the figures. By the
way this is also a factor of slightly affecting lower new business value when you look at the
figure on our French business.
On the third question, how do we treat under solvency II, the IRP business the pension
business in France? There has been an agreement with the regulator, that this business
Page 10 of 17

Date: 2019-05-16

FINAL

being treated in this regime IRP, which for the people who doesn't know allows to treat in
a kind of solvency I like approach in the business, because of the longer term and maybe
because of the lack of final regulation in Europe around that, had an agreement of
accounting for the unrealized capital gain, net of some technical shortfall in longevity risk,
which are the longevity charges.
I always mention when I speak about the lower technical impact of both. You have capital
gain minus charges. At year-end '16, we were allowed to account for 100% of this figure.
For the whole year for this year of '17 we were allowed to have 75%, year '18 50%, and
year '19, 25% and the year '20, which is the asymptotic landing point of 15%. So we have
still a small impact of let's say about slightly more than one point in the next year to be
expected around this agreement.
What is important to know, is that this year, our digital effect, so you are -- at year-end, an
amount. And the first quarter you report immediately the digital loss, that's why you see
this three percentage point impact in fact in our Solvency as we disclosed in our own
funds supplementary information at the year-end '18. Hope, I gave you sufficient visibility
on that treatment.

The next question is from Farooq Hanif with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. Thanks very much. Just very quick question. So you mentioned the strong
growth in nonmotor in your mix which clearly is something that you've been wanting to do.
How much of that is coming from Italy and what proportion of your business in Italy now is
it nonmotor in P&C?
And secondly, on the technical margin in life which is elevated. You mentioned the higher
protection mix. So presumably, it's sustainable for the rest of the year? Thanks.

A - Frdric de Courtois
Good morning, Farooq. So yes, we of course, post to develop the matter. In Italy, actually
if you look at the figures, so first on premiums the mix in Italy in Q1 is around EUR 500
million motor and EUR 700 million nonmotor. Nonmotor was slightly positive, but close to
zero and actually, because of the precontract that we've taken, our motor grew close to
2% in the first Q1. So I would say that's a bit counterintuitive because we try to develop
nonmotor, but in the Q1 motor grew more than nonmotor.
Then on the technical margins, so I think your question was related especially to
protection, right? So it's difficult to predict the future of volumes, but protection is a high

Page 11 of 17

priority for us and for our distribution channels. Actually, I'm expecting more protection
sales in Asia during the rest of the year. So, if everything holds in other countries, I would
expect that again, this is a high-level guess that protection sales and new business could
accelerate during the year. But again, I'm probably just -- I take a small risk in seeing fees.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you very much. A few questions. The first one is, what is the amount of
investments in alternatives? You mentioned, infrastructure and also in private funds.
The second is if I take the EUR 616 million adjusted figure, what ROE is that equivalent to
you have an 11.5% before -- over 11.5% target on that. And then the final question, just
going back to solvency, at the beginning I think there was a discussion around and you
said that sensitivities have changed. I just wonder if you can potentially give us some
update on the current sensitivities to the BTP and the risk-free? Thank you.

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Hi, Michael. So, speaking about specific amount on investment -- on seeing this strategy,
we do not disclose this amount. I just confirm you that our plan has a 3-year time horizon
to invest around EUR 20 billion among real assets between infrastructure, private debt,
real estate, and private equity.
Second question related to the return on equity. I mean, if you just take the quarter, given
the impacts of the capital gain, you are at a higher projected level on the year. But on the
normalized effect, we are absolutely in line with what we are accounting. And if not slightly
higher due to this impact with respect to what we have disclosed in the strategic plan
target.
The third question related to solvency update and sensitivity, basically, the sensitivity did
not change in. I mean the meaning, maybe I was not clear in the point. The fact that when
you measure a sensitivity of a BTP spread movement, all the swap curve which is the first
important point, because there is clear reference rate for solvency in swap curve, you
need to take into account different facts.
When you disclose the sensitivity in BTP at year-end '18 at 7 percentage points, where the
sensitivity is where all else equal, a movement of a few basis points would have triggered
this effect that becomes specific VA What happened in this quarter, is that the joint effect
of higher BTP spread, lower risk free rates and in lower corporate bond rate and lower
rate of the BTP in the EIOPA portfolio, which is the reference point onto which you

calculate the difference, created a in time negative movement, versus what you were
expecting. So everything moved, it was not a single, stand-alone movement of mobility.
That's why you should not have done this calculation with the seven percentage point, but
you should have done this with the one we found the activation of the country rate, which
was 12 percentage point.
Sorry for the long explanation, but we are thinking about jointly movement of four
different animals, and among these four animals there were many other small babies,
which are all in the different of the government's bond and the other corporate spread
rates in the EIOPA portfolio. So it's quite complex. But basically message is four different
things moving together, all in the opposite direction not allowing you to trigger a standalone sensitivity to seven. Hope these were clear.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

If I may just -- I think I understand and I love the faces of the little baby kind of mirroring.
But the -- so if I understand the activation on change would benefit by 12 points, if it
happens. And the fact that the activation didn't happen and that all these things move. Is it
that the problem or the seeing we didn't calculate properly, will the activation point move?
Or is it that all these the BTP and the swap, et cetera, created a kind of correlation, which
increased the market movements?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Frdric de Courtois
Just to clarify your first point the activation, when it happens is not 12 points, it is the
difference in sensitivity versus 100 basis points movements moves from 12 point to 7
points. Then, when you speak about the movement and the market change, it is not that
they are uncorrelated. When you do a sensitivity, you need to create a stand-alone
movement, then you have the so-called joint effect.
The point here is at year-end I told you that we were basically less than 2 basis points
from the activation, but the delta against which you move is again a moving factor
because, the delta onto which you have to measure the movement of the BTP is not
stable, these changes, depending on the corporate bond change, the government
change and as well the weight because if they look at changes that reference portfolio as
they did the weight of the Italian BTP could change the basis.
So, there was a joint effect of -- on one side we have a movement, but on the other side
of the reference point your thermometer change in degree. You see we are not more in
the Kelvin, we are in the Fahrenheit just to explain it because, we changed the reference.
This is the complexity of this system. Unfortunately, you cannot predict the movement, the
joint movement of four different elements that contributes to the activation trigger.

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thank you very much. A couple of questions. I have a little bit more simple than
the last one. Firstly, coming back on unit-linked sales. you're seeing recovery so far in Q2
on the back of market recovery. And then secondly on P&C, just wonder can you update
us on whether the Italian banks are having any disruptive impact on P&C pricing. Thank
you.

A - Frdric de Courtois
So, Q2 is on the April, I would say and high-level comment slight recovery compared to
Q1. The banks, we see no impact on our business in Italy.

The next question is from Giuseppe Mapelli with Equita. Please go ahead.

Q - Giuseppe Mapelli

{BIO 7269722 <GO>}

Yes. Got to answer two questions. The first one is on your combined ratio. You stated that
your underlying combined ratio improved by some 80 basis points year-on-year, can you
give us an idea, and isolate what has been the impact on nat-cat in the first quarter?
Thank you.

A - Frdric de Courtois
First -- Good morning, Giuseppe. I said that on the claims ratio, not on the combined we
had a reduction of the attrition of current interest ratio by 0.8 points. We have a slight
deterioration of the acquisition costs, because globally business mix is moving towards
nonmotor especially in Austria, in CEE and in Spain, so globally we have a slight
deterioration of the expense ratio by 0.4 points.
So if you do the sum of the two halves, I have minus 0.8 on the claims ratio, plus 0.4 on
the acquisition ratio, so let's say minus 0.4 on the combined. Then on the impact of cat
nat, so not including man-made in the Q1 '19 impact was 0.9 points, compared to 1.5 last
year. So an improvement of 0.6, 0.7 points.

Thank you. And just another question on your motor DPL[ph] trended your experience in
Italy because someone is saying that the pressure has once again increased in terms of
average premium. Can you share with us what's your view on the market and also for the
outlook for 2019? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Frdric de Courtois
What we see in Italy, is as I said now flat average premium. So it remains the competitive
market, I confirm it. But flat average premium is much better than what we had before.
The good news is that the frequency are continuing to decrease, so I see a relatively
significant improvement of the profitability in Italy due to the, as I said the flat average
premium on one hand and the decrease in frequencies.

The next question is from Johnny Vo with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you. Just asking about the remittance ratio and the remittances to the holding
company. I guess, you're adjusting the shareholder structure or the group structure, the
financial structure of the group. And given the solvency move -- has moved for this
quarter, has there been any impact on the remittance profile of the group?
The second thing is just again on the remittance. Is the remittance following the organic
capital generation of the group, or is it exceeding the capital generation?
And just third question, you make a point with regards to the current yield on your book.
But what is the economic reinvestment rate? Are they now above the previous
reinvestment rates or below the reinvestment rates? This is on an economic basis. Thank
you.

A - Frdric de Courtois
Hi, Johnny. So, first of all, the restructuring of the holdco core and the different
intermediate holdco core group. I confirm you that we are working in order to optimize
our capital management framework as we announced at the group plan in November.
So, this is going on which is also consistent with all the operations and also the way we will
manage the cash upstream. On the fact that the movement in solvency II whether, this is
impacting or not our remittance capacity, I absolutely confirm that there is no absolute
change in that, because we are still as I recalled you the 212% end of April and solvency
level is a very solid one, which is absolutely in the middle of our risk appetite range,
preferred range and there is nothing which is changing there, our structure of the plan.

On the second question, organic cash generation, is it exceeding the capital generation? I
mean, given the high-level of capital generation we have which is well above even the
dividend capacity as you know which is more than twice That one, I confirm you that the
capital generation is higher than the cash generation.
But as we explained also in November that we continue to explain, this is just taking the
time to see this increase going forward, thanks to the higher profitability of the new
products and the total transformation that we'll be managing through our liabilities, which
are the product. The third question related to the current year, the reinvestment rate --

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

Economic reinvestment rate.

A - Frdric de Courtois
Yeah, I mean by economic investment rate, I hope if we can agree on the definition, it is
the IRR of the bond you are buying, so --

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

The market value, which is a little bit, what, not the book accounting ideally.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Frdric de Courtois
Yeah, the market value investment rate versus the previous quarter of 2018, there are
even in some cases due to the strategy of reinvestment in the so-called private debt and
the real asset. We have a slightly higher rates versus first quarter '18 of reinvestment in
non-life and basically stable in life. This is the actual situation in the group.
