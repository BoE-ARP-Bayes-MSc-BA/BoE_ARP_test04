Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Thanks, Kjetil. I'm very pleased to announce second quarter result of NOK 812 million. The
operating result for the quarter is strong at NOK 645 million. This is a 16% increase from
the corresponding period last year. Good growth in savings combined with strong
insurance results and continued good cost control, contributes to the strong result for the
quarter. The underlying solvency margin is strengthened with 3 percentage points in the
quarter to 163%. Including transitional rules, the solvency margin is 167%.
If you move to slide number 3, you see that in our Capital Markets Day in May, we
introduced this picture to illustrate our twofold strategy in relation to active management
of our Guaranteed Products, as well as our growth in Savings and Insurance. This is a
continuation of our strategy for the last ﬁve years, but reﬂects that we are now in a strong –
that we now have a strong balance sheet and are in a long-life solvency position. This
means that we have the ﬂexibility to use the balance more actively and that the use of
capital and cost going forward will be led by what creates shareholder value and not only
by reducing risk.

Bloomberg Transcript

In our front book, we will further develop our leading position within occupational
pension and use this position to grow within private savings. Growth within occupational
pension and private savings drives the growth within asset management. In addition, the
asset management area grows by winning external mandates that is due to strong
performance on administration and also our strong position as a leading asset manager
on the sustainability.
Meanwhile, we continue to aim for at least 150% solvency ratio and manage for gradual
capital release as the capital need for our Guaranteed business now have peaked.
If we then move to slide number 5 to – let's take a closer look into these quarter's 3%
points movement in the solvency position. This movement can be divided into three main
components. The ﬁrst is the model changes and improvements we have done in addition
to assumption changes from EIOPA. Our internal improvements have given us 1%
negative movement in relation to changes in cost allocation. The assumptions from EIOPA
has given us 0.6% positive movement. The main eﬀects come from increased volatility
adjustment, which has then, of course, positive eﬀect. This is contracted by some increase
in the equity stress.
The second main element is due to market and business mix developments. In Norway
and Sweden, loan interest rate has fallen by 9 basis point in the quarter. And this has, of
course, led to a negative eﬀect on solvency. On the other hand, returns have been strong
and this has led to increase in buﬀer capital. And on top of this, the conversion from
deﬁned beneﬁt to paid up policies has been very long in the quarter. In sum, this has led
to a 1% point increase in the solvency margin.
Thirdly, a good result for the quarter has built 3% in solvency margin, of which half is
allocated to dividend. So, we book a 1.5% increase from this element.

Then, let's move to slide number 5. And to sum it up, we also see a strong result growth
building our buﬀer capital that has increased the solvency margin in the quarter. Equally
important, we see that the sensitivities for longer interest rates and falling equity market is
considerably reduced in the quarter. Now we see that a 15 basis point fall in the interest
rate from today's level will reduce the underlying solvency margin with only 6 percentage
points. Again, increase in buﬀers and increased asset duration has led to these reduced
sensitivities. In sum, we now have a strong solvency position and are robust towards
potential market stress going forward.
Then, let's move to slide number 6. We see that the strong growth in Savings segment
continues. Unit linked results grew by 18% compared to second quarter in 2017. Assets
under management grew by 14% since second quarter in 2017. During this quarter, we
have seen a ﬂat development in asset under management and this is by partly due to
some assets under management reduction in Skagen related to negative returns on
emerging markets, as well as some outﬂow of customer products.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our bank has had the positive development with 12% volume growth in retail loans during
the past year. Growth within insurance has been low, but we see now signs of growth
picking up towards the end of the quarter and the proﬁtability is very good in this
segment.
If we then move to slide number 7. Part of the growth within unit liked stems from the
Swedish occupational pension business in SPP. We now see impressive growth in our
Swedish business and premium income have increased by 22% since the same period last
year. The positive development is a result of good sales and very positive development in
net transfers. SPP has been through a substantial digital transformation, it is now
perceived to be a customer-friendly and a very strong positioned occupational pension
company in the Swedish markets.
Slide number 8. We are actively working with digitalization, our front-end and our value
chain in Storebrand, both through our own digital innovations as well as through
partnerships. In this respect, Storebrand Bank has partnered up with the Swedish savings
app Dreams. The savings app was introduced on a small scale in January, and after the
prudent launch in June, the number of users has grown to over 30,000 individuals. That
has also received top rating among savings apps in Norway. With Dreams, we are
reaching a new customer segment. A typical Dreams customer is a female under age of
30.
Slide 9. In Storebrand, we are also investing in more long-term saving solutions for our
customers and are ﬁrmly committed to our focus on sustainable investments. It is,
therefore, a pleasure to present to you another exciting new savings concept that we just
launched called the bølge or wave in English, where we give customers the opportunity
to invest directly into the 17 sustainable development goals.
In other words, you can invest directly in the development goal that is closest to your
heart. For example, we just launched a portfolio where you can invest in gender equality,
based on the analysis of what companies scored the highest based on their commitment

Page 3 of 12



Company Name: Storebrand ASA

to solving this important issue. Each portfolio consists of the top 40 to 100 companies,
contributing solving each (00:10:05). This is a concept we are looking forward to currently
develop on the near future.

FINAL

And with that, I give the words to Lars.

Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Thank you. And then, we can turn to page 10 key ﬁgures. As Mr. Grefstad presented, we
are happy with the group result of NOK 812 million in the quarter. The operating result of
NOK 645 million is somewhat better than what we expect going forward, driven by
satisfactory growth and good insurance results. The solvency capital has been
strengthened in the quarter and the capital requirement has gone down. This leads to an
improved solvency margin. The calculated tax charge has gone up in the quarter,
explaining the lower EPS after tax has been adjusted for amortization in the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning over to page 11, Storebrand Group. We see satisfactory growth in fee and
administration income. Partly, this is explained by the acquisition of Skagen, but adjusted
for Skagen and currency eﬀects, we still see a 6.5% growth year-to-date. The insurance
results are good in the quarter. The main reason is improving disability of development.
With an improved cycle in the jobs market, less people seek disability cover and some
other previously disability retired workers re-enter the workforce.
Operating costs are under good control. In the second quarter, we have exercised to
share a purchase program for employees. The program had a very good uptake this year
and the cost ended at NOK 25 million. The cost is taken in full in the quarter. While the
cost level overall is ﬂat, we continue to reallocate cost from back book to selected growth
areas. Taxes are estimated at 18% in the quarter and 17% year-to-date. Taxes payable stay
close to zero due to the historic tax losses on the balance sheet.
Turning over to page 12. This picture shows the same ﬁgures as the ones we saw on the
previous page, here broken down into the result areas: Savings, Insurance and
Guaranteed. Just to remind you, Savings include non-guaranteed savings in Norway and
Sweden, including Unit linked, asset management, and retail banking. Insurance is shortterm insurance risk (00:12:39) both P&C and Life, which can be measured on combined
ratio. And Guaranteed is the deﬁned beneﬁt plans in Norway and Sweden, including
long-tail embedded insurance risk in life longevity.
Trading experienced good growth in line with our strategy. The operating costs in this
area are increasing as a consequence of Skagen, investments in digital solutions, and
other growth initiatives. Insurance showed good proﬁts from following implemented
pricing measures; cost cutting and the general decline in disability. Guaranteed has
increased proﬁtability, despite being in long-term run-oﬀ. The conversion of deﬁned
beneﬁt plans to pay deposits is declining. The cost measures come through as planned,
and we have been able to increase prices in certain areas.

The percentage of Guaranteed reserves as a percentage of overall best reserves continue
to decline and is now less than 60% of the total. More details can be found on the
following pages. But, I will wrap it up here, so that we can open up for questions.

Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje

FINAL

Thank you, Lars and Odd Arild. The operator will now open up for questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We have a couple of questions coming through already. And the ﬁrst one
comes from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you very much. I have three questions, please. I was wondering, ﬁrst of all, if – to
just sort of understand your view of the underlying results in the quarter. I guess, if I try
and quantify the one-oﬀs, I think as I understand, that we've got probably NOK 120 million
from reserve releases, NOK 53 million from risk results and paid-up, and NOK 41 million
maybe in the other. So that if I take all of those, that would get me to sort of around about
NOK 600 million. I just wanted to check whether that was sort of in line with what your
thinking was?
The second thing and maybe just a little bit more on those reserve releases, I know you
gave us a little bit of the drivers, but I guess it's the second quarter where we're seeing
quite signiﬁcant. And I'm just wondering if you could comment on what we should expect
going forwards?
And then, ﬁnal question, next the very good development of the fee and administration
results, that I guess, if I looked at Swedish Unit linked in particular, the reserves are up, but
the income is down. And I'm just wondering if there's any sort of one-oﬀs in there or
whether that's natural margin, sort of pressure or perhaps you could just comment on the
outlook there? Thanks very much.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Thanks, Peter. You mentioned a couple of gains and it has been your ﬁrst question. I
would say that some of the reserve release is in excess of what we expect on a normalized
basis. I would measure that that approximately NOK 50 million. All the other things are
basically things that are within normal variations and should not be accounted for as
anything special. So, net-net, we're talking less than NOK 50 million in things that are of
an extraordinary nature here.
In terms of reserve releases going forward, for example, this business is probably a longterm cycle eﬀect and we should probably not expect quarterly changes on that. So we – I

FINAL

would guess that we will continue to see low visibility in the coming quarters with a very
sound jobs market in Norway these days.
And on fee and administration income and the margins in Unit linked Sweden, we've had
particularly the strong growth in Sweden in the tick-the-box market, which is a low-margin
market, but that comes on top of the high-margin business that we have in the core
business and furthermore, it may be some kind of periodic eﬀect here. We don't see a
general margin pressure in the Swedish Unit linked business, which is called Other
Occupational Pension, which is a core pension product that we sell. So, all in all, we're
pretty, pretty – we're pretty conﬁdent both with the Swedish Unit linked business, as well
as the results that we present this quarter.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

And the next questions comes from Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is
now open.

Q - Jonny Urwin

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, all. Good afternoon. Just two for me. Firstly, the EIOPA stress tests are ongoing. I
wondered if you had any initial observations or color that you could share with us at this
early stage, please.
And secondly, just on the model change, so it seems that the direction of travel on model
changes over the last few quarters is now negative. I was just wondering of you now
taking the opportunity to strengthen the model's conservatism now the ratio is in a bit
better shape, just trying to tighten things up? Thanks.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Thank you, Jonny. If I'm talking over the (00:18:06) EIOPA stress test, yes, we are
conducting the EIOPA stress test. One of the stresses is on increased interest rate,
(00:18:15) is very unlikely to view increased interest rate, that's a risk factor again. We have
not completed the survey. I will not comment on it now. I think, I will have rest of the
companies to make published statements on this Q1 next year. I'm even prepared to do
so.
When it comes to the model changes, it is a matter of (00:18:44) is based on recent
assumptions that will change from one model to another and this is within, what I would
say is natural variance from one quarter to another.

Q - Jonny Urwin

Okay. Thank you.

And we have one more question and that's from Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please
go ahead. Your line is now open.

FINAL

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Hi. Yes. Good afternoon. Question on the Insurance segment. First of all, Lars, you
mentioned there was NOK 50 million of reserve releases kind of out of the ordinary. In
which parts of the Insurance segment were these or if the other reserve releases, if you
could shed a bit more light on whether it was P&C or disability, et cetera?
Then, the second question is we heard today from one of your nonlife competitors that
very bearish outlook, or actually from (00:19:54) competitors, a very bearish outlook on
the Norwegian motor insurance market. If I look at your ﬁgures, it doesn't seem to me that
that had a big impact, and was just wondering are you seeing the same negative trends as
your competitors in Norwegian motor insurance? Thanks.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl

Bloomberg Transcript

If I take the ﬁrst on the insurance release, it's primarily related to disability and disability
comes primarily through on page 15, where you have the last line called pension related
disability insurance Nordic, that is Norway and Sweden. But, it's primarily from the
Norwegian business, where we have this release related to lower disability. Peter
mentioned also that we have a good risk result in paid-up policies of NOK 53 million. A
part of that is also related to less disability (00:20:56) a component in that market.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

When it comes to motor insurance, that while P&C is quite a limited part of our total
insurance oﬀering, and Storebrand is much more life insurance – disability insurance and
so on. So, I think the composition is very diﬀerent when you see us towards other P&C
companies. So, in that respect, you don't see that much impact within our portfolio. And I
don't have any more information actually about the motor insurance impact as such on
our – in our results since they're quite limited.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

How much is by the way a motor from P&C premiums roughly?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I think you look at the premium composition in the presentation, you'll see that the
personal lines was one-third more or less, and then again, you have the pure P&C, which
is probably a half of that, and of the pure P&C that's mainly motor, but also some housing.
Yeah.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

All right. Thanks.

Got it. Thanks.

Operator
And we do have a follow-up question from Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead. Your
line is now open.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Thank you. Sorry. Just a quick follow-up. Consolidation in the Norwegian markets picked
up a bit recently, I just wondered what you guys thought about that, do you expect it to
continue? Would you be open to be sort of involved in it? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Well, of course, we follow very closely what happens in the Norwegian market when it
comes to consolidation. We're about seeing now DNB and (00:22:57) joining forces
together when it comes to the P&C market, and also Nordea buying Gjensidige
(00:23:05) banking operations. We of course follow this market very closely. We also see
that this gives us a great opportunity in the markets, meaning that we will be a provider –
a direct provider, where we have a consolidation where you, well, take oﬀ some – all of
these players in the market. So, we think it's a quite good space for us going forward
when it comes to our operations and the combination with customer base we have and
opportunities to do our B2B2C strategy and get the full strength or retail oﬀering.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Do you think it hinders you that you don't have a massive P&C oﬀering?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Once again?

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Do you think it hinders the Storebrand's proposition given you don't have P&C? Would it
be helpful if you have more of a P&C oﬀering than you do?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

No. I think what you see now from Storebrand, we are very much a savings company. Its
pension and savings. And it's very strong positioned on corporate savings by building the
retail savings, also that it is supported by insurance that's very much mainly on the
personal lines that has allocation towards savings. And to have (00:24:27) one-stop
buyers in the market, we also oﬀer banking operations and P&C business. But, I don't see
Page 8 of 12



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2018-07-13

that that's as a main element that we don't have more P&C, so to say. And I also think it's
important to note for the individuals, we have a full scale P&C oﬀer for corporates. We
don't insure large claims or anything like that for corporates. But, that's another
assessment, of course.

FINAL

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks very much.

Operator
And we have Peter Eliot again from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead. Your line is now
open.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thanks very much. Just wanted to come back ﬁrstly actually on the points about the
reserve releases. When you mentioned sort of cost of just less 50% million is one-oﬀ, I
guess, if I – I think it's oﬀ top of my head that that would imply an underlying combined
ratio is more in the sort of 85% or low 80%. But you still seem to be guiding to 90% to
92% as being appropriate. Could you just square that for me?

Bloomberg Transcript

And secondly, perhaps if I could also – you mentioned Skagen brieﬂy, but could you just
say again what your – the current sort of ﬂow situation there is and what your outlook is?
Thank you.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Yes. On the combined ratio, you are right. But the combined ratio ﬁgure that you reached
there is also a result of actually very good underlying results currently due to the fall in, in
particular, in disability, but also low motor claims and low other claims that we've had in
the quarter. So, it's not going to be stable 90% to 92% in every quarter.
We have had a couple of quarters that are better. It's partly explained by reserved
releases, but also partly explained by simply low claims in this – into that couple of
quarters. Furthermore, we've had a cost-cutting program within the Insurance business,
which are giving the necessary results, so that we have a competitive oﬀering. We can use
that competitive oﬀering in increasing distribution spend, marketing spend, and other
things, in order to reestablish the growth that we have mentioned or we told you during
Capital Markets Day that we will. And this is a growth of 5% per annum and we are using
now measures to get back in growth.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

When it comes to Skagen, well, it's about some outﬂow of assets, but it's very much
according to the plan we have put forward when we acquired the Skagen. On top of this,
this quarter, as I mentioned, we have also – some of the Skagen fund has very much
emerging markets still. And based on that, we also have seen the emerging (00:27:36)
market has had a negative return. So, that also contributes to a negative element into that

Page 9 of 12



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2018-07-13

dimension of the Skagen in this quarter. But, altogether, very much in line with the plan
we put forward when we put – when we did acquire Skagen last year.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

FINAL

Thanks very much.

Operator
We have one more question before (00:28:13) And the next person who would like to ask
a question is Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Thank you. If I may continue on the market consolidation; obviously, with the moves of
Gjensidige in terms of selling the bank, has that created more kind of questions also as a
strategic rationale of Storebrand Bank for you? Obviously, you have a much bigger life
oﬀering, whereas Gjensidige is focused more on the P&C side. But does it raise questions
also from your point of view that you should deﬁnitely own the bank? And on that same
note, have you considered external bank distribution of P&C products more nowadays as
another distribution channel? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Well, we are always looking at diﬀerent opportunities in the market. But, I would say that
having large pension and savings operations, especially when it comes to the (00:29:21)
these products, it's important to have good solution when it comes to banking to support
that. So, I will not say that it changed our view of it, but as I said, we of course, are looking
at the diﬀerent modes in the market both when it comes to production and also
distribution of both P&C and banking operations.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

So, I guess that last week they had a number of parties interested in their bank. Have you
been approached by potential buyers of the banking operations?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Well, it's a small market and we know all the diﬀerent players in this market. And I think, as
I said, after that in this market this was very much Gjensidige Bank, Storebrand Bank and
the former Skandiabanken, and that was operating as a direct bank. So, now there's only
two, Skandiabanken and Storebrand Bank, and I think this is also great, it's a great
opportunity for us going forward on the banking side.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

What about the banking, external bank distribution for P&C products? Have you
considered that?

Yes.

FINAL

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, we have a small P&C operations that we just talked about. Our main insurance
operation have scaled towards our savings and pension products. And the way we look
upon our P&C business is more like an add-on to the show (00:31:04) that we provide a
full-ﬂedge of retail products for our customers, our large customer base, and we don't see
us as a more natural, well, producer for others when it comes to our insurance business.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Thanks.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

White-Collar union.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yeah. White-Collar union. We also provide insurance for Rema, which is one of the largest
