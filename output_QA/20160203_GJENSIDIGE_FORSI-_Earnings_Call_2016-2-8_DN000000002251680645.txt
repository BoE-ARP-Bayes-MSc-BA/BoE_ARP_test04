Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Gjensidige Q4 2015 and Preliminary 2015 Results
Presentation. Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to hand [ph] the conference over to Janne Flessum, Head of IR.
Please go ahead.

Janne Flessum

{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

Thank you, and good morning from me as well. As always our CEO, Helge Leiro Baastad,
will start by commencing the headlines for the quarter before our CFO, Catharina
Hellerud, commence the numbers in more detail. And then we will, of course, have the
time for a Q&A session afterwards.
Before we start, I would just like to remind you that you can download the full
presentation from our website, gjensidige.no/ir. Please, Helge?

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Janne. Good morning to all of you from me as well. We delivered yet another
very strong fourth quarter and Catharina will take you through the details later on, so I will
not use the ﬁrst slide.

So if you turn to page three in the presentation, we can comment the whole year. For the
year 2015 as a whole, we delivered another record high underwriting results and the
ﬁnancial targets were achieved by the wide margin. Proﬁt before tax, NOK5 billion; the
underwriting result, NOK3.5 billion, and that corresponds to combined ratio of 83.7%.
With discounted reserves, it's at 82.3% for the whole year.
We had growth in premiums of 4.3%, and underlying growth if you, among others, adjust
for currency and new businesses, it's 2.2%. The whole year we had a favorable underlying
frequency claims, also in fourth quarter development and the runoﬀ was 3.4% for the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

The proportion of large losses was lower than expected for the year, 4.1% versus 5.2%,
and the cost control still remains good. We are around 15% in cost ratio. We had a
ﬁnancial result of 1.5 billion, and that corresponds to a return on ﬁnancial assets of 2.6%
for the year. This gives us a return on equity of 17.4% for the full year and a proﬁt per share
was NOK7.57. As you have seen, the proposed dividend of 4.2 billion corresponding to
NOK8.40 per share.
Let me give you some more details related to our dividends, so if you turn to page four.
Based on yesterday's closing price, the proposed dividend corresponds to a dividend
yield of 6% and it's in line with our dividend policy. The dividend consists of two elements
NOK6.40 is the sense the dividend ﬂow is stipulated on the basis of the proﬁt for the year
and the dividend capacity resulting from our earnings expectations. This corresponds to
an increase in the nominal dividend of 8.5% from 2014 and the payout ratio of 84.5%.This
element shall remain high and stable in nominal terms and also grow in periods with
earnings growth as we expect going forward. NOK2.00 represents the distribution of
excess capital as part of ensuring an optimal capital structure.
So let me remind you of what I commented also of the third quarter. The dividend ﬂow
based on earnings generation will be calibrated, so that we can avoid a downward shift in
the curve of three to ﬁve years, when we will be back to normal in terms of run-oﬀ. In
addition, we will continue to free up potential excess capital over time. We will look into
further measures to optimize our capital structure among other things, further issuing of
hybrid capital within the Tier 1 criteria of the Solvency II regulation. And this is something
we will actively be looking into during 2016.
Let's then turn to the operational targets, if you look at page ﬁve, I can comment on the
operational situation. Firstly, we are pleased to have strengthened our absolute and
relative position in the Norwegian market despite a somewhat more challenging
macroeconomic situation and intense competition. The competition is -- as it has been for
some quarters. It's nothing new actually related to the competition. We are though
satisﬁed with the renewals from 1st of January, in line of the market conditions and it's
actually better than we could here. We have among other things, signed a new
commercial agreement in Norway, with the premium volume of NOK195 million with
eﬀect from 1st of January.
If I continue on the Norwegian situation, the customer satisfaction was record high at the
end of the year, which is reﬂected in the market share development. Gjensidige has

FINAL

experienced a stable development, as you can see from the chart and we have
strengthened our position relative to our main competitors in the Norwegian market. And
this is achieved in a year where we report 4.3% growth in combination with a combined
ratio of low 83.7%.
There were two reasons for this. First and foremost, it's about good customer and risk
selection. This is a continuously improvement process and it has been that for years. We
delivered a good customer experience through our capable employees, eﬃcient digital
solutions and relevance in our marketing. We have a strong brand and the bank and the
pension and saving business contribute to loyalty and broad range of products. And of
course, the customer dividend model in Norway contributes to loyalty and with the
proposed dividend, it will be another year with a signiﬁcant customer dividend to the
Norwegian P&C customers.

Bloomberg Transcript

We will continue our eﬀorts to ensure proﬁtable growth in the Norwegian markets going
forward. Further, in 2015 if we move outside Norway, we have strengthened our position
and our basis for further proﬁtable growth also outside Norway. We have acquired two
companies, Mondux in Denmark and PZU in Lithuania. 30% of earned premiums now
comes from markets outside Norway. If you start with Denmark, we have consolidated our
position in Denmark and continue growing with good proﬁtability. We have also
implemented measures in Sweden and the Baltics to ensure the implementation of best
practice and good proﬁtability in the long-term.
And with a rational and disciplined approach, we will also continue to seek new
opportunities for growth, both organic and structural in our market area. Towards the end
of 2014, in connection with our Capital Markets Day, we introduced six overriding KPIs
with clear targets towards '18. And as you can see from the table at right, we are on track
to deliver on these.
I guess I will give the word to Catharina Hellerud.

Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Thank you, Helge, and good morning, everyone. I will start by commenting the ﬁgures on
page seven. The underwriting results were strong, the best underwriting results we have
ever delivered in fourth quarter and the same goes for the year as a whole. There was
relatively little snow and winter weather during the quarter and this led to a favorable
frequency claims development. This aﬀects the proﬁtability of the motor and property
products in particular. The proﬁt performance of the retail bank and the pension and
savings have shown positive developments.
Proﬁts are better in both areas this quarter than in the fourth quarter 2014. This is primarily
due to good underlying proﬁtability, but the comparison is also tested by some nonrecurring items both in the fourth quarter 2014 and 2015. The bank continues to grow.
Lending has increased by 33% in the last 12 months, most of it loans aﬃnity group
members and in the current feeder channels. 77% of the lending volume represents
insurance customers. The bank is also an important part of Gjensidige's focus on the

FINAL

youngest [ph] segment. The investment portfolio yielded a return of 1.1% in the quarter.
The proﬁt before tax expense was 1.5 billion and 5 million [ph] for the full year.
Let me run through the results in some more detail. Moving to page eight, you will see
that we reported a strong combined ratio of 84% in the quarter, corresponding to 83.2%
from a discounted basis. The cost ratio was 16% compared to 15.3% in fourth quarter 2014.
The increase is partly because the acquired business outside Norway have the higher cost
ratio and partly because we have increased eﬀorts to ﬁt into the Baltic business.
The loss ratio was 68% which is 1.2 percentage points lower than in the corresponding
quarter in 2014. Correcting for a somewhat lower one-oﬀ gain and a higher proportion of
large losses in this quarter compared to fourth quarter 2014, the loss ratio was 2.5
percentage points lower this quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

I would like to comment to [ph] private groups in particular. Firstly, for private motor in
Norway, the proﬁtability was very good. This was actually aﬀected by little snow and
winter weather, but also due to a continuous good underlying trend. The provision for
motor in Norway was realized during the third quarter. Expected lower claims inﬂation
going forward means that the level of commissions is somewhat lower than before, which
contributes with a positive eﬀect on the short-term proﬁtability. Lower expected claims
inﬂation will, however, also be reﬂected in the pricing of these products going forward.
Secondly, property in general in Norway also showed good underlying proﬁtability. The
proﬁts in the quarter were better than in the corresponding quarter in 2014 and as a result
of fewer ﬁres and water damage claims, both frequency and average claims are lower
than expected.
Turning to page nine, you see a breakdown of the premium growth. We report a solid
5.4% premium growth in the quarter, with underlying growth of 1.4%, when currency
eﬀects and acquisitions are excluded. Our competitiveness in Norway is regarded as
good and we maintain our market share. Thus, the Norwegian insurance market is
characterized by strong competition and a somewhat decreasing growth rate. Private has
an underlying growth of 0.8% in the quarter, while commercial has grown by 1.4%.
The Nordic segment reports a growth of 10.1% [ph] and 1.4% when adjusted for currency
eﬀects and of the acquisition of Mondux. Mondux contributed 64 million to growth in the
Nordics this quarter. An increased growth in the damaged property market will be a
positive growth driver going forward in the Nordic segment. The Baltic segment reports
growth of 95.6%, after the acquisition of PZU Lithuania. Adjusting for currency eﬀects and
acquisition, the growth was 3.6%. PZU Lithuania contributed with earned premiums of 110
[ph] million in the quarter.
So page 10 shows a breakdown of the cost development. Most of the nominal increase in
costs come from the Baltics, and it's due to the acquisition of PZU Lithuania and an
increased investment relating to [ph] the Baltics business with regards to IT, tariﬀs, CRM
and distribution. In the other segment, the nominal increase in costs was virtually at
practically zero during the quarter. The corporate center is, among other things, aﬀected
Page 4 of 18



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2016-02-03

by the fact that we have made some investments in IT and security solutions, in order to
ensure that we can now integrate the Baltic business into our Group's joint IT platform in
an eﬃcient and secure manner.

FINAL

So if you turn to page 11, you will see that large losses in the quarter amounted to 261
million, slightly below the expected amount of 283 million. Around two-thirds of the large
losses are related to natural peril claims.
On page 12, I will give you some details on the run-oﬀ. The run-oﬀ gain of 231 million
corresponds to a positive eﬀect on the combined ratio of 4.2 percentage points. The runoﬀ gain is primarily related to the two Norwegian segments and conﬁrms the two product
groups that we commented on last quarter, motor TPL and workers comp. As mentioned
then, we expect to see one-oﬀ gains in these two product groups in the next three to ﬁve
years. In addition, you can see that we have had a substantial runoﬀ loss in the Baltics this
quarter. This concerns the provisions in motor TPL. There were increased claims levels
and made it necessary to strengthen the claims provisions. But we do not expect any
further strengthening of provisions in the Baltics.

Bloomberg Transcript

So moving on to the investment portfolio on page 13. The investment portfolio yielded a
return of 1.1% in the quarter. The match portfolio yielded a return of 0.8%. The held to
maturity portfolio, which is a large part of match portfolio, yields are stable and still
relatively high return of 1.2% in the quarter. The average reinvestment rate for the
investments in the Norwegian held to maturity portfolio for the year was 3.5%, while the
running yield is 4.7%. A further widening of credit spreads means that the excess value in
the held to maturity portfolio fell by around 100 million in the quarter to 1.4 billion.
The free portfolio yielded a return of 1.6% in the quarter. The widening of credit spreads,
which included for the high income, contributed to the portfolio yielding a negative
return in the quarter. Current equities also yielded a negative return, aﬀected by the
development for the shares in SR Bank. And so for the rest of the current equities were
aﬀected by losses on derivatives used as hedging instruments. And PE, hedges
(inaudible) returned 1.2% in the quarter.
The property portfolio had a very strong result in the quarter with a return of 10.7%. This is,
of course, aﬀected by the sale of our 50% of the shares in Gjensidige's property company,
Oslo Areal, in October. The sale resulted in a gain of 379 million, of which 250 [ph] million
concerns the reversal of deferred tax. Our intention is to keep property exposure at
around the level before the sale by reinvesting the concentration in property through
Oslo Areal.
Turning to page 14, you will see a table summarizing our capital position in the three
relevant perspectives. I will cover quickly on each of them.
The rating model is still in the most binding capital perspective. The actual capital
requirement is almost unchanged from the previous quarter, increasing from 15.1 billion
[ph] to 15.2 billion. Available capital is reduced by 1.7 billion, and this is largely because
labor costs and dividends for 2015 ﬁnancial year is more than the 70% of the proﬁt that we
Page 5 of 18

FINAL

take into account when calculating capital during the year. And this gives a capital
adequacy ratio, from the rating perspective of 106% at year end, which then corresponds
to a strategic buﬀer of 900 million.
But for us, the fact that the regulatory uncertainty relating to Solvency II has been
reduced, the main intention behind the statutory buﬀer is to ensure suﬃcient ﬁnancial
ﬂexibility to carry out minor M&A transactions. In addition, it should also support a high
and stable ordinary dividend.
We are planning to apply for approval of internal model [ph] during the ﬁrst half 2016.
Until the application has been granted, the standard formula will be used to calculate the
statutory capital requirement. And at the end of the quarter, the solvency margin is based
on the standard formula of 145%. The ﬁgures for the internal model perspective are set up
in accordance with the reversal of the internal model, for which we will apply for approval.
It is therefore our best estimate of the statutory solvency position, once the internal model
has been approved. At the end of the year, the solvency margin, based on the internal
model, was 187%. As is clear from our review, we have a solid capital position in all
perspectives.
In 2015, we have, for practical purposes, achieved a clariﬁcation for inclusion of the
natural perils fund as part of the Tier 2 capital. We also expect the guaranteed provision to
be assigned to the Tier 2 capital. And this means that the capacity to issue further Tier 2
capital is limited. The capacity for issuing Tier 1 capital was 2.7 billion at the end of 2015.
And it is then natural for us during 2016 to consider this further capital eﬃciency metric to
using part of this capacity. Naturally, the market terms will need to be considered
reasonable.
And for the sake of the good order, on page 15, we also show our view of the remaining
regulatory uncertainty related to Solvency II. For most of the outstanding issues, there has
been a positive development during 2015. One exception is the guaranteed scheme
provision, where there has been no clariﬁcation. The asset base starting point is that the
provision should be classiﬁed as a liability for solvency purposes.
At the end of 2015, the provision was 600 million. We still assume that the provision will
be part of the Tier 2 capital, but if FSA position is reﬂected in the ﬁnal regulation,
however, the solvency margin will be 181% in the internal model perspective and 141% in
the standard formula perspective. That is based on the ﬁgure as at the end of the year,
2015.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah, okay. Well, we have now the whole 2015 behind us, I've used the opportunity to
remind you our ﬁnancial targets and our operational priorities going forward. So if you
move to page 16, you can see that our ﬁve key priorities are towards 2018, the same as we
presented back in 2014, and our ﬁnancial targets remain unchanged. Our everyday
digital, and we will have to adapt and change in line with the development. The balance

FINAL

between preservation and innovation and between thoroughness and agility, I think will
separate winners from losers going forward.
However, the use of technology will be more and more important and in 2015, we joined
our development technology and IT resources in a single eﬀective entity, technology and
development it's named. This entity is intended to be the driving force in Gjensidige for
the realization of projects in the ﬁve key priorities, as you can see on the chart and ensure
relevant and competitiveness going forward as well. Among other things, it will be about
more pilot projects and shorter time to market, testing and launch of products and
services based on better insights and the Internet of Things within health, motor and
property. And of course, also projects related to testing on the robot technology for
simple business processes and back-oﬃce functions.
I'll give you a couple of examples, where we are already well on our way among lots of
examples actually. One is use of mass data in the Norwegian market. It's using publicly
available data for geography and buildings across all processes in the company. This is a
continuously improvement process as well. We have done this for years. And of course,
we achieve better pricing, customer and risk selection and more eﬃcient claims handling
as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

Also, what we have deﬁned as risk management in the Norwegian corporate division, we
launched a new solution for risk selection both in physical distribution and in the selfservice channel one year ago.
And during the second half of 2015, for example, around 9,000 customers in the
commercial Norway business, underwent the systematic risk scoring based on the
industry speciﬁc digital models. And this risk scoring is a consumer valuable insight into
their risks and companies, while also providing Gjensidige with the information about the
risk situation and loss prevention possibility.
Going forward this will help to make us better at predicting customers' proﬁtability and to
ensure that we attract and retain the most attractive customers. This gives us also a
continuously improvement type of work and we will continue with our concept called risk
management in the commercial lines. Put in other words, we are well prepared. And we
continue over (inaudible) to take the position at the most customer end, the general
insurance companies in the Nordic region in parallel with creating further substantial
value for the shareholders.
And ﬁnally turning to page 17, we will this year 2016, also take the time to celebrate our
200 years anniversary. And the anniversary will be celebrated by internal and external
activities throughout '16. And as you can see here, we add a crown on the night watchman
for this celebration. So thank you.

Questions And Answers
Operator

FINAL

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our ﬁrst question today comes from Matti Ahokas from
Danske Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning, Matti Ahorkas from Danske Bank. Two questions if I may, ﬁrstly on
slide number four on the dividend policy, a bit of a clariﬁcation, please. So if I understand
you correctly, you plan to grow the ordinary dividend. And what should we expect
regarding the NOK2 excess distribution? Is this a kind of normal run rate level or how has
the NOK2 been determined? And as said, what should we expect going forward? That
was the ﬁrst question.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

It was ordinary dividend and expectation going forward and extraordinary, okay. We
expect EPS growth going forward and the EPS should then also grow nominally. As you
know from our policy, ﬁrst priority, however, is high and stable, and at least 70%, given an
okay capital situation. So after third quarter, we presented a program for run-oﬀ gains for
the next three to ﬁve years. And when we look into our management forecasts and take
into consideration the development of run-oﬀ gains, we expect, as I said, the EPS will
grow in line with EPS going forward. And that we will have EPS growth going forward.
And the starting point now is 6.40. Last year the starting point was 5.90. Related to
extraordinary dividend, I think the right communication there is that we will not build
unnecessary capital. The return on equity target is 15%. And as you have seen now, the
surplus above the most binding capital requirement is NOK900 million. And that gave us
the opportunity to pay out NOK2 extraordinary. I will not guide on a speciﬁc number
going forward. But as we also said during the presentation, the Tier 2 capacity is fully
utilized.
We will, in 2016, look into Tier 1 capacity -- Tier 1 debt and the capacity there is 2.7 billion.
We will consider issuing Tier 1 in 2016 to optimize capital structure further. But we will not
utilize the full capacity and it's important for me to say that. We need to hold back an
adequate buﬀer. But, of course, it's about a reasonable size. I'm not sure, Matti, if I
answered your questions now. But if I didn't, you can try once again.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

No, I think it was much clearer. But so to round it up, you could basically say that the
NOK2 is probably a good working assumption for at least 2016, 2017 as well.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I think it's not right for me to give you your working assumptions. So my object is to be
very clear and have the same communication quarter after quarter related to the speciﬁc
Page 8 of 18

policy actually.

FINAL

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Fair enough. The second question is regarding the Baltic and Nordic business. What
should we expect regarding the premium growth and also proﬁtability going forward?
Now you have a pretty big diﬀerence between the Norwegian business and the rest of the
Nordic business, how long would it potentially take for these units to maybe reach
proﬁtability more in line with the Norwegian unit?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

If you look at the Baltic units ﬁrst, of course, they have during this quarter integrated their
portfolio, that's been bought from PZU in Lithuania this quarter. And when we
communicated the acquisition back in the beginning of 2015, we said that the plan was to
integrate this business into our existing portfolio and that we would spend 2016 and 2017
to do the integration work. We expect the Baltic business to have a negative proﬁt in '16
and '17 due to this integration work. But we expect to see proﬁtability from 2018. That has
been the plan since we communicated the acquisition. And that is still the plan that we
are working according to. And we see that's easily according to the plan so far.
If you look at the Nordic segment, it's a proﬁtable business. But we have also
communicated that we are now looking into the Swedish part of the Nordic segment. We
are working to re-underwrite part of our commercial business in Sweden. We look at
taking down some of the larger accounts, some of the large loss exposure. And we are
seeing positive eﬀects from the work that we have been doing. But we continue to spend
more eﬀort into our Swedish corporation also during 2016, but it's also working according
to plan. And we expect to see good results from the measures that we have implemented.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Is the Swedish business still loss making or was it still loss making in 2015?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

It was loss making in 2015, but it's now -- it has improved substantially since 2014.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. Thanks a lot.

Operator
We'll now take the question from Jakob Brink of ABG. Please go ahead.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Hi, it's Jakob from ABG, with two questions, please. Coming back to Matti's question on
dividends and capital, and what you just said, Helge, I think you said the maximum
capacity was 2.7 billion. Could you just conﬁrm that this would be at the maximum -- sort
Page 9 of 18

Date: 2016-02-03

FINAL

of solvency ratio of 175%? If I do at the minimum level over the internal requirement, I get
a maximum capacity of only 1.6 billion. And then I guess you want a buﬀer from that as
well. So it's an AT1 issue of around 1 billion. Is that likely or should it be closer to the 2.6
billion [ph] as you highlighted?
The second question if I understood you correctly during the presentation, you said that
you're seeing a quite strong claims inﬂation in motor Norway. So we should expect shortterm positive proﬁtability here. But that you would adjust pricing along the way. What is
actually the claims inﬂation on the -- sort of house and motor in Norway and what should
we expect on pricing here? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I can start, Jakob. We do not see claims inﬂation in motor in Norway. As we have
communicated for several quarters now, it has been a very strong frequency
development. And it has been a downward trend. So I don't think I said claims inﬂation in
motor. I said that the capacity, true capacity was 2.7 billion. And you ask if that's right
because your calculation is saying 1.6 billion. And then I think I will ask our CFO to maybe
elaborate on that question as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

When we look at the capacity to use subordinated debt, we have to consider all diﬀerent
perspectives, so the S&P perspective and also, the Solvency perspective. And it has to be
considered both on Group level and on Solvency level. And the most constraining or the
most binding, when it comes to Tier 1 capacity is the S&P model. And the capacity, the
maximum capacity is 2.7 billion. That's correct. And as I commented, we will look at using
part of this capacity by issuing Tier 1 capital during 2016.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

But isn't it correct that what you do is -- I mean you can maximum have 20% of your Tier 1
capital in Solvency II as being AT1s. Isn't that correct?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yeah. If you look at page 33, you can see, actually, how well we calculate the capacity.
That's correct.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay, I'll check that one.

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yeah. Yeah.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

And then, sorry, just coming back on the claims inﬂation. Maybe I didn't express myself
correctly, but what is actually development on pricing then in motor, going forward? Is it, I
Page 10 of 18

Date: 2016-02-03

guess, negative, then?

FINAL

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

What we comment when it comes to motor or underlying health inﬂation in motor in
Norway, we say that it has been reduced from last year, or in beginning of 2015 -- or
actually 2014, it was between 3% and 4%. And then we have now guided from the last
quarters, third quarter 2015, that you should expect -- or we expect then for inﬂation to be
more in line with 1%. And when we think about the pricing, we are looking at prices that
reﬂect underlying claims inﬂation. So this is a -- as I commented, this is part of the
explanation around the important explanation, actually, why we see lower growth rates
within especially the private segment in Norway.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I've got a couple of questions left. Just coming back
on the dividend, if I can. Clearly, there's going to be a three to ﬁve year period where your
proﬁts will be boosted by the reserve releases that you expect to book. And I just wonder
what your thinking is for what you'll do with the dividend after that. Should we expect the
regular dividend then to drop, to reﬂect the lower contribution from reserve releases or
how do you think you've got scope to increase the payout ratio, to ensure that the
dividend does not drop after that impact disappears?
And just be clear and this would be the second question, just to be clear on the -- as and
when you do issue more hybrid debt. Is the intention to then simply repay that out as a
special dividend to shareholders? And ﬁnally, probably the most boring question you'll
get today, what's the expectation for the tax rate going forward, please? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Hi, Blair. The two ﬁrst questions, and then Catharina can take the tax ﬁnally. I think we also
after third quarter commented what we will do after three to ﬁve years. We said, and we
still say, that we will calibrate the dividends green, the ordinary dividend related to annual
results, to avoid a cliﬀ after three to ﬁve years. That means that we have to calibrate this
between the ordinary dividend and the extraordinary dividend going forward. And the
short answer to your second question is yes.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Sorry, could -- Helge, could you just explain the ﬁrst part of the question again? I didn't
quite understand what you said, in terms of what will happen once the impact of the --

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

So we will avoid a cliﬀ down after three to ﬁve years. So we will calibrate the ordinary
dividend stream going forward, that you will avoid a situation with a reduced ordinary
dividend after three, four or ﬁve years. Therefore, we have to see this --

FINAL

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Okay, so you'll have to avoid that.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

You will see these two dividend streams together, actually.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay, understood. Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

And to your second question, related to Tier 1, that's the short question and a short
answer is, yes.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

That meaning that we will pay this out to our shareholders to optimize the capital
structure.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah, I thought so.

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yeah. Yeah, and when it comes to tax rate, the corporate tax rate now as from 2016 is 25%.
We expect that the Norwegian authorities are looking at taking their corporate tax rate
down further, to 22% as from 2018. And that remains to see, but that is the thing that the
authorities are communicating. So it's a -- so it should come further down over the next
couple of years.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

So 25%, trending down to 22% if the changes take place over time?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yeah, that's the signal from the Norwegian authorities. They're looking at being more in
line with Sweden and Denmark.

Paribas.

Q - Niccolo Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Hi. Just a couple of questions. Sorry to follow-up again on Blair's question on the
dividend, but you're reassured on the fact that you don't expect a cliﬀ on your ordinary
dividend after three, ﬁve years, when the runoﬀ gains diminish? Could you -- do you think
the NOK6.40 ordinary dividend leaves room for any growth in the ordinary dividend over
the next three years? Is that the way we should think about it or could that well be
relatively ﬂattish until the end of this three, ﬁve years' period?
And secondly, if you could just remind us your direct exposure to your oil sector, both in
the private equity funds and in any other asset classes, speciﬁcally the corporate bonds?
Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

It's -- I think we commented that we expect earnings growth going forward. And I also
said that we expect growth in the dividend -- ordinary dividend going forward. So yes, we
expect growth in ordinary dividend for the next few years. But when you look into
expectation for dividend growth, you have to take into consideration that after three, four,
ﬁve years, we'll have a diﬀerent situation related to run-oﬀ. So you have to calibrate -- you
have to look into the dividend split between extraordinary and ordinary. But to your
questions, yes, we expect growth in the ordinary dividend for the next few years as well.

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

And with the oil exposure, the oil exposure in our investment portfolio is within the PE
portfolio. So it's around 50%, half of the PE portfolio, which is exposed towards the oil
and oil service sector. So that is it. It's around then 700 [ph] million which is the exposure.

Q - Niccolo Dalla Palma

Thank you. We will now take a question from Jonny Urwin of UBS.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, all. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, we saw from one of your
competitors a couple of weeks ago that they're trying to put through some price increases

across the book, just to get ahead of the curve on claims inﬂation. I was just wondering
what you think about that. And -- I mean it doesn't sound like claims inﬂation is any major
issue at all, but are you planning to put through any price increases? And in which case,
on which parts of the book in particular? That would be very interesting.
And then secondly, I guess it's a bit of a more qualitative question, but on the customer
satisfaction, you're doing very well against your targets and it's all moving on. I was just
wondering how that's translating into retention and cross-sell. You helpfully mentioned
that it's helping you from a market share perspective in Norway. But I'd just be interested
to hear a bit more about the levels of retention and are you actually managing to sell
customers more from higher satisfaction levels. Thanks very much.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Your ﬁrst question, I guess you think about the presentation from Tryg related to claims
inﬂation and I think that was related to the Danish market. We see the same development
as Tryg on property and travel insurance in Denmark. And we expect price increases in
line with claims inﬂation. In addition, you can also expect from Gjensidige that we will
continuously implement new tariﬀs in Denmark. So this is a combination of pricing based
on what we see in claims inﬂation in Denmark and the introduction of new tariﬀs. Tryg
claims that they will increase prices around 3% across the portfolio. I think our comment
on that is that we maybe have been earlier with price increases in travel insurance
especially. We will not comment a ﬁgure, but we see the same trends in Denmark as Tryg
communicated.
In Norway, just to complete the diﬀerent situation, it's volatile related to property
insurance with ﬁres, freeze and natural events, so it's more volatile. But on the motor
insurance side, Catharina commented that, it's a very favorable frequent situation and we
price in line with the very low expectation for claims inﬂation going forward.
Your second question is related to customer satisfaction and (inaudible) of churn rate and
product per customer. I think the short answer and maybe Catharina could add some few
comments there as well, but the short answer is that we, on the Capital Markets Day in
2014, presented ﬁgures from our private business and SME business in Norway. And we
had the same strong situation.
I do not want to claim that we have increased our position, but, as you maybe remember,
it's an extremely unique situation with more than four products for 70% of the customer
base with a duration of 15 years. So that I hadn't heard about similar ﬁgures anywhere in
Europe actually. So more than 70% of our private book in Norway, customers with more
than four products, non-life products and they have a duration of 15 years. And that's still
the situation.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah, a brief follow-up. I just thought, as you mentioned there is a 200 year anniversary of
the company, is it totally unfair to assume that you might potentially pay an extra, extra
dividend to celebrate it?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Matti, that was a very good -- when you have anniversary, someone should give you
presents.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Exactly.

I can't comment that, Matti. It's a good question actually.

We now have a question from Steven Haywood of HSBC.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to clarify on your dividend and your Solvency II ratios,
how much of the proposed dividend is excluded or included in the Solvency II ratios that
you're currently presenting? Thank you.

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

When we look at the ratios that we are presenting, it also includes the eﬀect of the
proposed dividend. So it's included that we assume that the dividend will be paid out.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay, I understand. Thanks.

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Was that clear enough. Yes, it's less than the dividend -- proposed dividend.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Yes, that's ﬁne. Thank you very much.

We now have a question from Vittorio Sangiorgio of Twelve Capital.

FINAL

Q - Vittorio Sangiorgio

{BIO 20732870 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everyone. I had a question on the diﬀerence between the partial
internal model and standard form because there are more than 40 points diﬀerence of
coverage, and which is pretty material compared to other European peers. And I was
wondering whether you could just give a little bit of visibility of what are the key drivers
particularly in the capital requirements would make it such a diﬀerence.

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

I think if you look at page 29 in the presentation, you will see where the diﬀerence comes
from. It's a lot diﬀerent. So if you look at capital charge for non-life and health
underwriting risk, you have the main diﬀerence there. But there's also some diﬀerence if
you look at the market risk and it is -- there is a combination. It's a partial internal model,
which means that part of the capital requirement is calculated by using a standard
formula. But the main diﬀerence is within the insurance risk, but also, some within the
market risk. So I think, looking at page 29, hopefully you will get more clarity on the
diﬀerences.

Q - Vittorio Sangiorgio

{BIO 20732870 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And out of the diﬀerences, which one would be the most -- you think the one that could
be the most challenged by the regulator when approving the partial internal model?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

I think they will always like to start discussing the diversiﬁcation eﬀects. That's probably
where they will start. That's my -- at least I think that will be the assumption from our side.

Q - Vittorio Sangiorgio

{BIO 20732870 <GO>}

(Operator Instructions) We now take a question from Blair Stewart of Bank of America.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. It's possibly more of an observation than a question, but what we've seen over
the past few years, we've seen signiﬁcant excess capital being returned to shareholders.
In Q3, you identiﬁed an excess of the reserving position in the company again would be
distributed to shareholders. You're now talking about increasing the leverage at the
company to give back to shareholders. So there's invariably a reduction in conservatism at
the company. I just wonder, Helge, probably a question for you, is there a risk that that
goes too far?
