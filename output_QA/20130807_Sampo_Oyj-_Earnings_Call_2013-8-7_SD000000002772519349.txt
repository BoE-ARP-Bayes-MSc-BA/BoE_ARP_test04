Presentation
Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen, this is Jarmo Salonen and you have called into Sampo's
Conference Call on Q2 2013 Results. With me I have Sampo's Group CEO and President,
Kari Stadigh, head of P&C Insurance, Torbjorn Magnusson. And group CFO, Peter
Johansson.
As has become our tradition, Kari will start with an introduction and with the latest
developments, after which we will take whatever questions you may have. But before
handing over to Kari let me remind you that you can follow this transmission live at
sampo.com/result. And a recorded version of the call will later be available at the same
address. That is all for me and I will hand over to Kari. Kari, please?

Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Welcome to the conference call on my behalf as well. I'm very happy to present results
that beat the consensus estimates. Given the sluggish general economy in Europe and
the low interest rate environment, I would like to quote Torbjorn Magnusson, who
yesterday in our group management meeting said the result is as good as it should be.

FINAL

So should it be. This statement of course illustrates a few things. One, it illustrates our
commitment to deliver results long-term that meet our ROE targets regardless of changes
in the environment. Two, it illustrates a level of results that our dominant market position
in all three areas of operations deserve. Three, it illustrates results that are needed when
interest rates are low and the running yield in our ﬁxed income portfolios keep declining.
The only area where we missed consensus estimates was on our NAV. The main message
here were based on currency and treatment of Nordea. However, if you correct our NAV
at the end of the Second Quarter with the increase in Nordea and top share price as of
today, it is clear that our present NAV is about EUR21 of share.
Our normalized operations report the combined ratio of 88.8% for the ﬁrst six months, a
tie with the best ever results seen last spring. As I have stated then many times before, the
decisions made today are seen three years from now in our numbers. So it is especially
pleasing to compare the ﬁrst half-year numbers with our peers and be proud of the
decisions that management has made three, two years ago.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our relative performance has been excellent. In light we saw gross written premiums
grow by 10%, an improving cost ratio and a very good performance in our main
distributor, Danske Bank, with sales up 40% quarter-over-quarter. As you have seen, we
also changed the discounting rate to 2.5% for 2014.
In our associate, Nordea, the market seems to appreciate the operational performance
and strong build up of capital, core tier one ratio with now reaching 14%. As the main
(ordiner) on Nordea I would like to point out three main -- three, four main achievements
or issues.
First of all, I would like to state that Christian Clausen, the CEO of Nordea, has now in
place a winning team. I think that Nordea now has by far the best team in the Nordic
banking area and we should and we can expect them to perform.
Two, the focus on core in Nordea is necessary to reach the ROE target in the future. And
they will execute the exit from Poland is a pure statement of determined management
action. And that was very well received by us as the main owner.
Three, the continued inﬂow of customer -- customers in the right segments show how well
appreciate the Nordea concept is in the Nordic market in general. This forms an excellent
basis for future performance.
And as the last point, the sell down, the seller % by the Swedish government in Nordea
removed the overhang and improved the colleague, the and quantity of long on the
owners in Nordea. This will beneﬁt all of us in the future.
All in all, boring is good. And I see good prospects for further positive development
throughout all of our operations.

Thank you, Kari. And, ladies and gentlemen. we are now ready for your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We have several of questions at this time. Our ﬁrst
question comes from Peter Eliot. Please ask your question.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thanks very much. One (inaudible), on the non-life cost ratio within the and sort of
moving parts by country, Sweden and Denmark both showed a reasonably good
improvement, whereas and Finland deteriorated slightly. Can I just conﬁrm the Finland
cost ratio? Would that be attributed to integration costs and the Swedish and Danish
improvements, can we assume those are sustainable?

Bloomberg Transcript

And perhaps if I could just ask quickly on the life division as well what your outlook ﬁrst of
all for sales is. And you mentioned as a strong performance of the Danske channel.
Perhaps you could comment on what you said the outlook for the (Mandas) and life
channel.
And on life earnings, I guess we've come to expect a sort of reasonable stable earnings
stream for the life division, partly due to the sort of constraint of the regular and the
discount rate. But and now we've got to a position where unit link reserves have
overtaken the guaranteed reserves. Is there any reason we can't look forward to perhaps
earnings growth going forward? And I appreciate you can't ultimately word worth the
capital markets. And I'm not asking for a view on that, is that just in general terms taking
that out of the equation. Thank you.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
I begin with the cost ratio. Well, then and yes you're right. That's mainly integration cost.
But also reﬂects a high level of IT activity and building a production system in Finland.
And when it comes to the part for the cost ratio I think I've said many times that this
management team is strongly committed to improving the cost ratio every year by two
deﬁnite points. And we don't run the Company by country. So we will continue to look at
it as a group and improve the cost situation.
On life I'm not in a position to predict sales that as you are well aware of that the sales are
up and divided into two parts. One is the long-term savings, which is distributed by our
main partner and our wealth management team. And in long-term savings you are well
aware that's that they're a ﬂuctuation it's based on the general economic development.
So I don't want to take that.

FINAL

The other part of the business is pensions and they are driven mainly by tax issues. So
there is always a possibility for disruptive tax development in that. However, we haven't
seen any sign of that and the demand for the products have such with the present tax
regime is very stable. So unless there are any regulatory or tax changes, the main pension
business is stable.
The pension business, voluntary pension business is growing slightly. However, the old
products are declining and we have of course said that the weak proﬁt balance sheet is
going to decline by maybe EUR50 million, EUR200 million, EUR200 million per year,
which gives a capital (inaudible) of this (inaudible) per year.
On the earnings, such a big part of the earnings is based on the (wheat) proﬁt investment
income. So this is a long-term project to improve the unit link and risk products. And you
saw that the expense ratio is now improving. So I have used the rule of thumb that the
EUR100 million, which is 2% on the assets, is a margin which ﬂuctuates up and down. And
then 10 and 10 could be from cost rates. So an expense ratio.
And of course the management is targeting to increase the cost and expense ratio. But
compared to the EUR100 million these are small numbers. This was a long answer on a
small issue. But I hope it was helpful.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you.

Operator
Thanks very much. Our next question comes from the line of Hakon Fure. Please go ahead
and ask your question.

Q - Hakon Fure

{BIO 16623060 <GO>}

Yes. Hi guys. Good afternoon. It's Hakon Fure from DnB. I have two questions, ﬁrstly on
your serves and the P&T impressions, just some clariﬁcation. This quarter you state the
technical reserves in Finland are increased what EUR75 million. Then we have EUR37
million released in Sweden. But and this year you talk about a total prior and your claims
for certainties of EUR56 million. Should I see all these in connection or are these separate
reserve mixes?
Secondly, on your investment outlook I believe that's in Q1 you're quite positive on the
value in equities. However, looking at your investment assets by the end of Q2 I can see
no change in your equity exposure, hence an update on your investment outlook would
be interesting. And do you still see value in equities and does the expense that change in
your equity exposure there at all? Thank you.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker

The results ﬁrst of all the discount rate change in Finland led to prior losses of EUR75
million, same type of change a new set -- a new and the reserves in Sweden were aﬀected
also directly by interest rates. And that helped us by about EUR35 million.

FINAL

And then we've had a reduce of old reserves and inﬂation-driven reserve releases, as we
often have (planes) inﬂation in the Nordic region is low and our reserves are assuming a
slightly higher claims inﬂation. So the total of that was at a many euros as you mentioned.
I think the main reason you didn't see equity with being higher was that the equity values
dropped in the Second Quarter. And I think that the situation today would be a little bit
diﬀerent.
Our (inaudible) is actually depressed and the same that the only area where we see value
is in equities. But with the equity weight we have in life plus if I feel that we are neutral
plus already. And we at this moment we don't have a risk appetite to increase the equity
weight in our group. If equities rally we probably would give and sell all slightly. But allow
the equity exposure to grow with the increase in value.

Bloomberg Transcript

Why I am so using the word depressed is that with the huge of liquidity in the society, we - I feel that everybody is deleveraging and you don't earn anything on cash anymore. And
of course our running yields have come down almost one percentage in 12 months in our
portfolios and it's clear that this running yield drop will continue maybe on the same pace
or that is diﬃcult to see, depending on the opportunities which we are oﬀered.
However, we are depressed on this point because everything we want to invest in the
allocations which are given to us are getting smaller and smaller. And our cash is growing.
So we clearly have a reinvestment risk. But we are not going to lose our nerve in this. We
have been in the same situation earlier and we allowed the cash to pile up and wait for
something which has the right risk reward ratio with declining and running yields.

Q - Hakon Fure

{BIO 16623060 <GO>}

Excellent. Thank you.

Operator
Thanks very much. Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Seidl. Please go
ahead and ask your question.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon, two questions, one of the P&C side. I see that you
thought of it is to all for the industrial business. I wonder if this is due to you and players
entering the market, or is it just the existing players heating up competition that make you
withdraw. And in which countries this is more pronounced.

Page 5 of 15



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2013-08-07

And secondly, going back to the running yield and know that the P&C it seems to
accelerate now. It's fall from 3.4 to 3.1 while life seems to decelerate. What is your outlook
on this and shouldn't we expect given the short added duration a rather quick turnaround
indicator sample?

FINAL

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
In the industrial lines in a way there are new players in the Nordic region, especially
Sweden. But we've seen this many times before. But the likes of (Acta). And Allianz and
AIG. But it's early. And the (water) and right a few pieces of business we -- you or one
shouldn't over and that and one shouldn't exaggerate the eﬀect of this. The renewal rates
are still extremely high. But this is not an eﬀect in Sweden. We need to increase the rates.
That has been diﬃcult in this environment and we continue to take a ﬁrm stance on the
rate increases there.
There must be a (pipe) hole somewhere because I didn't follow your reasoning on the
earning yield. The running yield and if has decreased to 3.1%.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yes. It has accelerated -- it has accelerated by 30 basis points. It was 20 in the previous
quarter, right. And in --

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker

Bloomberg Transcript

You are trying to analyze how deep, how steep the decline is.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Oh okay. Well I wouldn't draw too many conclusions from that because you must
remember that Mandatum will also be to invest in euros, whereas if it's also exposed to
and (inaudible) and (tech). And there is a diﬀerence in interest rates here.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
So I wouldn't analyze it that leaner. Let's see what the outcome is in the next quarter.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yes. And the short iteration shouldn't in the sample should be beneﬁting with a quicker
turnaround from your perspective?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Quickly if the interest rates would go up. And on top of that of course in Mandatum the
balance sheet is actually gradually shrinking on the traditional portfolio. But in April of
course the portfolio is gradually growing because we still have premium growth.

FINAL

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yes and yes. All right, thanks a lot.

Operator
Thanks very much. Our next question comes from the line of Gianandrea Roberti of
Carnegie. Go ahead and ask your question.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good afternoon from me as well. I have three questions. The ﬁrst one is on the life
segment. I hear your comment regarding the free up in capital which actually I think we
discussed also in the Q1 call. If I look at that ratio and that preserve there were around
EUR4.4 billion at the end of '10. And they are just above EUR4 billion now. So they are
down nearly 10% or something.
But when I look at your economic capital in the life insurance business, basically it doesn't
change at all in the capital and tied up from economic perspective in the last two and half
years. And I suppose part of it is driven by the fact that interest rates have been falling
further. And but I'm not sure how to tie up these two items, the fact that the economic
capital needed to run the business is basically ﬂat with the fact that well there should be
some free up in capital from that division. Am I making myself clear on this?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
On the economic capital situation I don't exactly remember what the numbers were in the
two and half years ago. But basically depends also on the volatility of equities plus during
this period interest rates have come down quite signiﬁcantly. So the actual -- the mismatch
is increasing and that is consuming capital quite a lot.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Right. But so that doesn't pose you any issue with the fact that a further decline of
reserves and we should see any further go down around EUR200 million. We should see
around 50 of this out of the Mandatum life basically quick underwrite, right?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Yes, we can guarantee with the present allocation on investments.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Okay, yes. The second question that I have it's a non-life, perhaps for Torbjorn. I think
there's quite a bit of diﬀerence between your growth and the gross premiums with and
Page 7 of 15



Company Name: Sampo Oyj

Date: 2013-08-07

FINAL

the net premiums earned in this quarter. And there was something similar in Q1 as well.
I'm not sure. But it seems to me that it's mostly in this quarter it's because there is the
reinsurance, the seeded item, it's somewhat smaller. But is it possible really to have an
idea on your growth and then split it up between currencies and the rest, which I would
think the rest is mostly price hikes, right? And there's very little of organic growth at the
moment.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Trying to -- I think -- I think about how to answer this in a nontechnical way. Of course we
renew between 14% and 15% of the book in the commercial and industrialized in the ﬁrst
of January, which means that you will never during the year have the same development
of growth rates and that of that earned.
Then on reinsurance seeded we'll of course also diﬀer between written and earned
depending on when we pay, write the reinsurance. And our reinsurance programs are at
present renewed on 1114 and 17. So I don't think I can be very helpful with this.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Let me put it another way, Torbjorn. If I skip -- if I leave aside the currency eﬀect, the rest of
this it's by side. So is that correctly understood?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, by and large, yes.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

By and large, okay. Then my last question, I know it's extremely and integrated, Peter. And
my apologies for this in advance. But I noticed EUR12 million and EUR12 million like (20)
and again losses from deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans in your -- in the comprehensive
income statement. That comes 100% from Norway. Is that correct, or on the Norwegian
pension liabilities of it?

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

That would be my guess because roughly if we look at the pensions and it's about 75%
Norway, 25% Sweden. So my guess would be that it comes mainly from Norway.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

But can I ask you. And in the First Quarter it was actually EUR41 million. So if I sum up the
ﬁrst two quarters it's more than EUR50 million. And I was looking at the -- at that item, get
(inaudible) in there for the ﬁrst two quarters. I'm just wondering what kind of interest rate
used to do that. Is it an interest rate that you decide? I guess not. But I'm just a bit puzzled
by the development of that item.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

It should be a common interest rate across the market. So yes -Page 8 of 15

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Sorry. Can you repeat that?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

It is based on covered bonds in Norway. But it doesn't have to be the same for all
corporations in Norway. And I have no idea what that (inaudible) does with it.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Fair enough. Thanks a lot, thanks.

Operator
Thanks very much. Our next question comes from Matti Ahokas . Please go ahead and ask
your question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes hi, Matti Ahokas here. Going back to the prior year gains, Torbjorn, you mentioned
that this other excluding the interest rate changes in Finland and Sweden I get to ﬁgure
around EUR60 million other prior year gains. That's a fairly high ﬁgure. And should we
expect that this ﬁgure is kind of the new normal, or are they kind of additional like and
then it's just one-oﬀ here because normally the prior year gains have been and roughly
half of this.
And then if you could also shed some light and regarding the large claims, how much
were they above or below normal in the Second Quarter? And ﬁnally, if I may, I noticed
you've been buying some government bonds, which I ﬁnd quite interesting. Which
government bonds were you actually investing in and in the Second Quarter? Thanks.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Well, Martin, you didn't expect me to say yes, this is a new normal for a prior year gain,
did you?

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

No.

FINAL

Oh we still have an underlying diﬀerence between the reserving of 4% for claims inﬂation
and the present claims inﬂation of three. And that could for instance give us a 1.5% on the
combined ratio every quarter. But that's -- this would vary over time as often depending
on the claims inﬂation going forward.
So no I wouldn't expect EUR60 million. We were lucky with some very old reserves in
Finland this time which coincided with this discount rate change also in Finland. And large
claims were very close to normal this ﬁrst six months, which is probably why it's not
mentioned in the report. It is mentioned, sorry about that.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Our stance is still the same that we don't like government bonds. However, with our
excess liquidity is piling up we have had problems in ﬁnding any bank to where we can
deposit that at a reasonable rate. So we have bought short-term (inaudible) from
Germany, Poland and France. And the amount is roughly EUR750 million. And Peter has a
closest (re-talk).

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Yes. I have the exact numbers and you actually ﬁnd them in the supplementary package
on page 26. (Yarman) can check if I have the right, if I have all the pages on my package.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we have in Dutch 347, France 324 and Germany 100. And then we have 15 in Sweden
and 12 in Finland. But those are all bonds, older bonds. And all of these are in two, three
year maturities.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

And great. Can I just have a quick follow-up on the reserves side? Actually if you look at
the government bond yields they've gone up in Finland. So I was kind of a bit puzzled as
well that why did you lower the discount rate this time around because one could think
that it should be the other way around. What was the reason you decided to lower the
discount rate?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
I think we are still quite far from 3%.

Q - Matti Ahokas

FINAL

Thanks, thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. And I've got two questions. The
ﬁrst is with regards to something we've discussed before, which is the reinvestment
risking is parts been already carry. But just looking at the investment mix in the P&C
business and bank % and money markets, should -- is that very much temporary as your
(statue) for a better home for that? Or should we think that of that as a counter balance to
the 10% equity we think. And just interested in some thoughts around that.
And the second question, it wouldn't be a sample quarterly call without talking about the
dividend. And I think we had a really fruitful discussion last time about internal dividends.
And I'm guessing your comments on Nordea are fairly optimistic and maybe it will be that
that is the source of upside surprises going forward in terms of how much there that
comes into sample group.
And that being the case, if you agree with that, how would you react to that, because you
said in the past that you want to have steadily increasing dividends. If there was a hike in
the dividend from Nordea, would you be inclined to pass that on directly to shareholders,
or would you want to maintain this? And I think you have talked about a and graphically
beautiful dividend. Thank you.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker

Bloomberg Transcript

I use the statement again. We like it to look beautiful. So we like dividends to increase
year-on-year and you used some word in describing Nordea's dividend that if there was
an unexpected or something jump in dividends. I wouldn't expect Nordea to do that if
they share the same religion.
I think that they would also like to see growing dividends from here to eternity. So there
really all Nordea dividends we can pass through straight to our owners. We have no need
for excess capital, as you are well aware of that we are well capitalized. Then you had a
question on reinvestment risk.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

The money market has been growing. But we normally take the -- of course it has -- if
investment assets have grown during the ﬁrst half of the year bonds have been maturing
and partly we have invested also in govis like we talk about. But normally then we take the
dividend towards the end of the year. And that of course and hopefully reduces the cash
and hopefully we ﬁnd opportunities also on the bond side.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

It describes quite well the reinvestment pane that if we don't ﬁnd anything that we in
(tough) our risk reward criteria, then the cash is piling up. And we have had this earlier in
history and we will keep our nerve here.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay, thank you, Kari. And maybe just a follow-up on the Nordea point. And do you -- do
you as major shareholders would you, would you measure their success in an extent to
Page 11 of 15



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2013-08-07

which the dividend and it improves over the next few years? Is that going to be key
benchmark for you as owners?

FINAL

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Well I think that we come from the world of dividend stocks. We are a dividend stock
ourselves. And but I would here like to quote Christian Clausen. I think Christian is the
spokesperson of Nordea and he has clearly indicated that the cash ﬂow is very strong that
it accumulates capital signiﬁcantly. And he's expecting that -- he has also been expecting
new decisions on there at once more (inaudible) one or risk weighted assets. So I think all
that together it is a clear sign of growing the dividends. But now I want to basic and of
course from him in order to be prudent in the governance.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Fantastic. Thank you.

Thanks very much. Our next question comes from the line of Per Groenborg. Please go
ahead and ask your question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Groenborg
Yes hello. It's Per Groenborg from Danske, two questions from me as well. The ﬁrst one,
Torbjorn, you addressed a little bit earlier. Your prior gains say excluding the sales or the
same (inaudible) was pretty high this quarter, again and to 5.5%. You said that a signiﬁcant
part came from Finland. I know that your Norwegian combined ratio it's almost at 80 and
you had -- there was a quite signiﬁcant (ﬂoating) and in Norway. And you commented a
bit on well there were extraordinary high prior gains in Norway. Well there just was a
pretty fantastic result from your side compared to what a recently eﬀect delivered.
My second question and might be a bit more philosophic, now you have know what your
discount rate at 2.5% in your and not by part of your book. One other source, wouldn't it
also be prudent to do the same for all years when it comes to the life part of your book?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

And the gains again then not in Norway for us was 0.7 in the half year results combined
ratio. That's not a big event and actually there were no other big events. There was a
much more benign winter this year so I think these nat capped explanation for results in
Norway is quite exaggerated with some other insurers.

Q - Per Groenborg

And for frequently in Norway it continued to be very low compared to our expectations
and our pricing initiatives two years ago. So that's been helpful. At the same time we've
done a lot of work on the tariﬀs, as I think I mentioned in the last quarter. And we see
some of the eﬀects of that. So yes we had a very good result it seems compared to the
competitors that have come out with their results in Norway. And I'm pleased with that.

Q - Per Groenborg
Of course, congratulations.

I think that our life company and as you will know we treat it more or less like a hedge
fund, it's a diﬀerent type of animal from the P&C operations. And we have a much higher
equity weight. We have always had and we have going forward. So I think we are quite
comfortable with having this rolling lowering of these constraints in the life company. We
have been comfortable with having 2.5%. And now for the next year.
And if our opinion changes and we become more pessimistic or optimistic how do you
treat the view of our lower interest rates, then we could add one more year to that. But I
wouldn't go as far as doing it for the whole book unless the authorities open a dialogue
with us and they want all our competitors to do the same. And then I would treat it
diﬀerently of course.

And what and it -- is it -- it is correct that on the P&C that you are the only one that are
about now at lower below 3%?

Q - Per Groenborg
Sorry. I couldn't hear you.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Yes. There is one big neutral and they. So depending on who I talk with they say that they
have a 2.5% discount rate or 2.1% discount rate. So I'm not quite sure which one they
have.

Q - Per Groenborg
Okay.

And but also the regulator I think that there has been some talks that the regulator
potentially would lower the discount rate in Finland for the P&C side. But there have been
no indications on the life side.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

And if they would do it on the life side I would assume that they would give a period
when you are allowed to ﬁll the reserves. And historically many times they have given ﬁve
years time to do it. So I think that we are in a way already proven the way we do it. But we
are comfortable with this.

Q - Per Groenborg
Perfect.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

And just to be technical of course the duration for liabilities is very diﬀerent in life and
non-life. So there's no reason why the rules should be in fact the same.

Operator

time. Please continue.
