Good morning. I'm Tracy Benguigui, insurance analyst at Barclays, and I'm pleased to host
our fireside session with Alan Schnitzer, CEO of Travelers. Apologies for a few minute
delay. So why don't we just jump in? I believe that Alan has a few opening remarks and
slides, and I'll just remind folks that we will be taking questions at the end of the session
and you could look at the portal to submit those questions.

Bloomberg Transcript

With that, I'll turn it over to Alan.

Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Tracy. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for making the time to tune in.
Before we get going, I'm duty bound to share that to the extent we get to any forwardlooking information, there are risks and uncertainties involved, and I'd encourage
everyone to look at our SEC filings for factors that could cause those statements to be
untrue. And with that out of the way, in my experience, questions often get pretty -pointed pretty quickly. So I thought I would just take a minute or two at the front end and
set the stage with a little bit of high level commentary, if that's okay, Tracy.
Andrea, maybe you could share the slides and just confirm that they are up. I'm not sure I
can see them. I'm just going to -- I'm going to assume, Andrea, that the slides are up
there. We have for a long time, going back to 2005 or 2006, identified leading return on
equity as our north star, and this slide that hopefully you're all seeing is something we've
shared for a long time. This really hasn't changed in a long time. But we did change the
dialogue five or six years ago, and we made the point that any strategy to deliver leading
return on equity requires a strategy to grow over time as well. And internally, we talk
about the dual mandate to perform and transform. Perform we measure as through a
return on equity lens, but transform is about making sure that we're developing the
capabilities to make sure that we will continue to be successful for the next decade and
that we are positioning ourselves to grow over time.

We've laid out the innovation strategy before, so I'm not going to take the time to do that
now. I know, we're a little short on time. But what I would like to do is share the results of
that and, hopefully, Andrea, we're onto the next slide here. But if you take a look at this,
over the last five or so years, we've grown at about 4.5% compound annual growth rate,
which is substantially faster than we grew earlier in the decade, and we outgrew GDP.
There's been more in this industry for a long time that we ensure the output of the
economy. And it's hard to outgrow GDP without something else giving. And we took that
on and we challenged that. And in fact, we have over the last five or so years grown
substantially faster than GDP.
Moving to the top-middle box, you can see we've done that a stable underlying combined
ratio, and that to us is demonstrating the fact that we didn't grow either by underpricing
the product and we didn't grow by taking on risk that we didn't understand. We grew by
investing in franchise value. At the same time, as we were doing that, we identified
improving productivity and efficiency as a strategic priority.

Bloomberg Transcript

And you can see that from 2011 to 2015, we had an expense ratio that was right around,
call it, 32 run rate. That wasn't bad. That was fine. But we knew that to be competitive and
do the things we really wanted to do, we needed to improve that expense ratio. And so
we got busy five or so years ago and we've improved that two points down to a runway
of, call it, say, 30% at the moment. That's a two point increase, but that's a pretty
substantial percentage improvement of that 32. And so we've done that by leveraging
technology investments that we've made and we've done that by improving workflow.
The productivity and efficiency continues to be an important strategic priority for us. And
that gives us -- the operating leverage we have from advances from here will give us
some flexibility. But going to the bottom line, the upshot of what we've done in the top
row is higher underlying underwriting income. We've taken that to a new level. And that
used to be -- there will always be some volatility from period-to-period that's whether
another factors. But say $1 billion to $2 billion, a substantial increase over this period.
Moving over to the next box. We don't talk a lot about cash flow. At least, externally, we
don't talk a lot about cash flow from operations. But it's something we think about on the
inside. And higher cash flow gives us the opportunity to make important investments to
return capital to shareholders, but also to grow our investment portfolio. In 2011 to 2015,
we had average invested assets of around $70 billion. We've grown that to about $80
billion. And so in an environment of what feels like chronically low interest rates, having
more invested assets and more profit from underlying underwriting are two important
levers.
So the strategy that we laid out some years ago has been affected. We've executed it.
This company is an execution machine. And from here, we think we've got more
opportunity for this to continue to play out and very confident that we are very wellpositioned as the economy reopens. We've got the talent, we've got the technology,
we've got distribution relationships, and the overall franchise value for hopefully the story
to continue to play out for years to come.

you'd like to get into. I just thought this would be helpful to set the stage.

Questions And Answers
FINAL

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

(Question And Answer)
Thank you, Alan. I'll just remind folks that we have a survey button on the top right of the
screen, and we actually have some audience responses, polling questions. The first one
being pricing question, and we'll will revisit that responses a bit later. But maybe just to
kick off to Alan, maybe you could just set the stage as well on what your pricing outlook
looks like the rest of the year and into next year.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. So we don't give outlook on pricing, so I'm not going to respond to that
quantitatively, but I will share a few thoughts on pricing. So a number of drivers in terms of
rate, I mean, certainly on the commercial side and increasing on the personal lines as well.
But on the commercial side, and we've talked a lot about this and you've heard a lot of
others talk about it too, but social inflation, economic inflation, severity of weather, low
interest rate environment, so all those things continue to be factors that, I think, are
driving pricing higher. So I do expect that rate increases will be around for a while at levels
that expand margins. Again, we're not going to quantify it, but we expect rates to be out
there for a while at levels that expand margin.
Two other comments I'll make, because people get laser-focused on this pure rate
number. And I think particularly in an environment of economic growth, it's really important
to look at the overall price number, because there is margin improvement in exposure.
And so looking at the headline, overall price is clearly as important as looking at the pure
rate number. And then it's -- that headline rate number can also be deceiving. There's a
lot of important texture underneath the way that's executed.
And on our last earnings call, we shared some of that texture in terms of what was
happening in terms of rate bands. And you can go take a look at the transcript and our
slides from that for a little bit more texture. And really important, as you're thinking about
one company versus the next, having the data and the analytics and really importantly the
know-how at the frontline underwriter level to execute really with precision. It's not just
about getting more rate or less rate. It's about getting the right price on the risk
combined with terms and conditions that's really important to managing execution and
profitability.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Great. I mean, you did mention in a way pricing is one-dimensional. So if you want to pick
on a non-rating variable like terms and conditions, what would you think is
underappreciated that Travelers is putting a lot of work across the sustained rate
adequacy?

FINAL

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. So terms and conditions, really important levers in managing risk and reward and
managing margins. And there's really a lot to that conversation. So the way I think about it,
Tracy, I start with program terms. And so for a property policy, that would include price,
limits, deductibles, sub-limits, the casualty policy, you get price limits and attachment
points. And I think about those as program terms, because those are the things that get
negotiated on every single deal and you can move those pretty quickly. And while they
are negotiated on a deal-by-deal basis, there are portfolio level applications of program
terms. So for example, think higher deductibles applied systematically to tornado, hail
exposed risks to address frequency and severity. So that would be sort of one element of
terms and conditions I would think about.

Bloomberg Transcript

The next one I would think about, and this may have been what you were thinking when
you asked the question, our coverage terms. And often industry observers think about
exclusions when you talk about coverage terms. So for example, early and throughout the
pandemic, we thought about communicable disease exclusions applied again very
surgically and where it made sense on some policies. But we've been doing that for years.
So I think, wage and hour exclusions on EPL policies. I think short-term rental exclusions on
homeowners policies. Not that we don't cover some of those risks, but you want to make
sure that you're covering them deliberately and pricing for them. And so exclusions make
sense.
But beyond those exclusions, and this is another thing, I think, that doesn't get quite
enough fair time is the coverage grant. So you have a coverage grant that gets pulled
back by exclusions, but that coverage grant really can't be overlooked. And that's
important, because when a coverage grant -- when you have erosion of the coverage
grant over time, that's very hard to correct once there's market momentum behind it. And
so for example, we are careful to avoid less disciplined broker forms. And our discipline
with the overall coverage grant was evident throughout the -- for example, the pandemic.
And it was one of the reasons why very early in the pandemic last April of 2020, we were
able to come out and pretty definitively state that we didn't expect business interruption
to be a problem for us. And that was really all about the discipline of the coverage grant.
A nice thing about terms and conditions, especially when they're tightening, is that they
often -- it's often more enduring than the price component of a risk. And so in other
words, the tightening of the terms and conditions generally last beyond the moderating
of price.
And then the last thing that, I think, often gets overlooked when it comes to terms and
conditions is a close cousin of risk selection. And sometimes, no matter what the price is,
no matter what the terms and conditions are, you just can't get an adequate return on a
product and -- or risk, and that's really when you need to just put up your hands and say,
I'm sorry we can't write it. And an example of that is we stopped writing cyber policies for
businesses that don't have multi-factor authentication. And so in the whole terms and
conditions conversation, risk selection is over often overlooked, but it's key.
I think you're mute, Tracy.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

That was great insight. And I think also just circling back to your comment that it's just not
all about rate. What do you think is the right trade-off at this point in the cycle, raising
renewal retention with giving up some rate and the reverse, holding a line and squeezing
more rate? Could we anticipate at this point of cycle further increases in your retention
levels?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

And so I tend -- we tend not to think about that as sort of a portfolio trade-off rate versus
retention. Again I -- yeah, that's sort of a default to the headline number, which just isn't
the way we executed really think about this business. As we've explained many times, we
approach this business one account, one class of business at a time. And I can't stress
enough the importance of thinking about this and certainly executing it in a very granular
way. So our approach is to keep our best business, get rate where we need it and add
attractive new business to the portfolio. And you make those decisions one account at a
time. And at the end of the quarter, at the end of the year, you add up the results and
either you have more or less whatever the metric is you're looking at.
And the fact that we really, at the moment, don't have that trade-off at all, I think, is
evidence of that really granular execution. What I mean by that is we have a very high
quality book of business. And so our retentions are near all-time highs. And that's true in
both our business insurance segment and in our bond and specialty segment. And that
really is a function of the fact that we like our high quality book of business, we like the risk
and we want to keep it intact. So retentions near all-time high. But given some of the
headwinds to returns that I mentioned a minute ago, we also need more rate. And so if
you've looked at pricing in the last couple of quarters, that's also at an all-time high. So
again, given that granular count-by-count, class-by-class execution dynamic, we've been
able to maintain both the high retention and high price.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Great. And maybe we can get into some of your business lines. I'll start off with workers'
comp. Are you further along understanding how their bureaus will be treating 2020
pandemic trends on 2022 loss cost filings? Our read is that COVID-19 will be treated as a
catastrophe and excluded from underlying loss cost trends. But I guess, what is a little bit
less clear is how these bureaus will be treating workers' comp frequency tailwind in 2020,
which may be the real wild card.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. So this is a -- I mean, the NCCI, for example, is -- it provides the bureau service for
many states, but it really is a state-by-state application of this process. And so it's, again,
as always in this business, hard to generalize across all 50 states. In terms of direct
COVID claims, I think you're right. We are seeing most states, excluding COVID losses
from loss experience. But it's not true uniformly. For example, I think that's not true in New
York, for example. And I do agree with you that the big unknown is the indirect side, the
favorability from non-COVID workers' comp claims. And that remains to be seen. I think
the important thing to keep in mind on that question though is that the job of the bureaus

Page 5 of 13



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2021-09-14

is to predict as best as possible what future loss costs are going to look like, and they
actually do a pretty thoughtful job at that.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Great. And I guess, how are those conversations going so far in terms of pricing,
putting all that together?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

It's again hard to generalize 50 state conversations. It's a work in process. But I would say
productive and constructive.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Okay. And then I also noticed that in the second quarter, commercial auto grew at a faster
clip sequentially, and I understand most of this is rail. But can you contextualize rate
adequacy on the commercial auto side? Do you think there's still rate catch-up that's
needed? Are you worried about some of the qualitative aspects like the quality of
truckers on the road post-recession?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. So we're always going to see some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter and the dynamic
in commercial auto in the second quarter. Rate has for a long time and, I think, will
continue to be a big driver of the net written premium growth. But the story in the second
quarter was actually endorsement activity. And going back to the comparison quarter a
year ago, second quarter of 2020, we actually had a lot of commercial vehicles coming off
the road early in the pandemic. And so there was a lot of endorsement activity that
lowered the exposure. And what we saw in the second quarter of this year was what I
would describe as a more normal level of exposure. But compared to the prior year, it
looks like a lot of growth. So I think that was a big part of the growth in the second quarter
of this year, although rate continues to be a big driver of premium growth in commercial
auto.
It's a tough line of business. It's been tough for the industry for a long time. I still don't -we're definitely doing better. We've been -- the rate increases have been compounding
for a while now. So I think current returns in the outlook are improved, but still not where it
needs to be. And we what expect is the economy improves to have some deterioration
and driver experience levels. And we would anticipate that and put that into our pricing
models. So yes, I agree.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Okay. Now, turning to personal auto, because everyone's talking about where's frequency
and severity. Are regulators looking at 2019 as the base year, completely discounting
2020? And do you find that to be problematic, given rates were higher and severity was
lower?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}
Page 6 of 13



FINAL

Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2021-09-14

Yeah. I don't really think that's problematic. I mean, certainly -- it's certainly a dynamic. I
don't think it's problematic in the sense that we maintain excellent relationships with our
regulators. And anytime our rating plans are out of sync with our rate need as is the case
now as you point out, as miles driven returns to pre-pandemic levels and severity rises,
we -- our rating plans in some states are out of sync with our rate need. And so we sit
down, and we have a conversation with the regulators. And clearly, 2020 was an abnormal
year. And so that's often a discussion point with the regulators. We talk through that as we
make the case for our rate need. But at the end of the day, I would describe it broadly as
business as usual in the sense that that's what we do every day with our regulators. We're
having conversations with them on a regular basis, explaining where we are and what we
need. And at the end of the day or at least over time, we generally get to where we need
to be.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Yeah. I guess, that brings me to the big question of how long it would take. I mean,
intuitively, personal auto is six-month paper. So it should be easy to reprise. So just trying
to understand where the regulators heads are at, so you don't go through a number of
cycles where you're behind on accumulation of loss trend.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. I would say that's largely business as usual as well. There's nothing new there. It's
the -- that's the same sort of lag in the environment that we've been navigating
successfully for years. And as we think about where we are and where we need to be, we
expect there to be some lag in the time it takes to get rate actions approved,
implemented and earned in. So again, it's hard to generalize across all 50 states. But it's
broadly business as usual. This is a different -- it's -- everyday is a different environment.
This is a different environment than we had last year, for example. But it's the same in the
sense that we're well-versed in sitting down with our regulators and moving the process
along.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Maybe just thinking about the economy reopening, how do you anticipate
loss cost trends emerging? Do you anticipate pent-up litigation in the courts?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

So generally speaking, just stepping back. There's clearly a correlation between economic
activity and loss trend. And so just taking the auto line, for example, when you've got
more congestion on the roads and you mentioned less experienced drivers, those sorts
of things would contribute to higher levels of loss trend. And add to that, in the current
environment, some increase in the expectation for labor and materials costs. So we are
expecting, as the economy reopens generally in some lines, some incremental tick up in
loss trend. So it's expected and we'll price for it. So there's often a focus on how loss
trend is going to change. And the real question is, how is loss trend going to change
relative to expectation? That's a really important question. How is it changing relative to
reserving and pricing assumptions? And so as you point out, as the economy opens up,
loss trend, we would just expect that and that would be in our assumptions.

Page 7 of 13



FINAL

Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2021-09-14

In terms of pent-up litigation, I don't know how to answer that other than yes. I assume
that's the case. The courts have been closed. They've been slow to reopen. As they
reopen, I think, they're going to prioritize criminal cases over civil cases. So it will take
some time to know exactly what's been happening underneath the fog for a while. But for
that reason, as you and others have heard us say, we've been very cautious in reserving
for that environment. So the underlying data that we've observed over the last year and
year-and-a-half might cause us to think that things are improving a little bit. We haven't
really recognized that, because we think that has more to do with the obscurity, the data
than really what's going on underneath. So we've been pretty cautious in the way that
we've been reserving for that, because we expect there will be some activities as the
economy opens up.
The other thing to keep in mind, Tracy, when we think about an economy opening up and
the consequences for loss trend is the consequences on exposure growth. And so a
mitigant to rising loss trend, other than the fact that we do anticipate it and price for it, is
that as you have higher levels of wages, for example, or higher levels of sales, overall
economic activity, that would translate into exposure growth, which to some degree
offsets to one degree or another, but offset that higher loss trend.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Yeah. You mentioned wage inflation. How do you think that's going to impact workers'
comp loss trends?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Generally, wage inflation is a favorable thing for workers' comp loss trend. And that's
because that -- the premium dollars will increase linearly with wage increases, but losses
don't move up proportionately generally. And so higher levels of wages are generally
good thing for workers' comp margin.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Good insight. Let's talk about catastrophes. So far, the quarter shaping up to be quite
active. How is the Ida part one and part two looking for you? And I guess my follow-up to
that is, did Northeast derivative impact of the storm surprise you? Or is that something
you generally capture in your models?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Good question. Ida has been getting a lot of attention, as it should get a lot of attention.
But a really important point I want to make is even putting Ida aside, this quarter, from
both a cat and non-cat weather perspective, is shaping up, to use your words, to be quite
active. So that shouldn't surprise anybody. What I would say in terms of the modeling,
Tracy, is that, I think, the way to think about it is some models are considerably more
developed than others. And so hurricane models on the continuum would be relatively
more advanced than other models. And so the -- just to use your words, the part one of
Ida was very well-modeled and an expected. Part two wasn't as much a hurricane as it was
a flood. And the Northeast flooding, flooding is a peril generally, I would say is those

Page 8 of 13



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2021-09-14

models just aren't as advanced and developed. So did it surprise us? I wouldn't say it
surprised us, but I would say the models just aren't as well developed.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

FINAL

Got it. And do you have a prediction of the industry level loss?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

I just -- I don't spend any time at all predicting industry level losses. I just don't find any
value in it. We spend a lot of time coming up with our own view. And I would say our own
view is coming into focus, but not to a degree that we're prepared to share a number
right now. But over time, it'll only be a few weeks probably before we have a much better
handle on what the industry estimates will be, and we'll use that for our own postmortem. But I just don't find a lot of value in speculating about industry losses.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Got it. And also in light of elevated catastrophe event, I guess, it's time we to touch on
your reinsurance buying philosophy. I mean, it seems like you're comfortable to absorb
what I call an earnings event, even though you have Ag cover. How did you get to this
place? Do you need to hold on some more capital in light of your higher occurrence
retentions? Or would it be more efficient to hold on to less capital and buy more
reinsurance for volatility cover?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. I don't think it's quite as simple an equation as the question might imply. I mean,
optimizing capital efficiency is an ongoing initiative for us. So our CFO, Dan Frey, focuses a
lot on that. He and I talk about that a lot. And if there were an obvious or easy way to
lower our cost of capital, of course, we would do that. Reinsurance isn't necessarily lowcost capital. You don't find a reinsurer that's willing to take your losses and not charge a
margin for using their balance sheet. And we think our underwriting expertise, the fact
that we have a relatively high degree of predictability in our loss activity certainly over time
gives us the opportunity to take more risk gross. And the fact that we're not conveying a
margin to somebody else to take that volatility we think gives us a competitive advantage.
The other thing that I -- is often overlooked in reinsurance buying strategy is when you've
got a primary business, there's a lot of risk in building a book of business on the back of
reinsurance capital. Because that reinsurance capital can come and go pretty easily every
year. The reinsurers can make a decision to write it or not write it or raise the price or
terms of conditions. And when you're a primary writer like we are, just given the
relationship we have with our customers, our distribution partners, given the regulatory
environment, you just can't come and go like that. And so to think that you're going to
write a lot of insurance, a primary insurance on the back of reinsurance, and then hold a
lower level of capital really leaves you exposed to changes in the reinsurance
marketplace.

FINAL

Okay. Great. Just maybe staying on the theme of capital management. I know, you had
those slides upfront. But I'll just point out that many of your peers upsize their buyback
programs with discrete time stamps, and Travelers does not have a time stamp in relation
to your $5 billion authorization. Can you just share what factors you considering to make
that determination? I mean, can you conceivably be at a point where your excess capital
position won't result in acceleration of capital returns?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. I'll just take the opportunity to point out we've got a very long, consistent and great
record on capital management. So we started our stock buyback program in 2006. And
since 2006, we've returned through share buybacks and dividends nearly $50 billion of
capital to shareholders. So I think we've got a great and very clear track record in how we
do it, and we've been very effective. And I think that's been a really important contributor
to shareholder value.
For us, it's not about the fact that we're sitting on a bunch of excess capital at the
moment. And we can say that in the next month or six months or a year, we're going to
return it. For us, it's about the ongoing process of right sizing capital. And that's how much
capital do we have versus how much do we need to run the business. And so how much
do we have is generally a function of earnings. And how much we need is a function of
other uses of capital and whether that's growth, organic or inorganic, and investment and
some provision for uncertainty. So we are -- and we're also -- we're not market timing.
We're not trading in our stock. We are really thinking about just right sizing the balance
sheet. And that's an ongoing very deliberate process for us. I would add that in share
buybacks going back to 2006, I think our -- the price per share at which we bought back
the stock is under $70 a share, $66 or $67 or something. So it's been a great rate for us.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Got it. And I'll also do another compare and contrast to competitors. I mean, some of your
peers have laid out explicit multi-year savings plans. What are some of the things you're
doing on the expense side and how meaningful could that impact be to your expense
ratio?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. So we've got a lot of competitors that are pulling out blueprints on the drawing
board, talking about what they're going to do in terms of expense management. And I -one of the reasons I opened up the conversation with that is to a large degree, we
started that five years ago. And so we recognized the need to do that. We didn't pull the
blueprints out. We just did it. And so we've substantially reduced our expense ratio. We've
improved our operating leverage. And we've done it through leveraging technology, and
whether that's digital tools for our employees, digital tools for our customers, artificial
intelligence, robotic process automation, improving workflow. So taking high volume, low
dollar-type policies and routing them through a centralized underwriting process center.
So things like that.

So we've taken the ratio from a run-rate of about 32 to run-rate of about 30. We said
that, for now, we're comfortable with around 30. And again, there's always going to be
some volatility. That'll be a little bit more -- that would be a little bit higher, a little bit lower
quarter-to-quarter. But this is a comfortable place for us. It doesn't mean that we're -- that
productivity and efficiency is any less of a strategic priority for us. It just means we've got
other alternative for what we do with those dollars. And so from here, as we generate
incremental efficiency, we can make the decision to either let that fall to the bottom line
or invest it in other strategic priorities if we think there's a return on.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Great. I'm just going to remind folks that you can submit questions on the portal or email it
to me directly, and I could take those questions. I have plenty of fallback questions just to
get us through. So I have actually some philosophical questions. I guess, from our see,
what leading indicators we look at to evaluate tort liability? And conversely, could we get
to a point where we could see tort reform, like capping judicial awards, similar to what we
saw in the mid-mile side two decades ago? I mean, I heard like Philadelphia courts are
intimated with volume of activity. And so that just maybe the more pragmatic path at
some point.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. So just taking that in order of the assets. So in terms of leading indicators, I mean,
we certainly have visibility into some metrics that outside observers wouldn't have access
to. So we track things like attorney rep rates, the point in the claim in which attorneys are
brought in and so on and so forth. So there's a lot of insight we have that you wouldn't
have. But there are things that are visible from the outside. I would characterize them as
very blunt instruments. So attorney marketing spend for example, trends in third-party
litigation financing, legislative activities that are either helpful or unhelpful, so reviver
statutes for example or tort reform bills, which we see in some states.
You open up the newspaper, and you get a sense of social attitudes that are reflected in
jury word. So I think there are indicators out there that an outside observer can look at. But
again two things, one, it's a very blunt instrument; and two, to understand the
consequence of it, you'd really need to understand the significance of that relative to an
insurance company's expectations, because you can look at something and say, gee, we
would expect tort inflation to be higher, but the question is, is it going to be higher or
lower? It's -- what is it relative to what we're reflecting in our assumptions for price can
reserve?
In terms of the real policy question, where we go tort reform? I've been very vocal about
the tort tax. And there are studies out there that say that our tort system costs American
families across the country $3,000 per family per year. And I think everybody ought to be
up in arms about that. There should be an uproar over that. And in states like New York, I
think that's close to $6,000. And I bet that's higher, because these numbers are from a
study that's a few years old at this point. So I think it's a shame that we don't have more
aggressive tort reform, but I think we've got a plaintiffs bar that's very well organized, very
well funded that, I think, has been has been successful. And just looking at the way the
political winds are blowing, as much as, I think, it's a great idea, I wouldn't expect tort

reform to happen at the Federal level, although we are having some success in some
states. And so I --- it really is a battle that has moved to the state level where, I think,
there's an opportunity to make a difference.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Great. I've gotten a few audience questions. How comfortable are you with pricing
dynamics in commercial auto? What refrains you from having a more aggressive stance in
this space?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

I'm comfortable that it's moving in the right direction, for sure. What stops us from being
more aggressive? I guess, two things, one is we're in the business of working with our
distribution partners to take care of our customers. And so it's in our interest to have an
orderly market and to make sure that we're providing solutions at fair prices. And so
moving at a pace that isn't shocking to the market is better than moving at a pace that is
shocking. But also, the important thing about -- important thing to remember about
commercial auto is generally written for us as part of an overall solution. And so we're
writing the commercial auto with the liability, with the workers' comp, with the property.
And so we could -- and we do manage profitability both by line and by account. We don't
tolerate loss-leader type products, but we are measuring account profitability and
obviously the market doesn't have visibility into that, but that dynamic explains, I think, why
we're not more aggressive.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Got it. And this question actually reminds me the last time we were in price firming cycle,
let's call it, 2011 or so on. Basically, you had so many competitors, take a step back in
workers' comp, and that was an area that you grew a little bit more aggressively. You
could kind of say that the industry thought of that as a loss leader. So I guess, what makes
commercial auto a little bit different?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand the question. Different than what, workers' comp?

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Yeah. I guess, there was a view out there that workers' comp was a loss leader, and you
took a more aggressive stance at that time. But it sounds like, just based on your
response, a little bit more conservative on the growth path for commercial auto.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. I'm not sure we ever -- I mean, I think I can say definitively we never looked at
workers' comp as a loss leader. It's always -- I mean, we've been a market leader there.
It's been a great product for us. We have outperformed the market over time by pretty
substantial market and that's benefit of scale, data, resources. So I'm not sure I
understand the question exactly, but I'm not sure I agree with the underlying premise that
we thought about workers' comp as a loss leader.

Okay. Got it. We only have about one more minute left. I guess, my last question is just
touching in on your E&S capabilities. I know, you are learning a lot from your investment in
Fidelis. You also have in-house capabilities like Northfield, Lloyd's, etcetera. Just how
satisfied are you in your penetration in specialty lines market?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yes. And beyond Northland, Northfield and Lloyd's, we have more flexibility than, I think,
people appreciate in our admitted products to provide solutions. So when business
moves from an admitted market to a non-admitted market, it's not generally -- it's often
not because we couldn't provide the solution. It's because we choose not to -- we reject
the risk and reward proposition of that business. So we've got more flexibility than, I think,
people appreciate. Having said that, I do think to a degree, we are underway E&S. And
we've got all the tools in our toolbox to be successful. There's nothing we fill compelled
to do. There's no pinch in the back. But it could be an opportunity for us someday for sure.
And we evaluate that and we think about that regularly.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

Got it. I think we're got -- we're out of time. This conversation went by really quickly. I really
appreciate our discussion today. Thank you, Alan.
