Thank you, Emily. Good morning and welcome. We apologize for the delay in starting the
call this morning. We understand that one of the numbers that was distributed was
incorrect and connected you to the replay, which of course has not happened yet. This is
the actual call. We've sent out an email with the correct number and we see a roster is
being assembled in something of a slow in argue was fashioned. We apologize for that
error on our part. We hope others are able to join us in process, and that the replay will
work as function and we are grateful that you're here this morning.
So good morning and welcome as stated this Tom Gayner, I'm here today with our CoCEO, Richie Whitt, and our CFO, Jeremy Noble. We're glad you've joined us and we look
forward to briefing you on current conditions, as well as answering your questions. I'm not
telling you anything you don't know when I'd say the 2020 remains unlike any other year.
The systemic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and all that following in its way
remain immense and unrelenting. That said, I could not be more proud of the efforts of
everyone in this organization to truly serve our customers, our associates and our
shareholders in the face of adversity.
We've provided for claims and financial assistance to our policyholder customers to cover
substantial losses and economic cost. Those losses stem not just from the things you see
in the headlines regarding the pandemic, but also a state of natural catastrophes, such as
more hurricanes than hurricane names, wildfires a major [ph]direction, and ongoing
recurring events and circumstances that we see regularly in our insurance operations. We
continued to provide necessary and desirable products and services throughout our
Markel Ventures operations. That includes building the machines, with deep breathe.
Things will get much more basic or necessary than that and since man does not live by
(inaudible) alone, we also produce and provide everything from medical services, housing,
house plants to brighten your day and trailers to convey everything from industrial gases
to the car you drive. We make truck floors to keep the products you need from falling out
of the bottom of the trailer, technology consulting services to manage and keep track of it
all, and many other items as well. And by the way, we also provide fire suppression
services to keep it off from catching on fire.
We're doing our best to keep our associates safe and gainfully employed throughout
these truck trial times. We're also working to produce financial results which create the
capital we need to be able to serve our customers and associates. Over many years and
as displayed to the first nine months of 2020, we've built a system at Markel to be a
resilient and robust company. We work to serve and dependably honor the promises we
made. We've built a diversified three engine machine consisting of our insurance,
investments and Markel Ventures operations. Those components work together to fulfill
our purpose each and every day.
We're delighted to be able to report our 2020 year-to-date progress in doing so this
morning. Clearly, work remains to be done. While our insurance operations remain mildly
in the red to the year-to-date, [ph]we recover dramatically since the first quarter shock
losses, we recognize that the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We've accelerated our
pace of making tough but necessary decisions to increase the durability and quality of our
insurance operations, which will be measured by improved profitability. In our investment
operations we're reporting profitable results for the first nine months. While that is always

FINAL

too shorter timeframe to draw conclusions about investing those results continue a multiyear pattern of conservative and profitable investing.
Our investments protect our balance sheet and stand behind the promises we make and
they also produce appropriate returns. In our Ventures operations, we produced
outstanding results so far in 2020. The leaders of the Ventures businesses adapted and
figured out ways to surmount unprecedented conditions and circumstances. I am grateful
and amazed for their work and accomplishments. The performance of our three engines
demonstrates the resilience and the spirit of Markel to fulfill our purpose of serving our
customers, our associates and our shareholders.
We believe in win, win, win as the fundamental architecture underlying Markel, and we're
pleased to be able to share how that played out in the unprecedented conditions of
2020 today. Even more importantly, we hope this update provides you with a shared
optimism of how we will continue to evolve and build even more resilience and
sustainability going forward. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Jeremy to review the
financial details of the year to date. Richie will then follow with some commentary on our
insurance, and insurance and securities operations, and then I will speak briefly about our
ventures and investment engines, following that we will take your questions.
So that, Jeremy?

{BIO 20687803 <GO>}

Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. Our underwriting, investing and Markel
Ventures results continue to be heavily influenced by the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic. But fortunately, we saw positive contributions from each of our three engines
during the third quarter. Our insurance operations produced an underwriting profit despite
elevated levels of natural catastrophe losses as well as increases to reserves related to
the pandemic, reflecting the strong underlying performance of our business. Our Markel
Ventures operations delivered meaningful profits demonstrating their resilience despite
economic uncertainty. And our investment portfolio also saw gains and bit volatile market
conditions.
Looking at our underwriting results, gross written premiums were $5.4 billion for the first
nine months of 2020, compared to $4.9 billion in 2019, an increase of 10%. This increase
was attributable to our insurance segment, which reported gross written premiums of
$4.5 billion, an increase of 13%, compared to 2019 period. This premium growth is
attributable to both our growth in our and more favorable rates with our professional
liability, and general liability product lines as well as growth in our personal lines, product
lines.
Gross written premium within our reinsurance segment were consistent with the 2019
period and roughly $960 million. Year-to-date retention of gross written premiums was
83% in 2020, which is down 1 point from 84% in 2019. And our premiums for the first nine
months increased 10% to $4.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to higher written premium
volume in our insurance segment. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first nine

FINAL

months of 2020 was a 101%, compared to 95% in 2019. For the third quarter 2020, we
reported a 97% combined ratio, compared to a 94% a year ago.
Our 2020 combined ratio included 9 points of underwriting loss is attributed to COVID-19
for the nine-month period, compared to 3 points for the quarter. As I've discussed in the
past two quarters, we recognized $325 million of pre-tax net losses and loss adjustment
expense during the first quarter of this year. For those policies and contracts were COVID19 was identified as approximate were direct cause of loss. During the third quarter, we
increased our loss estimates on these coverages by $32 million and also recognized $15
million of losses on our trade credit product line arising from the economic uncertainty
resulting from the pandemic. As a reminder, our losses for COVID-19 are primarily
attributed to business written within our international insurance operations are primarily
associated with coverages prevent cancellation, business interruption losses and policies
where no specific pandemic exclusions exist.

Bloomberg Transcript

Due the inherent uncertainty associated with our assumption surrounding COVID-19, which
among other things, includes assumptions around coverages, liability, reinsurance
protection, duration and loss mitigation factors, as well as the fact that the economic
impact of a pandemic continued to evolve, our estimates continued to be subject to a
wide range of variability.
During the third quarter a test case of the sample of business interruption coverages for
policies written in the United Kingdom was completed with the court's judgment finding
mostly in the favor of policy holders. This really was most impactful to certain estimates in
our reinsurance segment, where we increased our estimate of losses and loss adjustment
expenses of certain treaties following increase in estimated losses by our savings. Within
our insurance segment, the ruling did not meaningfully impact the reserves previously
established for business interruption coverage given the assumptions we initially made in
our policy terms and conditions.
Our estimate at September 30th, 2020, also reflect additional data gathered through
increased claims reporting and change in our expected duration of the pandemic, which
was most impactful to our vent cancellation coverages. In addition to the explicit provision
of losses recognized during the quarter on our trade credit product line as the overall
effects of the pandemic continue to evolve, further losses indirectly related to the COVID19 pandemic are possible and they also emerge within our professional liability and
workers' compensation product lines among others, including our reinsurance product
lines.
To date, we've not seen any other evidence of significant incurred losses increasing for
these secondary exposures. Our underwriting results for the first nine months of both
2020 and 2019 also reflect losses attributable to natural catastrophe. Our 2020 combined
ratio included $101 million or 2 points of underwriting losses from hurricanes Laura, Sally,
Isaias as well as the Midwest a (inaudible) and wildfires in the Western U.S., compared to
our 2019 combined ratio, which included $43 million or 1 point of underwriting losses from
Hurricane Dorian and Typhoon Faxai. With regards to prior year loss reserve development
consistent with our reserving philosophy, prior-year loss reserves developed favorably by

FINAL

$435 million in the first nine months of 2020, compared to favorable prior year
development of $337 million in 2019.
Turning to our investment results following the significant declines for the fair value of our
equity portfolio during the first quarter, we have seen meaningful recoveries in the
second and third quarters. Net investment losses for the first nine months of 2020, $231
million, compared to net investment gains of $1.1 billion last year, a year-over-year decline
of $1.3 billion.
As I've mentioned in prior calls, in our long-term focus, variability in the timing of
investment gains and losses as we expected and we may continued to see volatility in the
equity markets, due in part to the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic. With
regards to net investment income, we reported $274 million in the first nine months of
2020 compared to $339 million a year ago. The decline is largely due to lower short-term
interest rates and lower holding to fixed maturity securities in 2020. Net unrealized
investment gains increased $298 million, net of taxes. During 2020, reflecting an increase
in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio resulting from declines in interest rates
during the first nine months of the year.
Now I'll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures
surpassed $2 billion through the first nine months of 2020, compared to $1.6 billion last
year. This increase reflects the contribution of revenues from our recent acquisition of
Lansing building products, which we completed in late April and the acquisition of VSC Fire
and Security, which closed during the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding the contributions of
Lansing and VSC in 2020, operating revenues in our Markel Ventures operations
decreased compared to 2019 as a result of decreased demand attributed to the
economic and social disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. EBITDA from Markel
Ventures was $284 million for the first nine months of 2020, compared to $219 million last
year, reflecting the contribution of Lansing and VSC, as well as growth and improved
operating results. It's certain of our businesses. Looking at our consolidated results for the
year, our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2020, was not meaningful to the
small pre-tax loss in the period. The effective tax rate was 22% for the nine months ended
September 30th, 2019. And the estimated annual effective tax rate for both periods was
21%. We reported a net loss to common shareholders of $31 million for the first nine
months of 2020 compared to net income to shareholders of $1.3 billion a year ago. And
when combined with the contribution of the increase in net [ph]unrealized gains on our
fixed maturity portfolio comprehensive income to shareholders for the first nine months
of 2020 was $260 million, compared to $1.6 billion a year ago.
Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows capital in our balance sheet. Net cash
provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion for the first nine months of 2020,
compared to $712 million in 2019. Operating cash flows for 2020, reflected higher
premium collections as we've seen strong growth in our insurance segment over the past
several quarters.
Invested assets at the holding company with $3.8 billion at the end of September,
compared to $4 billion at the end of 2019. The change in holding company invested
assets reflects funds used to acquire Lansing, as well as a decrease in fair value of our

equity portfolio, both of which were partially offset by proceeds from our May 2020
preferred shares offering. Total shareholders' equity stood at $11.9 billion at the end of
September, compared to $11.1 billion at year-end. We continued to maintain the fixed
maturity portfolio product the high credit quality investment grade securities with an
average rating of AA. Our debt to total capital ratio at the end of September was 23%,
down slightly from 24% at year-end, and we have no unsecured senior nets maturing until
July of 2022.
We believe we are well-positioned to meet our ongoing capital and liquidity needs,
including supporting the growth in our insurance operations. We expect to continue to see
attractive opportunities in the specialty insurance marketplace. With that, I'll turn it over to
Richie to talk more about our insurance businesses.

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Thanks Jeremy, and good morning, everyone. As Tom has already said the year as we
saw the continuation of the unpredictable roller coaster year that is 2020 in the third
quarter. Despite all that, our insurance operations continued to grow nicely and we obtain
meaningful rate increases in almost all our lines. Our third quarter was also impacted by a
series of small, medium-sized cats as Jeremy mentioned for which we recorded an
aggregate $101 million of underwriting losses in the quarter. And those were related to
multiple hurricanes Laura, Sally, Isaias, the roadshow and the Western wildfires. As regards
COVID-19 losses in the third quarter of 2020, we increased that provision to $374 million
that was up from our original $325 million provision that we established in the first quarter.
While we have revised many of our original assumptions with the availability of additional
information in some of those have been positive, some of those have been negative, the
largest driver for the increase in our direct estimates this quarter related to the UK High
Court ruling on the FCA business interruption test case, that the impact of that ruling
impacted our estimates within our reinsurance segment. There were also some increase
is required is we now expect the impact of COVID-19 to be felt into the first half of 2021,
that specifically impacts and then cancellation business. As part of the third quarter
COVID-19 provision, we also recorded $50 million of estimated losses in our trade credit
product line within our insurance operations and those claims, were related to indirect
economic impact from COVID-19. We're not a but-for company at Markel. CAT losses over
the past four years, including 2020 COVID-19 losses has significantly impacted all of our
insurance, reinsurance, and ILS businesses.
As a consequence, we've missed our underwriting profitability goals over that four-year
period. And as a result, we've implemented many key strategic changes over the last
several quarters designed to reduce the number of but-for items that could potentially
impact our future results. We believe the changes we have made and will continue to
make will reduce the volatility of our insurance business results going forward. Given the
strength of the current market and pricing trends and the unique capabilities we have
assembled, we are bullish about our opportunity to perform and put more points on the
board moving forward.
Make no mistake. We are realist, and this is insurance and but-for events are going to
happen. Our goal is to lessen their impact and deliver stronger underwriting results to

FINAL

account for the inevitable events that will occur. Now I'd like to discuss our insurance
operations, which include our underwriting operations, State National Program Services
operations and insurance linked securities operations. So I'll kick off with the insurance
segment. Gross written premiums for the quarter are up $96 million or 7%, compared to
the third quarter of 2019. For the nine months, premiums are up $503 million or 13%.
Premium growth for both the quarter and nine months was driven by continued organic
growth and rate increases in our professional liability, and general liability products along
with growth in our personal lines, product lines. For the quarter ended September 30,
these increases were partially offset by lower gross written premiums within certain of our
specialty programs due to lower economic activity related to COVID-19 and due to active
portfolio management where we have discontinued writing certain underperforming lines
and programs.

Bloomberg Transcript

We're taking the opportunity in this market to remix our portfolio to our most profitable
lines of business. The combined ratio for the insurance segment was 94% for the third
quarter of 2020, compared to 92% last year. That two-point increase in the combined
ratio was driven by five-point increase in the impact of CAT losses and one-point of loss is
attributed to COVID-19 exposures, partially offset by lower attritional loss ratio and a
lower expense ratio. The decrease in the attritional loss ratio due to decreases in our
general liability and property product lines driven again by premium rate increases.
The insurance segment combined ratio for the first nine months was 100% versus 94% for
the same period a year ago. The six-point increase in the combined ratio was driven
primarily by nine points of loss attributed to COVID-19 exposures and two-point increase
from the impact of CAT losses. These impacts were partially offset by an increase in
favorable development on prior accident years losses, primarily in our professional liability
and product -- property product lines, and lower attritional loss ratio across several
product lines due in part to premium rate increases and a lower expense ratio. Higher
earned premiums for both the quarter and year-to-date within our insurance segment had
a favorable impact on our expense ratio and an unfavorable impact on the prior year's
loss ratio.
Moving to the reinsurance segment, a few weeks ago, we announced that we are
creating one center of expertise for the global property CAT reinsurance market by close
-- by closing our Markel global property CAT unit and having to fill up become Markel
single point of entry for serving the property CAT reinsurance market. This move allows us
to more fully leverage and fill as market leading competitive position while also
generating operational efficiencies. We believe that the companies that will win in the
future of those in most efficiently connect CAT -- connect risk with capital.
And this strategic move is going to help us do that in the property CAT market. Going
forward, Markel Global Re will increase its focus on underwriting and growing its casualty
and specialty lines under the continued leadership of Jed Rhoads, President and Chief
Underwriting Officer. Gross written premiums for both the quarter end-year decreased
slightly compared to the same periods in 2019. In the quarter, we saw higher gross
premiums in our general liability lines due primarily to new business written, and higher
rates on that business, offset by lower premiums in our workers' compensation and
Page 7 of 22

FINAL

property lines due to lower premium adjustments and lower renewal premiums with this
workers' compensation, and the unfavorable impact of renewal timing within property.
As mentioned previously, significant volatility in gross premium volume can be expected in
our reinsurance segment due to individually significant deals and the timing of renewals.
The combined ratio for the reinsurance segment was 116% for the third quarter,
compared to 103% last year. That 13-point increase in the combined ratio was driven by
three-point increase from the impact of CAT losses and a 15-point increase due to losses
attributed to COVID-19. Partially offset by more favorable development on prior accident
year loss reserves.
The increase in favorable prior year loss development was due to favorable development
in our professional liability and workers' compensation product lines this year versus
adverse development that was experienced last year. The reinsurance segment
combined ratio for the first nine months was 106% versus 99% for the same period a year
ago. Seven-point increase in the combined ratio was driven by one-point increase from
the impact of CAT losses and a ten-point increase due to losses attributed to COVID-19.
This was partially offset by a lower expense ratio and more favorable development on
prior accident-year loss reserves.

Bloomberg Transcript

The increase in favorable prior year loss development was due to more favorable
development in our property product line, partially offset by adverse development on our
public entity product line in 2020. Next, I'm going to touch on program services in our ILS
operations.
As a reminder, amounts from our program services in ILS operations are reported within
services and other revenues, expenses, within our operating results. So starting with State
National gross written premium volume for State National's program service operations
were down in both the quarter and year-to-date basis that was driven by the run-off of
one large program and the in-force cancellation of another large program, which resulted
in a one-time unfavorable premium adjustment in the first quarter of this year. While gross
written premium is down as a result of these two programs we've seen encouraging new
business activity and we've found a number of new programs that are coming online as
we move forward. As a reminder, almost all of the gross written premium in our Program
Services division is ceded.
Ceding fee revenues were also down for both the quarter in the year due to the lower
gross written premium volume over the past few quarters. Moving to our insurance linked
securities operations, our combined ILS operations have roughly $10.6 billion and net
assets under management as of September 30th.
Revenues from our ILS operations decreased 29% from the prior year's quarter and 8%
for the nine-month period. Both the quarter and year-to-date periods were impacted by
lower management fees at CATCo due to lower AUM from winding down the operations,
and reduction in managed these charged during the wind down. Nephila revenues were
down for the quarter due to lower investment management fees as a result of some
redemptions in 2020 and an increase in side pocket assets on which management fees

FINAL

are deferred until released. Obviously the Cats that occurred in the third quarter, we had
to set up loss reserves for those, as well as pockets in that impacted management fee
income. For the year, Nephila revenues are up -- with the decrease of Nephila investment
management fees more than offset by higher revenues from their MGA operations.
Operating expenses from ILS operations increased for both the quarter and year-to-date
compared to the prior year due to the impact of a legal settlement in the CATCo
operations.
Higher operating expenses is so fixated with the growth in our Nephila MGA operations
and start-up cost associated with our large part operation. I'll finish with a little bit of
market commentary and obviously happy to pick that up when we get to questions. The
trends that we've been discussing in the previous quarters continued in the third quarter.
We can -- we see continued price momentum in almost all lines and we believe that this
pricing momentum will continue as a multitude of factors, such as low interest rates,
elevated CAT activity, social inflation, COVID-19 losses and economic uncertainty as a
result are all likely to persist throughout 2021. We also believe our businesses will benefit
as the economy recovers from the impact of COVID-19 while large and medium-sized
businesses have shown resilience to the economic disruption, small businesses which are
meaningful part of our portfolio have definitely been adversely impacted. To sum it up
after a brutal start to the year with COVID-19 losses. We now have an opportunity to
finished 2020 with an underwriting profit. We're going to need to push hard over these
last nine weeks to achieve that goal.
I want to thank all of our market employees who've worked so hard under difficult
conditions to give us this opportunity. I want to thank you for your time today. And now I'd
like to turn it over to Tom.

Thomas Sinnickson Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Thank you, Richie. In our investing operations, we earned 2.8% on our equity portfolio and
5.4% in our fixed income holdings for a total return of 3.8% after all allocated expenses
and FX effects. I am pleased with positive returns in the current environment. Strategically,
I believe that the most important role for investments at this point is to preserve and
protect the balance sheet of Markel. Given our views about the general level of trade-offs
between risk and return on offer today, we believe that our current focus on high quality
and liquidity preserve options to make different investment decisions in a different
environment.
The opportunity cost of our staff, it seems very low to me. We don't think that we would
get paid appropriately for taking meaningful credit, duration for many other types of risk
right now. As such, we'll stay relatively liquid and ready and able to deploy cash more
aggressively when we see the opportunity to earn appropriate returns and compensation
for doing so. In our Ventures operations, I want to be clear. The news is excellent. The
managers and teams of the Ventures businesses continued to respond superbly to
rapidly changing and disruptive business conditions. I am grateful and amazed at their
skills, professionalism and dedication to their associates in their customers.

For the first nine months, revenues and Ventures grew 28% to just over $2 billion
compared to $1.56 billion a year ago. EBITDA for the nine months increased 29% to $284
million compared to $219 million a year ago. This record setting financial performance was
broad based. While this is the first full quarter of results from our most recent acquisition
of Lansing building products, the entire group demonstrated resiliency and the value of
diversification. We operate an array of different industrial and service businesses that are
market leaders in what they do. They serve a wide variety of customers and experience
economic cyclicality and variability from many factors.
We would normally expect volatility from their results. Not unlike what we experienced
from our investment portfolio when we look at short term timeframes. With that said, I
think this year's results stand as a dramatic validation of the value of Markel Ventures to
the overall purpose and future of the Markel Corporation. For your reference, I checked
my notes from the third quarter year-to-date conference call from five years ago in 2015.
And that year, we reported revenues from Markel Ventures of $784 million for the first
nine months and EBITDA of $76 million.

I don't remember the exact economic circumstances and conditions of 2015. But I'm
pretty sure I didn't include dealing with a worldwide pandemic. Our efforts to build an
enduring and resilience system at Markel continue to unfold. I'm hopeful that the evidence
we've offered you this morning about our short-term and long-term progress provides
you with some confidence in our win, win, win mindset as we seek to build one of the
world's great companies. With that, Emily, if you'd be so kind to open the floor, we love to
answer some of your questions.

Questions And Answers

We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions).
First question comes from Phil Stefano from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Phil Stef ano

{BIO 18965951 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, and good morning. Just going back to the insurance business in the
premium volume, I guess I was surprised that the growth is decelerated from the second
quarter, and it feels like part of the explanation that is that we're taking the opportunity in
the market to remix some lines of business, maybe you can help us think about the extent
to which this pressured top-line growth, how long may this remixing take. And look -- Just
given the opportunity in the market and the extent of pricing, what are your early thoughts
on 2021? Why would we not see double-digit growth next year?

A - Thomas Sinnickson Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Sure. Thanks, Phil. Yeah. Third quarter, there were a lot of different things impacting the
third quarter, but one in particular was -- I mean, we are taking the opportunity to remix
and really focus on growing what we call our green classes that our most profitable
Page 10 of 22

FINAL

classes. So we've been very aggressive I think this year in terms of moving away from
business if it wasn't meeting our profitability goals, closing some of those down, closing
down programs that -- We didn't see meeting our goals. And some of that's starting to
add up, and that impacted in the third quarter.
Also in the third quarter, July 1 is a big date for us and we had a really good July 1. AugustSeptember, they tend to be less busy months for us and that sort of continued this year.
So all in all, I'm very pleased with the growth we showed in the third quarter, giving all the
moving parts and all the things we are doing. Also, it's fair to say, the economic struggles
had impacted I think small business to a greater extent and maybe larger businesses. And
we saw the massive amount of stimulus that was put into the economy in the first six
months, that wasn't there in the third quarter, and I think some of that had been used to
pay premiums in the first two quarters by some businesses.
So we saw a little bit of that in the third quarter. But I'm not particularly concerned about it.
We've seen a few of our numbers so far for October, and I would tell you, they're very
strong. So you say, why wouldn't we grow double digits in 2021? That's certainly going to
be our goal to grow double digits in '21.

{BIO 18965951 <GO>}

Okay, got it. And sticking with insurance, and understanding and appreciate that you're
not a but-for company. But when I look at the underlying loss ratio, but for CAT losses in
COVID, there was a pretty good improvement in that attritional performance. Can you
help us thinking about the potential contributions of rate versus trend, any COVID
frequency benefit from a lack of economic development, and the remixing the business.
Presumably, that's going to have a benefit as well. So if you could just kind of bifurcate all
these moving pieces to help us understand what's going on here.

A - Thomas Sinnickson Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

I'll do the best I can. We've gone to a point where our year-to-date rate increase is a
double-digit, low double-digits at this point. So rate is certainly a part of it. The remixing is
also a part of it. We are growing the most in the lines of business that we, again, call our
green classes which are our most profitable classes. We are shrinking classes and you saw
that some in the third quarter that we haven't seen the profitability that we would like to
see. So all those things are at play. And yes, we saw very nice decrease in the attritional
loss ratio so far in the year. And the goal -- the goal is to make sure, but-for events don't
stop that from being what the result looks like as we go into 2021. So unfortunately for the
last four years, there has been a lot of CAT events that has prevented what has been
some pretty nice underlying performance. It's prevented that from showing up in our
combined ratio. And so we've been taking a lot of steps to mitigate and hopefully reduce
the number of those, but-for events.

Q - Phil Stef ano

{BIO 18965951 <GO>}

Okay. Last one for me and then I'll requeue. I was just hoping you could provide a little
context on your appetite to grow reinsurance in the potential outlook for one-one.

FINAL

Well, obviously now Markel Global Re is going to be focused on casualty and specialty
lines. And we do think there is an opportunity in the casualty and specialty lines to grow.
We're seeing rate increases. I talked about we're seeing increases in our general liability
reinsurance programs and some of that some of that is obviously new business we're
writing. But a lot-- Some of that increase is also just underlying rate increases in the
primary business.
We're going to be cautious that we haven't seen the profitability we have wanted to see,
in those two areas over the last couple of years. So first and foremost is making sure it's
profitable, and once we are convinced it's profitable, we'll look to grow it in this
environment.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Could you speak to the M&A environment for Markel Ventures. I guess
I'm wondering if the tough economic conditions are just sort of creating opportunities
where some targets may be temporarily impaired looking for a partner. I don't know if you
do those types of situations or other opportunity is popping up here in this environment.

A - Thomas Sinnickson Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks, Jeff. This is Tom. I would say there is a lot of M&A being done, but not at
prices that we're going to do it. Frankly, over the last three or four years, we've not made
a lot of outgoing calls or solicited things, but some businesses have been attracted to
that the long-term nature of Markel's, we have grown almost in spite of ourselves. We
observe a lot of transactions. And we're rubbing hair off our heads, scratching our heads
looking at the valuation. So I think circumstance you lay out will probably happen someday,
but we're to kind of watching the freight go by.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Okay. And then on the Lansing acquisition, obviously revenue's up a ton from that deal,
but profits at Markel Health Insurance were up a lot too. Is that from Lansing, I guess with
building products is that-- or is that struggling now and so we could see profitability pickup
quite a bit next year from that.

A - Thomas Sinnickson Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Yeah, I want to reiterate that. That profitability has crossed the board. So, yeah,
everybody is feeling COVID in one way or another. But again I just take my hats off to the

Page 12 of 22

FINAL

managers and people at the Markel Ventures operations. They've done a -- Just grateful
and amazed are the two words that accurately describe the circumstance. So that's not
concentrated in any one place. Obviously, the revenue pickup is pretty big with Lansing
because that is a business where, I mean, its distribution kind of business.
So revenues are disproportionately high compared to EBITDA relative to the rest of the
Markel Ventures set of businesses. The returns on capital will be similar, but it's crossed
the board. The group is doing very well.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Okay. And just one more on the insurance segment. I guess, the NPWT growth, I think, you
referenced in the queue is that a program that was put it into run-off there. I think it
affected the retention amount. What program was that, or what was the size of that
program?

A - Thomas Sinnickson Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Well, we put a handful of programs in lines of business into run-off that we're not
performing. The particular one that I think that was mentioned there was being referred
to, it was a program -- it was a program for municipals and it had a heavy property
exposure in it that had really not performed well. And so, we chose to walk away from
that. I think the impact in the quarter was $20 million-$30 million if I'm not mistaken.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jeremy Andrew Noble

{BIO 20687803 <GO>}

Not -- not so much gross yet. I mean, -- I think it's for a period of time until that program
transitions were sort of serving in the front of capacity, so it influences the net retention
versus what we've seen so far on the gross written premium. But--

A - Thomas Sinnickson Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Yeah, Jeremy is right. We are still running that for the next carrier at this moment. So it
hasn't impacted our gross that much at this point, but we're not retaining it net. So over
time, that will come through as well.

A - Jeremy Andrew Noble

{BIO 20687803 <GO>}

And that's a good example where I think we will find the opportunity to kind of make up
for that premium reduction by focusing on the profitable classes that we're seeing
opportunities.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Right. Okay, thank you for the color.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions. The reorganization or change in the property
reinsurance business that's going to Nephila. Can you just talk about that in a little more
detail? In particular, I guess what I'm curious about is, is that effective for one-one? Is it
effective immediately? And in general terms, about how many millions of premiums are
impacted, kind of, maybe using this year's year-to-date as a run rate or something like
that.

A - Thomas Sinnickson Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Sure. Sure, Mark, it's effective for one-one. So no one-one business will be renewed on
Markel's books. And if those clients are interested, Nephila will offer renewal quotes on
that business. It's about $200 million of premium. It's obviously CAT-driven premium that,
to the extent, it is renewed. It will renew within the fill of funds. Obviously, what that does
for us in terms of Markel's balance sheet is it removes that volatility from Markel's balance
sheet. And as we go forward, to the extent, we want to take CAT risk. It's a cleaner
option, I think, to do it from within the Nephila funds, to invest in the Nephila funds. It
shows alignment with our investors.

Bloomberg Transcript

It's very easy to calculate how much capital on allocating to CAT, it's whatever the
investment is. It makes that makes that math simple. And then, obviously, Nephila with its
management of roughly $10 billion of AUM. They have market presence, market cloud
that we just -- we're never going to be able to achieve at Markel Re. So the logic just
make too much sense in terms of making that move.

Q - Charles

{BIO 15023094 <GO>}

Thanks for that. Now, the logic did seem to make quite a bit of sense. On that same topic,
or generally in that same topic, with the legal settlement you've now achieved in CATCo
does that accelerate or change any of the timeline on finalizing the run-off there.

A - Thomas Sinnickson Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

No, the run-off is really dictated by the settlement of the contracts with Siemens and the
team there has made terrific progress settling suddenly with seen I think we're down to
about $1.2 billion of AUM, which I think is I don't know, $1 billion or $2 billion or so down
from the beginning of the year. So they've made great progress, as is always the case,
you know that last bit takes a while. So they're working really hard to do it. But that
settlement really is unrelated to how long it will take to return all assets to the investors.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. And then the other question that I had. You provided a very helpful table in the
queue related to the various COVID related charges that you took. There are few items
within that table, though where it showed effectively a negative charge. Were those just
reclassifications between the insurance and reinsurance segments or was there some
actual release of reserves or take down of reserves associated?

FINAL

Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2020-10-28

Hey, Mark. It's Jeremy. There were a few pockets actually where we reduced our reserves
from initial expectation. Some of that we saw in our US property relative to our initial sort
of reserves also within our international book in the UK relative to business interruption.
We kind of commented about the sort of the contract that we're putting some reserves
up in our reinsurance line associated with the FCA Test Case, but we really haven't seen
the frequency of claims reporting for some of business interruption relative to our initial
expectations there. So there were a couple of situations where we release reserves
netting against those increases.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful.

A - Thomas Sinnickson Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Yeah Mark, I tried to kind of allude to that, my comments. I mean obviously we took our
best shot back in the first quarter and coming up with reserves for COVID. Obviously,
since then we've learned a lot more, and my guess is we'll continued to learn as we get
through this because we've never seen this situation before. As a result of those
learnings, in some areas we felt reserves could come down, in other areas, we felt
reserves needed to go up. And my guess is that, that will probably continue as we go
forward, we'll continue to adjust as we learn.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Of the total bucket of sort of $375-ish million, is most of that still in IBNR at this point or
has there been significant pay downs relative to that through certainly some of the event
claims I would think out paid at this point.

A - Jeremy Andrew Noble

{BIO 20687803 <GO>}

Yeah, certainly, Mark. I don't know if you're right to hand. But I think more than half of that
is still an IBNR. So we've seen -- Certainly, we've seen increased claims reporting from the
encouraged standpoint, and we've had some settlement activity, but there's still a
significant amount of that that's sitting in IBNR. And it's a good example. The amount that
have been put up in the third quarter at principal we all in IBNR.

Hey, John.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

FINAL

Richie, I'm curious what your expectation is for State National. You mentioned some new
programs coming on. When do you expect that would start growing again?

A - Richard Reeves Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

I think it will, those were big programs that came off in the first quarter. And it's, we
probably talked enough about it. One of those programs was very much an opportunistic
program. And when that company receive their upgrade of their ratings, they no longer
needed State Nationals' program services fronting capabilities. So (inaudible) that is going
to go away. The other one was a little surprising to us, not so much that it went away, but
how it went away, that on a cut-off basis and that premium all just moving to the new
carrier. But we've seen a number of new programs coming on.

Bloomberg Transcript

Unfortunately, none of those have been quite as large as the two that went away. But
we'll start to see premium ramp up from those new programs and more importantly, we
really like the activity we're seeing. And I think it's just what's happening in the market. It's
a very interesting, exciting time in the market right now. There is a number of new players
trying to get themselves setup to hopefully take advantage, I guess, of the conditions.
And by plotting services is a very attractive way to get going quickly. So we were receiving
a lot of inquiries.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

Okay, great. And you mentioned probably not a quote. But you have not met your
underwriting goals over the last few years due to the cat losses, and now you're remixing
the business. So I'm assuming you're aspiring to a higher underwriting profit. Can you
share like what you are thinking about in terms of when you're mixing the business, and
what type of combined ratio or is it premature for that?

A - Richard Reeves Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

John, given the rate increases we are seeing, given the interest rate environment that
Tom and the team are having to content with. We think we need to be around the 90
combined, and I'd love to see it lower. But I think it's got to be something around the 90
because we just can't put the pressure on Tom and team to generate returns in this low
to no-interest rate environment.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

Right. Okay, great. Thank you. And then, I understand there was of settlement in a lawsuit.
And so maybe you can't talk about some of this. But to the extent that you can, what is
the run rate expenses of the profitability at ILS Investment Management segment?

A - Richard Reeves Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}
Page 16 of 22



Company N ame: M arkel Corp

FINAL

Well, I'm going to -- It's not going to be an exact quote from Mr. Noble. Mr. Noble and I
were talking the other day, and unfortunately I don't think I've seen a run rate quarter yet.
There's just been a lot of noise, unfortunately. But here's where we are, John. I think we
have had success in attracting new AUM for January 1. So that will be coming on board for
2021.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Richard Reeves Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

So the two things that impact our ability to make to create a return in ILS are the amount
of AUM, and how many losses we have. Well, we can't do much about the number of
losses. Although I would tell you the last four years have been brutal.
But rates are going up substantially. So I think that business is going to be better priced. I
know that business is better priced going forward, giving us a better opportunity to earn
on that for our investors and thus earn fees. So really, there really hasn't been a good run
rate quarter yet, but I think going into '21. We've got some momentum, both in terms of
rate increases were receiving. And so the profitability of the business we're writing and
investors signing up to invest in the funds.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Thomas Sinnickson Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

And John, if I could tag on to Richie's answer because there is one very, very important
nuance that, I think, often gets lost in the communication of how this business works, and
it's newness to Markel. So when Richie talked about the losses that occur, in the old days,
when we were writing that business on our balance sheet, that would be dollar-for-dollar,
our capital that would have a loss and show up in the combined ratio, the business we
write. This is where we're managing other people's capital. So the loss ratio really has a
profound but indirect effect on the management and performance fees. So there is
exponential returns on our capital when industry losses come in more -- at lower levels
than would have been the last couple of years. And to Richie's point about, we haven't
seen a normal run rate. We've not been in an environment where you start to see kind of
what your normalized expectations of management and performance fees that Nephila
has indeed earned over many years, and we would expect to normally describe the
business.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

Okay. Well, let me prompts another question. So if I think about traditional Asset
Management, which everyone on the call is familiar with, you would take average AUM
times of fee. If I do that, I get about 140 basis points on the Nephila revenue annualized.
And that would be my revenue and then expense, profit margins and invest margins
about 30% on average. So but it sounds like there is a third dimension, which is the
amount of loss, CAT losses loses. Also--

A - Thomas Sinnickson Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Page 17 of 22



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2020-10-28

FINAL

Well, here's the thing. So like traditional Asset Management. If you were talking about a
company that manages mutual funds, where performance fees have historically not been
part of it, your math is exactly that. It's assets under management times the management
fee, minus the expenses. Boom shakalaka. There is a profitability in the 2.0 version of
investment managers, and there's plenty of them out there. That's only part of the
equation. Then there is another variable of performance fees, based on how well you did
for your investors. And that's the aspect that I've just highlighted here.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

Yeah, okay. So it's three dimensions, not two.

A - Thomas Sinnickson Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Correct. So, John, obviously given the last four years, there hasn't been a lot of
performance fees earned because there has been pretty above normal or above
previous normal CAT activity. So that's impacted it. And also, this business is highly
leverageable. At $10 billion of assets under management, it would look very different
under $12 billion or $13 billion or $14 billion of assets under management, because we
really don't need to add a lot of additional cost to manage that.

Q - John Fox

{BIO 18976738 <GO>}

Right, sure.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Thomas Sinnickson Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

We can scale of the business pretty substantially.

talked about, I assume that that's a reported number that includes CATs and all of the
but-fors?

A - Richard Reeves Whitt

getting there over the next couple of years?

FINAL

A - Richard Reeves Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

I feel very bullish about that. I think we talked with the first set of questions about the
improvement in the underlying attritional. So I think there's more room for that to improve
it. And we've obviously we've been working very hard to reduce volatility from CAT losses.
So I'm bullish as we go into '21.

Q - Phil Stef ano

{BIO 18965951 <GO>}

Okay. And the last one is a numbers question on Ventures. Can you help us frame the
contribution that Lansing could have over the next couple of quarters or what we could
expect maybe there is some seasonality to the business as we think about the revenue
growth into mid 2021?

A - Richard Reeves Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, I think when you look at the quarter, given current business conditions. That's
reasonable run rate kind of revenue thoughts that you should have. Typically, seasonality
building products tend to slow down a little bit in the winter time, but we're not seeing
that right now, just things housing related are quite hot. But we'll see how it goes. And
we've not owned it long enough to really give you any seasonal pattern. Other common

Hello, gentlemen. I have a why-not instead of a but-for. Ventures (inaudible) you've been

FINAL

maintained (inaudible) equity in the company during this horrific period. Over my many
decades in this business, I've seen many companies that had share repurchase plans, not
buy when the price was low, but buy when the price was high. And I know you're very
attuned to value when you make that decision. But the sky's -- if the sky's are not perfectly
blue now, but it seems like you are envisioning times when they're going to get a lot bluer
then they are. Currently, the pricing is good, Ventures is doing well. You feel good about
all the insurance arms.
Why not take the handcuffs off the statement that you're not open to buying shares back.
Today, you've got cash, I believe of $4.5 billion. I've never seen -- if that's correct. I haven't
seen that ratio to value of the company in your history. Why wait for the last cloud to clear
to have the ability to pull the trigger if you choose to do so. It doesn't mean you have to,
in the last quarter of the year, but you would have told the market that you want to have
that arrow back in your quiver, and you may or may not use it.

A - Thomas Sinnickson Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Alright, Charles. This is Tom. Thanks for the question. And really the long-term in the pull,
from my point of view, is the regulatory and rating agency environment that we continue
to need to be sensitive to. So in the environment which we continue to be in, the current
growth rate of what we're experiencing in our insurance business has regulators and
rating agencies being very particular about the amount of capital we have and the form in
which it is held. So we continued to work with them to try to make them as comfortable as
we possibly can, and that's an ongoing process.
And at the point where the growth rate slows down a little bit, that will actually free up
sort of the regulatory capital and rating agency capital that we need to be sensitive to for
the insurance business. But other than that, I agree with everything you said.

Yeah. Hi there, good morning. Just maybe one more question for Richie on the
reinsurance segment. Obviously, if you included the CAT losses. I think you look at life,
now you had a cumulative loss over the last 10 years and so. I suppose, but-for CAT
events have been pretty sizable. It seems to me that by consolidating the property CAT
business tuned to fill that you are going to be reducing a lot of the volatility in that
segment. So my question is more -- if it's going to be looking more like casualty and
specialty going forward. What -- how has that performed, and how far away from that
90% combined ratio are those pieces?

A - Richard Reeves Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Yeah. It has not performed as well as it needed to, Bob, is what I'd tell you. I can't
remember this question it was, but I said, before we grow it, we're going to make sure
we've got it at the right price at the right level of profitability. And we're seeing really nice
rate increases on the primary side. Not all of that has flowed through to reinsurance yet.
So we're going to be watching that really closely, but I am bullish on our opportunity to get
that to a great -- to a good profitability level.
But I think it is -- I think reinsurance is a little behind primary at the moment. And so we're
going to keep working on it. And once we are comfortable. You'll see us growing.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Bob Farnam

{BIO 15005467 <GO>}

Okay. My point is, for reinsurance, we take $200 million of the property CAT out, maybe
take a lot of a catastrophe losses out. So that kind of get that -- kind of a way to back into
what the other pieces have oddly performed over time. I think, obviously, the COVID, you
probably consider that covering the casualty and specialty or is that considered cat. How
are you noticing that--

A - Richard Reeves Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

That's mostly coming out of the property policy is not entirely but mostly.

Q - Bob Farnam

Yeah.

Q - Bob Farnam
