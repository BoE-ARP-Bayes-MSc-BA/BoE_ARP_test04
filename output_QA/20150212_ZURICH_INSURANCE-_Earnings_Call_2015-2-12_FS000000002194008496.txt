MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to the Zurich
Insurance Group Annual Results 2014 Conference Call. I'm Stephanie, the Chorus Call
operator. I would like to remind you that all participants will be in listen-only mode, and
the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be a Q&A session.
The conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast. At this time, it's my
pleasure to hand over to Mr. James Quin, Head of Investor Relations and Rating Agency.
Please go ahead, sir.

James Quin

Hello and welcome to Zurich's full year results presentation. I'm joined by our CEO, Martin
Senn, and our CFO, George Quinn. Martin and George will make a few short comments
before we open the Q&A. And as usual, please keep to two questions.

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Thank you, James, and welcome to everyone on the call on my behalf as well. We are one
year into the three-year strategy we outlined in December of 2013. And as I explained in
my presentation this morning, we have made good progress in a number of key areas and
across each of our three strategic cornerstones, namely, investing in priority markets,
managing for value and growing our operating earnings.
In terms of our targets, we are very well positioned in two of the three, our solvency, as
measured by the Z-ECM ratio and cash remittances. These two metrics are important
reﬂections of our overall ﬁnancial strength and resilience and underpin the CHF 17
dividend per share that the board of directors is proposing.
Where we are less satisﬁed is with the progress made in translating these initiatives into
improved earnings, with an ROE of 11% below our 12% to 14% target range. While an 11%
return is not a bad outcome in itself, there is a gap to close. And we have actions
underway across the business to ensure that we will deliver on all three of our targets.
And with that, I will now hand over to George, who will give you a short overview of our
ﬁnancial results. Thank you.

George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Martin, and good morning or good afternoon from me. I'll make a few short
introductory remarks on the results. And as I do that, I'll try and answer some of the
questions that we've been receiving this morning. And I'll focus ﬁrst on Q4 standalone.
So our business operating proﬁt of just over $800 million is below expectations and that's
mainly due to a 99.4% combined ratio on GI business and reserve additions that we made
in non-core, which mainly relate to U.S. asbestos and environmental liabilities.
In GI, the accident year ex-cat combined ratio was 98.2% for Q4 compared to 94.8% in the
ﬁrst nine months of the year. The increase is due to four factors, which are in roughly
equal measure. So we have a slightly higher level of large loss. We have adverse
experience on U.S. crop. We have an uptick in the attritional loss ratio, and we have
slightly higher expenses.
To put it in some context, compared to where we were in the nine-month results, we've
increased the attritional loss ratio booked for the full year by about 30 basis points in Q4.
It's a fairly small adjustment, obviously, overall for the year, but it magniﬁes because of the
impact in the quarter.
This doesn't make the Q4 results any better, but hopefully, it does explain to some degree
why we wouldn't extrapolate this into future periods and why instead we would actually

FINAL

ask you to focus on the full year picture. Now, on that basis, we did make good progress
in a number of key areas. So even with a weaker Q4, our accident year ex-cat combined
ratio in GI improved by 1.5%.
Our Life business results were impacted by some of the management actions that we took
last year, as well as the costs of some of the central initiatives that we are undertaking in
execution of our strategy. And Farmers, we believe, has clearly turned the corner, with a
return to growth and positive momentum on all key metrics.
There are positive trends in the performance, although we clearly need to do more to
improve our ROE and deliver on the 12% to 14% target. But this isn't any diﬀerent to the
picture that I set out at the December investor update. And while the gap between our
2014 performance and our target is perhaps slightly wider than expected, the levers that
we intend to apply are no diﬀerent to the ones that we discussed back in December.
So namely delivering, number one, on the GI turnaround plans, further underwriting
initiatives in priority markets, in-force management in Life and with an acceleration of
plans relating to eﬃciency.

Bloomberg Transcript

Lastly, in relation to our balance sheet and cash position, the macro environment, lower
reinvestment rates and the strength of the dollar and Swiss franc against the euro present
us, obviously, with some challenges. We've tried to give you a steer in the presentation on
what these factors might mean for our starting-point earnings in 2015, but nonetheless,
we remain in a very secure position in terms of both solvency and our ability to extract
cash from the business.
As you know, the board of directors is proposing an unchanged dividend of CHF 17 per
share. And as we said before, the main driver of dividend and dividend growth will be the
overall earnings level. And our aim is to grow operating proﬁt earnings. At the same time,
as I said last December, we are highly unlikely to simply add to our equity over the next
two years without taking options to deploy our surplus capital within the business or
return it to investors. And this remains an additional lever to allow us to improve our ROE
and achieve our targets for 2014 to 2016.
With that, we'll now open it up for questions.

Q&A
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. First question from Mr. Paul De'Ath,
RBC. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Paul C. De'Ath
Yeah, hi there, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of things. Firstly,
on the Z-ECM ratio, this obviously remains at an elevated level. Where do you expect that
Page 3 of 27



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2015-02-12

moving? I mean do you plan on more re-risking in order to improve returns and bring that
number down? That's question one.

FINAL

And the second point, again on the solvency position, you've given some guidance on
the FX impact on earnings, but if you could give us some kind of steer as to whether or
not the FX moves will have any impact on the solvency position over the next year that
would be very helpful. Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Great. Thanks, Paul. So on the ﬁrst one, just a reminder the Z-ECM number we published
today is the September end position. So we'll have an update again with the Q1 results. I
mean I think if you look at I mean what might happen, the things we may do, I think from a
re-risking perspective, we'll take some steps to address the issues of negative interest
rates, especially in Switzerland, and perhaps elsewhere in the portfolio. And I think that
will add a very, very small amount of additional risk to the portfolio. I don't think that will
be particularly material for us and maybe a couple of points. The FX move will also have
some impact, but again, I expect it to be pretty modest, maybe at the same type of order.

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean when we present the next Z-ECM ratio, it will include the plans for 2015 and the
growth that we currently plan for and the risk capital that it requires. But I mean I don't
expect to see a major change beyond those two items and the impact to growth. So I
mean Z-ECM, we're well above target range; target range again is 100% to 120%. Our aim
– in fact, more than our aim, our intention by 2016 is to make sure that we're back in that
range.
The capital priorities we've set out before, but obviously, number one is to maintain and
eventually grow the ordinary dividend. Number two is to invest for growth. And the
growth can be organic or inorganic. And then number three, to the extent that we haven't
achieved target capitalization levels through number one and number two, we'll return
capital to shareholders.

Q - Paul C. De'Ath
Okay. Excellent, thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you.

Operator
Next question from Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi there. Could you just remind us – clearly, you've put 2015 as an element of a transitional
year and there's quite a few projects where you anticipate payback in 2016. Now, I can

Page 4 of 27



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2015-02-12

identify one of them which is the Brazilian extended warranty business. What are the other
areas of investment where there could be some payback in 2016?

FINAL

So I think there's Brazil extended warranty. I guess you would hope to reinvest the capital
freed up from Farmers Re. What other areas are there where there's a return in 2016
maybe not evident in 2015? Thanks.
And, sorry, the second question was you used the term acceleration with respect to costs
or eﬃciencies, roughly that term. Can you just give us some update on the progress on
the $250 million cost saves? And again, do we assume the non-Life expense ratio should
fall from 2016, given less investment/more payback? Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, thanks, Andrew. So on the ﬁrst topic of investment, I mean I'm not sure I'd necessarily
think of 2015 as a transitional year, but I understand why you put it that way. I mean the
most obvious thing is Brazil. But on top of Brazil, we'll have – I mean if you go back to the
Q2 presentation, we talked about some of the – I guess, the operational leverage that we
described around Santander and the fact that the growth rate we see in Santander is
signiﬁcantly faster than the growth rate on the expense of the amortization side of the
upfront.
Just one comment on the capital from Farmers Re, so I mean I guess we haven't discussed
that topic in detail. I mean you've seen in the presentation already today that I've
mentioned the fact that we're going to trade away the – I mean part of the volatile income
stream in return for capital release. It will take us a bit of time to achieve that capital
release. So I don't necessarily expect to have all of that in my hands this year and, in fact, it
will need time so that, obviously, the team at Farmers can have a discussion with the
regulator and make sure that the regulator is comfortable with the plans that we are
proposing.
So I mean overall, from a – I mean what changes 2015 into 2016, I mean my guess is I
mean you'll see I mean relatively modest impacts from things like Brazil. You'll maybe see
a stronger impact on the Life side from things like Santander, Sabadell and other
transactions that we've done more recently. I mean what would be more transformational?
I mean we have to come back to costs and eﬃciencies.
I guess this comes on to the second part of your question. I mean it's a topic we've been
spending a lot of time looking at. If we simply allowed the – if you look at the expense
ratio for GI on a pro forma basis, if we do nothing, it will rise into 2015. And given the
market conditions and given the challenges that we face, I mean that's not something that
Mike Kerner and the team are prepared to countenance.
I mean overall, though, I think we need to tackle costs and eﬃciencies across the entire
group and not just for GI. So I mean I think that will be a much bigger theme this year that
you'll hear us come back to in May.

FINAL

On the $250 million saves, I mean the $250 million are essentially above – we say, above
the business use, above the legal entities. We are currently on track for delivery of that.
And I'm highly conﬁdent we'll deliver the remainder in the course of this year. I mean I
think we're up to about $100 million saves on that piece for 2014. We'll get the remainder
in 2015.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Can I just clarify on investments? The investments you made in 2014 to Brazil, Sabadell,
that wouldn't be part of the $3 billion reinvestment that you talked about at the Investor
Day. Is that fair?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

No. That would be unfair. I guess we did those before I mentioned the $3 billion.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So these are incremental.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So none of the $3 billion has occurred then as far as you're concerned at this point.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

No. And maybe one additional point on the capital front. I mean I think as you would
appreciate, I mean the $3 billion was sized based on our reasonable expectation of the
amount of money we'd have complete ﬂexibility over. I mean to the extent that we can
grow organically, I mean our ability to use capital and grow organically is much larger
than $3 billion. The $3 billion is the, I guess, the limit where we have complete ﬂexibility or
fungibility.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Andrew, just to add from my side as well, on the aspect of eﬃciency and the respective
improvements, and George just highlighted the fact that it has to go beyond GI and it has
to encompass the whole group. Clearly, with the headwinds we're facing and the
macroeconomic environment, there's a strong sense that we have to look on how we
transform operations, technology altogether.
This is a consideration which has to obviously go as well beyond 2016. But clearly, just to
give you some example without being able to put a price tag on to it, that would mean
Page 6 of 27

FINAL

initiatives in relation to data centers, data center consolidation, real estate consolidation,
further procurement savings, end-to-end process redesign. That's an area, I think, where
we still have quite some work to do in absolute terms. And these are kind of the topics
when we talk about accelerated focus on eﬃciency, we really want to put our hands on
moving forward.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And the acceleration is just reﬂecting the tougher backdrop. Is that right?

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Well, it's reﬂecting that, but the tougher backdrop is as well putting the right sense of
urgency on these initiatives.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thanks.

Next question from Michael Huttner, JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Thank you so much. So my ﬁrst question is could you just possibly walk through the
combined ratios in the fourth quarter by country or geographic area? I couldn't quite
match the numbers I'm looking at with your comments, you see, and I'm kind of thinking,
well, I must be wrong, because you know your numbers, I don't.
For example, I don't think you mentioned Germany. Germany had a high combined ratio
in Q4. I think the UK was mentioned as a source of high large losses. In fact, the UK was –
it had a magic quarter. I can't – and I'm not trying to criticize this. I just want to better
understand what – the feeling I had is that, as CFO, you got a bit fed up with your non-Life
guys and eﬀectively you added a lot to reserves, but that's just a feeling.
And then my second question is on the reserve releases. So the impression I have is that
you're still quite conﬁdent that 1% to 2% is a kind of normal run rate. However, 2014 was
0.6% and you guided us just thinking of 2014 as a normal kind of base. And of course, if I
were to add the U.S. asbestos, which now is non-core, but it was originally in non-Life, of
course, that 0.6% would even be lower. So I just want to have your sense of why you're so
conﬁdent on that number. Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On the ﬁrst point, Michael, so I'm going to avoid going through the thing country by
country, but maybe try and explain I think why some of the confusion arose. Maybe for
everyone's beneﬁt to repeat what we had in Q4, so we've had a combined ratio that's
about 3.4 points worse than the nine months and that's a combination of expenses, which

Page 7 of 27



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG

Date: 2015-02-12

FINAL

is about one point. So if you'd normalize for one-oﬀs, it's crop in the U.S., which is about
0.5 point.
And then on individual large losses, I guess we picked out UK and Brazil. I mean Brazil is I
mean almost all of the impact. So large losses we see higher by about one point. And
then we have the attritional impact, which is, I guess, the second point that you made, I'll
come back to in a second, which is the further one point deterioration for the year. But
obviously, given that's current accident year, you wouldn't expect that to repeat every
single quarter.
So apologies for using UK. I think you're right on the UK result overall, but we picked out
examples of large losses. We weren't looking to try and confuse you.
On the attritional, I think this is your second point. I mean if you look at a number of
businesses, you see attritional numbers that are weaker than we'd like to see. If I look at
the portfolio overall, I mean the things that stand out for me, I mean you can ﬁnd in almost
every geography we operate some small deterioration, again, in line with the comments
that I gave at the very beginning of the call.

Bloomberg Transcript

The things that stand out more though – I mean to come back to your example – did I get
for some reason bored or irritated or whatever it was with the actuarial team and
somehow make them do something they wouldn't ordinarily do, obviously, the answer is
no. I mean yes, the things we did change in Q4, I mean things like I mean high excess
energy books, I mean some – the kind of topic that's notoriously diﬃcult to reserve. And
essentially in that book, we've seen poor experience in 2013.
And in fact, if you cast your mind back to Q2, you might remember it being one of the
reasons why we did not achieve the expected PYD level in that particular quarter. And I
guess we looked at 2013, we looked at the rate improvement that we believe we have
achieved in 2014, and we've concluded at the end of the year that we don't want to give
quite as much weight to that at this stage. I mean that's an example of the kind of thing
we went through. But it really wasn't – and I wouldn't want people to walk away with the
impression that this is some addition of excess conservatism. We try to do the process as
consistently as we always have.
On reserve releases, I mean we end up for the year at 0.6%. Again, for the quarter, we're
beneath the guided 1% to 2%. I mean you've heard me talk before in prior quarters, if you
look at it closely, there are individual items that, I believe, from a longer term perspective,
I wouldn't necessarily multiply up so, therefore, it leaves me with conﬁdence.
And to be honest today, when I look at what we do and the expectation we have, I still
wouldn't change my view that I expect 1% to 2%. But obviously, it's disappointing that I
can't demonstrate that and I simply have to again hold the prospect of it.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Brilliant, that's really helpful. Thank you.

Next question from Andy Broadﬁeld, Barclays. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Andy D. Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Hi there, good morning or good afternoon for you. I just want to follow-up very quickly on
your comments with Michael putting the two things, the true-up and the reserve releases
or the attritional and reserve releases together.
It feels cyclical, in fact, just looking from the outside in. And I appreciate you say there's
no signiﬁcant individual things, but is that not a sign of a cyclical trend that actually the
claims inﬂation is running slightly ahead of where you expect it, especially after a period
of such low claims inﬂation I guess we're all looking for that sign, if there is one, so just
your thoughts on that, please.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then just on the investment side, are you able to give us kind of an indication of the
percentage of your – how would I put this, the allocation of risk to investments now as a
sort of percentage of your overall portfolio? And is it sort of maxed out now or would you
consider re-looking at your risk allocation to investments from a strategic level rather than
just a tactical level?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So what we'll try and do is I'll try and answer number one. I'll deal with the numerical part
on number two. And maybe Martin could comment on the strategic aspect of the risk
allocation of the capital allocation to investments.
I mean the answer to that question number one, Andy, is yes and no. So I mean you've
been in this business long enough to know that everything is cyclical in insurance. So I
mean there isn't an aspect that doesn't have some cyclical feature. But is it claims inﬂation
coming back? I don't believe it is. If it was claims inﬂation, then we'd be talking about
workers' comp today, because that's the ﬁrst place we're going to see it.
So I mean I think we get – I mean if I look at what we've got – again, going back to the
comments I made to Michael, I mean a part of the driver is this issue I referred to around
excess energy. So again it's high excess book, I mean very hard to get the number right. I
mean we do our best, but I mean we're not always perfect. And here, we've made a
decision that we would be more conservative and will carry that conservatism into 2015.
On the remainder of the book, I mean I don't think claims inﬂation. I think some of the
other attritional stuﬀ that we see, I mean maybe a bit economic activity. I mean certainly in
the U.S., on our commercial auto book, we think that's part of the driver for the change

Page 9 of 27



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2015-02-12

again that we made in Q4. But in general, if it was inﬂation that was coming back, I mean
you see it ﬁrst in the most inﬂation exposed lines, and I mean currently, I don't see it there.

FINAL

Q - Andy D. Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

And then, sorry, just on that very quickly, there's no sense that terms and conditions have
moved over time at all. I mean that's certainly not my sense. But I'm just trying to think
about the drivers that could cause these things to sort of move slightly faster than you
expect.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I mean I think to be honest, I mean I guess we come back to the rate environment. The
rate environment is tougher. So I mean if you look at the book overall, I mean pricing that
we see in Q4 I mean is spot on where we were in Q3, I mean the composition is diﬀerent.
So if you look at the individual parts of GI, we come to the same place. We're a bit
stronger in Latin America. We're a bit stronger in North America. We're a bit weaker here
or there. But I mean the overall environment is pretty competitive on the rate side. So I
suspect this may be a bit more that chipping away at the edges than anything else.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the risk allocation, if you've got the slide pack, again, it's the nine-month position, so
that's the one I'm going to give you now. So I mean it won't have changed dramatically by
the end of the year. Slide number 50 is the one that has the detail on it. And on this, we
have – 58, sorry, my eyesight is not as good as it used to be. I need to buy glasses.
So the – I mean overall, we've got about 38% of the risk in ALM and market risk. We have
about 10% in investment credit risk. I mean we're close to the halfway mark, which is
broadly consistent with where we've been in the past. And Martin, do you want to add a
comment on this one?

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. Thanks. Hi, Andy. Well, look, we have actually last year largely in the ﬁrst
half completed the re-risking by putting an additional $2 billion of risk capital in the
investment strategy. That has led mainly to a purchase of equity and corporate debt. It
was at the time $2.5 billion equity, $5 billion of corporate debt and credits all together.
There is at this point no plan whatsoever to increase the allocation to investment
management with regard to risk capital.
What I should stress, though, obviously, is that there's going to be some shift to think
about negative yields in Switzerland, so bonds, Swiss bonds, corporate and – corporate
bonds partly negatively yielding, but deﬁnitely government bonds. So this became for us
clearly a non-investible asset and any new investments from maturing assets we have to
look and diversify into other categories across the globe.
Having said that, we will not on the back of that materially change the risk allocation. It
might be $100 million here or there, but it's not going to be a signiﬁcant impact on the
risk capital. And the last thing what I should say is we have started last year as well to shift

Page 10 of 27

a good part of our investments into less liquid assets. We will continue doing that. But that
as well is not going to impact the risk capital usage. As we do that, there is capital neutral.

Next question from Thomas Seidl, Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions. Unfortunately, on the same topics we've
discussed already. First, on the reserves side, when I look at slide 28 on the reserve
diagonal, I make two observations here. There are three vintages where you increased the
ultimate loss ratio even though just one year before you decreased. And secondly, the
loss began in year one is dramatically down to 66.6%, so why should we be conﬁdent and
comfortable with the further reserve outlook just looking at the plain data here? That's my
ﬁrst question.
And second question. With the investment income and you just commented, Martin, I
mean credit spreads interest rates have fallen dramatically last year. I mean I look at slide
56, with the re-risking, you managed to keep the debt yield at 3.02%. Now with QE and
spreads further falling, should we not expect Zurich to take more credit risk or is it just that
you accept lower investment income and, hence, overall lower margins?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So on the ﬁrst one, Thomas, I guess when I look at the diagonal on slide 28, and if I look at
the last – or I guess, when I look at the ﬁrst line, so the initial reserves, say, in the year, and
I look at 2005 and on I mean I'm not sure that the pattern is very diﬀerent from what you'd
expect to see given the rate improvement in the book, and not only in the book, but also
in the market.
I mean I guess the challenge would be I mean where does it go from here? So I mean I
think from a pure rate perspective, I don't think the market is going to drive further
improvement for us. But I mean I don't look at that and believe that's a signal that things
are too optimistic.
I mean in fact, if you look at the last diagonal, which I guess is the most recent view, and
again, you think about rate improvement, say, 2013 over 2014 – or 2014 over 2013, I mean
that doesn't look unreasonable to me.

FINAL

Just on – thanks, Thomas. No, I think at this point, you should not expect us to employ
more risk capital. We want to stick to our discipline of managing assets relative to
liabilities risk adjusted.
And with that the initiatives we undertook already, it's making us pretty comfortable in the
way we are positioned at this point. Naturally, there is an ongoing review with regard to
our strategic asset allocation. But clearly, there's no need or any intention for us to change
that allocation. The capital we have, I think George has made a point to that, that we want
to primarily use to grow the business organically or inorganically and when that it is not
possible, then at one point, we obviously will as well think about deployment of capital in
other ways, but not sort of load up and chase yields on the investment management side,
because that's at one point when ﬁnancial markets do sort of reposition itself will hit back.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And frankly, I'm not trying to lead to any sort of market call here, but everybody's going to
play into the same direction, chasing yields that we want to avoid and then to protect the
investor over the cycle and that just depended on the income on investment side. And
that brings us back to our strategic priorities and as well, of course, and I have highlighted
that, the urgency to become much more eﬃcient all together within the group.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

And just one question on that. Should that then mean that the debt yield, on slide 56,
would fall 20 basis points, 30 basis points this year, just as it did from 2012 to 2013?

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

What I can say with regard to the impact on the business operating proﬁt – or the
investment income, rather, you would still see kind of a ﬂattening out. Now, that ﬂattening
out in the number is probably going to be bigger and I would guide you with a number of
about $100 million of negative impact on the investment income for this year, i.e., 2015.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

And that's all together across all asset classes, right?

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Okay. And overall?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I mean so overall, I mean the impact on Life will be much, much less, because, of course,
the policyholder will actually bear quite a bit of the risk. So I mean the additional impact
we don't expect to be materially above the $100 million that you've seen already on GI.

Next question from Farooq Hanif, Citigroup. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to turn to your cash remittances,
slide 19. I mean you talk about the $500 million of special additional cash remittances
from Farmers and Global Life, but it sounds from what you're saying that the capital
release from Farmers is going to be multi-year and there's more that you're looking to do
in Global Life. So I was wondering if you could comment on whether we're likely to see
more of this kind of above budget release in the next few years and where it could come
from.
And perhaps related to that, second question, I mean you talked about the phase one of
Global Life kind of restructuring where – which seems to be sort of eﬃciency focused. Is
phase two more capital and capital release? So could you sort of just talk a little bit about
that as well? Thank you.

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

FINAL

Thanks, Farooq, for the questions. So ﬁrst of all, on the cash remittance topic, I guess I
want to avoid that, certainly, in the case of Global Life, I would create expectations for
more than the $500 million we've indicated for 2015 and 2016. So I still expect them to
come in at or around that level.
I mean I think the inﬂection point for them will be beyond that. And at that point, we
expect to see less cash reinvested and more cash come back out of Global Life. But
certainly, for the next couple of years, I mean I think it's always possible and if we see the
opportunity, we would take it, but from a plan perspective, we assume $500 million per
annum.
Farmers, I mean I think I mean given what we're doing on the core share side, we certainly
expect that to have an additional beneﬁt above the run rate for us. I don't expect it will
come in a – I don't expect it to come in a series of payments. I guess it can always arrive
that way. I think it's more likely that, I mean hopefully, we reach agreement at some stage
and there would be again more of a one-oﬀ increase in the cash ﬂow from Farmers. But I
mean that's yet to be seen and I think to be honest I think that will take more than 12
months to put together.

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean overall, we remain very optimistic on the cash front. I think if we were setting the
target for three years for cash today, we'd be setting it higher than – more than $9 billion.
So we – our expectations for 2015 and for 2016 remain positive, but obviously, I don't want
to reset the target today.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. And so – I mean okay, so obviously, you don't want to talk about expectations, but
just in terms of sort of phase one, am I right in thinking it's more just straightforward cost
cutting?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah, sorry, Farooq. I didn't answer the second one.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

My apologies, yeah.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Sorry. So the – I guess the – I'm not sure I'd split it in quite the way you do the – I mean I
think Kristof and the team have been pushing a number of things along at the same pace.
So they have a team focused on the in-force management piece, which is around
managing the policyholder behavior, working on the expenses, looking at the asset
allocation, I mean doing all the normal things that you would do. And I mean we have
high expectations for that piece, but I mean we haven't weighted on the capital side.

Page 14 of 27



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG

FINAL

So I mean we have a number of things in train. I mean we're looking at various parts of the
portfolio to see if there are alternative structures, whether we can turn around or exit. And
I think at this stage, I mean I think our expectations are I mean relatively modest for that
piece given the market conditions currently. But I think we do expect to see some change
on the capital front alongside the in-force piece.
So the in-force piece will continue through 2016 for a minimum and I think probably
beyond that as well. And on the structural options, I mean that's a topic I think we'll also
pretty much continually look at and review to see whether or not we have options
available to us that would improve returns to our shareholders. But we do both in parallel.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay, thanks very much. Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

And I guess maybe – sorry to – because I guess I now connect part two of your question to
part one. Sorry, I should have done that at the start. So I mean what that would mean is if
we are more successful on the structural side, then you could see again another one-oﬀ
on the Life side. But again, from a forward-looking perspective, I haven't had a trigger for
that today, so I haven't planned it yet.

Q - Farooq Hanif

Next question from Mr. James Shuck from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Thank you. I had two questions, please, just reﬂecting again on the eﬃciency side, I'm just
interested to try and think about some ratios and where you might kind of see yourself
going if you were to be kind of closer in line with peers. So if I normalize the expense ratio
in 2014, because you've got about 50 basis points of one-oﬀ beneﬁt, your GI expense
ratio is about 31.1%. Obviously, a large part of that is commission expenses, so the noncommission expenses is 17.4%.
Could you just sort of indicate where you kind of see that going? It's obviously far too
high at the moment, but in the medium term, what is the kind of aspirational kind of level
for you to get that down to? And then, although it's not an ideal number, we don't really
have a better sort of way of looking at it, but just on the Life side, Life operating expenses
in relation to reserves, about 89 basis points, also looks very high. Obviously, that's
boosted somewhat because of the very high number in LatAm. So could you just
Page 15 of 27



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2015-02-12

comment directionally about where that 89 basis points should go to in bringing you back
in line with peers or even beyond?

FINAL

And then my second question was on – again, on the net cash remittances, please, on
slide 19. I'm just keen to get some insight into the actual free cash generation underlying
these numbers so we can try and draw some views around actually what remittance ratios
were driving these numbers. Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I'll do the second one ﬁrst, because it's easy. So I'd just knock-oﬀ the $0.5 billion, James.
$3.2 billion would be the one I'd work from. So that'd give you a sense of the extent to
which we're converting earnings into cash.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Sorry, not so much earnings to cash, but free cash generation to cash remitted.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So I mean if you're looking for the slide that we normally publish with Q1, you'll have to
wait for Q1 for that one, so apologies, but we'll give you more detail on that as we do our
normal disclosure at Q1.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On the expense side, I mean I understand why you do it. I'm not sure that we would
necessarily split it apart and only look at, I guess, what we would describe as the other
underwriting expenses, so I guess the central non-commission part of the cost. I mean
overall, we haven't set a target yet. I think our view is it would be wrong, and for the
reasons that Martin gave earlier, to establish a purely top-down view. And what we're
trying to do is to go through the process that's triggered by a peer comparison, but then
to try and decompose that and look at the things that really should drive eﬃciency for us.
So we have been doing some peer benchmarking lately. I think it would be fair to say that
we see ourselves as with considerable room for improvement. But what we're looking to
do is rather than have a top-down view of a number, which then tends to be something
that's applied somehow evenly across the organization, we're looking at more of a
program that will be transformational, again, with the focus that Martin described around
all the key cost drivers for the entire group GI, which, of course, is the bulk, but for
everyone else an addition.
So again apologies, I won't give you a number yet, but it will be a topic that we'll come
back to at the Investor Day in May. And I guess the key aim here would be to come up

Page 16 of 27



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG

FINAL

with a program that I mean wouldn't be a temporary reduction in expenses, wouldn't be a
diet, for example, but would be something that would be, I guess, longer lasting.
On the Life side, I mean I agree with you. I think the – if I compare this to peers on the Life
side and I mean use some of the metrics that I think most investors would commonly use,
we also look a bit high there. I think, as you mentioned, partly that's expected I mean
given where we are in terms of the current stage of maturity of our Life business. But I
mean it's clear to me that I mean Kristof also sees expenses as a way that he can achieve
his plan over the course of the next two years.
So I mean again today, I don't have ratios for either of these things today, but it is a topic
we'll come back to with more chapter and verse in May.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Okay, I look forward to May. Thank you.

Next question from Stefan Schürmann, Bank Vontobel. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Yes, hello. I have two questions, the ﬁrst one on the Life side. In fact, can you maybe give
us an update? I didn't ﬁnd any numbers for reserve adjustments. You must have increased
reserves there again. How much was that in Q4?
Then the second one on non-Life growth, just a small one on Switzerland. Q4 saw a drop
in top-line of 17%. Is there some one-oﬀ, or is there a trend? I mean I would have thought
that you would rather try to gain market share than lose, so will you just explain on this
one, please?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So on the ﬁrst one on the Life side, I guess I mean it's relatively routine for a number of
adjustments to move through the Life business and go in both directions. I mean if I look
at it from a net perspective, there is no net impact from reserve over the course of the
whole year. So I mean the Life headline number, I think, is relatively representative of what
they've actually achieved despite the fact we've had a number of things, like Farmers New
World Life, the German reserve adjustments that we made earlier in the year. But the
thing nets out to broadly zero, so I mean what you see is what you get in Life.
I mean on the Swiss business, we don't see anything unusual in Q4, to be honest. So I
mean we're not – I mean over the course of the year, we've grown our Swiss Life business,
so we're running at a rate that's I mean probably a bit ahead of market. It's been one of
Page 17 of 27



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2015-02-12

the areas where we've focused the investments for growth and it's certainly an area where
we look to take market share going forward. So certainly, from an annual perspective,
we're happy with where it is. We're not concerned or see anything unusual in Q4, and we
look forward to see this business continue to grow faster than the peer group.

FINAL

Q - Stefan Schürmann
I mean in non-Life, I'm talking non-Life, their gross written premiums into Q4 were clearly
down.

A - George Quinn

Next question from Nick Holmes, Société Générale. Please go ahead, sir.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Hi there. Thank you very much. Just coming back on cost eﬃciency and you mentioned,
Martin, the sense of urgency. I wanted to ask when do you think the GI expense ratios are
going to start to show some improvement. I mean they've clearly got worse in all of the
segments in 2014. Is 2015 too early to expect improvement? Is 2016 more realistic?
And as a sort of second question to that, how important is pricing in U.S. commercial do
you think for your expense ratios? I mean if there is a severe softening in that market, how
worried are you that that's going to endanger the U.S. expense ratio? Thank you.

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Thank you, Nick. Let me take the ﬁrst question and then George takes the second now. I
cannot elaborate further than what we have said, and George has mentioned with regard
to the structural consideration on eﬃciency. Very complete to your question, clearly, the
ambition has to be to have some impact already starting in 2015, without any doubt in GI
and then beyond that into 2016 and beyond, obviously, look for the group as a whole,
and not just GI, on how can we accelerate the focus on the eﬃciency and with that as well
get much more eﬃcient all together along the lines I have said. And that's beyond GI. But
the bulk of that should be, obviously, coming into 2016 and beyond, okay.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

But – as a follow-up we can expect you would hope to see some improvement by the end
of this year.

Some improvement, yes.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On the second point, on pricing in U.S. commercial, I mean maybe just to give a bit of the
history and I guess you guys will follow the market statistics, I mean for our North
American business, the commercial part rather than the global corporate part, I mean we
improved in Q4. I mean but at 1.1%, we were close to ﬂat in Q3. I mean 1.1% is – I mean
essentially means ﬂat when you think about inﬂationary increases or claims cost inﬂation.
I mean what implications would that have for the expense ratio? I mean we have a plan
that obviously anticipates what we think the forward trajectory of rates will be over the
next couple of years. I mean we'll set our expense base accordingly. If we saw a signiﬁcant
softening, I mean not just in North American commercial, but in any other part of the
book, it would have implications.

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean I think ﬁrst, we'd look at tiering the portfolio, so trying to maximize the share that
we can take of the parts of the business that we think are more proﬁtable. The NAC team,
in particular, have a predictive analytics project running, which is again aimed at risk
selection, so we'd hope to see beneﬁts come from that.
I mean for the entire business, if the business cannot produce the required returns, do
costs come under pressure, whether it's North America, Europe, or just about anywhere
else? I mean absolutely, they do.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Yes, I understand. Just as a very quick follow-up, I mean MarketScout is forecasting minus
5% price changes by the end of the year. Is that something that you would be kind of
comfortable with, with your cost base? You could control that or would that be something
you would feel is perhaps not just incorrect in terms of forecasting, but might give you
problems?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah, so the – I mean I guess that – I know the market – I saw the same report. So
MarketScout is zero for the U.S. commercial market for January.

Yes.

FINAL

And I think – and I guess there's some hockey stick to the rate reduction, because I think,
as I read it, there was a more modest reduction by mid-year, but it seems to accelerate
into the second half of the year. I mean I guess we have our own view of what will happen
on rates. I mean I don't want to give you it here, but I mean it wouldn't be entirely
consistent with MarketScout, although we do see the same headwinds coming for the
commercial business, especially in the U.S. So this will be a tougher year as well.
But I mean I guess MarketScout have given their view and they've given a commentary as
to why they believe it to be the case. And you guys can be your own independent judge
of how you would view rates to move. I mean again, all I can repeat on the rates overall is
that we have plans for the next two years and plans beyond, and if we're not producing
what has to be produced, we look at all the things that we have under our control that
help us get to where we want to be. And costs are clearly very high on that list.

Next question from Marcus Rivaldi, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead sir.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone. Couple of questions, please, on cash and capital. So ﬁrst, on
your capital, the stated solvency ratios, obviously, do beneﬁt from a regulatory regime
that takes a longer-term view on discount rates for particularly longer-term liabilities. If
you were going mark-to-market today, what – would that be a diﬀerence in your ratios?
And on that, does that feature or do you consider that mark-to-market position in your
thoughts around capital management internally and maybe in discussions with
regulators? So that's number one.
And secondly, on the cash side of things, obviously, you've had a stronger year on cash
remittance than the $9 billion run rate would suggest. In the past, George, you've
suggested that you'd take maybe that bonus from this year and use it to give yourself
some comfort of smoothing out and ensure you're going to hit the $9 billion for over the
three-year period. Is that still the case or would you be thinking, well, I've got this excess
cash now, maybe I could deploy it into a share buyback more immediately? Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Could I just ask a question, Marcus, on the ﬁrst one?

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Yes.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So that I understood it, so you mentioned the use of long-term rates.

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Yes. I think that UFR sort of inclusion within Swiss solvency tests and obviously, within the
Solvency II.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So I mean I guess as I look at, we use interest rates that reﬂect the key rate durations of the
liabilities, so they're relatively matched. So I don't see this same mark-to-market
component that you do. So I mean my view is that what we have today is actually a markto-market with no adjustment.
So I mean I guess the more – I mean the ultra conservative view, which feels to me would
actually be the wrong way to look at it, would be if I used current interest rates across all
key rate durations. But I mean that just wouldn't be the way we manage the business. So
we don't do what I think you've suggested. I mean we use the traditional approach and
we discount market base rates at the key rate durations.

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

I was just thinking I mean the point being really is we all hope we're going to get growth
back in Eurozone and elsewhere, and inﬂation, but are regulators taking a more cautious
view that you're ﬁnding at the moment that what if we do get a period of very low interest
rates for an awful long time?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I think on that one, I mean I guess the – I mean the challenge there would really be on the
really long duration liabilities, so I mean extrapolation in the context of Solvency II,
because that's been a lively discussion with the regulators I mean only very recently. So I
mean I don't really expect them to change that.
And again for us, I mean given that we're not playing at the very extreme end with the
heavy guarantee business, I wouldn't see that as a major risk factor for us. I mean if that
became a topic, I mean it would not be good for the industry in general. I mean it would
be very bad, but I wouldn't see that having a particularly negative impact on us.

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Okay.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On the cash side, I mean just to be careful, I think I understood the question. But you used
the words smoothing out. So I've got $3.7 billion in year one, maybe I'll only take $5.3
billion over the course of the next two years to smooth out to get $9 billion, or $5.4 billion
to get just over $9 billion. I would not do that. It's important to me that we continue to
focus on cash and we continue to take every step that we can to liquefy the earnings. So I
mean I think it would be reasonable to expect that the $0.7 billion excess that we have

Page 21 of 27



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2015-02-12

FINAL

today is something that today we'd be projecting to be at least $700 million above the
more than $9 billion target.
I think the point you're really making, though, is around I mean how would we use the
money. I mean if you look at last year, I guess, I've ended with excess cash of maybe
around $1 billion. And – I mean I guess, you'll see us do more of what we did last year, but
– so invest in things like the Via Varejo distribution agreement in Brazil, the agreement
with Bank Sabadell in Spain.
So I mean on projects, we really believe it's – even if they're not immediately proﬁtable,
for example, in the case of the Brazilian deal because of the upfront amortization, if they
can contribute positively to our plan, particularly for 2016, I mean that would be a good
use of our cash. I think that's how I'd answer you. Hopefully that covered.

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Yeah. I wasn't trying to just smoothing. I think it's more we don't know how uncertain the
world can be. It's more a question of you've got a dividend to meet every year and it
gives you a bit more leeway to make sure that that is secure in future from cash at center.
But it doesn't sound as if you feel like it's burning a hole in your pocket and you want to
again use it very, very quickly outside of that investment in the business.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Well, the – I wouldn't use the word – expression, burning a hole in my pocket, but I guess
I'm keenly aware that there's two parts to that ROE calculation. So I mean obviously, I'd
push Mike, Kristof and Jeﬀ hard on the R side of the equation and I think the team expects
me to help them manage the E side of the equation. It can't just be one. So again, for the
achievement of our targets in 2016, management of E is going to be an important part of
it.

the Investor Day in 2013, you gave a sort of indication that you would expect P&C
business operating proﬁts to increase by about 5% on a annualized 9M 2013 basis. And
the question is in light of the general dynamics, which you're seeing now, would you
stand by this guidance or this indication for the future?
And the second question is related to Life proﬁtability. It's just – I'm just looking for
perhaps a qualitative evaluation of the dynamics in your Life book. I see that, obviously,

acquisition costs have gone up, as you wrote 18% increase in APE, but you have – it
appears at least that you've written that business at lower proﬁtability although, also, it
looks as if the business was less capital consumptive. So I'm not clear on the proﬁt
dynamics. There seem to be lots of dynamics which pushed in diﬀerent directions
perhaps. And I would value just some evaluation of how you describe your Life – the
dynamics of your Life proﬁtability.

Yeah, okay. All right. So on the 5% CAGR for GI, I mean I think the way to think of that –
well, let me, ﬁrst of all – I guess we set these – we gave these indications, because we're
looking to give an indication to the market of what we believe we can achieve. So we
wouldn't remove them without careful consideration. And we wouldn't remove this.
However, I think if I look at our GI business, I mean I expect Mike and the team to deliver
what they've committed, but where I would expect them to be to get some slack is on
foreign exchange. So for example, on pure translation adjustments, if the dollar
strengthened incredibly or continues to strengthen signiﬁcantly over the course of the
next 24 months, I would not expect GI to make up the diﬀerence.

Bloomberg Transcript

To the extent that foreign exchange rates drive expense issues because we're overweight
in a particular currency in the expense mix, that's a diﬀerent topic. That needs to be
addressed. But overall, currency adjusted, I expect us to hold to that 5% CAGR.
On the second topic, I mean I think your summary is it's absolutely spot on, so particularly
in Q4, so what you're really seeing here is a substantial rise in APE. It's driven by
corporate life and pension business in the UK, which is both low margin and capital light.
So it's a volume play. So we're looking to add more of that to the platform to achieve the
scale required to be proﬁtable.
I mean across all of the corporate life and pension business, the corporate risk element is
currently proﬁtable already, but the broader platform will take a bit more time before we
reach the level of proﬁtability that we've targeted. But that's what drives the characteristics
that you see especially in Q4.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

And would these characteristics remain the same if you exclude the impact of the UK
single premium pension contract?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

No, no, not at all. So I mean you see volume would drop.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Yeah.

Next question from Anasuya Iyer, Jeﬀeries. Please go ahead.

Q - Anasuya Iyer

{BIO 18981555 <GO>}

Hi, it's Anasuya. My ﬁrst question is on the loss reserves addition in your non-core
business. How often is this review done? Is it quite regular or part of a larger review?
Basically, is there risk of more strengthening here?
And my second question is where do you see your reinvestment yields being currently,
particularly on the GI book? So how much dilution in yields do you expect over the next
year or two from the low interest rate environment? Thank you.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yes, so on the ﬁrst one, so non-core, I guess as everyone's seen, has had a loss for the
quarter of just over $140 million, which is unusual given non-core's performance over
several quarters, over the last couple of years. It was triggered by an external review that
we conduct periodically on the reserves. The current frequency of that review is every two
years. I guess it will continue at that rate or maybe slightly less frequently. So I mean I
cannot promise for sure that there's no risk of additions to reserves, but I mean we have
booked to the point that we believe was indicated following that external review.
I guess it's also worth pointing out on non-core that I guess that's about half of the total
impact in the fourth quarter. There are also additions to some builders' guarantee
products in the UK and there's some impact from some property exposure that we've had
from some of the Dunbar Banking assets that we've held for some time.
I mean I think from a go-forward perspective, I really do not expect to see this type of
topic recur on a regular basis, and in fact, from a planning perspective, I'd expect noncore businesses to be fairly ﬂat. On the reinvestment yields, we have – I'm just looking at
my notes, sorry.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I mean for GI, in particular, I mean the book or accounting yields for Q – let's do the full
year. It's the same for both. Well, for Q4, just over 2.6% is the accounting yield. If we did a
new money yield on the entire portfolio, we'd be more like 2.2% so, i.e., what we're
investing at.
So we've got about a 40-something basis point gap on GI. I mean given the duration of
the book, I mean it would take a few years, maybe about four years' duration on GI, so it
would take several years to feed in to that level. And of course that gap is reﬂected on the
guidance we gave already today on the expected impact on investment income for GI for
2015.

We have a follow-up question from Michael Huttner, JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Yes, just on Germany, so a couple of years ago, we had these big reserve additions and I
notice Germany in Q4, and I know it's a tiny part of your business now, but what it did
miss, at 103% and I just wondered if it's the same sort of thing?
And then I just wondered if – and I know you said you have very little exposure to very
long interest rates, but I guess there may be still some in Germany. Can you give an idea

of what the impact of the ZZR is now? And maybe are there trigger points which will make
it more onerous quite soon?

FINAL

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, Michael, the Germany reserving topic was in the architects and engineers. I'm just
looking at James. Can you remember what the – we'll have to come back to you on what
the line was...

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Okay, no problem.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

But it wasn't the same sort as...

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A couple of years ago. On ZZR, so I mean to give you a slightly longer – slightly long
answer to give you all the numbers that I've currently got, because we made a big eﬀort
to model ZZR, but again, it's based on interest rates per end of the year, so I guess it will
be slightly tougher today if we were to redo it based on current.
So I mean if you look at the next few years, we currently expect the ZZR reserves to peak
in 2021 and the requirement is going to be I mean somewhere between $4.5 billion and
$5 billion. And I mean if I look forward, I mean we'll cover that out of what we currently
have in unrealized gains. But I expect that from about – probably mainly from 2019
onwards, I could see a drag in BOP of maybe $150 million if we're not able to oﬀset it
through reductions to policyholders or other sources of eﬃciency within the portfolio.
So I mean without being completely relaxed about it, it doesn't cause me any immediate
concern and I don't really expect to see it have any substantial impact on us through to
2018, given that we currently have in front of us.

Q - Michael I. Huttner
