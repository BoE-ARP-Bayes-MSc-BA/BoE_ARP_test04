Good day and welcome to the CNP Half Year Results Conference Call. Today's conference
is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Antoine
Lissowski, CFO. Please go ahead.

Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Hello, everybody. I'm glad to speak to you for this new interim results.
We are on the slideshow, and I'll make a short presentation of the ﬁrst slides and after
leave ﬂoor to you to invoke diﬀerent questions. I am surrounded by diﬀerent members of
the team of CNP. That means that any technical question you may raise, should ﬁnd
someone here to speak to.
On page three, you have the main ﬁgures of our interim results. Starting with the premium
income, which was this half year up 2.9% at €16.2 billion. The revenues of the company
grew by 4.3%, at €1.666 billion, with administrative costs at €431 million. The EBIT stays at
€1.235 billion, up by 3.9% to last year's.
The attributable net proﬁt of the company for this half year is €615 million to be compared
with €601 million last year. The new business margin is slightly higher than last year at
15.3%, and the return on equity is at 8.8% to be compared with 8.1% last year, for the
whole year.
The economic coverage ratio, which is our calculation of Solvency ratio and the standard
formula is at 170% up to last year's by 10 points. And the MCEV per share is at €26. The
net book value per share being at €20.5.

Now I come to diﬀerent information regarding the activity of the group. On page four, you
have ﬁrst a review on our French business, with the net insurance revenue up by 1.9% at
€633 million. Here please notice that the growth comes from the business in savings and
pensions which is up by 6.6% whereas the personal risk and protection business is down
by 7.5% at €193 million. This includes as indicated a negative impact of statutory discount
rates which we had to take into account in evaluating our liabilities. With technical
reserves at the end of half year at €291 billion, and I let you take knowledge of the
diﬀerent compounding of these reserves.
On page ﬁve, you have a view on the product mix of the company and you see quickly
that there is an important shift in our sales, with unit-linked contracts being up very
dramatically. They represent now 17.8% total savings and pension premiums where they
were at 11.6% last year. In fact, we are gaining market share in this area.
The inﬂows of unit-linked in net represented more than €1 billion and the outﬂows from
traditional savings products slightly below €1 billion, €932 million, during the same
period. That means that our business model clearly was shifted from completely or
majority only, the business model in traditional products and it is now progressively
gaining area of very much balanced business model where unit-linkeds are much higher.

Bloomberg Transcript

The personal risk/protection business is on this side very stable. The APE margin was at
11.8%. It is slightly higher than last year and it is of course expressed explainable by level
of unit-linked in our protection.
Now let's go to Latin American business on page six, with the net interest revenue at €501
million reported, is up by 10.7% to last year's. If you take like-for-like ﬁgures, the growth is
at 15.2%. You see that, as usual, the major part of this net interest revenue is attributable to
personal risk and protection, which grew by 11.2% reported. And the savings and pension
business, which are of smaller magnitude in terms of revenue are up by 8.5%.
On page seven, you see how the premium income in this market behaved during the
period. It's a very dramatic increase of the premium income. In like-for-like ﬁgures, the
increase is by one-third, 33%, with very important growth in savings and pension
business, which stays at €1 billion and with growth of 43% and personal risk and
protection business at 22%. The new business margin, the APE margin, on the side are
still around 32%, with 31.6%, which is relatively similar to last year's.
If we come now in page eight to Europe, out of France. The scope was signiﬁcantly
modiﬁed by strategic transaction among which the two main regarded transaction are the
sale of our common subsidiary with Barclays in Southern Europe, which accounts for a
reduction of net interest revenue of €16 million. And on the other side, the ﬁrst time
consolidation of CNP Santander Insurance, our loan insurance subsidiary in common with
Santander, which accounts for €15 million plus the other contributors being the negative
because of restructuration in our Spanish and Italian business which provoked
reevaluation of some provisions.

FINAL

On page nine, you have evolution of premium income. In this area, we're roughly stable
as a whole, but when you look at diﬀerent elements of this business, you see immediately
the traditional savings are down by 50% and they are at €566 million. And it is mainly
attributable to Italian subsidiary whereas unit-linked savings are up by 62%, represent
now more than €1 billion. Here too it is a result of the very determinated management of
the sales of Italian company, mainly.
The pension business being slightly at the same level as last year. And at the top of the
slide you see that the personal risk and protection business was increased by 131%
through the acquisition of CNP Santander Insurance. This acquisition is also one of the
reasons for the growth of the APE margins which now stay at 16.5%, up 10.8 percents (sic)
[percentage points] to last year's. The two moves explaining this level of margin are ﬁrst
the improvement of Italian pension savings business and also [majoritally] introduction of
Santander CNP activities in the scope of the business.

Bloomberg Transcript

All that results in page 10, in a very important growth of new business value across all the
regions, the growth of 20.6%. If you take the reported ﬁgures, we come from €206 million
to €248 million. We have growth in France by 11%. Growth in Latin America by 10.7%
reported and would be 20% if you take into account like-for-like ﬁgures. And triple in
Southern Europe with €28 million as previously reported.
Now we come on page 11 to administrative expenses. You can see that globally the
change was slightly above the change in revenue, with 5.4% growth, at €431 million. The
major part of these expenses are of course in France and growth there is very moderated
at 1.8%, according to our budget. In Latin America, the growth of 14.4% is due to ﬁrst to
the inﬂation rate in Brazil, and second to the expense in development in Brazil, in
particular for the creation of the digital company, which should start its activities in 2016.
A similar growth was registered in our Southern European activities in terms of expenses.
And it is due to ﬁrst, the changes in scope of consolidation. In fact that means that the part
of the costs of Barclays Vida, which was the sold company were taken by our remaining
company, which is called CNP Partners, which has diﬀerent development ﬁnance during
this half year. It was a sort of new start of the company there which explains speciﬁcally for
this interim period growth of cost.
Globally, the cost to income ratio is at 35%. All that results in an EBIT – on page 12 – at
€1.235 million. You see there that EBIT on savings and pension was up whereas it was
slightly down in personal risk and protection. It is again due to our new provisioning
attributable to the decrease of interest rates. And when you see the diﬀerent countries:
France and Latin America experienced an improvement of the EBIT whereas in Southern
Europe, the EBIT was slightly lower than last year.
Now let's come for – a few moments to the investment policy of the company. We now
operate in a low rate environment which needs a certain adaptation in our strategy. First, it
is clear that the ﬁxed income investments are mainly now in credit instruments, roughly
75% of investments in ﬁxed income are now in credit. But in an environment of low
interest rate, the maturities of these investments are short, less than 10 years. And a part of

Page 3 of 12

FINAL

them are made at variable rates. The remaining investments in long-term government are
clearly much lower than during the similar periods before due to very low interest rates. I
remind you that the average interest rates in French govvies this half year was around 1%.
As a way, we have also intensiﬁed, our diversiﬁcation of assets and turned over sorts of
assets. In equities, we are still increasing the part of equities in our investment with €1.6
billion invested during the period. We have also invested massively in investment
properties with €1.2 billion and in private equity with over €400 million of new capital
commitments.
In this ﬁeld, you may know that CNP Assurances was quoted as the one of the ﬁrst 50
institution investors in the world. It is clearly the outcome of determinated policy which
started 20 years ago. And now we consider to have suﬃcient knowledge of the markets to
be able to support such volume of new investments. And the infrastructure sector is still at
the starting level with €70 million of new investments during the period. We think that
action put on this area by the new European Commission Juncker plan will lead us to
increase substantially reinvestments in infrastructure in the next years.

Bloomberg Transcript

On page 14, you have diﬀerent conﬁguration on the rules and constraints in the
management of these investments and the Solvency II regulation. First, it encourages us
to go on with protection against risk of rise in interest rates. Most of you are very familiar
with CNP and know that this is a tradition of the company to protect our balance sheet
against rising interest rates. Of course, from a very low level of these rates – that this now
involves a very rigid increase of this protection.
Second, but I already mentioned that, the investment in credit was with shorter maturities.
Third, we have started to hedged with options, long-term risk on equities. It is I would say
one of the aspects of our decision to increase our equities exposure, which is that we
must protect the result of the company against the risk of market diﬃculties when we are
buying goods which are out of the money, which are not too expensive that which would
be of very great use if there is an accident on the equities market now.
And we underline also that there is a signiﬁcant portfolio of short-term ﬁxed income
instruments which represent of course a much lower cost in terms of risk and therefore of
– in terms of economic capital to oﬀset the relatively high risk level of capital involved by
equities and over diversiﬁcation assets which we have.
On page 15, we come back to the results of the company for the half year, starting at the
level of EBIT which we explained before. You see that the ﬁnance cost of the company
increased a little bit because of the issuing of subordinated bonds last year. The income
tax expenses growth reﬂects the growth of the activity and our revenues globally. The
noncontrolling interest is a part of revenue which is attributable to the minor shareholders
of our partnerships and the major part of that goes to the Brazilian partners. All that
together puts the recurring proﬁt at €543 million which is slightly the same level as last
year.

FINAL

Below that you have diﬀerent exceptional elements. The net realized gains on equities
among which the gain realized on the sale of our subsidiary in Southern Europe with
Barclays which by itself represented capital gain of €232 million and diﬀerent other
market movements which have an impact on the proﬁts.
All of that was as usual with the company partly oﬀset, but nonrecurring provisions which
represents €216 million. You know that when we have an exceptional gain, we adopt this
policy to keep part of this gain in provisions, whereas when we had in the past
exceptional losses, for instance, when we had to impair some of our investments, this was
also taken from these diﬀerent provisions.
That allows us to have an attributable net proﬁt which stays at 2.4% above last year's. It is
€615 million, 75% of that is from the French activity, 28.7% coming from Latin American
businesses – 23.7% coming from Latin America and the remaining 1.3% coming from
Southern Europe.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we come now to page 16, with equity and MCEV. The equity is roughly below €17 billion.
I do not enter into the details. And the MCEV of the company is at €17.8 billion. You see
that the our net asset value was up. It is due to the increase of diﬀerent equity market,
mainly. And the value of in-force is slightly below last year's. It is an eﬀect of increased
volatility between the end of last year and the end of this interim period.
And the last slide 17, shows for one of the last times, our Solvency I capital ratio, which is
roughly at 400% with unrealized gains and at 120% without these unrealized gains. It is
one of the highest level reached by the company in its recent history. And in page 18, you
have one of the ﬁrst ratio or the future history of the company which is the Solvency II ratio
which is at 170% to be compared with 160% at the end of last year. This increase is
attributable to the growth in the value of the assets, representing the wealth of the
company and relative reduction in the cost of our activities this year being slightly down
to last year's.
Now I ﬁnished the presentation of the main pages. We have of course diﬀerent
appendices to which we could refer business history longer where now conversation and I
give the ﬂoor to you to answer to your diﬀerent questions.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instruction] We take our ﬁrst question from Rötger Franz of Société Générale.
Please go ahead.

Q - Rötger Franz
Thanks for taking my questions. First of all, I have a question regarding your economic
coverage ratio. Can you give us some more quantitative information what drove change in

it? And in particular what was the impact of interest rates in terms of percent and the
impact of the change and the scope of consolidation?
Also my question is how much capacity do you have under Solvency II for further Tier 2
issuance at least in theory? And also your equities are quite high, it's about 10% of your
total investments, that's far above peers, why don't you reduce the equity banking ratio a
bit to strengthen your solvency to bring it more in line with peers? And then ﬁnally you
mentioned infrastructure investments. What would be the maximum exposure as a
percent of total investments that you would target for infrastructure investments? Thank
you.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Thank you. There were four questions. Jim, can you recall the diﬀerent questions? The ﬁrst
one was about the coverage ratio.

A - Jim Root

{BIO 2545921 <GO>}

The coverage ratio, if you could give a little more detail what it consists of and what the
diﬀerent factors that impacted it. Was that it, Rötger, basically?

Q - Rötger Franz
Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

We have here responsible of risk division of the company deputy, if she wants to add
something to what is written.

A - Operator
Perhaps just to explain to you that increasing our coverage ratio is one of the two factors
mainly equity markets and slight increase in future sales are really the two factors. And we
can say that more or less half is coming from the ﬁrst factor and the other half is coming
from the other one. So for this half year, the valuation is quite simple. And there is no
other speciﬁcs to mention.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

And I would just add to that there was no speciﬁc restatement during the period to
improve the ratio. The next question?

A - Jim Root

{BIO 2545921 <GO>}

Under Solvency II, if there's a cap to the Tier 2 issuance.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Well, I'd just say that we have some room to Tier 2 issuance. And in fact, the element to
which we pay more attention is not Solvency II limits but rather rating agencies'
Page 6 of 12



Company Name: CNP Assurances
Company Ticker: CNP FP Equity
Date: 2015-07-30

evaluations of what is risk, the limit at which we start to be at risk in terms of level of our
rating. It is rather that the limit than the Solvency II elements.

A - Jim Root

{BIO 2545921 <GO>}

FINAL

Third question is why don't you sell your equities?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Because we want to have returns. It's very simple. And to enter in more detail, as we're
trying to explain the policy of the company in a low interest rate environment is to
increase the economic capital it devotes to relatively risky investment in terms of
insurance, which are equities, which return is expected to be much higher than those of
bonds. And to oﬀset it – for remaining at a reasonable cost of capital to oﬀset it by an
important low capital charge investment part in short-term bonds. That means that we
have one side, important investments which are burdensome in terms of capital cost. And
on the other part, the light capital investments in bonds.
The next question was...

A - Jim Root

{BIO 2545921 <GO>}

The last question what's the maximum of infrastructure you can do.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

I don't know if that is the maximum. But we are far from it. Michel, would you perhaps say
something about the diﬃculties you have to ﬁnd investments?

A - Operator
Infrastructures represent almost 0.4% of our portfolio today. It's very low regarding our
liability which some of them are – it consists of [joint] suspensions and long-term liabilities
which are very well suited to infrastructure investment.
For the current year, we had targeted only €300 million investment infrastructures. And
today we are far from this amount. So we are still looking for opportunities. We are
contemplating some for the time to come. The diﬃculty today is to source interesting
enough infrastructures within the competition in this ﬁeld.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Okay. Further questions, please?

Operator
We take our next question now from Ralph Hebgen of KBW. Please go ahead.

Yes, hi. Ralph Hebgen. Good afternoon.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Ralph...

FINAL

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Can you hear me okay?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

We can hear you okay. Sure.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

All right. Cool, cool excellent. So, I've got two things. One is the €200 million gain from
BVP which you put into reserve. I'm just slightly confused how this worked technically. I
just seem to remember that sometimes when you have a reserve increase or release from
reserves, these amounts were reﬂected in net insurance revenue. So perhaps if you could
just explain how this worked and conﬁrm that this €200 million is indeed not reﬂected in
the insurance revenue, or otherwise? That's question number one. Yeah, sorry.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. And number two?

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Number two is on the economic solvency ratio again. So we've heard that the transition
from 160% to 170% was basically generated by market movements entirely, but – so you
can conﬁrm that they were no modeling changes or no changes to the internal model...

A - Jim Root

{BIO 2545921 <GO>}

Right. Yes.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

...in the ﬁrst half. Does that generate an opportunity to make these changes in the
progression towards Solvency II, or is your internal model basically already the fully
loaded Solvency II model? That's question number two.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Yes. In fact, we have no internal model. We have purely standard formula. We are
applying standard formula as precisely and conformingly to the regulation as possible.
And there is no diﬀerence between what we do and the standard formula. There is no
question of improving the model and so on. Obviously, you are analyzing accounts of
many companies which are cooking their ratios. It is not possible where you are making a
ratio without internal model. Then there is no clearly evolution in the model.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

So this is the standard formula you're using and that is not going to change?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

FINAL

Absolutely. Standard, and plain standard formula.

A - Jim Root

{BIO 2545921 <GO>}

There is some scope from beneﬁt from the transitionals.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

No. So far there is nothing with transitional.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

No. Just to follow up to that. Will you – or at what, point will you disclose sensitivities to
macro drivers of the economic solvency ratio or the Solvency II ratio?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We'll make ﬁrst sort of inquiries among diﬀerent analysts to see what is the least of
indicators you will need to have next year with Solvency II. It is clear that there will be at
the beginning a certain diﬃculty in communication because diﬀerent competitors will
produce ﬁgures and measures which will not be comparable. Then what we will do is ﬁrst
to analyze what all the other companies have given.
Second, to discuss with analysts which follow our equity to see what are their wishes. And
after we'll settle sort of standard or CNP standard, what are the sensitivities which we will
publish quarter after quarter in order to give you long-term series of not only of the ratio
itself but of diﬀerent positive elements to help you to analyze its evolution. But so far, we
have no speciﬁc list of diﬀerent publications which we will make. It is a work in progress.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

And do you have a target date by which you provide – by which you wish that work to be
completed, like ﬁrst quarter of 2016 for now?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

I think that we will work on that at ﬁrst at the end of the year to be ready to say something
in February and of course complete this with a view on the publications of the market
during the ﬁrst quarter of next year in order to be fully complete in July next year.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay.

FINAL

I come back to your ﬁrst question. There is no speciﬁc point with this sort of capital gain. I
think I referred to Barclays Vida capital gain. There was no relation with net interest
revenue in the past of them. You know suﬃciently well the structure of the company. You
know that all our own accounts investments are in speciﬁc part of the balance sheet and
the subsidiary are there. And when we impair or when we make capital gain on the
subsidiary, it is out of net insurance revenue.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Outside?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Outside, I am sorry.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Yeah, okay. Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. Very clear.

Operator
Thank you. We now move on to a question from Michael Huttner of JPMorgan. Please go
ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Fantastic. Thank you very much. My only question actually is on the PPE which I
discovered this morning was €6 billion which is a lovely number. Is there a limit – when will
you stop adding to it? It seems you're growing it at the moment just about €1 billion a year
and what is the beneﬁt to shareholders of growing it on a stand that eventually it all goes
to policyholders? Is there a beneﬁt because it's part of some fee or it's a buﬀer or – just
understand a little bit, because the way I look at it as I think, well, when you stop adding
to it, then the earnings will go up and the dividend will go up, maybe up? That's my
question.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

And the restructure orders will also go up as well. Do you have, Michael, a suggestion on
the target on the PPE to the provisions. At roughly 3% when we look ﬁgures published by
our French competitors, we see that to be just below 3% is not exotic, okay? It is not
exceptional. There are many very important actors which are at this level. And when you
are at very low rate environment to have reserves in order to be able to, if necessary, pay
some policyholders – dividend to policyholders to keep these customers in case of
interest rate surge is necessary, then the beneﬁts to the shareholders is clearly that it
protects their own risk against an increasing interest rate. It is sort of buﬀer at the beneﬁt,
indirect but at the beneﬁt of shareholders. And it allows us to have a very regular and
predictable net revenue all of the time.
If not, there would be probably very high volatility in terms of net revenue and perhaps
sometimes also necessity to make emergent capital raising which is clearly not the style of
Page 10 of 12

the company.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

And is it included in solvency?

FINAL

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

The status of that in solvency, Mike, the status of the PPE of solvency, you can say few
words of how if looks?

A - Operator
So the PPE is I know that would be using the Solvency II model because it's a return that
protects the eligible of funds because when you have a stress, a market stress, in the
standard formula, you can use this ﬁgure to reduce the impact of the stress.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

It is clearly a status of being a buﬀer against capital being dented in case of market
events.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

So it's a bit like available capital?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

You can call it like that. But I don't know if there is a word in English for the PPE. It's not
available capital. It's not capital. It is a buﬀer. It is a sum which is available in case of, but is
not capital.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

It's not capital.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

It's not capital.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

It is a protection for the capital.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay, lovely. Thank you very much.
