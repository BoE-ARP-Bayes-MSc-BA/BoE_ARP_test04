Thank you, Ian. And good morning, everyone.
In a year which has been marked by intrepid forces, including both unfortunate political
developments and large natural catastrophes, SCOR once again demonstrates its ability
to weather shocks and to continue to create further value for its shareholders. The group
has profitably expanded and deepened its franchise in 2018: achieving a normalized
return on equity in line with the Vision in Action target, a robust solvency position at the
end of the year, a part of the optimal range.
The most significant political risk that struck the risk -- or the group, sorry, last year, was
the fiscal reform in the United States which was introduced in the very last days of 2017
and includes a provision taxes for insurance premiums (due to) affiliated foreign
subsidiaries. SCOR restructured its operations in 2018, mitigating part of this fiscal reform
and hence maintain its competitiveness going forward. (Meanwhile), Brexit has been an
additional complication last year. As the practicalities of the United Kingdom's exit from
the European Union's are not yet full known, we have prepared for a hard Brexit. We have
therefore created a new Paris-based P&C insurance company to ensure the continuity of
the services offered for the clients in the European Union. SCOR Europe SE was approved
by the French supervisory authority, the ACPR, in November 2018; and is now fully
operational. Our reinsurance industry now dedicates much of its attention, therefore its
energy and resources, to dealing with these kinds of issue pertaining to the
refragmentation of the world, i.e. the ongoing sharpening of political, international and
social tension. Of course, nimbleness (allows it) to find appropriate solutions when faced
with (these types of problems).
As far as acts of God are concerned, Mother Nature has also been quite agitated in 2018.
(We stood the stretch of ) hurricanes in the U.S., Michael and Florence; 2 powerful
typhoons in Japan, Jebi and Trami; 2 wildfires in California; and other smaller event across
various areas and regions. Managing such risks and covering these kinds of events is our
raison d'etre, as we say in French. It's our mission. We are there to help citizens and
societies face these risks. We are here to alleviate the negative impact of these risks
when they occur. And at SCOR, we are proud that during this second consecutive year of
elevated natural catastrophe activities we have once again accomplished a mission.
Meanwhile, SCOR's global footprint, Tier 1 stages and good market approach have
allowed the group to continuously expand and deepen its franchise. In this regard, I am
pleased to report that, in 2018, for the first time in its history, SCOR crossed the EUR 15
billion mark in terms of gross written premium. As a result of the group's strong
underlining (sic) (underlying) fundamentals, SCOR is pursuing its attractive shareholder
remuneration policy. A regular cash dividend of EUR 1.75 per share will be proposed at the

next annual general meeting, which will be held on April 26, 2019. In addition, we have
successfully completed a EUR 200 million share buyback program, fully in line with a
commitment made to our shareholders in July 2017 in terms of capital structure
optimization.
The merger of the 3 SE legal entities is well on track. Subject to regulatory approval, we
expect it to be completed by early 2019, providing a solvency benefit of up to EUR 200
million.
Let's go to Page 4. I'm proud to say that, in a year once again marked by exceptional
events, SCOR delivered a solid set of results, with net income of EUR 322 million for 2018,
translating into a return on equity of 5.5%. Furthermore, gross underlying profitability is
excellent. Normalized from the exceptional events of 2018, the return on equity would
stand at 9.4% and hence exceed the Vision in Action profitability target of 800 basis
(technical difficulty)

Bloomberg Transcript

in the upper part of the optimal range of 185%, 220% defined in the Vision in Action plan.
And these is results after accounting for dividend and share buyback.
Thanks again to its nimbleness, agility and robust capital shield, SCOR successfully
absorbed shocks, safeguarding the group from severe losses. SCOR delivered strong
and managed endogenous growth in 2018, with premiums up 7.1% at constant exchange
rates compared to 2017. The growth was balanced between both of the group's business
engines, mainly driven by a development in Asia Pacific on the Life side and in the U.S. on
the P&C side as further demonstrated by SCOR Global P&C's strong January '19
renewals.
The achieved normalized technical profitability demonstrated that the group's underlying
technical fundamentals remained very strong. On the P&C side, the 2018 P&C combined
ratio remains below 100% despite the numerous natural catastrophes that took place last
year. Normalized combined ratio stands at 94.7%, below the 95% to 96% Vision in Action
assumption, bearing witness to the quality of SCOR Global P&C's book. SCOR Global Life
records a robust Life technical margin of 7% in 2018. Finally, SCOR Global Investments
delivered an elevated return on invested assets of 2.8% in 2018 largely driven by a
continuing increase in the income yield.
Basically, all 3 of the group's engines are delivering. Even so, we have not managed to
achieve the group's global profitability target of 800 bps above the risk-free rate due to
the exceptional weight of natural catastrophes and the cost of the U.S. tax reform. The
group is certainly profitable. And its underlying technical fundamentals are very strong.
Let's move on to Slide 5. These 3 graphs illustrates how SCOR continued to deliver a
combination of diversified growth, solid recurring profitability and strong solvency in 2018.
SCOR's growth potential, long-term value-creation capability and shock-absorbing
capacity are confirmed year after year.

FINAL

Moving on to the next slide, if we look at the total shareholders' return, which is the sum
of the share price appreciation and the dividend paid to shareholders. SCOR stands out
from its peer group. Despite various shocks, SCOR total shareholder return averaged
49.1% since the launch of Vision in Action plan in September 2016.
Let's move on to Slide 7. SCOR is pursuing its strong shareholder remuneration policy. A
cash dividend of EUR 1.75 per share will be proposed at the next general assembly on
April 26. We continue to optimize our capital management, thanks to a proven and
consistent process: first, by ensuring the group solvency is in its optimal range; second, by
allocating capital to support accretive, value-creating growth in the future; third, by
defining the amount of a sustainable dividend accordingly; and finally, if appropriate, by
accessing any excess capital leftover for shareholder repatriation or future use.

Bloomberg Transcript

In 2018, the completion of the share buyback program led to a 66% increase in the capital
returned to shareholders compared to 2017. Looking forward, SCOR's ambition is intact.
And we have every confidence in the group's ability to continue its solvent and profitable
growth and pursue its strong value creation in the years ahead. SCOR is uniquely
positioned to significantly benefit from the positive long-term trends that the reinsurance
industry offers. And meanwhile, the group is on the move and actively preparing for the
future; constantly improve the tools, processes and our model. We are supporting the
only credible blockchain initiative in the insurance sector and partnering with numerous
insurtechs to see what innovations are going to emerge and save the insurance and
reinsurance world from woe.
The group has tremendous potential for continued profitable growth and long-term value
creation as a global Tier 1 reinsurer. SCOR is an independent company and master of its
own destiny. We're actively preparing our next 3-year strategy plan, which will be
presented in September. This would be an opportunity for SCOR to confirm its objectives;
and to set out the ways and means chosen to achieve these, leveraging the Tier 1 stages,
the global and deep franchise, the prime rating and expertise-driven human capital.
Let me now hand over to Mark for the balance sheet details. Mark, the floor is yours.

Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Thank you, Denis. And good morning, everyone.
So let's begin on Slide 8. I will walk you through the financial highlights of the year.
In 2018, SCOR underwrote EUR 15.2 billion of gross written premiums, representing a 7.1%
increase over 2017 at constant exchange rates or 3.2% at current exchange rates. This top
line growth was driven by the strong contribution of both business engines. SCOR Global
P&C grew at 6.7%. And SCOR Global Life by 7.3%, both at constant exchange rates. In
spite of heavy nat cat experienced in 2018, P&C returned to profit, with the net combined
ratio for the year at 99.4%, including a 12.6% nat cat ratio. On a normalized basis, the P&C
combined ratio stands at 94.7%. And that's better than the Vision in Action assumption.
Life technical margin is strong at 7%, also in line with the Vision in Action assumption.

FINAL

Finally, SCOR Global Investments delivered a return on invested assets of 2.8% supported
by an equity gain; and by the increase in recurring yield, which was 2.4% for the year and
2.6% in the Fourth Quarter.
Overall, SCOR's net income for 2018 stands at EUR 322 million. This is a 12.6% increase
compared to 2017. And this translates into a return on equity of 5.5%. The return on equity
would stand at 9.4% when normalized for the high nat cat volatility and the U.S. tax reform
impact of EUR 68 million in 2018. This is well in line with our Vision in Action profitability
target of 800 basis points above the 5-year risk-free rates.
SCOR's solvency position remains very strong at 215% at the end of 2018, in the upper
part of the optimal range of our solvency scale.
Let's move to Page 10. SCOR generated very strong operating cash flows of EUR 891
million. Both divisions contributed strongly to the operating cash flows. SCOR Global Life
provides strong cash flow, partially offset in the Fourth Quarter by the one-off impact of
payments relating to the U.S. tax reform, with 2017 benefiting from elevated technical
business cash flow from 2 financial solution transactions. SCOR Global P&C also provides
robust cash flow in line with expectation. Overall, the total liquidity of the group is strong
and stood at EUR 1.2 billion at December 31, in line with our asset allocation assumption.

Let me now hand it over to Frieder, who will give you more details on the solvency and
capital generation of the group.

Frieder KnÃ¼pling
Thank you, Mark. Slide 11 shows the development of the group solvency position during
2018. There were 2 main drivers of change with SCOR's solvency. The operating impact of
plus 18percentage points was very strong and resulted from significant capital generation
by our business engines in 2018, combined with a very modest SCR growth given a
favorable risk-return profile and improved diversification of the business expected in 2019.
This more than offset the combined effect of the share buyback program which has been
executed in 2018 and the planned dividend. Other movements of the solvency position
were minor, including the effect of the U.S. tax reform.
In total, the solvency ratio increased to 215% and stands at the upper end of the optimal
range, in line with our Vision in Action objective.
Slide 12 provides more details on the composition of the operating impact, that means
the Solvency II own funds generated by the business during the year, with 2 main drivers:
value of new reinsurance business written during the year of EUR 450 million and the
expected contribution by the in-force business of EUR 442 million. Aggregate variances
compared to the expected results were relatively small (if possible). Overall, the business
engines created almost EUR 800 million of Solvency II own funds, demonstrating SCOR's
value generation capacity.

FINAL

Moving on to Page 13. SCOR's risk profile continues to be dominated by insurance
underwriting risk, in line with our stated risk appetite. In comparison, the contribution of
market and credit risk to the total capital requirements is smaller. The Life and P&C
underwriting risks continued to be very well balanced. The level of diversification at this
level of aggregation has further improved to 50%, which is clear indicator of the strengths
of SCOR's business model. These build on the continuous maximization of diversification,
which in turn is the basis for optimizing the group's capital efficiency and profitability.
SCOR's solvency is resilient to financial market movements, with all of the sensitivities
shown on Page 14 leading to a solvency position at the upper end or above the optimal
range. As a reminder: SCOR does not use any long-term guarantee or transitional
measures. And its solvency position is not sensitive to the level of the ultimate forward
rate.
With this, I'd like to hand over to Victor for his comments on the development of the P&C
portfolio.

Thank you, Frieder. And good morning.
2018 was another year marked by natural catastrophes, although not as badly as 2017.
2018 and 2012 are the second costliest nat cat years on record with insured losses of
around USD 80 billion. Costliest years are 2017, 2011 and 2005, with inflation-adjusted
insured losses ranging from USD 130 billion to USD 140 billion. Therefore, 2018 appears to
have continued a 6; to 7-year nat cat cycle that started back in 2004. It's worth noting that
this cycle has been dominated by 3 peak periods of two years, 2004 and '05, 2011 and
'12 and 2017 and '18, each recording insured nat cat losses of more than USD 200 billion,
with 2017, '18 being the highest at around USD 230 billion.
2018, beyond the 6 losses that received wide media coverage, 2 hurricanes in the U.S., 2
typhoons in Japan and 2 wildfires in California, the market has been impacted by a large
number of smaller but still significant events all over the world. This unusual loss profile
with a high frequency of medium; to high-severity losses, has always been monitored by
SCOR's enterprise risk management system and stands well within our risk appetite as an
earnings event. Because of the number of medium; to high-severity losses sustained in
2018 and because of the size of each loss for our payers, the 2018 scenario mostly
triggers recoveries from our proportional retrocession -- explains the gap between 2017
and 2018 in terms of percentages of recovery down from 50% to 30% in rounded figures.
Despite this loss activity and thanks to the quality of our underwriting and to the
management of our portfolio, we have produced a positive net technical result for 2018.
Our net combined ratio stands at 99.4%.
2018 is also marked by a high number of very large man-made losses in refining,
aluminum, mining, large construction projects and cyber. Their impact on us has been
contained, thanks to the selectivity and the controlled line sizes of our per-risk
underwriting. Our net combined ratio normalized of nat cat and reserve release stands at

FINAL

94.7% -- it is very satisfying to see that this technical performance is accompanied by
continued growth at a steady rate of 6% to 7% per year.
Second consecutive year of intense nat cat and man-made losses following more than a
decade of continuous risk-adjusted price predictions in the industry explains the beginning
of a market reaction that became increasingly visible in the run-up of the 1/1 renewals. This
long-awaited movement is currently restricted to loss-making business and appears too
limited for now. But it is encouraging for the spring and summer 2019 renewal.
On this note, I'll hand over to Paolo for his comments on the Life division.

Thank you, Victor.
SCOR Global Life records another successful year in 2018 both in terms of growth and
profitability. For the total year, we've been able to record gross written premiums of EUR
9.1 billion, achieving effectively the Vision in Action assumption one year ahead of the plan
at constant exchange rates. This represent a strong increase year-over-year at constant
exchange rates of 7.3%, or 3.6% at current exchange rates. The strong growth was mainly
driven by the expansion of the franchise in Asia Pacific, with the Protection business in the
region growing at over 34% compared to 2017. Asia Pacific now represent a material
share of the Life division both on premiums and results. Growth has also been supported
by new financial solution deals, reflecting strong demand across U.S. and Asia Pacific
market; as well as by development of the Longevity business in the U.K. The overall
premium growth is in line with the Vision in Action assumption of 5% to 6% over the cycle.
On the profitability side, we see a strong increase in the net technical results, standing at
EUR 589 million, up 7.9% at constant exchange rate. The technical margin at 7% is in line
with the Vision in Action assumption. The performance of the in-force portfolio is in line
with expectations. And the new business underwritten continues to exceed the group
ROE target.
Life division continues to be a key contributor to the value creation of the group.
I will hand over to FranÃ§ois for details on our investment portfolio.

FranÃ§ois de Varenne
Thank you, Paolo.
Moving on to Slide 17. SCOR's total investments portfolio reaches EUR 27.2 billion at the
end of December 2018, with an invested asset portfolio of EUR 19.1 billion compared to
EUR 19 billion at the end of June. The positioning of the investment portfolio is in line with
the Vision in Action target asset allocation. Liquidity is stable at 5% of the invested assets,
in line with the target level defined for the strategic plan. The share of corporate bonds in
Page 7 of 21

the invested asset portfolio is stable since Q2 2018 at 49%, close to the maximum of 50%
defined for the plan. And the duration of the fixed income portfolio is at 4.3 years, slightly
below the levels shown three months ago.
Our fixed income portfolio remains of very high quality with an average rating of A+ and
highly liquid. Indeed, at the end of December, the expected financial cash flows from the
fixed income portfolio over the next two years stand at EUR 5.4 billion, providing strong
financial flexibility and allowing SCOR to see (the range and strength of ) opportunities.
SCOR Global Investments delivered an elevated 2.8% return on invested assets for the
full year 2018, which is supported by a continuing increase in the income yield, 2% in 2016,
2.10% in 2017 and now 2.4% during 2018. During the last quarter, our income yield reached
2.6%, highlighting the relevance of the portfolio rebalancing implemented since the launch
of Vision in Action. This quarter, financial contribution was boosted by a large capital gain
of EUR 87 million realized on the sale of an equity co-investment.
Our reinvestment yield stands at 2.9% at the end of December 2018, still significantly
above our current income yield. Under current market condition, we expect a continuing
increase in our income yield for 2019, which should increase for the third consecutive year
at around 2.5%, strengthening the invested assets financial contribution quality. The
annualized return on invested assets will be comprised between 2.7% and 3% for the full
year 2019.

Kamran Hossain from RBC. A couple of questions. First one is looking at the -- I guess, the
Solvency II earnings during the year. New business contribution is particularly strong and at
EUR 450 million definitely above what you'd flagged in late September, the EUR 300
million level. In that EUR 450 million for this year, are there any particular one-offs? Or is
that a reasonable number to assume going forward? I mean, if you do have the number
for last year, the corresponding number, that would be really helpful. And the second
question, just on capital, would it be possible to get an update on the AAA surplus and
whether actually the merger of the SEs will do anything there at all?

A - Denis Jean-Marie Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Frieder?

A - Frieder KnÃ¼pling

Bloomberg Transcript

So the new business level which was included in this economic valuation slide which you
were referring to was flagged as being a conservative level. So it's not surprising that
what we've actually created in 2018 is above that. New business value, I mean, you -- as
you know, this is more volatile than other metrics. It depends on deals which materialize
and profitability on the market and so on. But having said this, the amount which we
generate in 2018, I mean there is no one specific one-off deal in it which drove this in a
particular way. So I think it's a reasonable starting point of what you should expect in the
future, with ups and downs, as I mentioned. And we haven't disclosed the number for the
previous year. But the level was approximately in the same order of magnitude. So -- and
there's nothing unusual about new business value in 2018.

Operator
We will now take our next question from Jonny Urwin from UBS.

A - Denis Jean-Marie Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Just I think there was a second question from...

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

So on the second question. The question had to do with the S&P capital level. So we are
still significantly above the AAA threshold for S&P capital. Not too much has changed for
us on that exactly.

Now so just to follow up on that (12 50) cap gen number then. So I mean it's a really good
number. And even adjusted for the experience variances, we're at like 16 points or so. So I
mean is the message today that that's broadly sustainable. Obviously, there'll be pluses
or minuses in any given year. Then secondly, what sort of level of losses would be needed
in 2019 to turn the P&C market? It feels like we're closer to the tipping point than we have
been in recent years.

A - Frieder KnÃ¼pling
On your first question, I think the one somewhat more favorable impact on operating in
2018 was the fact that the SCR has grown only by a very small amount. That's driven by
improved risk-return expectations for the business in 2019. We've placed our retrocession
program on the P&C side early and at favorable conditions. We've seen good renewals.
And given the much wider spreads at the end of 2018, we also expect a bit more
investment income on a market value basis. So of course as the business grows, we can't
expect our capital to remain flat forever. But having said this, we will -- improving the riskreturn profile and improving diversification of our business and keeping the growth of
capital requirements under control and managing this is at the core of what we are doing.
So that's something which in the future we'll also pay a lot of attention to. With this
exception, I don't think there is anything unusual about the operating impact. And in
particular, as I said, the own funds value creation was -- and yes, not unusual and in line
with what we have generated in the past.

Q - Jonathan Peter Phillip Urwin

{BIO 6126952 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And could you give us a normalized expectation just for where you think that cap gen
would run? Even if it's just a range, that would be great.

A - Frieder KnÃ¼pling
Yes, I don't think we can give that guidance. We all need, I think, a bit of a longer track
record of those numbers. They are volatile. I mentioned new business as something which
is very dependent on market conditions and which moves up and down. And we have also
seen this on an MCV basis. But then the contribution from the in-force business is a bit
more mechanical. There's mostly unwinding of discount and release of cost of capital and
investment income on an expected basis. So you should see less volatility in that regard.
And the other variances, I mean, they -- over a longer term period, they should average
out to 0. But again claims variances, assumption changes and so on will lead to pluses and
minuses over time. So you'd need a somewhat longer time series to really make robust
projections on this. But now with this in mind, I think you can take the numbers as a good
starting point for forming expectations.

A - Denis Jean-Marie Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Victor, on the P&C market dynamics?

A - Victor Yves Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well you need to look at it from 3 perspectives: the P&C market insurance, reinsurance
and retrocession. But my feeling is that we've got the losses already in the books. I mean
we've got the nat cat losses, for sure, with the last two years. And don't forget that the 1/1
Page 10 of 21



FINAL

renewals were mostly European renewals; and Japan and U.S. are coming in April, June,
July. So I think we should see a reaction of the market as from April to the -- in particular to
the contracts that have been affected by losses. As far as the man-made, I think we had
our fair amount of losses as well. And the market has reacted to react in insurance and in
retrocession. So you look at commercial and industrial lines. It's quite obvious. And I cited
the industry sectors that have been heavily affected by losses, starting with energy and
refining in particular, mining. And you've seen the losses recently in the press. You've seen
the large project, in particular hydroelectric. Cyber has been in there as well. So there are
a certain number of industrial sectors that have been heavily affected. And those have
started to react already. And we see that in business solution in particular. And we benefit
from it. And last, I would say the casualty in the U.S., where certain segments have been
identified. And you can see the reserves strengthening in a number of them, commercial
auto and D&O, med mal and related to hospitals in particular. So there are a number of
segments in the market where you see that the reaction is already there. As I said, it's not
sufficient, the -- but we expect it to amplify as we pursue the next 2 renewal seasons in
2019.

Operator
We will now take our next question from Sami Taipalus from Goldman Sachs.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Yes. First one is on -- again on the capital generation actually. Is it possible to just break
down the new business contribution a bit between P&C and Life just so we get a feel of
it? That would be quite helpful. And also just on the assumption changes there. You've got
a positive net number. But if I've understood correctly, this number also includes nat cat
losses. So I think maybe worth minus EUR 350 million or something for the year. So what's
-- can you just give us a bit more detail on what the positive moving parts are there? Then
my second question is on the reserve release. I think you've released about EUR 100
million of reserves this year. Do you think that the reserve surplus is stable year-on-year?

A - Frieder KnÃ¼pling
So both Life and P&C have contributed (particularly) to the new business. Contribution, we
haven't split it out at this point in time. And we'll first see what the developing market
factors and appetite of (readers) of this is going forward. So we'll develop our disclosure
in the future also. But at this point we are not providing a detailed split. On the inflow -sorry. On the variances, yes, you're right. The excess nat cat claims have gone into that.
But we've had positive variances and developments from other parts of the P&C and Life
portfolio. So this has more than offset the P&C nat cat claims. But they are in there.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Is it possible to be a -- just a little bit more specific on what those positive variances are?

A - Frieder KnÃ¼pling
They're really spread out across the portfolio. So from other parts of the P&C portfolio
and the Life business. So as I said, it's spread out across the whole rest of the book.

FINAL

A - Victor Yves Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Yes. First of all, I think this is totally consistent with what we've done all over the years
when we had -- we have been hit by large natural catastrophe. And if we'll refer back to
2011 or 2012, you would find exactly then the same magnitude of reserve release. They
are totally consistent. And secondly, I think EUR 100 million needs to be put in perspective
of an amount of net reserves, outstanding losses and IBNR of EUR 11.5 billion for the
division. So I think not only we have positive development on recurring basis because we
have kept the same prudent reserving. But this amount of release, while it is quite
marginal compared to (total), we believe -- and Frieder is probably (thinking) on that. We
believe that we are comfortably at this state after those...

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Okay. But did the level of surplus change over the year? Or was it stable or...

A - Victor Yves Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

I think it is -- it has been -- and we have been enabled this year to replenish the level of
surplus. So we are basically in the same order of magnitude as we were at the end of last

Our next question comes from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

It's Andrew Ritchie here. I have 2 questions. First of all, for FranÃ§ois, could you just give
us a view on how you're thinking about credit risk right now? There's obviously been some
spread widening in Q4. It's come back a bit in Q1 and slightly more uncertainty on the
credit environment. Maybe just talk about your new money deployment in Life and your
current view on taking additional credit risk. And second question, can you just clarify on
the retro program, which I understand protected you a bit less given the nature of the
2018 losses? Was there any change in the structure of the retro program when you
renewed it? I think you renewed it late in the year. But before any sort of retro changes.
But maybe just remind us on the structure, the broad structure and any significant
changes.

A - FranÃ§ois de Varenne
So on your first question, on the credit risk. So that's something we monitor carefully,
being 49% of the portfolio exposed to corporate bond. We don't think we are at the end
of the credit cycle today. But if -- let's say, (if cycles standout) like this, credit cycle is very
long. We have a specific focus today on the migration risks within our portfolio, i.e. we
monitor carefully the BBB bucket of corporate bonds portfolio to minimize the risk of
migration of -- to issuer in the high-yield universe. So that's why we keep single A buyers

in our corporate bond portfolio today. We purchase bonds. We purchase shorter-duration
BBB bonds to enhance the runoff capacities to these. And we decrease idiosyncratic
exposure when bond

FranÃ§ois. On the retro program, Victor, the...

A - Victor Yves Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Yes. On the retro one, there was no change of structure in the retro program. I mean this
is just, as I commented, a question of the loss activity we had this year. We can see that
that's kind of an in-between scenario between benign and severe. And we have a pretty
unusual feature which is 4 blocks of losses: 1 Japanese block, 1 on U.S. wind, 1 U.S. fire and
1 rest of the world. And each block is in between EUR 150 million to EUR 200 million for
our shares, net of our proportional retrocession, which mean that with this in-between
scenario we are relatively high in terms of net combined ratio points. But we are not high
enough to activate our aggregate and our driven retrocession. So basically, as I
commented, what we get this year is, well, mostly proportional retrocession that is being
activated. So -- but this scenario, we knew about it. We've modeled it year after year. But
this is a scenario that we consider as totally manageable. And we prove it. Our combined
ratio is below 100%. It's pretty unusual to have a loss activity that is so evenly, well, spread
over 5 different blocks of event.

Maybe you could give us the contribution of (retro) in -- that we've seen in (inaudible) at
the bottom of (names) (inaudible) it was the same program...

A - Victor Yves Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Yes, yes. In 2017, we had 2 major losses, the 2 -- the first 2 of the HIM series. So we had 2
big losses and we had others. The 2 big activated the nonproportional. And the sum of
the total was enough to activate our aggregate policy. So we had nonproportional
recovery on top of proportional. It meant that we had 50% recovery in all, basically made
of 30% proportional, 20% nonprop, this year. But we are missing the 20% nonprop
because we don't reach the -- per event an aggregate total by which our nonproportional
retrocession would be triggered. This (inaudible).

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

I guess just the -- I guess the positive being you didn't -- because you didn't burn a large
part of your retro in 2018. Then that would have enhanced your ability to renew it on
decent terms.

A - Victor Yves Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well I think you can see the glass half empty or half full. It's quite obvious to me that, if '19
is a normal year, we are going to come for renewal of our retrocession and in a favorable
situation whereby, I mean, we would not have activity in our nonprop in '18. If '19 is a

with a lot of continuity, as always, plus a very good track record in comparison to the rest,
yes, definitely.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Sorry. Sorry. Okay. So trying to stick to 2 questions and a few numbers things here.
Just starting with the attritional sort of in the Fourth Quarter, Victor, are you able to point
out -- you mentioned large losses in refining, infrastructure, mining. How much of this is
coming from SBS? Are you able to give us some guidance on that? Just -- and if that is
very material again, then is there any plans on managing that risk? So that's the first
question. The second question is just on the investment line in the Fourth Quarter. I think
the fair value line item has registered one of the strongest quarterly loss moves, that EUR
24 million, that I have seen in many years. Is there some special item there? And if I could
just squeeze in, on the investment margin -- sorry, investment return outlook: It's a bit
subdued compared to previous year's number. Is that because the -- you're
deemphasizing realized gains, please? So that's my 2 question.

A - Denis Jean-Marie Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Victor?

A - Victor Yves Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Yes. Vinit, actually, just to be quite clear, my point was to say that the market has been hit
by series of large man-made in different sectors. And the sectors I mentioned are refining
in the energy side, aluminium; mining; large construction project, hydroelectric in
particular; and cyber. If I look at where we've been affected, we've been essentially
affected ourselves in refining. We have 3 large losses in onshore energy. And we have 1
large property loss. And we have not been affected massively on aluminium. We've not
been massively affected on mining. We've escaped the problem of large construction
project, in particular the hydroelectric dams. And we've escaped the large cyber. So what I
meant is that, if I look at the market position and our position, the fact that we've been
selective, the fact also that I -- as a principle of underwriting for years and years and years,
SBS has always given priority to balance of the portfolio by avoiding to have peaks in
share acceptances. But we've been able to absorb to a very large extent the few large
losses that you had during the year, hence the excellent normalized that we are able to
pull out despite the fact that the year is heavy man-made loss activity here. I don't think
Page 14 of 21



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2019-02-20

we have to change anything in our underwriting. We just have to continue it. And we have
to benefit of the strengthening of the market and probably the rectifications of certain
clauses that have deviated over the years. That is going to happen and is already
happening. We see that in different sectors that have been loss affected.

FINAL

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Sure. And the EUR 130 million, Victor, you mentioned on Page 15, is that -- that's an yearly
figure. But are you able to point out a quarterly Fourth Quarter figure? Or yes. Or it's not
very relevant.

A - Victor Yves Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

The EUR 130 million is the total amount of nat cat losses in excess of EUR 3 million each
that we have sustained during the entire year. The larger ones in this industrial -- EUR 130
million is Frederick, the European storm, which stands at -- where it's about EUR 30
million, I believe.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay, okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Victor Yves Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

EUR 26 million, exactly. So you've got this one at EUR 26 million. And then you've got a lot
of them which are probably corresponding to a higher activity of severe converge -convective storms that we have seen everywhere in the world. I mean tornado, flash
floods, hailstorms as the one we had in Sydney just before the end of the year.

A - FranÃ§ois de Varenne
So Vinit, on your first question, on the fair value impact in Q4. So that stood at we have a
hit of minus EUR 24 million in Q4 in fair value. 2018 return on invested assets was indeed
slightly impacted by (indiscernible market term) that happened in Q4 and especially (due)
negative mark-to-market developments within our convertible bond portfolio which is
accounted under fair value through P&L and also lower-than-expected capital gain on the
disposal of the large equity co-investment. Normalized for this volatility in Q4, our return
on invested assets will have been 3% for the full year 2018. So comfortably in the upper
part of the 2.5% range of Vision in Action. For your second question, the outlook for 2019:
As long as the full Vision in Action plan is concerned, I confirm that the average return on
invested assets over the entire strategic plan will be in the upper part of the 2.5% to 3.2%
range. And it should be close to 3%. And please note also that, since the beginning of
Vision in Action, the quality of the financial contribution has significantly improved, with an
income yield of 2% in 2016 and expected at 2.5% next year. So with the guidance for next
year of 2.7%, 3% -- up to 3%, I include a capital gain. If you look at unrealized gain in our
portfolio, at the end of 2018, we still have a significant buffer of gain, especially coming
from the real estate portfolio and capital gains from this bucket in 2019 and (inaudible).

(Operator Instructions) We will now take our next question from Thomas Fossard from
HSBC.

FINAL

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Two question on my side. First one will be for Victor. And that will be, I guess, my last
question for Victor. Just wanted to come back on the California and wildfires. So you had
in '17 EUR 105 million of incurred losses, 2018 EUR 143 million. I mean, any change in the
underwriting or in terms of risk exposure for '19? Because at this stage, it's difficult to see
why there will be no rerun again of this type of losses in '19. So did that figure any change
in the way you were approaching the business there? That will be the first question. And
the second question, which is I guess a more strategic one: Looking at the way the group
is deploying the capital at the present time, Life versus nonlife, you're still significantly
overweight, also balanced but overweight Life business. And actually the growth in Life is - keeps going up. And how do you feel about this slide -- a higher exposure to Life at a
time where maybe the PC market is starting to show some signs of stabilization? So any
current thinking about how to maybe rebalance the group? Or is it time to rebalance the
group now towards P&C in order to capture maybe the next five years leg?

A - Denis Jean-Marie Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Victor?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Victor Yves Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well we've done a lot of studies on wildfire on California, as you may imagine. We already
changed our pricing after the 2017 and -- but we don't have any model at the moment
that is really operational. But we have started to, well, work on deterministic scenarios last
year, which has led us to revise our pricing upwards and has caused us to have to leave
certain contracts at the end of last year. Well this year, well, we are doing additional work
to try to come out with recalibration of our models. And we have launched a project to
come up with our own model by the end of this year. What has got to be understood is,
the wildfire of this year, as we can see them at the moment with what we have -- and
we've done extensive reviews of PCS figures. And we have a discussion with a model
provider, one of the few model that exist for wildfires in California. But we believe that
you are talking on the camp wildfire of this year of return period well above 50 year,
somewhere between 50 and 100 year, which is much, much higher than the return period
of what we had last year. This fire is a much, much higher size. So if you look at the
distribution of the hit for us between the two of them, the camp is really sticking out as
the one that has impacted us the most. So I think we are doing studies on that. We hope
to improve again our underwriting. I don't think we have anything wrong in our
underwriting. I think the size of this loss was -- just was massive. It remains that, well, we
have to recalibrate our model. And we have to make sure that, wherever we underwrite
contract with exposures, we are getting those exposure calibrated, assessed and priced
for. And that's what we are doing not only in California but in other areas, Canada in
particular.

the balance (part with) Life?

FINAL

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Yes. So for the second question. We do have a 40-60 split in premium in terms of P&C
and Life. But when you look at the required capital. And this is on Slide 13 of the deck you
received, you can see that the required capital is fairly balanced between the two. And
nonetheless, when the group does its annual planning and more importantly our next 3year strategic plan, this is something where we assess the -- all lines of the business on a
geographic basis for the best contribution to the value creation and the strategic
franchise development of the group. So that's something you'll probably hear a bit more
of in September, on our IR day. But again the split in the capital requirement really isn't
that different.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Mark, I fully understand that. But I mean also conscious in terms of maybe what looks to
be a stabilization of a 5, six years soft market environment. And keeping in mind that last
time you grew externally with -- on the P&C side with Converium was also, I will say, back
to times where markets on the P&C side were a bit more, I will say, stronger than it has
been over the 5 -- the past five years. I mean, did that triggers any strategic thinking, I
mean? And conscious of the timing in the cycle currently.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Well we're always prepared to allocate additional capital to areas of our business
geographically, in lines that are going to produce more. That's a clear point. It's something
we were prepared to do. In the First Quarter of 2017, it didn't really materialize. But
there's no issue with that. Just more broadly speaking, I would say, outside of U.S.
mortality there's really very limited limitations on where we would want to grow. And that
includes investment risk, Life risk and P&C risk.

We will now take our next question from Frank Kopfinger from Deutsche Bank.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

I have 2 questions. My first question is on the EUR 200 million one-off. Given that we are
halfway through Q1, any thoughts you can already share by now of what you are going to
do with the EUR 200 million? Then secondly, on the tax rate for 2019: In 2018, the tax rate,
even if I adjust for the U.S. tax effect, had been pretty high. So any view on where tax
rates should go in 2019?

A - Denis Jean-Marie Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Mark, on those questions?

FINAL

Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2019-02-20

Yes. So the tax rate was elevated in 2018 at 34% -- approximately 34%. And that was
heavily influenced by the U.S. tax reform charge of EUR 68 million which we saw as a
onetime event. If you normalize it for the U.S. tax reform charge, you're slightly above 21%
in the group for the effective tax rate. So that's in the range of the 22% to 24% ETR that
we would expect through normal volatility. There could be a little bit of friction in 2019 with
respect to the U.S. base erosion and anti-avoidance tax, as we still are waiting for
potentially guidance from U.S. Treasury on how the BEAT will be calculated. But I wouldn't
expect that to be very significant. So I think our original guidance of 22% to 24% holds; and
probably a little bit more pressure on the downside -- or a lower tax rate, I should say,
given the favorable change in rates that have happened in the U.S. And that assumes a
normal distribution of geographic profitability. On the first point, the 3 SE merger benefits:
So the merger is well on track. We're very happy with where we are right now. And we
expect it to be formally completed on March 31, with retroactive date to Jan 1. And we
expect the benefit to be upwards of -- close to EUR 200 million. But we have not made
any decisions on what to do with this risk margin benefit that we'll get under Solvency II.
That's probably something that we will approach in the strategic plan, which will be
unveiled in September during our Investors Day presentation.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Just some non-numbers topics, please, yes -- so Vinit from Mediobanca again. Sorry. So
Denis, there was a media article I read a few days ago that SCOR wants to be a
consolidator -- or views itself as a consolidator. Are you able to comment on what kind of
lines you would be thinking about where you feel that you would like to grow? So that's
the first question. Second question, just quickly, just on this normalized ROE. It's now three
years in a row, it's literally most of this plan, where it's above the target substantially. So -or maybe at least 100 bps. Which bit is in your view the surprise versus the target 800plus higher risk rating, if anything?

All drivers. So yes. I mean we've seen 10.1, 9.4. And even the previous year was 9.5. So we
are consistently above target, which is good news. I'm just wondering. Where is this, in
your view, the good news, coming from? It's just a very -- I mean, if there's nothing that is
striking, that will be fine. I'm just curious to see if something is standing out here.

FINAL

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Yes. We have enjoyed -- for example, in 2017, we enjoyed a very nice return on invested
assets. It was probably stronger, certainly at the upper end of our guidance or -- guidance
to the market. P&C remains very resilient, though. Take a look at the combined ratio.
That's better than the assumptions we put in Vision in Action. We had a 95% -- 96%
combined ratio. And we are outperforming that through the first -- or through the three
years of the plan thus far. Then Life continues to be quite stable for us. So it's been quite
a strong performance across the board for us, I would say, in all 3 areas.

A - Denis Jean-Marie Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

On the first question, Vinit. We look at -- and always say, if you want to understand what
we do today and what we are going to do tomorrow, the best is to look at what we did in
the past because one of the certainly characteristic of the group is to be highly consistent
on return. So we made acquisitions, I suppose, the last 10 years, 11 years, even before,
Revios in Life and then Converium. Then we made Generali U.S. and made Transamerica
reinsurance portfolio and some other small acquisitions. So the group has been able to
make acquisitions over the last 11 years. The rule is the following: That the policy for
acquisition for exogenous growth, we check if the acquisition is in line with the targets of
the plan that we pursue at the time. So if the acquisition accelerates the plan, fine. If the
acquisition make us deviate from the plan, no. It's very simple. And since it's in plan with
profitability and solvency targets, we really check that the acquisition is fully in line with
what we said we will do when we launch a plan. So -- and may I say that, looking
backwards, I think those acquisitions have been successful and indeed accelerated the
development of the group without deviating the tracks that we've decided to follow. So
that's the philosophy and the practice we have been doing. So when I said in an interview,
by the way, the only interview I gave for France, that I'd rather be a consolidator than a
prey, it means that it's true that it's core values, the fact that we are independent
company. We are a Tier 1 reinsurer. The fact that there is a freedom, that we are
responsible and accountable for everything we do, the fact that we decided on a track
and a plan is -- it's of little value for our client. It's a lot of value for the franchise. Our
clients know that we are the deciders of last resort. Our clients know that, when we sign a
treaty, when we sign a contract, we're going to deliver. We're going to stick to a price,
whatever the outcome of the contract. So it's absolutely fundamental, if we want to
remain a Tier 1 reinsurer, to assure that we are the deciders of last resort. For that, of
course, we are valued and support of our shareholders. So we look at the opportunities.
It's the whole fiduciary duty of any CEO and any executive committees in the world to
look at potential developments; and that's what we do, make reviews. And we try to go
further only and only if those reviews lead towards the conclusions that I just said,
absolutely in line with the objectives of the group. So nothing new.
Now a last point: We have been able throughout the last 11 years to combine quite nicely
exogenous growth and endogenous growth. When we make an acquisition, it's not at the
-- most of the time, at the expense of the endogenous growth. So we have been able to
grow with our own resources and, in the meantime, make acquisitions and integrate those
acquisitions in a quite an optimal way. It's most seamless. So I think this is a recipe. And we
are going to continue to do this recipe in the years to come. So we are really on track. The
next plan, we'll give you the new objectives we want to set and as well the means to
reach those objectives. But there will be certain continuity in the acquisition policy that

Maybe before Ian ends the call. We are -- we feel good -- and right. So it looks like an
advertising campaign. We feel good. But -- we feel good. I think we check everything in
this company with the board yesterday and even with committees to strategy, audit, risk.
FranÃ§ois, (I'm sorry). And we look at the fundamentals of the group. And I really believe
and with a conviction that the group is in good shape. I mean we grow. And we
demonstrate that -- year after year, in a quite homogeneous way, part of the world where
we want to experience, that we are profitable and with a good technical profitability. We
absorb volatility. And finally, we maintain a high level of solvency. So that's the
fundamentals of the group. So in a world which is more uncertain and more demanding
than before notably due to the U.S. tax reform or the Brexit case or whatever, the IFRS 17. I
mean all those developments that are taking place. And again, we prepare and we
anticipate.
This is the last meeting where Victor Peignet will take part. He's decided to apply for
retirement after years and years and years of an incredible contribution to the group,
traveling about 4, 5 times around the world per year, absorbing an incredible number of
fires and issues in France. And it's pretty much emotional, which is around the table, to
