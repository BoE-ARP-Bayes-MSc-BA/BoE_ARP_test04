{BIO 1750135 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Linda. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today.
As Linda said, I'm here today with Albert Benchimol and Joe Henry. And it is indeed my
great pleasure to be here again to talk with you about this transformative combination.
As we explained when we announced this merger in January, combining our two
companies will create a broadly diversified global specialty insurance and reinsurance
company with the scale, capital and market presence to compete at the highest levels of
our industry internationally.
Our board has always been focused on addressing the challenges of today's evolving
markets and creating value for our shareholders. Our combined entity will be one of the
world's preeminent specialty insurance and reinsurance companies. We will have a topfive market position among reinsurers and a leading position among broker-based

FINAL

reinsurers. We will have a significant specialty insurance platform with compelling growth
prospects across a diversified array of product lines and a strong and growing life,
accident, and health franchise.
Although both PartnerRe and AXIS are well-positioned on their own, we believe that we
will be better positioned to compete and excel in this evolving new global marketplace as
a combined entity, which will benefit our clients, our brokers, our shareholders and our
employees.
I have always had a great deal of admiration for PartnerRe and the business they've built
in the reinsurance market over the past two decades since I came to Bermuda at the
same time that PartnerRe was being formed. Our work with them during this integration
process over the past few months has strongly reinforced these sentiments.
As Chairman Emeritus of the combined organization I look forward to working with our
talented group of leaders from both of these great organizations and serving the
combined company. I'd now like to turn the call over to Albert, who will discuss the
specifics of this revised transaction. Albert?

Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you Michael, and good morning everyone.
We've been working closely with PartnerRe since we announced the merger of equals at
the end of January. And throughout this integration process, we have confirmed the
premise of our merger, uncovered new opportunities and grown even more confident
with respect to the tremendous strategic benefits of this merger.
Our strategic combination with PartnerRe will create superior and sustainable value to all
shareholders by forming a broadly diversified global insurance and reinsurance company
with the scale, capital and enhanced market presence to deliver greater breadth and
depth of products and services, larger capacity and leading positions in several markets.
Together, we will be one of the world's preeminent specialty insurance and reinsurance
companies with gross premiums written in excess of $10 billion. As we detail on slide six,
this is truly a transformational opportunity for our two companies.
By merging with PartnerRe, we are creating a company that will be one of the world's top
specialty insurance and reinsurance companies with approximately $13 billion of combined
shareholders equity that, as Michael said, is a top five global reinsurance franchise with
leading position in the broker channel, and top 10 global life and health reinsurer and a
significant primary specialty insurance platform with compelling growth prospects across a
diversified array of product lines.
We see significant potential to create value through our increased relevance with
distribution partners and clients across our three major business units with one of the
Page 3 of 15



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2015-05-04

most complete range of products and services, geographic spread, larger capacity and
entrepreneurial spirit. And we are confident that we will achieve at least $200 million in
expense savings.

FINAL

In addition, the transaction will significantly enhance capital generation capabilities through
diverse sources of growth and profit which will allow us to both reinvest in the franchise as
well as return meaningful capital to our shareholders.
Today's revised terms, as outlined on slide eight, reflect our steadfast commitment to the
combination. Further terms of the amended amalgamation, PartnerRe common
shareholders will receive a special one-time cash dividend of $11.50 per share immediately
prior to the closing of the merger.
The original terms of the amalgamation agreement remain unchanged. AXIS shareholders
will receive one common share and PartnerRe shareholders will receive 2.18 common
shares in the amalgamated company for each share they own.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our combined board will include seven directors from each company including Jean-Paul
Montupet currently the Chairman of PartnerRe, remaining as the Chairman of the
combined company.
Following the close of the transaction, PartnerRe shareholders will own approximately
51.5% of the amalgamated company while AXIS shareholders will own approximately
48.5%. We expect the transaction to close in the third quarter of this year. And we've
already received a few regulatory approvals including Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance.
As outlined on slide nine, we have made significant progress to-date which has reaffirmed
the strategic benefits of the combination. We've already completed the first phase of
integration, and as a result of this process, we are even more confident of achieving at
least $200 million in expense savings. The integration process has been extensive with
active participation from both sides on over 20 identified work-streams. Our discussions
have generated many excellent ideas that will benefit our merged company going
forward. In addition, the positive feedback from brokers and clients with respect to the
merger has been tremendous.
This transaction remains financially very compelling. As we note on slide 10, the
transaction will result in expense synergies as well as significant capital generation and
return to shareholders. It will be accretive to operating earnings per share and ROE to
AXIS shareholders beginning in the first full year after the close. And we expect to achieve
double-digit EPS accretion and double-digit ROE by year two. Book value per share
dilution will be de minimis with very acceptable low-single-digit tangible book value per
share dilution that we expect to quickly earn back.
The immense capital and cash flow generation capacity from the combination will more
strongly position the combined company to invest in research and product development,
to reinvest in its specialty franchises and growth businesses, invest in its staff to present
the best team in the industry and to return meaningful capital to shareholders.

FINAL

This transformative combination creates a leading global reinsurance platform, which will
be increasingly important as consolidation in the reinsurance market continues and as
you've heard from us before, increasingly cedants are focusing their reinsurance
purchases to a smaller core panel of lead re-insurers.
Now I'd like to discuss some of the specific value creating aspects of this merger. On slide
12, you will note that the combination creates a business with over $10 billion in total gross
premiums with substantial strategic benefits. Upon the completion of the merger P&C
reinsurance will comprise on a pro forma basis about 59% of our business, specialty
insurance approximately 26% and life accident and health will represent 15%. Each of
these three major businesses will benefit substantially from the markets positioning
resulting from this combination.
As seen on slide 13, the two P&C reinsurance businesses combine to form a top five
global P&C reinsurance business, and we will be the lead reinsurance based broker in the
world.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving to slide 14, the combination of AXIS specialty insurance business with PartnerRe's
insurance direct and facultative and wholesale insurance business will create a primary
insurance platform with over $2.5 billion in premiums. The global insurance business will
have a balanced portfolio mix with strong focus on specialty lines and the potential to
accelerate growth in desirable segments as opportunities arise.
Partner's life, accident and health business conflicts very little with AXIS A&H, as you can
see on slide 15. The combined business will be a top 10 global life and health reinsurer
and a top three U.S. health reinsurer, with significant opportunity for growth. The
combined life A&H business offers the ability to leverage broad product capabilities for
very high growth potential.
Between the two businesses, we have products to appeal to developed market
demographics such as longevity and disability and to less developed market
demographics such employee benefits and travel. The breadth of product is truly
astounding and will allow us to create a leading value proposition wherever we go.
Healthcare is booming internationally. At AXIS, we've already began to target new
markets like the Middle East and specialist classes such as expats and high net worth
individuals. In the U.S. both companies have been leaders in pursuing opportunities arising
from the establishment of the Affordable Care Act, and our books complement each
other very well. This combination of the two complementary franchises will feature global
product development, one of the best actuarial teams in the industry and significant
geographic reach. In addition, our hybrid insurance and reinsurance model offers
significant advantages.
The new management team at the combined company on slide 16, which was previously
announced, demonstrates how we plan to leverage the deep talent in both organizations.
This is a very strong team that I know well. We've been working closely together on the

Page 5 of 15



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2015-05-04

integration of our companies and we are committed to making it a success for all our
stakeholders. We are looking forward to uniting as one company.

FINAL

Moving to slide 18, I want to provide an update about our integration process. We are
moving full steam ahead, approximately 150 people involved from both organizations
working on over 20 separate work streams contributing to ensure the process moves as
quickly and seamlessly as possible.
We have made significant progress in defining our vision and target operating model for
our future, defined a day one scope requirement, and early indications strongly support
accelerated achievement of strategic and operating objectives.
Slide 19 gives a breakdown of our clear path towards achieving this target. There are
multiple opportunities for synergies across the organizations. As we've progressed
through the first phase of integration, we've confirmed our initial assumptions and
identified additional potential synergies that make us even more confident we will realize
a minimum of $200 million in merger-related savings.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide 20, you can see our highly complementary geographic footprint and business
segment coverage with operations around the world, including North America, Europe,
Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. We will leverage
each other's offices to accelerate geographic expansion. This global footprint offers
opportunity to grow our business and where we have overlap, serves as a source of
expense savings.
Some may ask, why not take advantage of the $250 million breakup fee and go away?
Simply accepting the $250 million termination fee would represent only a one-shot deal
with no strategic benefit to AXIS. The feedback we've received from clients, brokers and
employees since the original announcement has only strengthened our conviction about
the strategic power of this merger.
This transaction provides our companies with a tremendous opportunity to create
substantial value immediately, and even more over time. By merging with PartnerRe we
increase our scale and market presence. Our combined company will have approximately
$13 billion in combined shareholders' equity, over $10 billion in combined gross premiums
written across three attractive business platforms and sustainable long-term commercial
growth prospects through combined scale, efficiencies and expanded product capability.
Our expanded global platform and local market expertise will support and enhance
growth opportunities.
As you can see on the last page, this transaction generates meaningful synergies
including over $200 million in identified actionable expense savings. We expect to achieve
run rate level of savings within the first 18 months of the transaction. We feel that the
strength of both companies' balance sheets, our shared conservative underwriting
philosophies, strong reserve positions and the great familiarity between our management
teams will limit the execution risk of this transaction.

Finally, the combination has the potential to increase our valuation by providing
shareholders with an attractive entry point. We will have a stronger platform with earnings
per share and ROE accretion driving sustainable value creation.

FINAL

Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?

Q&A
Operator
And our first question comes from Amit Kumar of Macquarie. Please go ahead.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Thank you, good morning and thanks for the call.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Good morning Amit.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Just two quick questions. The first question regarding, I think we have some sense to this,
how did you come up with the $11.50 number? Was that more to maintain I guess book
value growth equilibrium or maybe just talk about that number?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

And what's your second question?

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

The second question is what I was getting this morning, was as an AXIS shareholder, I just
saw $560 million of potential capital from new company, move to PartnerRe shareholders.
I'm curious what you would say to that?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Okay, thank you for that. Let's address the first question. Obviously the derivation of the
dividend took a lot of things into consideration. But, fundamentally as I mentioned earlier
everything that we've seen from our earliest due diligence to the integration planning
process has really gone very, very well and we've confirmed all of those benefits. And
when we reviewed the expense synergies, the cash flow, the capital efficiencies available
as a result of this merger and the fact that clearly, PartnerRe was listening to its
shareholders and wanted to make sure, as we did, frankly, that all of the shareholders of
both companies saw meaningful benefit in this merger. We felt it was appropriate to have
PartnerRe declare the dividend of $11.50.

Page 7 of 15



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2015-05-04

FINAL

But importantly, Amit, even with this dividend we will have substantial capital to support
our strong ratings, drive profitable growth and still continue with our plans to return our
accumulated earnings to our shareholders through both regular dividends and stock
repurchases. So we did not see any diminution of the potential of our company and the
potential of our merger going through it.
Now with regards to the $560 million, I think what we need to do is really two things. The
first things that I would correct is that although there is a $560 million dividend, the
remaining company is going to be owned 52% by PartnerRe shareholders and 48% by
AXIS shareholders. And so 52% of that reduction is actually absorbed by the PartnerRe
shareholders. So as an AXIS shareholder if you look at the combined company after the
merger, it's only approximately $270 odd million which is a reduction.
And with that reduction, which I acknowledge, which does create, as I mentioned, only a
very de minimis book value dilution and only low-single-digits tangible book value dilution,
I believe that our shareholders are well served by owning a company that will be a
formidable competitor going forward, having EPS accretion already in the first year, seeing
double-digit EPS accretion within the second year, double-digit ROE over time. And as I
said I expect that the benefits of this merger are such that we will very quickly earn back
the very modest dilution that we took on tangible book value.

A - Michael A. Butt

{BIO 1750135 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And if I may add, our board obviously agreed with that analysis strongly.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. I'll stop here. Thanks for the answers.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

You are very welcome.

Operator
Our next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. Albert, could you talk a little bit more specifically about the
response you're seeing at 4/1 and how that plays in with your initial expectations?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yes, Mike, thank you. I think both PartnerRe and ourselves were very impressed by the
reaction we got. As you might imagine we spent a long time throughout the last three
months talking to brokers and talking to clients because one of the uncertainties as we
were planning this merger was, as you all were asking, what are the potential
dissynergies, and that was a number that we had – we were able to put a placeholder if
you would, but this needed to be confirmed in the market.
Page 8 of 15



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2015-05-04

FINAL

What I will tell you is that we grossly overestimated the dissynergies when we started this
merger. Our clients and our brokers are highly enthusiastic about their merger. They see
this as a real commitment to becoming a leader in the reinsurance space and they want
to do more business with us, plain and simple.
In fact, I would argue that our underwriters on both sides and seeing the market response
is actually emboldened them and made them feel increasingly comfortable about this
merger going forward. We will be a much stronger competitor going forward. It's been – I
have to say I've had fantastic meetings, which again, is why am so committed to making
this merger work.

A - Michael A. Butt

{BIO 1750135 <GO>}

If you believe in the tectonic plate shifts that some of you have all been talking about
going on in the industry, then a lot of the thinking going into what we are doing relates to
that and putting us in a position to be more strongly equipped to deal with those plate
shifts.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And by the way, the benefits that we've seen are not only on the reinsurance side. We've
already seen significant benefits in our interactions with our brokers and clients on the
insurance side and also on the A&H side. We've been – I'm very proud to say, we've been
a very successful midsized company. This merger takes us into the top lead group, and
we will be highly welcomed by our brokers and our clients in this top leadership group.

A - Michael A. Butt

{BIO 1750135 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. That's very helpful. I just want to touch on one thing you said. I think we've all talked
a lot, I understand well the panel reduction on the part of P&C reinsurers. Is there similar
trend going on in the life reinsurance space?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Actually, the life reinsurance space is a space that actually has smaller panels than the P&C
space. There are actually smaller numbers of reinsurers in the world and they tend to
have very strong relationships with their clients. So it's already there, if you would. I think
there the benefit that we have – excuse me – is that if you look at the lead reinsurers in
the world, they are essentially the top five, top six global reinsurers in the life world, and
clients have significant concentration of business and receivables with those top
reinsurers as it stands. The ability for the combined company to come with a life product
offering and a $13 billion equity base; again, will be very welcome by the clients because it
provides a significant player to add to that too small a group of global life reinsurers.

And our next question comes from Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. Please go
ahead.

Q - Charles J. Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Good morning.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Good morning, Charles.

Q - Charles J. Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

I'm wondering first if you could talk at all about what the potential capital synergies are of
the combined entity? I know you talked about the expense savings and your due diligence
highlighting other, I was just wondering if you could point to any, or what the balance
sheet synergies, capital relief could look like?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, we can't quantify them for you here, but certainly we'll tell you that as we've been
mentioning in a number of areas, the books are actually highly complementary. And so as
you have this increasing complementation, you get diversification benefits across the
book. Importantly, the ability to manage the overall book to make better purchases of
reinsurance and retro, because as a larger buyer you get a lot more coverage from the
market, and the ability to partner with third party capital to help deliver additional capital
and potentially lower cost additional capital to our clients, are all ways that we'll reduce
the overall – what I would say gross capital requirements of our company. And, of course,
as a larger company with a broader range of products and services by industry, by line, by
geography, we become a much more attractive partner to the third-party capital
providers, which again only makes it easier for us to optimize the growth (26:18) and the
net portfolio that we keep.
I think importantly, and I did not mention this in my prepared remarks, we have spoken to
the rating agencies about our plans and about this dividend, and the feedback that we
received was very positive. And I expect that the rating agencies see no issue with the
declared dividend and our plans to continue to grow and return capital to our
shareholders.

Q - Charles J. Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Could we talk – the dividend and the dollar amount at $11.50, was this – were you
comfortable at this level due to some of the further due diligence that has been taking
place since you announced the deal, that, hey, we've gotten a better look at the books,
we've gone through the reserve basis, we see where this is supported relative to where it
was before?
Page 10 of 15

FINAL

And then additionally, what would be the comments some investors might have that, of
the new company board makeup and the board members coming from the PartnerRe
side saying that this kind of dividend should have been at the initial announcement of this
transaction, as opposed to here, and that – it might question some that the board
members are looking out for shareholder interest – on the PartnerRe side, not on your
side. I think that people realize you struck a pretty attractive deal at the onset.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

There's a lot of stuff in your question so let's see if I can reduce it. Yes, the answer is yes.
Everything that we've learned, and we've gone into depth a lot more, has certainly made
us more comfortable that we could see this capital dividend go out of the company and
still have no impact on our plans going forward, so a yes to your first part of your question.
With regard to the second part of your question, frankly, it's not up to me to discuss that.
What I will tell you is that the PartnerRe management and directors have been staunch
defenders of the interests of PartnerRe and its shareholders and where we are today is a
deal that I believe provides significant value to the shareholders of both companies.

Q - Charles J. Sebaski

Yeah. Good morning. Following up on Charles's question just a little bit, and I absolutely
agree with most everything he said, the one question I have for you Albert – which I am
really not a lawyer and I don't understand these things completely, is there any risk of
AXIS having engaged in collusion with PartnerRe given you already have 150 people
dedicated to making this merger work and are there any legal implications to that?

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. On the capital return, Albert, you talked about returning the accumulated
earnings to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Is that just on the AXIS side or
are you speaking for the entire company, for the PartnerRe accumulated earnings as well?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Jay, good morning, I'm talking about the accumulated earnings of both companies. As you
know, both companies have been very good stewards of capital and my understanding is
that both companies were prepared to return all of their earnings to their shareholders
during the year.
Now we did suspend the share repurchase on the announcement of the merger, but
since then we've been accruing a lot of earnings that we do not believe we need either
on a standalone basis or on a combined basis. And as soon as the merger is closed we
will be re-initiating capital management activities and it remains our intention to return to
our shareholders immediately after the close our accumulated joint earnings of the
company.

That's what I was trying to get at, okay. It's just I didn't see that in the slides. I couldn't
remember if you verbally said it or not. '
And then secondly, I don't see, at least yet, any comment from Exor, whether they're
going to withdraw their offer or not. If they don't and they want to leave that offer out
there and this goes to a vote on the PartnerRe side, what – if that were to happen and
PartnerRe were to lose the vote with you, do you still get your breakup fee?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

As I understand the terms of the agreement, if the PartnerRe shareholders vote down this
deal and then subsequently do a transaction in the subsequent 12 months, we would get
the entire breakup fee of $280 million plus the reimbursement of expenses.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay, so I guess – if it was voted – I mean, obviously, you get into games of chicken with
this stuff – if they vote it down but then PartnerRe chooses to remain independent you
would get something less?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

If they chose to remain independent we would get a vote down fee of $55 million plus
reimbursement of expenses. But obviously, I'm quite confident that the shareholders of
PartnerRe will see the merits of this merger and the value creation and so I'm very
optimistic, Ian, that the shareholders of PartnerRe will vote to support this transaction.

No, of course. I just wanted to understand the ramifications because these things get
complicated sometimes. That's all I had. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead.

Hey, good morning. Albert, just quickly, so I think last time we had one of these calls, a
question was getting commitment to obviously the primary insurance business and that
being a larger percentage of your overall business and I think you said yeah, you'd like
that to be the case over time, at least 50/50 or more. I'm just curious: how do you expect
to get to that kind of 50/50 or more? Is that an organic growth? Do you think there is
additional acquisition to come here down the road?

I think we have a – thank you for that question, Brian. I think we have a wide range of
opportunities. I think organically, we will be able to grow more because of our positioning,
of our breadth of products, capital, locations and all the benefits that I have enunciated in
the beginning of this presentation. But there's no question that with a company of the size
that we will have, the potential profitability and cash flow here is very large.
And so, certainly we'll also have the ability to make acquisitions if there are attractive
acquisitions available going forward. But that, as at all times, will be based on the
opportunities in front of us and the benefits of investing our capital to support growth
organically, to support growth by acquisitions or to return that capital back to our
shareholder. You've got our commitment that we will make the best decisions we can at
that time.

Q - Brian R. Meredith
