Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Welcome to Tryg's Second Quarter conference call. I'm speaking, as Morten Hubbe, and
together with me in the room is Investor Relations and Tor Loennum our CFO. And we've
done a prerecorded webcast which you may view and see when it suits you. I'll do just a
very, very brief introduction on the results and then we can move straight on to Q&A.
We're pleased to see that the Second Quarter shows the strongest quarter we've
combined with in ﬁve years of 84.7% which means an increase in the technical result of
65%, an increase in the pre-tax result of 45% which shows that our insurance business is
on the right track to meet the target we've set from the Third Quarter next year, and
onwards.
Clearly, it's important to notice that we've had signiﬁcant help or a tailwind, in terms of
having fewer weather claims, fewer large claims, positive net income from the insurance,
which also left oﬀ on the runoﬀ numbers.
On the negative side, the continued decrease in interest rates have had negative impact
on the combined ratio. And if we move on brieﬂy to investments, clearly equity markets
have been negative in the quarter and more speciﬁcally, there's a signiﬁcant positive
impact from the new eﬀort. They do occur largely designed to help the Danish life and
pension sector. And on the other hand, a signiﬁcant negative impact from the fact that
we've been down, the value of our Danish domicile premises.

FINAL

So across these facts, we do see it as a strong quarter that continues our right direction
towards our goals in the Third Quarter next year. It doesn't change those goals and we
always know that the second and Third Quarter are season-wide, the best quarters in the
year. And of course, luck and the tailwind will not inﬂuence all quarters, and we try our
best to separate, for you to be able to see which is our doing, and which is a helping
hand.
I think with those few words, we'll hand it over to your questions, and we'll do some
answers to that. Thank you.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And we do have a question from a Hakon Fure DnB Markets.

Q - Hakon Fure Reistad

{BIO 16623060 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, good evening, guys, this is Hakon Fure from DnB Markets. Three questions, if I may.
First, on the new discount curve in Denmark. I assume this is lowered interest rate
sensitivity on your subs. What changes have you or are you planning to do to your
matching portfolio? Are you ceasing opportunity to increase a share of voters in your
portfolio?
Secondly, on the runoﬀ gains. Seeing as the new discount curve allows for the lowered
net present value of your long-term reserves, is the relatively high rate of gains in the
quarter also driven by the new discount curve in Denmark, or is there another explanation
besides the sideway to insurance.
And thirdly, on the property right balance. Am I getting this right if I say that the Danish
write-downs have been booked in the P&L while the positive adjustment in Norway is
booked directly to equity? Thank you.

A - Tor Loennum
Tor Loennum, hi, Hakon. I have -- you had three questions. One, if there is going to be any
changes in terms of the investment portfolio related to the changes in the discount curve
and these, sort of in the short run, there's not going to be any signiﬁcant changes.
Question number two is in terms of the runoﬀ gains. There is no eﬀect from the discount
curve changes in the runoﬀ gains. We have chosen to show that there is a positive eﬀect
from the sideways coverage as you said, but there is also some positive eﬀects from the
reinsurance part which hold a positive runoﬀ gain. And that's the reinsurance.
To question number three in terms of the property you have with -- you have read it
correctly. The ME increase in property value on the domicile will be taken directly on the
equity whereas any write-down is taken to the P&L.

FINAL

The next question is from Vinit Malhotra from Goldman Sachs.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hi, thank you very much. Just on this line 14 of the investor pack, I noticed this 5% beneﬁt
from proﬁtability initiative between last year's Second Quarter and this year's Second
Quarter. And I think probably because from my point of view, even excluding these
reserves reviews[ph] and even excluding that luck from the weather, I think you beat my
number by around 4%.
And this I understand, this proﬁtability initiative, would you break it down or quantify it
because you have mentioned DKK20 million of claims, but in this 5% is a very big
number. Thanks.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I guess overall as a distinction between two diﬀerent sort of time series of initiative, I think
since the autumn of 2011, we've explained that there were pricing initiatives and some
claims initiatives that would contribute gross, roughly DKK1 billion to 2012. And of course,
if there were no inﬂation at all, that would include the combined ratio by 5percentage
points.
Those fees are both price changes done in 2012, but also prices changes done in 2011
which had the carry-over to 2012 and then of course, we have claims through inﬂation, in
any given year, that would typically eat some three percentage points, which would leave
two percentage points net, to help the combined ratio development.
I think the DKK20 million you're referring to and which is important to debate as well is
that on the capital markets day June, we described initiatives to reduce both the claims
costs and to reduce the costs, admin costs as such over the coming years. And we're now
withholding how they are progressing.
So you can say one is the, 2012 impact from the primarily price-increase driven eﬀects and
the second is the coming year impact from working with claims procurement and costs.
So I think you need to keep both in mind.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Sure. So this in 1Q, of these, this number would have been --, this chart probably wasn't
shown but would this have again been around this mark, 5%? And --?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Company Name: Tryg A/S

Well as you said, the DKK1 billion in a year is roughly 5%, and of course within the
business areas, there is uneven distribution on the quarters --.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

FINAL

Sure.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

If you look at it from a company point of view, there is a fairly even distribution of that
impact that's showing in the quarter, therefore the 5%.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Sure. Just before I sign oﬀ, on the same slide, number 14, the corporate underlying claims
ratio has really fall down by a similar 5% magnitude, roughly. Is there something left that
you'd like to comment on that here, or is it just, if it lingers in pricing initiative?

A - Tor Loennum

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, you're right, sort of, in terms of the question. So it's a good performance in the
quarter segment, I think overall it's worth commenting that this is only a quarter and as
such, of course there will be some natural subtraction between the quarters.
I think the general picture as we said is that we do see improvements in proﬁtability
across the business areas, perhaps with an exception of commercial, this quarter, which is
in line with sort of the overall proﬁtability improvement that they expected but also that
there is signiﬁcant areas[ph] around the numbers.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And you may that that was reported, some concern about drops in corporate insurance
biting our rate. And I guess we've reported that since the tenures renew, we've been able
to turn around that trend and avoid reduction in rates and rather get, take ups in rates that
is starting to help results.
And we've also reduced the exposure risk wise in some segments. But I completely agree
with Tor, we will still see ﬂuctuation in the corporate area but it with more positive trends
than last year and the year before.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

So there's bit of accretion of the losses outside the large claim, which will lower probably,
do explain -- apart from pricing.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes.

FINAL

A question is from Hans Pluijgers from CA Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Yes, good evening gentlemen. Four questions from my side. First, looking at the run oﬀ
gains. You already explained the sideway reinsurance contract which you, as I understood,
you also said there were some other reinsurance gains. Could you may be quantify that?
And respect to the run oﬀ gains, more in let's say, which products groups did you saw,
good run-oﬀ gains again, mainly on workers comp stays at[ph] the case, and how is the
outside experience there going? And what do you expect let's say, for run-oﬀ gains going
forward? Could you give us some feeling what you expect for Q3, and Q4?
Secondly, on pricing, principally with the cleaning up the books with respect to let's say,
yes, cleaning --- getting rid of some more bad clients, how is it progressing so far? Do you
still have some cleaning up to do? Could you give us some feeling what you -- how far
you are into that process?

Bloomberg Transcript

Thirdly, on investment returns, you also mentioned a negative impact from the Norwegian
Hedge, from the interest rate swaps. Could you quantify that impact on the investment
return?
And lastly, just to get the clarity if I read it right, the claims initiative has about DKK20
million impact so far. That, you mean that on an annualized basis, and the same is for the
cost-initiative, DKK25 million, that's on an annualized base, so not the impact that you
already saw in Q2, is that correct?

A - Tor Loennum
Hans, I can start oﬀ with answering the question on run-oﬀ gains. We haven't quantiﬁed
the eﬀects in total simply because I think it would be diﬃcult to give too much detail. But
what I can say is that the claims are on the positive gains on the run-oﬀ side, it's primarily
driven by the sideways color that was mentioned that also related to some sources related
to natural perils. So it's the combination of eﬀects.
Then you have the question about what our expectations going forward in terms of other,
or sort of in terms -- the total various business lines. And I think what we said on the
capital markets day was that the development in terms of the worker's comp, looks
positive and I think that still stands and as such, of course, it should expect the positive
trend in terms of the run-oﬀ gains to continue.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

And I guess --.

FINAL

On the plus side, you can say that one area of cleanup has been the large claims exposed
segment in corporate where, we have been cleaning up our exposure to energy factories
and companies in Norway, and to some municipals in the Danish segment. That is, that
work has almost been completed. There are a few energy companies where there is a
longer contract, where we will be in 2013 before we completely reduce the risk, but that is
largely one.
I would say that in the commercial segment, we are still very much working on changing
the price segmentation and the risk assessment of customers and we're still really not very
far in that process. And I expect that still to have a negative impact on the top line in
commercial in the coming period.
But on the other hand, it's quite clear from our data that customers that we take out of the
portfolio in commercial has a signiﬁcantly higher claims ratio and therefore helps improve
the bottom line. Then of course, we have to sacriﬁce to some extent, the development
and topline in commercial. So that development will continue for a while, still.
In private line, the cleanup so to speak is more on a product basis per customer. It is
typically either in the content area or in the house area, whereas other products typically
are proﬁtable for those customers. So I would expect that to have less of an impact on the
numbers you see.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tor Loennum
In terms of the question related to the investment returns on the impact on the mismatch,
so to speak. There is, as you mentioned, a signiﬁcant eﬀect from -- or mismatch eﬀect in
this quarter and it's related to the Norwegian government bond thing, pushed even
further down.
And you've seen that eﬀect related to the pension obligation as well, and I think it is
stated in the quarterly report numbers in terms of, so you can actually sort of make the
calculation related to the eﬀects of the mismatch, if you look up on the reinvestment
chapter.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Tor Loennum
To the question number four, it's the quarterly eﬀect. It's not annualized.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

So we have DKK20 million positive impact in Q2 from claims initiative, and DKK25 million
from costs. Okay. Clear.

A - Tor Loennum
And you can see we are trying to show in the numbers as well the reduction in number of
FTE so it should be possible to actually --.

FINAL

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

That would imply that let's say from the DKK100 million claims initiative for 2012. You
already have let's say, DKK75 million already in the pocket, because if you take DKK25
million -- sorry DKK20 million, so it's like DKK60 million already in the pocket, because if
you take DKK20 million in Q2, you can argue that likely will also continue into Q3, Q4,
then you will leave DKK60 million in the pocket. That's what I -- is that correct?

A - Tor Loennum
Yes, yes. I'm not going to give you the guidance Hans, but of course, when we state the
targets we are quite anxious that we can make sure that we reach it.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Yes, I can understand that, but more let's say how I have to interpret this number. So on an
annualized basis for the costs savings, you have already DKK100 million annualized,
already realized. DKK25 million on a quarterly basis, this DKK100 million on an annual
basis, is that correct?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tor Loennum
Yes but it's correct if you take DKK25 million and plus, but clearly it's important to expect
that it's not like the eﬀects started in Q2. So you must make your calculations from --.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Yes, okay, okay, (inaudible). And are there, let's say, any respect to the cost initiatives, any
additional restricting costs or the layoﬀ costs you had to take in Q2?

A - Tor Loennum
No.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Any material? No, okay.

A - Tor Loennum
No but we will get back to that, I think, for the Q3 numbers.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

The next question is from Claus Gron Therp from SEB Enskilda. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Claus Gron Therp

{BIO 6011258 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, and congratulations with a very strong result. A couple of questions.
On the commercial expenses and the cost-ratio on commercial, I think we have discussed
on various investor presentations how come that your cost-ratio is a little bit higher than
some of your peers and is actually increasing in the Second Quarter, compared to the
First Quarter.
Could you elaborate whether there is any one oﬀ cost in this, or whether it is because that
you haven't started to take some costly reductions? Also based on the earlier comments,
you said that there may be decreasing premiums in the commercial lines which could just
exaggerate the issue with the expense ratios in that division.

Bloomberg Transcript

And the second question goes towards Sweden. Can we see any positive impact on the
pricing initiative or is it because of the weather and fewer large claims that Sweden is
doing much better in the Second Quarter compared to in the First Quarter?
And the last question is regarding your dividend policy. In the end of your capital market
day, you discussed that -- or touched upon the discussion whether you would change
your dividend policy and you said that there were discussions between the management
group and Tryg's board. Could you maybe elaborate to what extent there is any news
there? That is all.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I guess we'll start with the cost-debate on commercial. I think you're pointing to the
challenge on your own, there's a structural challenge that our cost-rate in commercial is
too high and the additional current challenge that we are reducing our top line. So the
challenge is to reduce the costs further than the top line is requiring.
And I guess some of that is being managed through lower salaries in the redistribution
line. But we also have to restructure more signiﬁcantly the mix of our distribution which
takes several years, we've started the process.
We are automating a number of processes that are manual currently, in commercial, and
we'll reduce headcounts in that area. But that again, will also take a signiﬁcant period of
time. So I guess it's -- we started the work but the development in the top line of course
isn't helping the process, and I guess it's fair to say that the structural eﬃciency measures
we've taken in private, we still have a fair bit of way towards this goal we have the similar
processes in commercial.
So we'll start to see reductions in the cost ratios, we're going[ph] to see reductions in the
costs, but the challenge for the top line is sort of pushing the process a bit.

FINAL

I think on pricing initiatives in Sweden, the main challenge has been our private business
on particularly car insurance in Sweden, but to some extent also house insurance. We are
starting to see improvements in the claims ratio of car insurance. The ﬁrst time we've
actually seen a period where car insurance had a lower claims ratio than expected, clearly
still not to our future targeted levels, but we're starting to see a positive development in
private.
It doesn't really change the fact that if you take away the three proﬁtable segments and
look at private lines only in Sweden, it's still not proﬁtable, but it is starting to move. So it's
not weather alone.
And I guess on the dividend policy, the only thing that has really happened since we met
you in June is that there's been the summer holiday, roughly. So we debated that topic
with the board again today, displaying for them also how keen a focus there was on this
topic, on the capital markets day. And we're continuing to work with diﬀerent scenarios
for the development of policies, and as we said on the capital markets day we will come
back, the market, during the autumn when we have news on this.

Q - Claus Gron Therp

{BIO 6011258 <GO>}

The next question is from Gianandrea Roberti, from Carnegie.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yes, good evening from me as well. I have three quick questions. I appreciate the around
DKK84 million, if I understood correctly, runoﬀ gain that you have, let's call it one oﬀ in the
quarter. Then obviously, one can look up on your report and seeing how much you were
lucky, if I can call it like this in terms of both weather claims and large claims better than
expected.
When I do this readjustment, I land on a combined ratio of around 89.5 in the quarter.
Maybe I should add a few bps for the additional reinsurance one oﬀ that Tor mentioned
before, but I see 89.5 to 90, already in Q2 2012. I just would like to see how -- if this is how
you see it as well, and if so, that seems already a pretty decent level. Quite a bit in
advance of what most of us were expecting, let's put it like this. That's the ﬁrst question.
The second question, it's related to a comment you have in the private lines section there,
which I thought was quite interesting, is the fact that you mentioned that there is a trend
among Danish clients to I guess, sell big cars and buy small ones, which is not surprising.
But also to drop the comprehensive motor insurance only remaining with TPL, with the
mandatory one.
I'm just wondering how important this is? If you mentioned the report, there must be
some real ones. It's just quite interesting.

The last question it's on the pension liabilities once again. I actually realized only recently
that some of your peers have decided them as an oﬀ-balance sheet item, it's not heat in
their shareholder's equity. And I'm just trying to understand how come you are also
Gjensidige and some other companies, book it like that and some other have it oﬀbalance sheet. This is driven by Danish accounting as opposed to IFRS or why is that?
Thanks.

A - Tor Loennum
Yes. Hi, Gianandrea, I think for the ﬁrst question, that wasn't really a question, I think it was
more a statement than -- and I guess it's, well, it's not -- it seems like you have made an
okay calculation. I think it's fair to say that, and you know this as well as me, that clearly
there is seasonality in the numbers and clearly Q2 should be a good quarter, granted that
seasonality.
So I think what we try to say is that we continue to improve proﬁtability wise towards the
below-90 on the sustainable basis, from Q3 2013.
I think in terms of your question number two, related to the private lines and the cars here
in Denmark. Clearly that it's an issue and I think we have talked about it before, that it's a
natural trend when you look at sort of what is going on in the economy.

Bloomberg Transcript

And so I think you have -- when you look at sort of, see what happens to the average
premiums and mostly that's also the eﬀect that we see.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Don't think we have those speciﬁc numbers on -- not ready hand, how many cars we're
actually talking about. But it reduces the average premium of private cars in the Danish
portfolio by a bit less than 1%. So there is an impact.

A - Tor Loennum
To the last question about the pension liability, Gianandrea, I think it's kind of diﬃcult to
answer what the peers are doing but when you talk about an oﬀ-balance eﬀect, it may be
that some Norwegian companies have chosen to postpone, to take the liability into their
balance sheet, which was the previous option. So it may be that's actually -- sort of is the
option they have chosen to use.
But the way that we treat the pension obligation under IFRS, I would assume would be the
same for both Norwegian, Danish and also other European companies. If you'd like, that's
a discussion which I think perhaps is better to take oﬀ line after the call.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Thanks a lot. Much appreciated.

Next question is from Giulia Raﬀo from Autonomous. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Giulia Raﬀo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

All right. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. A few questions. One, just to follow up
on the topic of runoﬀ. I was just wondering if you can give us a sense of how much of the
releases are actually coming from you -- releasing the exceptional conservative of -- you
talk on areas like worker comps, primarily in the last two years.
So how much, let's say, taking aside the reinsurance are kick-backs, how much let's say,
we can genuinely ascribe to you re-correcting an overly conservative view taken in the last
two years in relation to worker comps.
Then my second question is on investment income going forward. We continued to see
further compassion at the short end of the curve. If I'm going my numbers, I get to a
normalized investment income after technical interest of no more than DKK200 million for
next year. I was wondering whether the calculation pretty much matches what your
simulations are refund, of piece there.

Bloomberg Transcript

And ﬁnally, just one question on dividends, I understand you are still in the process of
discussing the policy with the board, but if I look at the excess over your targeted surplus
at the end of June, you were vastly at DKK850 million, so that would already put you in a
position where you can pay, assuming -- no considering that the ﬁrst half of the year has
been better than normal. It already puts you in a position to pay 50% payout of a full year
earnings power.
Should we expect you to consider to exceed a 50% payout already in 2012 or do you
think the discussion with the board will take extra time, therefore is something that should
have more of an impact in '13? Thank you very much.

A - Tor Loennum
I think if we start the last question, I think as Morten said, if you sort of expect to reach a
conclusion sort of by the end of Q4, of course, it will come really have an impact on 2013.
On the other hand, of course, it would be diﬃcult to take a totally diﬀerent view on the
2012 numbers, but it's kind of diﬃcult to speculate too much, I think. What you should
expect is that the results will -- I think we have said before that sort of our ambition is so
that when we sort of look at lower growth on the top line, it should be a high cash
conversion in terms of the numbers.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

We do expect I should say to reach a conclusion with the board this year. We don't expect
a sort of two or three step story.

FINAL

In terms of the investment income under the simulation that you have made, I think clearly
you're right. When you look at what has happened on the short-term interest rates, we
haven't sort of given any new expectations in terms of interest that we should expect on
the free portfolio so we haven't really given any new set of calculation numbers. But you
make -- you can make the same observation as us in terms of the short-term interest
(inaudible). And related to the --.

Q - Giulia Raﬀo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Excuse me, excuse me, can I just follow-up here? Can you give us a sense of where your
new money yield are at the moment, with regards to the pool of assets that make up your
free portfolio?

A - Tor Loennum
I said that perhaps, I think perhaps it would be better than we would try to give you an
update for the Q3 numbers in terms of expectations.

Q - Giulia Raﬀo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Okay, but you can't give us a sort of sense of the cash ﬂow you've invested in the last two
months, let's say, on the bond side which is back in the free surplus? What kind of new
money yield have you locked in there?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

But you -- why are you concerned about the diﬀerent distinctions between new money
and old money. When I understand is that a yield and coupon system, but when you mark
to markets the pricing and value of the bond anyway, there's no diﬀerence than the yield
that you get from old money and new money, as long as you calculate the yield at the
same point in time

Q - Giulia Raﬀo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Yes. That's correct, I was trying to have a sense of really, if you think about it, the free
surplus has been volatile in the last few quarters. We had several swings factored
impairment on your property, you had the -- in a few quarters there was some derivatives,
and ﬂuctuations.
So I was trying to have a sense of what new normal is for the investment yield, the
environment.

I couldn't take it away. If we take away a request which I think makes perfect sense, that
we should do something to operate the more overall predictability of our investment
income. But then view that more as a total, rather than trying to make some distinction
between old money and new money.

Yes. All right.

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

But I think that's relevant info Giulia and we'll try to do that.

FINAL

Q - Giulia Raﬀo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

No, because I think if you're looking at -- is one line will often consensus numbers tend to
be rather wide, let's say.

A - Tor Loennum
Yes. I agree, I agree to that Giulia. But then again, I think it's important that when you look
at the numbers, this is very clearly impacted by again relatively heavy inﬂow of money, to
perhaps in particular in the Norwegian markets and the Norwegian government bonds
and I think we can't really start to give you guidance on what is going to happen, under
that kind of extraordinary circumstances.

Bloomberg Transcript

Clearly, as Morten said what we can do is that we can try to update sort of the
expectations on the various parts of the portfolio, but clearly, we haven't changed the
expectations in terms of the real estate and in terms of the equity. So it will only be in
terms of the bond part of the portfolio.
In terms of the -- the ﬁnal question, in terms of the runoﬀ of gains, the reserve releases I
think in practice, what you should think is that we have said the runoﬀ gains in the area of
3.5% to 3% and that's really what we've -- that's also what we should expect going
forward.

Q - Giulia Raﬀo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Thank you.

The next question if from Per Gronborg from Danske Markets.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes, hello, it's Pere from Danske. I have three questions. The ﬁrst one, once again related
to your one oﬀ gains. When I look at your ﬁgures, it looks like you have DKK112 million in
gains on a gross level, and DKK349 billion on a net level, a diﬀerence of DKK237 million.
You have only really explained where DKK80 million of those are coming from. Is this the
way I can look at the ﬁgures and in that case, where the other two-thirds are coming from?
My second question is on the pension chart, on the equity. The charts you have taken,
now much are you now up to date with current interest rate levels or might there be more
to come if you could just tell us at which interest rate level you have adjusted your
obligations.

And ﬁnally, the cost of unwinding your discounted reserves. It seems to be coming down
pretty slowly. Are there any reasons why it's not coming more dramatically down in line
with discounting rates? To me it seems it has only come down some DKK10 million for a
quarter over quarter. That was three questions. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Tor Loennum
I think to start oﬀ with the runoﬀ gains, Per, as mentioned, yes, clearly there is as I mention
FX from the private covers, which have been with us. Then there is FX related to the
Norwegian natural private pool[ph]. And also some other minor FX, I guess, you've made
a comment that there is a diﬀerence or an additional income of DKK234 million[ph]
between the gross and the net runoﬀ gains. And I guess that says something about the
(inaudible).
In terms of the pension charge there is a 0.6 percentage points drop in interest rates, and
I think what have used after this quarter is 0.4%[ph]. And bear in mind that if you take sort
of development in terms of the interest rate changes for the third part, we have also, and I
think I mentioned that in Q1 we had changed the life expectancy in the pension charge, so
there is also an FX therein in Q1.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Would you be able to say if there was 0.6% eﬀect in the same quarter, and currently there
would be another 0.4%, was that correctly understood?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tor Loennum
No. In fact, what --.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

The FX you were booked in the Second Quarter was primarily from, if I understood you
correctly, was from a 0.6percentage drop in the interest rate.

A - Tor Loennum
Yes.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

And there seemed to be -- did you say there was another 0.4% down to current levels?

A - Tor Loennum
No, no, I just made -- Per I just made the comment that if you look at sort of the
development in terms of the long-term Norwegian interest rates, there was an increase
from 3112[ph] to Q1.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay.

Company Name: Tryg A/S

A - Tor Loennum
But that positive eﬀect was oﬀset against an increase in life expectancy in the obligation.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

FINAL

So basically what you have provision now based on this end of June interest rate levels.

A - Tor Loennum
Yes.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay, perfect.

A - Tor Loennum
Then you have, the ﬁnal question you have was about the unwinding eﬀect.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. But to me it seems like in the First Quarter, that cost of DKK132 million[ph], and the
same quarter, it's costing DKK123 million. The Fourth Quarter last year was DKK142
million. The ﬁgure is moving very, very slowly, is taking into account how fast the interest
rate is dropping.

A - Tor Loennum
I think that's a question that we will have to get back to you, if that's okay.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes, okay, that's ﬁne.

The next question is from Matti Ahokas from Handelsbanken. Please go ahead.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes, good evening. A general question, ﬁrstly on the premium growth. Now, we're seeing
a zero ﬂat premium growth. You've talked about the proﬁtability initiatives as an
explanation. Could you somehow try to isolate the impact of the kind a bad customer lost
and the underlying premium growth you're seeing, preferably on the diﬀerent basis units
as well?
The second question is regarding your Finish business, obviously our -- the Finnish and
Swedish business, a pretty impressive turnaround. Is there something extraordinary
behind it, and if not, does this somehow impact and should we see this as a kind a trend,
a change in the business or the more of a one oﬀ? Thanks.

FINAL

If we take the premium growth question. I guess we should overall expect a low growth
rate in the scenario where the environment in the countries we work in having a low
growth rate. But I guess some of the areas where we see a signiﬁcantly lower growth, it's
of course in the commercial segment.
While clearly we see a reduction in the commercial retention rate. We've done signiﬁcant
price increases in commercial and we're doing signiﬁcant restructuring of our risk
assessment of a number of commercial customers. And that is why, of course, there is
negative growth in the commercial segment. And we do expect that that negative growth
will continue for a while still, so both throughout 2012 and will also have a negative impact
on 2013.
And another area is of course Sweden where the restructuring of our, particularly our
motor pricing is very signiﬁcant. I think we mentioned on the capital market day, that we
currently have a retention rate in Swedish motor of around 50%, which I think is the lowest
I've had any time in my 20 years in insurance.

Bloomberg Transcript

But it basically shows how much we are restructuring the pricing matrix of our motor
business in the Swedish market. Then of course you may recall that we announced quite
clearly prior to viewing 2011, or 1st of January 2012, we knew that we would not accept any
price deductions in corporate. And as a result of that, of course, we say goodbye to some
of the brokers at closing time.
But clearly we monitor that the claims ratio development of these customers are
signiﬁcantly higher than the ones we have remaining in the portfolio. But of course it
damages the top line, but clearly improves the bottom line, and that is the policies we've
done.
I think in Finland and Sweden, one of the core derivatives that we are fewer employees in
Finland. We are selling less than Finland which means improvements to the cost ﬁle and
the FTE. But also that we're starting to see improvements in the claims ratios, we see in
Sweden that our private line customers are improving their results, both motor and house.
But also we're now into a quarter where boats and (inaudible) insurance have proﬁtable
periods. They are mainly used during the summer period and that is where we mainly
have the premium income and also the positive, net results.
It doesn't change at all our view that we are looking at our future strategy in Finland. We
just announced that in February of this year, and said that we would use a 12-month
period to carry out that strategic review, and they are being looked at as we speak. So I
don't really see anything changing. But of course positive that we're seeing
improvements, particularly in the Swedish business.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. Thanks.

(Operator Instructions) We have a question from Hans Pluijgers from Cheuvreux, please
go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Yes, hello, Hans Pluijgers again. Going back on my question on Norwegian hedge and
swap interest rate. If I calculated right, the increase is relatively big, it's explained almost a
full negative value adjustment in change in discount rates. Is that correct? Or even more
than that, considering Q1, that value adjustment was still a positive for DKK62 million, in
Q2, you have down to DKK50 million positive impact from the discount rate in Denmark.
But the negative impact from the owner-occupied, so you had oﬀers in Denmark and the
majority -- the rest must have come from the Norwegian interest rate. Do I miss something
there?

A - Tor Loennum
Hans, so what we're trying to say, I think, it is on page number 17, in the report. And I
guess that's what you're referring to, so what you're trying to say is where we have a
positive eﬀect of DKK150 million related to the change in discount sales.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes.

A - Tor Loennum
And that means that you have DKK110 million negative mismatch in this quarter
calculated. And yes, one of the main drivers is due to the change in Norwegian interest
rates.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Okay, but at the same time you have the amount of DKK50 million, negative impact also
from the write-down on your head oﬃce.

A - Tor Loennum
No. That hasn't come into the same line.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

They come into -- okay, not into the value adjustments.

A - Tor Loennum
It comes into other ﬁnancial income and expenses.

million[ph].

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Okay, clear.
