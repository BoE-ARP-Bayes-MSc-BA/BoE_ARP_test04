{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thanks, Linda. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Last night, AXIS
reported second quarter net income of $119 million or $1.29 per diluted share, and
operating income of $47 million or $0.51 per diluted share. As noted in our
preannouncement of July 18, this quarter was impacted by 20 catastrophe and weather
events, leading to $104 million of second quarter catastrophe and weather losses.
We ended the quarter with diluted book value per share of $57.62. Growth in diluted book
value per share adjusted for dividends, which we believe is the best measure of value
creation, was up 3% in the quarter and 14% over the last 12 months.
Joe will shortly review the financial results in more detail, but before that, I'd like to put
our quarter's results into context. The insurance industry occasionally experiences
quarters with unusual catastrophe frequency or severity, and this was one of them with
over $19 billion in estimated insured losses.
Our estimated market share of the losses is consistent with our position in the lines and
geographies exposed and meaningfully lower than our average share in prior years.
We're pleased that our actions in recent years positioned our portfolio to better absorb
catastrophe and weather activity and deliver strong book value growth.

FINAL

Importantly, all relevant metrics in our second quarter and year-to-date results
demonstrate clear progress along the various initiatives focused on delivering a
consistent attractive return to shareholders. In addition to a lesser impact from
catastrophes and weather than we would have experienced in the few short years ago,
our accident share loss ratio and combined ratio, excluding the impact of catastrophes
and weather, improved over the quarter and the year-to-date, even as we and the rest of
the industry experienced weaker pricing.
A significant highlight of this quarter was the launch of Harrington Re co-sponsored by
AXIS Capital and Blackstone, with total capital of approximately $600 million and an A.M.
Best rating of A minus. This important development significantly advances our 21st century
approach to capital management, whereby we complement our own balance sheet with a
broad range of third-party capital to deliver enhanced capacity, innovation and tailored
solutions to our clients and brokers. With Harrington Re, AXIS will be able to deliver more
capacity to profitable opportunities, have enhanced capital flexibility and generate an
attractive flow of fee revenue.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our commitment to intelligent capital management was further demonstrated by the
repurchase of $127 million in stock during the quarter. So far this year, we've returned $332
million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, representing
223% of year-to-date operating income. If current conditions hold, we intend to continue
repurchasing stock for the remainder of the year and into the foreseeable future.
We're pleased with our progress along strategic and operational initiatives, and our focus
on continuing the diligent execution of our plans to position AXIS as a leader in specialty
risks, delivering superior value creation to its shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.

Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we generated good
results featuring net income of $119 million and an annualized ROE of 9%. Our operating
income for the quarter was $47 million and annualized operating ROE of 3.6%.
Our net income this quarter benefited from a strong performance from our investment
portfolio, including realized gains, foreign exchange gains, continued favorable prior year
development, a decrease in our ex-cat and weather current accident year loss ratio, and
lower general and administrative expenses. These positive factors were offset by an
elevated level of catastrophe and weather-related losses in the quarter.
Despite the headwinds to net income, book value per share grew 3% in the quarter,
favorably impacted by an increase in unrealized gains on our available-for-sale investment
portfolio, which reflected downward shifts in sovereign yield curves and tightening of
credit spreads, partially offset by strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and
sterling.

FINAL

Before I get into specifics, I'd like to provide some context for premium growth in our
reinsurance segment both in the quarter and year-to-date. First, there were some
significant transactions which I'll explain shortly. The more moderate growth adjusting for
these transactions primarily reflects expansion of our relationships with key customers.
Second, we have increased retrocessions, which are reflected in the ceded premium ratio
of our reinsurance segment increasing in the quarter to 10%. Half of these cessions, which
are third-party capital providers, and that will increase in the second half of the year and
beyond with our new Harrington relationship.
It is our expectation that Harrington will be writing at a net premium-to-capital ratio in the
range of 0.25 to 0.3 to 1 and this will be entirely sourced from AXIS. There will be
increased impacts on our financial results prospectively as our third-party capital activities
ramp up, including a growing stream of fee income.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving into the details of the income statement. Our second quarter gross written
premiums increased by 11% with growth reported by both of our reporting segments. This
number is inflated by multi-year treaties and timing variations. Adjusting for these, gross
premium growth would be 5%.
In the second quarter of 2016, our reinsurance segment top line was up $109 million or
26% compared to the same period in 2015. Treaties written on a multi-year basis primarily
in our liability line of business had a significant impact on our premiums written, with
approximately $37 million of quarterly premium variance attributable to future
underwriting years. A significant professional lines client changed their treaty from an
excess of loss to a quota share structure, which resulted in $30 million of additional
premium.
Timing differences of approximately $19 million also had a favorable impact on our
premium growth this quarter, primarily in our professional lines, where the restructuring of
a large quota share treaty affected the timing of premium recognition. Adjusting for these
items, our gross written premium grew $23 million or 5%, most of which was increased
participations on existing treaties as well as a small amount of growth in our property
catastrophe and liability lines.
Our insurance segment recorded an increase in gross written premiums of $23 million or
3% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2015. Increased premiums
from new business written in our property lines were partially offset by a reduction in our
professional lines due to the recent exit from retail insurance operations in Australia. For
the six-month period, gross written premiums were up 14%. Adjusting for multi-year and
timing differences, we estimated that figure would have been 10%.
Net premiums written increased by 6% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the
same period of 2015. An increase in the reinsurance segment was partially offset by a
slight decrease in the insurance segment. Adjusting for multi-year and timing differences,
volume would be down 4%.

FINAL

Reinsurance net premiums were up 17% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the
same period in 2015, reflecting the increase in gross written premiums in our liability,
professional and catastrophe lines, partially offset by the increase in premiums ceded
principally in the catastrophe and credit and surety lines. Insurance net premiums were
down 1% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015, impacted
by an increase in the premiums ceded following increased reinsurance protection
purchased principally in the professional lines.
Net premiums earned increased by 1% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the
same period of 2015. An increase in the reinsurance segment was partially offset by a
reduction in the insurance segment.
The increase in net premiums earned recorded by our reinsurance segment was largely
driven by growth in business written in our liability, marine and other, and catastrophe lines
in recent periods, partially offset by an increase in reinsurance purchased in our
catastrophe and property lines. The decrease in net premiums earned recorded by our
insurance segment was primarily driven by a reduction in business written in our marine
lines in recent periods, as well as increases in premiums ceded in our professional lines
partially offset by growth in our accident and health lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our second quarter consolidated current accident year loss ratio increased by 6.5 points
to 75% compared to the same period in 2015, driven by a 7.6% increase in the cat loss
ratio. This was driven by an elevated level of catastrophe and weather-related losses.
During the quarter, we incurred $109 million or 11.7 points on our current accident year loss
ratio in catastrophe and weather-related losses net of reinstatement premiums,
compared to $39 million or 4.1 points of such losses in the same period of 2015.
In our preannouncement last week, we reported losses of $104 million for Q2 2016
events, including $41 million for our insurance segment and $63 million for our reinsurance
segment related to events that occurred in the second quarter, including the Fort
McMurray wildfires, the U.S. weather events, Japanese and Ecuadorian earthquakes, and
European floods. In addition for the current quarter, we reported $5 million of losses
attributable to development of first quarter U.S. weather events.
Our ex-cat and weather current accident year loss ratios improved to 63.3% compared to
64.4% in 2015 with decreases in both segments. The insurance segment's current
accident year loss ratio ex-cat and weather improved by 1.3 points to 63.2% compared to
the same period in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in mid-size loss experience in both
our marine and property lines.
Our reinsurance segment current accident year loss ratio ex-cat and weather decreased
by 1% to 63.4% compared to Q2 2015, primarily due to the recognition of better-thanexpected recent attritional loss experience and business mix changes across various lines
of business.

FINAL

Year-to-date our current accident year loss ratio increased by 3.5 points to 69.2%
compared to the same period in 2015, driven by a 4.3 point increase in the cat loss ratio.
We reported $124 million of cat and weather-related losses compared to $47 million in the
same period of 2015.
After adjusting for these events, our current accident year loss ratio improved to 62.4%
compared to 63.2% in 2015. The decrease was due to improvement in mid-size loss
experience in our insurance marine and property lines, together with the recognition of
better-than-expected recent attritional loss experience across various lines of business,
partially offset by the adverse impact of rate and loss trends.
Turning to loss reserves established in prior years, our results continue to benefit from net
favorable loss reserve development, which amounted to $78 million during the second
quarter. Short tail classes in both segments contributed $27 million of this balance. In
addition, our professional insurance and reinsurance reserve classes recorded $15 million,
our motor reserve class contributed $17 million, and our liability reinsurance reserve class
contributed $15 million of net favorable prior year development during the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our year-to-date favorable loss reserve development was $148 million compared to $121
million recognized during this first six months of 2015.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, our acquisition cost ratio increased
modestly by 0.5 and 0.8, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015, driven by
increases in our reinsurance segment. Our reinsurance segment ratio was 25.1%. However,
after adjusting for the impact of loss-sensitive features due to favorable prior year
development reported in the quarter, the ratio would be 23.9% and is comparable to
2015.
It is important to understand trends in our results when it comes to the treatment of prior
year business that includes adjustable sliding scale commissions based upon loss
experience. In the periods that loss experience is favorable, our results will show an
increase in favorable prior year development and the current year acquisition cost ratio.
For Q2 2016, this primarily relates to our professional and motor lines of business.
Decreased acquisition costs in our insurance segment were driven by higher ceding
commissions following the expansion of our reinsurance programs, which were partially
offset by higher commissions in certain lines of business.
Our G&A expense ratio in the second quarter was 15.4% compared to 15.8% in the same
period of 2015. On a year-to-date basis, our G&A expense ratio was 16% compared to
16.9% in the same period of 2015. Removing the effects of some onetime items in both
periods, expenses declined due to lower direct and performance-based compensation.
Overall, we reported underwriting income of $10 million and a combined ratio of 102.2%
for the second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our underwriting income was $109 million
with a combined ratio of 97.2%.

FINAL

Net investment income was $92 million for the quarter, an increase of $43 million from the
previous quarter and is comparable to the second quarter of 2015. The improvement
from the first quarter reflects a return to hedge fund performance to more normal levels.
In aggregate, the total return on our cash and investment portfolio for the quarter was
1.2%, 1.4% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The total return in the current
quarter benefited from a downward shift in the sovereign yield curves and tightening of
credit spreads on investment grade and high yield corporate debt, partially offset by the
decline in the British pound and euro FX rates.
Our net income reflected a large increase in foreign exchange gains, driven by the impact
of the appreciation of the U.S. dollar on our foreign-denominated liabilities, as well as
realized gains on our investment portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

During the quarter, we repurchased an additional $127 million worth of common shares
comprised of $125 million purchased pursuant to our board-authorized share repurchase
program and $2 million relating to shares purchased in connection with the vesting of
restricted stock awards. At July 22, 2016, the remaining authorization under the
repurchase program approved by our board of directors was $500 million.
We continue to make strong progress on the strategic goals and expansion opportunities
with our $100 million investment in Harrington Reinsurance Holdings Limited, the parent of
Harrington Re Limited. As I'm sure you're all aware, a subsidiary of AXIS Capital has been
appointed exclusive liability manager for Harrington Re. This role will involve responsibility
for negotiating and sourcing reinsurance business for recommendation to the
management of Harrington Re.
We noted previously that the impact of third-party capital activities will ramp up through
the balance of the year-end. Commencing with the next quarter, we will provide
disclosure with respect to premiums ceded to Harrington and other capital providers as
well as the fee income generated.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Albert.

Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Joe. Turning to industry conditions, as we look forward, notwithstanding the
high loss quarter we just experienced, we expect market conditions to remain generally
challenging with a localized firming where there is no escaping the need for improvement.
In our insurance business, renewal rates were down 4% on average as compared to down
3% in the earlier quarter. Casualty lines in the U.S. are strongest with positive rate change,
while professional lines are flat to down modestly and property-related lines down the
most.

FINAL

The London market is the most competitive with international property and energy lines
still down double-digits. We're managing our activities accordingly, emphasizing service,
responsiveness in the claims management as our differentiators.
In the reinsurance market, we are encouraged by increasing size of discipline at least in
North America. You'll recall we expected this in the most recent renewals and we have
observed that. Most Florida renewals were completed flat to minus 5% and some
accounts renewed at better terms. Following the June 1 renewals, there was strong
demand for capacity that was generally only provided at higher terms.
In professional and liability lines, cedents and brokers were pushing for better terms in
ceding commissions, but generally faced strong pushback, especially from established
industry leaders. And a number of placements were not completed even at flat ceding
commissions.

Bloomberg Transcript

While we are not expecting across-the-board reinsurance price increases in the
immediate future, we believe we are close to a floor, especially in North America. We
expect Europe to be a bit more competitive and smaller international markets the most
challenging of all, as capacity continues to exceed demand.
Approximately, 10% of AXIS Re's 2015 expiring premium was renewable in July. For us,
volume and price technical ratios were essentially flat with expiring as we managed our
book to protect balance and profitability. Through these renewals, we continued to see an
encouraging contraction of reinsurer panels as cedents position themselves to retain
high-quality capacity to support their strategic positioning and growth. AXIS Re does very
well in that environment as we provide outstanding product expertise, service, capacity
and cooperative claims management.
As Joe noted, much of our reported growth in reinsurance gross premiums written for the
second quarter and year-to-date was related to multi-year deals and timing such that our
growth in estimated gross annual premium was close to 10%. You'll also observe,
however, that we are ceding more of our reinsurance premiums, leading to mid-singledigit growth in net reinsurance premium.
This increase in cessions will accelerate in the second half of the year as we start sharing
some of the risk with Harrington Re. And that will happen through quota shares of
business that we write for ourselves to ensure the right kind of alignment between
ourselves and our capital partners.
Increasing our cessions in both insurance and reinsurance is consistent with our 21st
century capital management philosophy. We intend to respond constructively to our
clients and brokers when terms and conditions make sense, all the while expanding our
risk funding flexibility and matching risk with the best source and form of capital.
We fully intend to leverage our intellectual capital and relationships to do more for our
clients and brokers on the one hand, provide attractive risk return opportunities to
investors across the globe, and enhance our ROE in the process.

FINAL

Our path to leadership in specialty risks rest on a customer-centric front-end
characterized by expertise and responsive service, and efficient operating structure that
delivers decision-enhancing analytics, and multiple sources of risk funding to maximize
capital flexibility and operational leverage. We've made great progress along these three
pillars and we remain committed to executing on this strategy for the benefit of our
clients and brokers, shareholders, and employees.
And with that, let's open the call for questions.

Q&A
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Kai
Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Good morning and thank you. First question, Albert, you mentioned in the past few years,
you have been optimizing the portfolio for lower volatility business and the second
quarter cat is kind of the realized task (25:41) of that strategy. So can you expand a little bit
more on the performance of portfolio versus expectations? Because if the 3.6%
operating ROE is still not ideal, do you see further reduction in the cat volatility?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thanks for that question, Kai. I would separate that question into two, which is how do we
feel about the changes in our cat book volatility, and secondly, what are we doing to
improve our overall ROE. So we'll take a look at this quarter, and this quarter is really –
every event in every quarter is a single data point. And so, of course, you don't want to
generalize just from one quarter.
But if you take a look at where we were in the 2010 to the 2012, 2013 period and you look
at the various cat quarters and the cat events that we had, our average market share of
loss in that period was a little above 1.1%. Our share of loss in this quarter is 0.5%.
If you look at the second quarter of 2013, which was another second quarter with multiple
events, that was a quarter with approximately $12 billion to $13 billion of cat events across
the industry. In that quarter, we reported $140 million of cat losses or 1.1% share of the
reported losses in that quarter. And if you then turn around – and by the way, that was also
about 15 points of cat losses in the second quarter of 2013.
If you look at the 2016 second quarter, this is a quarter where people are estimating $18
billion to $20 billion; we're using a $19 billion number. With that $19 billion, our market
share of loss is not 1.1% like it was in 2013, but 0.5%. The combined ratio impact of those
events was not 15%, but 10.7% and the book value loss was lower. So, I feel good that we
have had significant change in our sensitivity to catastrophe events across the world.

Page 9 of 17

FINAL

Does that mean that we're happy with where the portfolio is now? Of course not. We can
always improve it and we will continue to do so. But I think that in this one event, and
again, it's a single event, we want to see more quarters to demonstrate that. But certainly,
if you look at the second quarter of 2016 compared to what our cat book did in the 2010
to 2013 period, I would say that the exposure is about half of what it was then.
Now with regards to the overall profitability, you're absolutely correct. We are not happy
with the overall ROE. And we will continue to work on our portfolio to improve the
profitability of our portfolio as we go forward and there, I'm very encouraged by what
we're seeing in 2016.
And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our loss ratio is down over 1 point in the
second quarter and six months notwithstanding the fact that over the last 12 months, we
and the industry have experienced, I'm going to say, approximately 1.5 points to 2 points
of adverse rate and trend. So, we're continuing to work on the portfolio and we will
continue to improve on that area.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are continuing to make decisive actions with regard to non-performing portfolios.
You've seen us get out of Australia. You've seen us get out of global excess casualty. We
are continuing to monitor our portfolios to determine if further action might be necessary
in one or the lines of business. We're growing our subscale businesses, we're making
intelligent use of reinsurance and we're optimizing our capital efficiency, and you can
certainly expect us to do more as we go forward.
Finally, a good chunk of that disappointment continues to be with regard to investment
volatility, and what we have done with regard to that is we have shifted our investment
portfolio to what we believe to be lesser volatile investment as we moved away from
hedge funds and moved over to more illiquid long-term assets like private equity, real
estate, debt and so on.
So we have a full slate in front of us. I think the progress to-date is good, but we certainly
are anticipating to continue on that path and deliver not simply satisfactory, but superior
ROEs.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you. That's very comprehensive. Then follow-up on the insurance segment that you
saw a core loss ratio improvement year-on-year for the first quarter – both first quarter
and second quarter, but you can see the second quarter actually – the underlying loss
ratio like higher than the first quarter. I just wonder if that six months' view is probably is a
better indication of the current trends and also, any other opportunity to improve the core
loss ratio in the current pricing environment.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

The reasons for the second quarter over the first quarter is we had more mid-size losses
in the second quarter than the first quarter. So you're always going to have some volatility.

Page 10 of 17



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2016-07-27

But overall, again I feel good about the fact that the loss ratio has come down for the six
months and the second quarter.

FINAL

With regards to ongoing improvements, I'll go back to my earlier answer, we're continuing
to apply analytics to guide our underwriting activities and we expect to continue to see
results from those portfolio improvement activities.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Lastly, on the expense side, are we still on track to achieve the $50 million expense
saving by 2017 and beyond that, any other sort of potential opportunities?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yes, Kai. It's Joe. We're very pleased with the progress that we've made on the expense
side. If you compare our year-to-date expense ratio drop, you can see it's down about
$20 million. So, we're well on our way to achieving the $50 million that we outlined in prior
periods. And frankly, we're taking some additional actions to continue to improve upon
that. So, we're very comfortable with the progress made on the expense side.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thank you so much.

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
Our next question comes from Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital. Please go ahead.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. First question, I guess just a little more clarity on Harrington Re
and how the flow-through it's going to be. I think, Joe, you said they expect to write it
0.25 to 0.3, so that would be a little under $200 million. So, should we think that your
reinsurance book is going to grow by $200 million and then that will be ceded off ? Is that
conceptually how that's going to work?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think you have to separate the front-end from the back-end. I think the front-end will
grow or shrink based on the opportunities available to us. And then, we will turn around
and cede a business to Harrington in the scale that both Joe and you have estimated.
I think whether we grow or not on the reinsurance side, it still makes sense to cede
premium to Harrington Re. We get the opportunity of leveraging our front-end, we get
the opportunity of earning fees and we have the opportunity of establishing multiple
sources of risk funding, which are, I believe, critical to the success of the company going
forward.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td

Okay. And then it'll come out of the reinsurance section then as opposed to your primary
book where you might have a reinsurance program with Harrington Re? Will they be
getting any access to the primary? Or is at all on the reinsurance side?

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Charles, that's a very good question. Predominantly, they will see the bulk of their
business coming in from AXIS Re's book, but Harrington will also be given an opportunity
to participate in our established reinsurance panels. And so, that will also be a source of
revenues to Harrington Re.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Okay. And just a little follow-up, I appreciate the clarity on the share of loss in the back
years versus this, but I guess – and you mentioned you thought your $19 billion loss
estimate was in the middle of the industry estimates. I guess I thought it seemed a bit
high. It seemed that a lot of the competitors that were announcing industry losses were
more in the $14 billion to $16 billion range. And I guess I'm just curious on what your overall
sensitivity of your loss pick is, the $104 million, to that end industry loss as it develops over
time?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Charles, I haven't gone through every report in detail, but my understanding is that many
of the other companies were giving you the total of the cats that they were reporting for.
So their geographic expansion, the business that they're in may have caused them to
include or exclude a cat, whether it's in Ecuador or in Japan or Europe and that, I think, is
the basis for the difference.
We have been, for as long as I recall, a global company. And so we do participate in
Japan. We do participate in Latin America, in Europe, in America, and therefore, we like
the spread that we get as a result of this, but it also means that when there are global
catastrophe events, we will include them in our book.
And so, what you see in the $18 billion to $20 billion that we are telling you is the total for
all of the events that we've named. And we continue to believe that those are reasonable
numbers.
Joe?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Charles, the only thing I'll add to that is that we've taken a very close look at each of these
events. And if for some reason the events deteriorate, in other words the loss estimates
go up, we will not participate on a proportional basis to how others might be affected in
the industry.

Our next question comes from Christopher Campbell of KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Christopher Campbell

{BIO 20262752 <GO>}

Hi, good morning and congrats on a great quarter.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you.

Q - Christopher Campbell

{BIO 20262752 <GO>}

Okay. My first question is just with Harrington now in the market, is this going to change
AXIS' reinsurance underwriting appetite?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

No, it's exactly the same underwriting appetite. And I think a clear feature of Harrington
for us is we only share business with Harrington that we are writing and retaining the
majority of that business. So if it's not good for us, it's not good for Harrington. And if it's
good for us, we believe it'll be good for Harrington.
So, we will continue to size our portfolio appropriately. We will continue to underwrite with
the underwriting discipline that is core to our strategy. But we also do recognize that
today, we have the equivalent of $600 million of extra capacity. So where the risks are
appropriate, we will be happy to take a larger share knowing that Harrington will share in
that.

Q - Christopher Campbell

{BIO 20262752 <GO>}

Okay. So you have $600 million funded currently, will you continue additional fundraising in
that vehicle? And then, how should we think about the premiums written to fee income
for modeling?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Right. I think that we are – part of our strategy is to expand our sources of third-party
capital. So we may, certainly, at some point in the future, do a second round for
Harrington. We may look for other sources of capital for different risks than those that are
currently targeted by Harrington.

And as Joe mentioned earlier, in our third quarter supplement, we will introduce
information with regards to managed premium. You'll see exactly how much we write
gross and net, and we will also disclose on that sheet the fees that we are collecting as
part of our third-party capital initiative.

FINAL

Q - Christopher Campbell

{BIO 20262752 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful. And just two more minor questions. Just a little
surprised by the reinsurance property cat and the insurance commercial property growth.
Can you give a little bit more details behind those opportunities and what you're seeing?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

My understanding is they're both up on a gross basis and both down on a net basis. And
what we're doing is optimizing the net portfolio, of course.

Q - Christopher Campbell

{BIO 20262752 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect. That makes sense. Then just the final question is with the more competitive
pricing environment and reserve releases were up about 140 bps year-over-year. So just
for the more significant lines driving that, what accident years are those releases coming
from?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

On the reinsurance side, the releases are coming from virtually all accident years, with the
exception of 2015. We had some development on a property loss there. And for the most
part on the insurance side, it's the same story. We had one or two earlier accident years in
which there were adverse development, but it relates to an unusual transaction. It has
nothing to do with actual development. So for the most part, favorable development is
coming from all accident years in both sides.

Q - Christopher Campbell

{BIO 20262752 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks for all the answers and good luck in 3Q.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Good morning.

FINAL

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

I want to follow up a little bit on the prop cat I guess gross growth but net declines. Just
want to understand the strategy there and maybe what kind of retro purchases you're
buying there and just trying to get a little further understanding of that strategy.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think the strategy on the cat reinsurance business is again a combination of not gross
and retro, but gross, retro and third-party capital. So part of our premiums are not simply
shared in the retro market, but through third-party capital. As you know, there is appetite
in the investment community for catastrophe risk and we shared with them also.
I go back to the point that I made earlier, which is that it's important for us to make sure
that we are responsive to attractive opportunities in the market. The front-end really
needs to be about serving our clients and brokers and making sense, and writing business
when it makes sense. And then secondly, on the back-end having diversified sources of
risk funding.

Bloomberg Transcript

And so, we are certainly going to continue to look for opportunities to serve our clients
and brokers on the front-end. But in many cases, we don't expect that that will result in a
net increase because we will be sharing those risks with capital partners.
Joe, you want to add to that?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yes. Ryan, just to comment on the insurance property growth, which was about 7% in the
quarter, it's really due to three reasons. One, as you know, we participated into some
facilities as of the first of the year. Those two broker portfolios have a property element
to them.
Secondly, in renewable energy, we actually rewrote a major account, which gave the
impression of creating more growth and maybe we actually did. And then third, on the
Lloyd's side, we're actually seeing – with our new Lloyd's capability, we're actually seeing a
lot more smaller accounts which are helping to diversify our portfolio.
And then on the ceded side, we've actually changed our reinsurance program to the point
where we're now excess of $5 million as opposed to excess of $10 million as we've been
in the past. So, there's been some growth, but as Albert pointed out, we're ceding net
back out on the reinsurance side. So, I hope that helps.

Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td

Okay. Yeah. No, it does. And then, we could be just moving back to Harrington as well.
How long should that take to get it to scale, again, of that 0.25 or 0.3 to 1? Could that be
done in the next 12 months? I imagine it could be possible.

FINAL

And then secondly, I just also wanted to just understand what their kind of prop cat kind of
PML tolerance would be?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

One of the values of creating a company like Harrington is that, in fact, you can ramp up
the volume immediately simply by sizing the quota share that we have with them. And
you're absolutely correct that we expect Harrington to reach their premium to capital
leverage in the first year and we will grow that as they grow their capital.
The second question related to their PML appetite, and Harrington is substantially focused
on mid- to long-tail lines. And that is – the cat book is not a large part of that book. It will
have some small cat exposure for diversification purposes, but Harrington needs to be
considered really as a mid- to long-tail line reinsurer.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Great. And then, Joe, just one quick little nitpick (43:17) one. Corporate expenses
kind of – they're running mid-$20 million. They bumped up a little above $30 million this
quarter. Was that something to do with Harrington ramp-up or just other onetimers?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

It's actually more due to reallocation between our segments in corporate. The total
expenses really have gone down as I mentioned before, but we decided to keep certain
expenses at a corporate level as opposed to allocate them to the businesses. So, if you
look at the business expense line, it's actually down, offset by the increase on the
corporate expenses.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Sure. But that relationship should continue though. So I guess a little bit more into
corporate then a little bit locked into (43:56) the segments?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yeah. I think the run rate you're seeing for corporate expenses should hold.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Okay. Great. No, thanks for that.

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yeah.
