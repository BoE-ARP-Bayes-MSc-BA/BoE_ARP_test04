Presentation
Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this conference call on Sampo Group's January-June
2019 Results. I'm Jarmo Salonen, Head of Investor Relations at Sampo. And with me, here
in the studio, I have Kari Stadigh, our Group CEO and President; Knut Arne Alsaker, our
Group CFO, and Morten Thorsrud, CEO for If P&C. As always, we'll start with Kari's
presentation, where he will highlight the most important things in the ﬁrst six months of
this year. But before handing over to Kari, let me just remind you that you can follow this
transmission live at sampo.com/result and a recorded version of the call will later be
available at that same address.
And that's all for me. Now I hand over to Kari. Kari, please.

Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thank you, Jarmo. Good afternoon, and welcome to the conference call on my behalf as
well. Sampo Group reported a proﬁt before tax for the second quarter of EUR506 million.
This is lower than the Q2 last year. But we should remember that the second quarter of
2018 beneﬁted from a recorded proﬁt related to Mandatum's deal with Danske of EUR197

million, as well as one-oﬀ gains in Nordea from divestment of shares in UC and sale of
their life and pension business in Denmark, which combined added EUR74 million to last
year's second quarter proﬁt in Sampo.
So adjusted for these three one-oﬀs, our Q2 proﬁt improved actually by EUR69 million or
16%. The insurance business in Sampo is performing excellently. If had a Q2 combined
ratio of 83% and the ﬁrst half year combined ratio of 84.7%, an improvement of 2.1
percentage points and 1.1 percentage points respectively. And both were best ever
combined ratios. Growth in If is also really, really strong with a growth rate of 4.3% in local
currencies in the ﬁrst half year compared to last year, even though new car sales slowed
down in the beginning of this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

All business areas as well as number of clients in all countries grew. The strong investment
results for the ﬁrst two months -- actually ﬁrst two quarters contributed to giving If their
best ever operating proﬁt for the ﬁrst six months of the year. Anecdotally, in their own
reporting currency, Swedish krona. Topdanmark also improved their underwriting result
and reported combined ratios according to our reporting principles below 80 percentage
points for both Q2 and the ﬁrst half year. Another clear sign of the great P&C operation,
which the management of Topdanmark is running. The life business in Topdanmark
performed also very well and doubled its proﬁt for the ﬁrst half-year compared to 2018.
P&C business is today already more than 60% of Sampo and insurance altogether,
roughly 75%. We are apparently back to our origins. So we are really an Insurance Group.
P&C Insurance is an excellent business. We continue to have world-class underwriting.
Our cost ratios are extremely competitive. If's online oﬀerings are now advanced
compared to market as well as winning rewards.
All of this contributes to strong growth and very strong proﬁtability. And with investment
yields that will be lower for longer, the attractiveness of Sampos' high underwriting
proﬁtability has increased even further. Mandatum's unit linked reserves were at -- an alltime high by the end of Q2. The Company's own sales force continues to perform well
and towards the end of Q2, we could see some signs that sales from our distribution
partner, Danske was peaking up.
I am optimistic, when it comes to Mandatum's continued growth going forward as well.
When looking at Nordea, I want to divide the approach into two diﬀerent parts. As a
client, I'm happy. I'm a client of four -- ﬁve banks. But I'm really happy with Nordea's
oﬀering and competitiveness compared to them. No need for me to change. From an
owner's view that picture is diﬀerent. Nordea did not surprise positively in Q2. Although
the development in the last quarter was not very diﬀerent from what I expected.
The most important news from Nordea was that they are now working on setting new
targets. We as a shareholder appreciate that Nordea now calls a spade a spade. The
environment around Nordea has changed compared to when the previous targets were
set. The bank has changed, the Board has changed, the Chairman has changed, There is
a new CEO on the way in. This is the right time to set new targets, new ambitious targets
based on a detailed business plan. There are no targets without a business plan. Nordea

FINAL

needs to improve both revenue and cost and it is our view as a shareholder, that the cost
targets in particular should be more ambitious than the ones Nordea is now
communicating. It is essential for Nordea to operate on a clearly lower cost-to-income
ratio in their retail business. As well as it's clearly important for them to meet higher ROE
targets in their wholesale and commercial banking divisions.
When it comes to Nordea's dividend, let's see how the communication will look when
released but I am conﬁdent that cash ﬂows from Nordea will continue to be a signiﬁcant
part of the buildup of Sampo's own dividend, which brings me to my last point, Sampo's
dividend. I have just told you that Sampo's P&C operations have record years. This means
that I expect dividends from this part of our business to be record high as well.
We are also about to generate excess capital by changing the calculation basis for our
solvency. So even if we would receive less dividend in the short term from Nordea, there
is absolutely no need for Sampo to change the existing guidance of moderately growing
dividend payouts. This is no news to many of you. Sampo continues to deliver a high
dividend yield as one could expect from a dividend stock.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Youdish
Chicooree from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone. I've got two questions please. The ﬁrst one is on your
combined ratio guidance, which has improved two percentage points relative to the ﬁrst
half of 2018. Roughly speaking, how much of the improvement would you attribute to
better weather compared to last year and how much would you say is more structural in
nature and sustainable going forward? That's my ﬁrst question.
And the second question is on the dividend, you just gave us two sources of potentially
higher dividends, should Nordea review their dividend policy, namely higher dividends
from P&C and your excess capital? I was wondering, if there are other speciﬁc actions you
could take to oﬀset the impact of a lower dividend from Nordea. Here, I'm speciﬁcally
thinking of the EUR700 million in liquidity buﬀers, you have at the HoldCo. Do you have
any other plans, speciﬁc plans for those buﬀers? Or could these be used to actually make
up for a shortfall from Nordea? Thank you.

FINAL

Okay, Morten Thorsrud, here. I will answer your ﬁrst question about the combined ratio
guidance from If. It's correct, we have improved the guidance and are giving a guidance
of 84% to 86% in combined ratio for the full year, which is, I think the best guidance we
ever given. I would say that the major part of this is attributable to -- to more structural
improvements. Weather is on a Nordic scale, not having that big impact. It might impact
more on individual countries. So it's more the underlying improvement that we see in the
business that is causing the improved combined ratio guidance.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On the dividend, I , of course, our toolbox includes many other instruments as well. One
obvious one is to issue hybrids in the subsidiaries and upstream more capital. But also
you ask about how to deploy the cash in the -- or the funds in the parent. We -- let's see
what kind of investment objects we ﬁnd. But I think as you remember, we deployed EUR1
billion last year and on the existing investments, we have actually mainly good news
because Saxo which was roughly a quarter of the investment, they announced that they
are successful with their EUR400 billion bid on BinckBank.
And therefore, we are going to maintain our shareholding and the bid will be ﬁnanced
with equity and debt. So we will inject EUR20 million more into the big project. And even
if the trading platform market as such has not been very benign. The fact that they can
acquire Binck is really positive because they get signiﬁcant amount of new assets under
management and it's also a synergy and a cost savings play. So good news on Saxo in
that sense.
And of course you all saw the announcement on Nets yesterday, where they sell their
corporate business to MasterCard, and I'm here only referring to public information that
they will receive roughly half, of what they paid for Nets, when -- and they sell a business
which is roughly a third of their volume. So if a private equity group, so early after the
investment exit something, I interpret it as very good news. Interim of course, they have
solved mainly -- their funding issue and reported good numbers. And you could see in
Nordax, the proﬁt share -- positive proﬁt share.
So good news on the parent company investments and if there are new investments that
we ﬁnd we are, of course, going to deploy more capital from the parent as well.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. But it sounds like in the near term, you don't have -- you're not
committing to spending materially more from what you already have. So that still leaves
you with signiﬁcant ﬂexibility at the parent company.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Page 4 of 21



Company Name: Sampo Oyj

Date: 2019-08-07

I think that the ﬂexibility is always good to be there. We -- if you look at historically how we
have created shareholder value, it has been by being contrarian. And in these volatile
times, it's good to be well capitalized than have buﬀers to do things that create
shareholder value. Knut Arne, do you want to add something?

FINAL

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Just a small addition in terms of the liquidity and ﬂexibility in Sampo plc, the holding
company, the current liquidity buﬀer, Youdish, which you referred to will increase even
further later this year, when one of the assets AT1 SEM [ph] in Nordea is maturing, which
will bring that liquidity buﬀer to slightly above EUR800 million, everything else equal. So
liquidity is not a big concern in terms of our internal cash ﬂows.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thank you for the clariﬁcation. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank.
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Two questions, please. Firstly, a more general question on the interest
rate outlook. Now, we've seen a fairly dramatic deterioration of the interest rate outlook,
bond yields falling quite a lot. How much of an impact for earnings will this have, in your
opinion? And what are the main tools to mitigate potential negative impact of this? And
more speciﬁcally, if you look at Mandatum Life, the solvency margin excluding the
transition rules was below 120. If ATI [ph] is at these levels, is there a risk that you cannot
take the kind of normal EUR150 million that you've previously taken in dividends from
Mandatum Life? Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Well, I think that the interest rate development has been especially dramatic in the last
few months. So it has partly taken us by surprise that the decrease is so rapid. And
therefore, of course, we have to see what kind of measures we have to mitigate that
development. It will not be one issue that has to be done, we have to look through our
whole operations, we have to become more cost eﬃcient, we have to look at the terms of
our products and pricing. So, it's a combination of many things. On the investment side,
we have to see how this plays out.
Now, it's very unclear. I don't personally believe that the quantitative easing will work the
way the central banks want unless they ﬁnd a way to force banks to have negative deposit
interest rates. Otherwise, the consumers are not going to consume and invest the way the
bank hopes and we will not see the inﬂationary targets. But it's too early to say as the
development has been so recent. I don't know, Knut Arne, if you want to add something?

FINAL

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Mandatum solvency, Matti as you referred to is the -- part of our business which has been
most impacted and most sensitive to the current yields. And we have activities ongoing to
try to strengthen further the solvency ratio of Mandatum. Obviously, the sort of high rate
guarantees are running oﬀ fast, and has been doing so over a period of time. And we
work proactively to reduce that even further. Also, to look at other measures to reduce the
risks and increase the solvency ratios somewhat to secure the dividend capacity of a really
well performing business currently in the ﬁrst half of the year.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

So we shouldn't expect any changes from the kind of normal streams?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think, it's too early to say but as we look at it today, we see no reason for that, but let's
see how this interest -- how the interest rates really play out and where they ﬁnally settle.
Also the hybrids are one of the things we have in our toolbox because, of course, if you
issue hybrids in this environment, their interest rates are much lower than we earlier
thought. So it becomes pretty attractive.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Denham from Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Just thinking about excess capital in
If, what proportion of If's proﬁt is from business which requires a credit rating? Is it all of
the industrial business? And then I know you can't speculate too much on Nordea.
However, if they move to a policy of dividends and buybacks, would you participate in any
buybacks even if it meant realizing losses? Presumably, you'd be forced to participate, or
at least dividend out additional Nordea shares to keep your ownership below 20% and
the capital requirement down? Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think that if Nordea would start to do buybacks, we would sell out pro rata. But as we
today see a signiﬁcant upside in Nordea, we wouldn't like to sell and therefore, I don't
think we are too positive on buybacks at this moment in Nordea. But the proposal has to
come to the owners from Nordea and we haven't seen any proposal of that nature so far.

In terms of If dividend, I don't see the rating to be restrictive on the dividend capacity of If
in 2019 versus what the owner would like If to upstream. There's ﬂexibility (Technical
Diﬃculty) absolute lower boundary. On the part of the rating sensitive business, Morten.

FINAL

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Yes, it's clearly in business -- or industrial that is, of course, an issue. And it doesn't go for
all of the industrial clients. But clearly, kind of the larger ones in particular, the clients
having captives are concerned about rating of an insurance company.

Q - Jonathan Denham

Cheuvreux. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Christoﬀer Adams

{BIO 15217428 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good afternoon. Two questions from me please. Firstly, the currency adjusted premium
growth in If was a healthy 4.3% in the ﬁrst half. Could you please break that down by price
changes and the change in number of policies? And secondly, you report staﬀ costs up
6% in If, what's driving this and how should we expect these ﬁgures to develop going
forward? Thank you.

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Yes, on your ﬁrst question on growth, I would split it roughly 50-50. And we have a clear
growth in number of customers in basically all business areas and regions. And then we
do have price increases that are somewhat above expected inﬂation going forward. So
I've expected roughly 50-50 between those two eﬀects. And the staﬀ cost is going up
due to in sourcing. In particularly in Sweden and Norway, we have in-sourced some of the
external distribution capacity that we had. So that has gone over from being kind of other
cost to being staﬀ cost. And then we also in-source some IT functions, where we have
used consultants previously. So I would not expect the staﬀ cost to continue to increase
like that. This is more kind of one-oﬀs driving the cost increase on staﬀ cost this time.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

And on total cost, you are as committed as ever.

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

On total cost, we are still committed on continuing and reducing the cost ratio going
forward. And as you see the report, 21.7% year-to-date compared to 21.8% last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

On the Nets disposal. Is it too early to assess what they might do with those proceeds. But
I guess, just looking at the proceeds as a proportion of your stake, it would be, I think
more than EUR100 million coming back to you, if they decide to distribute. So I just
wonder, if there is any indication from Nets, what they might do with the disposal
proceeds. And secondly, with regards to the P&C business, is there with a very low
interest rate and low inﬂation environment ? Is there an argument for excess levels of
reserves in the Company given the reserve to premium ratio is high particularly versus
some of the peer group. Just wondering, again, if that's possibly a source of additional
income as we go through the next few years ? And ﬁnally, I had to ask this, Kari, but what
would it take for you to cut your dividend, some aspects of consensus are looking for a
50% [ph] dividend cut at Nordea and that would leave you a shortfall that I think will be
more diﬃcult to plug, and of course, the market will not really give you credit if you're
paying your dividend out of additional debt, for example. So I just wonder, if you've got
any further thoughts that you can share on that particular aspect.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

So if we -- net disposals, we have no -- Nets disposals. We have no information. It's a
signiﬁcant number because with this deal, they get back 50% of their purchase price. But I
don't want to speculate how they will treat it. We are happy to receive it. But if they don't
Page 8 of 21



Company Name: Sampo Oyj

Date: 2019-08-07

give it back to us then they have found something fantastic to deploy it with and we
wouldn't mind that either. So we are neutral on that.

FINAL

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

On the reserving side on the P&C business. As you know, we are always having a reserve
level that we assume to be appropriate. And it's of course estimated every month. We do
have a run-oﬀ proﬁt which is historically on a fairly high level these days, and I think, we
already communicated that is mostly driven by benign development on bodily injury
claims in motor insurance in Sweden, where we see less bodily injury cases developing.
Then, of course, we do not speculate in sort of whether this will be continue. It kind of
depends on whether we see the trends continuing.
When you try to compare reserve ratios if versus competitors, you need to bear in mind
that there is quite a diﬀerent business mix between the diﬀerent competitors. If in
particular have a large exposure to Swedish motor that is extremely long tailed and but
therefore naturally have a higher reserve ratios than many other kind of peers in the
Nordics.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

On the dividend speculation, I don't really want to speculate on this. Let's see what
Nordea communicates. I'm absolutely sure that we will continue with our guidance and
moderately increase our dividend. So I see no reason to change that view. If we take a
longer view, I think that -- at the expectation is still that even if there would be a dividend
cut, it would be a dividend cut, which forms a new ﬂoor and then it would start to climb
up again. So then it would be a question how to bridge it. So I'm not worried on this part
and the liquidity is there. So we will continue moderately to increase our dividend, that is
what we will propose to the Board.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

And you would do that, Kari, even if the dividend was uncovered from ongoing cash ﬂows
?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Temporarily, I could do it because the world is such that if it's for one year or two years, so
I wouldn't mind if I am conﬁdent that I'm back on track after that period. Yes.

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

FINAL

Fantastic, thank you so much. And back to dividends. So two on the dividend and one on
the combined ratio if I may. And on the dividend, so you said, high dividend from If or I
think highest or whatever. But ﬁgure I have in 2016, they paid up an EUR179 million [ph],
which includes a one-oﬀ. And I'm just wondering, whether your kind of statement or views
is relative to that say high ﬁgures, it relative to the more normal kind of recurring dividend,
to me [ph].
And second is similar question for Mandatum, so Mandatum's two years has had what I
perceive or maybe I am wrong here, a kind of EUR150 million a year, positive adjustment
probably related to the Danske deal. And I just wondered if you would see that as a kind
of semi recurring. You alluded to the reducing reserves. Any help on this would be very,
very gratefully received.
And then ﬁnally, just going back to that amazing combined ratio. And here, I know you
don't like giving anything looking forward, but you kind of alluded to low interest rates, it
means you have to focus more on the combined ratio and things. Where do you see 83%
or even 84.6%? It's just an amazing number. Is there any kind of limit to this on the way, in
terms of how much you can improve? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

There is very little, I can add actually to the dividend discussion. I just repeat that we are
committed to the moderate increase so our dividend and we have to see how, what we
upstream from which entity and how much. So let's come back to that when we get more
clarity on the Nordea plan because it will aﬀect our internal upstreaming and the issue
also that if we issue hybrids, what will that have an -- as an eﬀect.
We are strongly reserved in If and then we of course will receive dividends from
Topdanmark as well. Mandatum, whether 150 is the right number. Also there, I would not
this time of the year, go out and speculate. Is it that -- exactly that number or other. But
the total sum of all these dividend streams give and take the scale or the magnitude, I feel
comfortable with my statement.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

On your question on the combined ratio, of course over many years now, we have been
adjusting the combined ratio target of If to reﬂect a low interest rate environment. So that
is what is pushing down the combined ratio requirement for If as well as the P&C industry
in general. But of course there is a trade-oﬀ there. And there is always a trade-oﬀ between
proﬁtability and growth. So of course we have -- we're trying to make a good assessment
of that when we put up our actual targets for the diﬀerent business areas, diﬀerent
products, diﬀerent markets.

Page 10 of 21



Company Name: Sampo Oyj

So it's -- it will be at the end of the day a trade-oﬀ between the combined ratio and also
the competition kind of where you want to see also growth in the market.

FINAL

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

May I just ask a follow on just on this trade-oﬀ point. So growth, 4%, of which say 2% or
2.5% is volume and this amazing combined ratio improvement of somewhere around 1%
or 2%, depending how you look at it. If you were -- if you look at this trade oﬀ
environment, which way you incline to move or you've been saying well, would you be
more inclined to say we'll actually, Saxo's [ph] excellent combined ratios more growth
would be welcome or would you rather say, well actually, I would like to grow more and -sorry, improve the combined ratio more. So just to get a feel. I think, you have the
amazing ﬂexibility to do what you like, but -- I see, any kind of view would be helpful.
Thank you.

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

I don't think I will answer that directly, but I think of course we are extremely happy about
the growth that we see, 4.3% ﬁrst six months, 4.8% in Q2 standalone. And in particular,
sort of, if you also bear in mind that car sales in the Nordics have been rather low so far
this year. It kind of makes the growth numbers even more impressive and it's purely
organic- driven. So -- but I will not speculate sort of on the exact sort of -- exact trade-oﬀ
there. It's something that we do sort of on the more granular basis kind of down on the
product and segment sort of per country basis.

ahead, your line is now open.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. Couple of questions from my side. First of all, a technical accounting
question on your distribution of Nordea shares, those shares booked at EUR8.24 currently,
I assume you're distributing them at market price to the shareholders that must imply an
accounting loss of some EUR140 million, EUR150 million. How should we expect that to
show up in the Q3 report on equity or somewhere in the P&L. My second question is on
the solvency, you addressing that you'd be willing to increase levers [ph] in the holding
company. Any views on -- after the Nordea transaction solvency of 170? How far you would
accept that one to go? You have any lower limit on the new way you are calculating it or
how do you see the solvency ratio worst case developing going forward?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Good afternoon, Per, on your ﬁrst question, the number you have is of course correctly
calculating, that will show up in the Q3 P&L, so not booked directly to equity, but in the
Page 11 of 21

P&L. And on the solvency, the 170, we don't have a policy with a -- with a limit stated. You
saw us take action with the current solvency situation, where, when we were approaching
140 in solvency ratio. And I think you could consider around that level to be what we
would consider to be a minimum on a running basis.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Some couple of questions from my side as well. I just wanted to check
the -- on the premium growth in the If side. Could you -- what are your expectations going
forward versus product and geographically growth in customers. Is it so that this transition
in ongoing trend, which you have seen for last -- some couple of quarters and you expect
it to continue or how should we elaborate then on that? That's my ﬁrst one.

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Yeah, of course, we try to avoid speculating too much about the future. And, but we've
seen a good growth rate now in If over the last few quarters. Part of this is driven by
improved retention in most business areas and that's -- that is something that is not
turning around totally overnight, at least. We expect that to give us some support also
going forward.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

So that the competition has increased or decreased in that sense?

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

'I think on a Nordic total scale, it's -- not very changed. Total in the Nordics, it's very much
the same players.

Isn't it Morten also saw that -- that we saw this excellent growth, especially in our biggest
market in Sweden. Despite the fact that car sales were down and wasn't it so that the cut
date for the -- very good cut -- car sales was the tax issue in Sweden.

FINAL

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Yeah, I guess, most of you remember that there was this quite a special year last year. Tax
change in Sweden as of 1st of July, which means that there was a record high number of
new cars being sold up until that date. And then the second half of last year was, of
course, much more modest. And of course that's also going to give us some support now
in Q3 and Q4, where we expect more normal sales levels to the car sales in Sweden and
comparing them to quite weak Q3 and Q4 last year.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. On the combined ratio improvement. Could you shed some more light into where
the improvement has come from product sides and geographies?

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We see an improvement basically in all business areas. If you look at sort of somehow and
the underlying trend. As you see, kind of we report 2.1% improvement, Q2 this year versus
Q2 last year. 1.1% improvement for the ﬁrst six months compared to last year. I think, all of
you know, that sort of there were quite some price actions in the commercial segment in
quite many countries. So, of course, we do see then some improvement there. And then
also in motor. We do see improvement in Norway and Finland.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Yeah the -- especially Finland was very good. Is that something that you were going to see
-- expect continue going forward. That is this decrease, which was quite heavily for some
years, is the one behind us.

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

I think, Jan, to understand the Finnish development, you need to remember that quite big
changes that was done to the Motor TPL bonus systems in Finland, and that was reducing
Motor TPL premiums quite a lot going back in time and of course that has now kind of
been fully earned into the premiums. So now, we expect a more normal sort of
development going forward.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Just two more on the Life side. We have seen an investment result of
some 60-plus over the last two quarters. Is this how that you should expect to coming
down to well around 40-plus-ish or is that 60 of the non -- now new recurring level? And
ﬁnally, on the capital side, how much capital can you really release from your old back
book is now running oﬀ?

A - Kari Stadigh

I think that the -- what the quarterly results will be for If -- for Mandatum, you have to wait
and see. So that will, that is of course always dependent on the capital market
development. On how much the old book decrease is.

FINAL

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

The EUR200 million is roughly, it depends a little bit on what kind of reserves, but roughly
EUR50 million in capital and release.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

In a quarter or in a year?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

For full year. So it's -- EUR200 million in a year is roughly EUR50 million.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

It doesn't matter sort of which time period it's run down but EUR200 million lower
windfall -- reserves is roughly EUR50 million per year, and EUR50 million capital.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Yes, in fact, so EUR50 million on capital potential release oﬀ of those EUR200 million
reduction in sort of underlying reserves

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Yeah, and it -- of course that EUR50 million will change if the -- if it's run down at a quicker
pace during the year, and it will be a little bit more, it can be big.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Per, just I'm sitting, thinking myself on your question, where it will show in the P&L, this
accounting loss of 140, it is a part of the share of associate proﬁt and loss, but I think we
Page 14 of 21



Company Name: Sampo Oyj

will decide to actually specify it explicitly this time in the proﬁt and loss. Just to have a
continuity going forward. The comparison for the back -- for the back on that particular
associated proﬁt and loss line for your model. So I correct myself, that we will -- it is a part
of that -- part of the P&L, but we will make that an explicit item in the Q3 report.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sami Taipalus from Goldman Sachs.
Please go ahead, your line is now open.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Yeah, good afternoon, everyone. Just a couple of quick ones actually. First one is a bit of a
follow-up on the last question on Mandatum Life, you say EUR50 million or EUR200
million per year from the run-oﬀ of the back book, could you say a little bit, you talked a
little bit about new business at the start of the call.

Bloomberg Transcript

Could you give us a little bit of a sort of indication of what sort of level of capital
generation you'd expect from new business value in Mandatum Life. And also I
appreciate, obviously, the actual investment result is going to be volatile of that business,
but what would sort of a sensible number be to think about in terms of a -- sort of plan or
budget investment income contribution to capital generation. That's question number
one.
And number two, you're talking a bit about debt issuance. Can you just remind us what
the upper limit for debt issuance? What you see is the upper limit for debt issuance within
the Group. Are you thinking about debt leverage ratios or interest cover, or how far, could
you go on this? Thanks.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

The actual investment result going forward that you can see our investment mix, how
much equity risk, how much ﬁxed income, we have. You can see our running yield. So
unfortunately, you have to ﬁgure out that yourself because I have no clue where the
markets will go. So your guess is as good as mine.
On the Mandatum back book. Yes, it runs oﬀ with EUR200 million plus per year and
releases this EUR50 million on the new business, it doesn't really tie up that much capital
because as you know, we are -- we have changed the Company to do more fee-based
business. And especially, the main products that it sells now are alternative asset
management products. And as it say -- when you go into private equity or infrastructure
and such and you sell it to your customers. What you really do is you sell it on a
commitment basis.
So actually, I don't know if we have published the commitment-based numbers, but we
are talking of premiums. But we can see that the committed capital is increasing faster
than our booked sales. So we are building a buﬀer on top of the premium sales that we
have today, because we are selling at alternative asset products. However, it's, there is an
Page 15 of 21

Date: 2019-08-07

FINAL

additional good news here and that is that when you sell commitments, clients start to pay
fees on the commitments even before it comes into premiums.
So that's I think important to realize. Then when we look at the Danske deal, even if they
are small numbers, we must remember that part of the business, that's risk products that's
mainly loan insurance to mortgages. And there the topline is extremely small, but it's so
high ROE business, and that is also picking up and that you will then see in an improved
risk ratio going forward. On debt issuance...

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Sorry, just to follow-up on that brieﬂy, I mean my question wasn't so much about how
much it's of a burden to the SCR, it was more about the amount of own funds it generates.
Is it possible to -- I mean, I appreciate you might not want to give the exact numbers here,
but is it possible to say anything about the order of magnitude of this capital generation?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, I think that you -- then you should look at our fee income and that you can see in our
expense ratio, risk ratio and you can start to analyze that, how much could we improve our
risk ratio on an annual basis and there, I think we have room of improvement. On our
expense ratio, we have clearly stated that the new deal that we have done with Danske is
not as favorable as the old one. And therefore, we got the EUR197 million compensation
last year and therefore, we have seen a drop in the expense ratio and now it should then
start to improve, once the fee income grow slowly. So this is -- these are the parameters
you have to work around.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

But I guess, these -- some of your policies, so it's quite diﬃcult to get to those numbers
from your P&L disclosures. Are we talking single-digit million, low double-digit million? Is
it possible to give any sort of steer...

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think on one part, we are talking single-digit and on the other part probably low doubledigit numbers, but not signiﬁcant numbers on an annual basis. Yet, but it's so high ROE
business. Now, I'm talking of the improvement from the present levels.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

We're actually just -- we're looking into how to optimize even a contract wording to
optimize also the capital generation and own funds generation, which you are referring
to. So let's revert to that a little bit later when we have gone through this possible positive
eﬀect on the Mandatum's own fund, which you bring up an important point.

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

On the debt issuance.

FINAL

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Debt issuance, the theoretical, sort of course it's 50% of SCR, 20% of in terms of Tier 1 on
the own funds. And in a sort of new world, where after we have changed the calculation
basis of -- on Nordea that would mean a theoretical capacity of more than EUR2.5 billion,
little bit more than EUR2.5 billion, which is ﬁve times what the Sampo plc has, and then
the Group has a few hundred millions more in If. So it's to the tune of an additional EUR2
billion theoretically, of course, that's not the realistic issuance capacity, but we certainly
could use parts of that, but at the same time also probably look at the scene here that if
were to issue more that we have to try to not signiﬁcantly increase the leverage ratio from
here.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Sorry, just a follow-up on that. I didn't quite understand your comments there about
theoretical versus realistic. Are you saying that you could actually issue that much or are
you saying that that's theoretical capacity, but you would never quite issue that much ?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Theoretic capacity in terms of Solvency II, I don't think we have plans to issue 50% of our
SCR in hybrid capital.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

But how much would you be comfortable with actually issuing it? I mean in terms of total
debts, both senior and hybrid combined from current levels.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

I think we're fairly comfortable with the level we currently have.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Yeah. So you wouldn't want to go much further than we currently have?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Not much further, but of course we could over time change the composition of that debt,
with the majority of the debt we have issued is not hybrid capital and not accounted
towards our solvency capital and excess capital base. That was my link to only sort of shy
of EUR1 billion in the Group and then EUR4 billion in senior or EUR3.5 billion in senior.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Perfect. Thanks very much.

Merrill Lynch, please go ahead, your line is now open.

FINAL

Q - Blair Stewart

Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on the comment you made earlier, Kari, about this
being a good time or an appropriate time for Nordea to undertake a review of its targets,
et cetera. And I know that's a call for Nordea but you know do have the chair at Nordea.
So I think it's fair game to ask. I'm just not clear, why if there's a good time, the actual
timing ahead of a new CEO joining seems rather strange to me from the outside. A new
CEO is going to inherit a set of targets, you might want to say is on target. I just wonder, if
you could be able to comment on that at all.

A - Kari Stadigh

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think that if we look at how Torbjorn as the new Chairman, works. He is planning things
really carefully. So I think that all new targets would be such that he would have them well
aligned with the management, the present and the future management and I think this is
a very good time to do it because they have announced that they will change the CEO.
There is a new CEO on the way in. And because of the recent development, we have seen
on interest rates and because of the modest development on their results. So they need
to -- and because all the targets that they are going to present, they must be based on the
new business plan. There are no targets without a business plan. So I think actually the key
is the plan that they are preparing internally, what they want to deliver because that is
then the way you will transfer it into actions. And Nordea needs -- as a client, I'm really
happy but as a shareholder, I think that Nordea really needs to improve its internal
eﬃciency and deliver more shareholder value. And that we will -- that also has to improve
-- include a more ambitious cost plan than what they have communicated so far.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah. I certainly hope, they're not going to deliver less shareholder value.

Hi, good afternoon. Couple of questions from me on the investment portfolio of If. I
wondered if you could share us the -- if there's currently any signiﬁcant or (inaudible)
mentioning hedges in place that mean that the economic exposures may be slightly
diﬀerent to what we see, particularly interested on the equity side is 10% of the portfolio,
the real exposure or is there any signiﬁcant hedge that means, it's actually slightly
diﬀerent at the moment? And the second question on the portfolio is, you have 1.3 years
duration on the asset side.
So you run a short duration mismatch. What's the solvency cost of that and what would it
take for you to change your view and have a closer matching of assets and liabilities on
that book. Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

We invest all our assets, all the ﬂoat in a way, as it would be our own money. So we don't
do anything exotic. So we have no hedges of the kind that we would not have disclosed
to the market. What -- the second question was, what would we think of matching? I think,
this is the -- completely the wrong moment to go along on the yield curve, now after the
drop we have seen. It would have been wiser to do it earlier but there we have been
wrong because we could not foresee this exceptional drop in interest rates, but the timing
would be wrong. So we are not even contemplating or matching that. We have the
reserves to maintain the mismatch.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Niccolo Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

And that the mismatch have a signiﬁcant impact on the solvency ratio of the entity or is it
marginal?

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you very much. And it's really to ask again, because, I am really sorry, I didn't follow
the points about the debt and the limits. I'm sorry, I got confused. Would you be able to
maybe just say it again? Or say it in -- just the main bits. I think the question was originally,
how much capacity you have and how much willingness you would have to, and my
perception, the answer was, it was more changing it to the edges, so maybe replacing
some of the senior with hybrid but rather than issuing what I think, I heard was a kind of
limited at the parent level of next to EUR2 billion. But any clariﬁcation, would be very
helpful. Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think that Knut Arne has said that we are happy with the debt level that we have today.
And I remember when this question has been put forward many times during the years. I
have said that we can't really have a ﬁxed number because it also depends on the
attractiveness on where we would deploy it because if you take on more leverage, then
you take one more risk and then the investments have to be attractive. We have more
capacity than we need. That is I think the main point, but if there -- and we have no
intention to take on more debt on a gross basis at this moment. But if there was
something unusually attractive, we could use this ﬁrepower for that, but we have no such
plans at this moment, maybe this clariﬁes.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Brilliant. And the ﬁgure on the capacity. Did I understand right, was EUR2.5 billion?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Yeah in excess. So it will be, it's 50% of the SCR which will mean for the Group in excess of
EUR2.5 billion after we change the calculation basis for Nordea and we have shy of EUR1
billion. So we have roughly EUR2 billion in hybrid, what I called theoretical hybrid
capacity, additional hybrid capacity.
