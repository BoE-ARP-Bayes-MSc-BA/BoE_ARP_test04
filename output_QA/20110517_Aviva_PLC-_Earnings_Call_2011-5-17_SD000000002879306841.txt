FINAL

So today we've announced a good start to the year, with choices that we've taken to
focus on profitability coming through clearly in this morning's numbers. In both Life and
General Insurance we've made strong progress and we're on track to meet our shorterterm targets on operating capital generation, profitability and costs. And we've also seen
an increase in both our IFRS and MCEV net asset values, with the MCEV now moving up to
576p.
Our General Insurance performance is the real highlight. We are seeing this business go
from strength to strength and performing very well. Net written premiums are up 9% in
the First Quarter to GBP2.7b. And importantly, we've achieved this growth while achieving
a combined operating ratio of 97% compared to 102% in the same quarter last year.
And sales growth was particularly strong in the UK, with an increase for a fifth consecutive
quarter, up 20% to GBP1.1 billion compared to Q1 last year. And we've increased motor
policyholder count by 580,000 since the start of 2010, principally through direct and the
RAC panel.
We are seeing continuing strong rate increases in personal motor in the UK. But also there
are some early signs that the commercial rating environment is beginning to turn. We're
starting to see early rate increases in commercial property following previous signs of
increases in commercial and motor.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Europe, General Insurance sales grew by 3%, with a greatly improved combined
operating ratio of 95%. That's due to management action on pricing but also combined
with better weather conditions in Ireland and France in the quarter.
The Canadian book saw 7% growth across both personal and commercial lines, with a 1%
reduction in the combined operating ratio.
So overall, there's real momentum continuing to build across our General Insurance
business and we're clearly seeing the results of the action that we've taken on pricing and
all of the cost savings that we've achieved over the last three years. So with the market
beginning to turn, the outlook for profitability appears encouraging.
And on top of that, I'm very pleased to announce today that we've strengthened our
relationship with HSBC with our appointment as a preferred strategic partner in the UK
and in Europe, an appointment that will offer significant opportunities across its Life and
General Insurance business. And alongside that, we can announce that our five-year
exclusive UK insurance distribution deal, the home, travel and creditor business, has been
extended for a further five years through to 2016.
Now, turning to the Life business, we're seeing there the benefits of the decisions we've
made to focus on more profitable business. First-quarter sales, whilst down against the
same period last year, are broadly at the run rate in the second half of 2010. And we've
delivered a very healthy Life new business internal rate of return, excluding Delta Lloyd, of
13.7%, well ahead of our target of 12%. And we've grown internal rates of return across all
regions.

FINAL

Sales in the UK, excluding the more lumpy bulk purchase annuities, were up 7%, with
pension sales rising 19%, individual annuities rising 21% and protection rising 8%.
Meanwhile, the bulk purchase annuity rating environment was less favorable and we
therefore wrote GBP200 million or so less than in the First Quarter of last year.
The really good news, I think, is that we're writing new business in the UK now at a very
healthy 16% IRR. We have implemented significant and permanent operational changes in
our UK Life business and those actions are helping to generate sustainable and growing
profits. And with regards to the retail distribution review, our multi-distribution approach,
combined with the fact that 85% of our new business profit is unaffected by the changes,
makes us confident that we're well prepared for the introduction of RDR next year.
Turning to Europe, where we've increased IRRs by 2% to 13%, the story is essentially one
of a shifting mix towards more profitable products and taking some tough action to
reduce sales of less profitable products.
Starting with France, there we saw a fall in sales due to a combination of general market
contraction and action to increase profitability of the with-profit products. More profitable
unit-linked sales through the Credit du Nord partnership increased by more than 100%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then let's move to Italy which, this quarter, accounts for just over 50% of the fall in sales.
The decrease there is driven by the management team taking decisive action to reduce
sales of the lower-margin with-profit product. And that's all been compensated to some
degree by an increase in sales of the more profitable protection and unit-linked products.
Meanwhile, Ireland, Turkey and Russia all saw increased sales. And Polish pension sales
fell, compensated to some degree by a healthy increase in protection and unit-linked
sales in that market.
A comment on Spain. We all know that it's going through a period of transition at the
moment with the consolidation and strengthening of the Cajas. Now our bancassurance
contracts with the Cajas are strong and should serve us well during this period of
transition. But it is having some effect on the market. Sales in the region were down 11%.
But margins do continue to be strong.
We expect life sales in Europe for the first half of the year to remain relatively subdued,
primarily due to the actions that we're taking on profitability. But we firmly believe that
there are significant growth opportunities across our markets in the medium to long term.
And profitability in bancassurance remains strong. In our European business, for example,
we achieved a life new business internal rate of return of 18% in that channel. And with
over 100 existing partnerships around the world, it remains an area of opportunity for us.
In the US, we continue to focus on achieving higher profits. IRRs on new business are now
14%. And whilst index annuity sales were down, life sales were up 12% as we continue to
diversify our US product mix.
Page 3 of 30



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2011-05-17

And in Asia Pacific we saw an 11% growth in total life and investment sales. And IRRs
continued to increase to 13%.

FINAL

In summary then, I believe we made a good start to 2011 in terms of sales and profitability
across all our businesses and we continue to drive excellence in General Insurance and
excellence in Life Insurance. And we continue to progress our strategy to increase focus
and depth in our chosen markets.
The disposal of a further 15% in Delta Lloyd generated cash proceeds of GBP381m. This is
an important further step for us. It means that we can now deconsolidate Delta Lloyd,
which will further simplify our disclosures and further de-risk our business.
So looking forward, I'm optimistic that Aviva will continue to make progress, both
operationally and strategically this year, whilst continuing to deliver against our short-term
targets.
Okay. Thank you very much for listening. We'd now be delighted to take any questions
that you may have.

Questions And Answers

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Gordon Aitken from
Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead with your question.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Morning.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Gordon.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Just a question on Poland. Sales are down 26% and you mentioned this is due to
pensions. I'm just wondering what particularly is driving this and how much of it is due to
the changes that have been announced to the second pillar there. And also what's the
outlook.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Yes. A really good question, Gordon. It's an important market for us. It's been a great
success for us. And you're absolutely right, there are structural changes in the market. I'll
ask Igal to comment in a little bit more detail. But essentially what we have done is really
point the direct sales force really away from the pensions market where we are already

Page 4 of 30



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2011-05-17

very strong and more into the protection and unit-linked market. But let Igal give a little bit
more detail.

FINAL

A - Igal Mayer

{BIO 15440055 <GO>}

Morning, Gordon. Yes. This is the, as Andrew said, the pension reforms that have
happened. The key to that market, if you look at our history there, was to build scale. We
did that very early on. We're the second largest pension provider in Poland with about
GBP11 billion of assets under management. We made very good returns on that.
Now the focus for us, if you actually look at our historical numbers, started in early 2010,
where we began to deemphasize going after new pension sales and really, as Andrew
said, switched the direct sales force onto protection and unit-linked sales. And the
progress has been very good. We're very pleased. The way I look at it, that franchise was
originally built on driving pension sales. We took early action to essentially shift the focus
towards life and protection sales. And we now have a very, very good and growing
franchise in that area and you're seeing those numbers come through in the First Quarter
of '11.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Gordon.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Tony Silverman from Standard & Poor's. Please
go ahead with your question.

Q - Tony Silverman

{BIO 2162363 <GO>}

Thank you. That's Standard & Poor's Equity Research. I just had a couple of questions,
please. In UK motor insurance, you mentioned a summer initiative coming up in
distributing through aggregators. And I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about
that. Is that the result of any sort of -- what do you expect to happen there? Has there
been any sort of successful pilot scheme -- pilot experiment or what?
The second question was we've heard from -- I suppose been a theme from a couple of
competitors in Europe of European banks looking after funding ratios and such like,
particularly in France and Spain. And I was wondering if you feel that may moderate at all
later in the year or what the outlook might be.
And finally, the deconsolidation of Delta Lloyd, does that impact IGD surplus in any way or
not? And if so, how? Thank you very much.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

FINAL

Thanks, Tony. Good morning. Yes, look, on the UK motor aggregator, I'll ask Mark to
comment on that. Obviously we've stressed just how successful we've been with our
brand strategy, gaining nearly 600,000 new customers under the Aviva brand and the
RAC panel. But our ambitions don't stop there, Mark, I think it's fair to say.

A - Mark Hodges

{BIO 15503226 <GO>}

Absolutely. Morning, Tony. This is all about routes to market. So you know we withdrew the
Aviva brand from the aggregated sites a couple of years ago. That was around getting
the economics to work for us. You know that we've introduced new pricing
methodologies; we've talked about that. You know that we've got a very, very successful
brand campaign running with the Aviva brand, which is helping to drive the increase in
customer numbers that we're talking about today.
So really the idea of having an on-aggregator Internet-only, that, I think, is something to
stress, separately branded play is all about being able to deploy the pricing expertise we
have through a different route to market. And if you think about the people we're
competing with in the motor market, they are multi-branders. And frankly this should just
be seen as a natural extension for us as we move through to grow our business overall. I
talked about growing personal life last year through brokers, through direct. This really is
just a natural extension of that ambition.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Thanks, Mark. The question about liquidity and funding in the European banking market,
my perception of that, Tony, is it really just depends on what banks you're dealing with.
The simple fact is that some banks have more liquidity pressures than others. And look,
on the whole, we work with some very, very strong banks. And I would say that if you go
through the crisis period going back from late 2007 through until now, the real crunch
period actually was in early 2008. And that is certainly a time when banks were putting
funding their own balance sheet right at the top of their priorities. And at that point it
affected insurance sales.
I think, in fairness, as we move forward, clearly there are some new liquidity pressures
coming from new rules on the banks. But in general. And I think we feel relatively
comfortable that it's not going to have a major impact on our sales outlook.

A - Igal Mayer

{BIO 15440055 <GO>}

Yes. No specific comments on liquidity impacting the sales. Look, if I give you the two
countries that you spoke about, in terms of France, the relationship with Credit du Nord is
very strong. There has been some very active campaigns, you'll notice, in the press
release. We've highlighted that unit-linked sales are up 123%. Overall sales from the
Credit du Nord relationship are up over 25% year on year. So we're quite pleased. And
our plans are for that to continue in the remainder of the year.
Spain, while sales are down from our bancassurance relationship, that is not driven by any
kind of internal need by the bank. It's more a result, as you would expect, with market
Page 6 of 30



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2011-05-17

sales down and the economy down, that's reading through, although I am very pleased
with how our partners in Spain really are able to play to their strengths and drive
standalone sales, which we're seeing good and steady results from.

FINAL

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

On the last question, Tony, I'll ask Pat to comment on the IGD and perhaps a little bit more
color even on the economic capital position.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Andrew. Morning, Tony.

Q - Tony Silverman

{BIO 2162363 <GO>}

Morning.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The impact of the deconsolidation of the sale of 15% stake in Delta Lloyd is to improve
IGD by a further approximately GBP100m. As Andrew kind of alluded to in the start, also
the shape of our asset profile changes quite considerably with the deconsolidation of
Delta Lloyd. We hold less, if you like, risk-seeking assets now in the rest of our Group,
which we touched upon in the January presentation. So from an economic capital
perspective, that means we have less risk charges. So the benefit from there is bigger
even than the IGD benefit.

Q - Tony Silverman

{BIO 2162363 <GO>}

But the actual deconsolidation, does that mean any surplus in Delta Lloyd is in your IGD
surplus, just as a proportion of that rather than consolidating?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. Yes.

Q - Tony Silverman

{BIO 2162363 <GO>}

Okay. That's fine. I'll come -- perhaps take it offline. Thanks.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of James Shuck from Jefferies. Please go ahead
with your question.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you very much. I had a few questions, please. The first one just on
the economic capital position, you very kindly gave an update in 2009 for the capital
position there. But I was just wondering what the 2010 position is, please. And if you could
update for Q1, then great as well.
Page 7 of 30



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2011-05-17

Secondly, I'd just like to talk about your operating cash flow, because you're guiding
towards operating cash flow of GBP1.5 billion for 2011. I'm just wondering, given where we
are so far in the year, are you more or less confident in reaching that, given you made
GBP1.7 billion in 2010?

FINAL

And my final question is just on the outlook for UK commercial non-life pricing, because
you make some brief comments that the property pricing is improving. Thank you.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, James. Look, I'll ask Pat to comment on the economic capital position first.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Thank you, Andrew. Hi, James. We didn't plan on updating each quarter on the economic
capital position. So there's no specific update on that. The only thing I would point you to
is obviously part of that equation is the available capital, which you largely start with your
MCEV base. So as we noted in here, we grew MCEV net asset value by 30p. So that
obviously is kind of directionally helpful. But no specific update, if you like, on the
economic capital position.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

On the operating cash flow, James, I think we said back in March at the time of the
prelims that it was too early to give further guidance. I still think that's the case. You're
right, we've had a strong start to the year. That's good. But I think it'll be at the half year
when we would feel comfortable to give a more material update in terms of our outlook
on that front.
On the UK commercial side, you're absolutely right, we are signaling that after actually still
quite a quiet First Quarter, just in recent weeks we have started to see something a little
bit more meaningful. But let Mark comment in a bit more detail on that.

A - Mark Hodges

{BIO 15503226 <GO>}

Yes. Morning, James. I think classically we see the personal motor market harden. We're
seeing the commercial motor market harden and now, as you see in the numbers, in
terms of 10% increases year on year, as Andrew said, in quarter one it was low single digit.
In terms of commercial property and liability, there are certain specialist lines where we're
starting to see some more rate moving. And literally, it is literally over the past month or
so, we're starting to see a little more coming through on the core property and liability
book.
Now we've got a very high-quality book, as you know. We went through a process of
cleansing that book through 2009. Our retention rates are very high. Overall the
profitability is okay. But we're just starting to see, we think, the very first signs of rates
hardening a little more. We frankly think the market needs that. We're taking a very
disciplined approach to underwriting, as we always do. And I'm encouraged by that
position.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Can I just return quickly to the economic capital position? I appreciate you're not
going to update that quarterly. But 2009 is a long time away -- sorry, a long time ago. And
the guidance you give on the MCEV is helpful. But when would you actually be in a position
to give us a more up-to-date economic view, particularly in the wake of the
deconsolidation of Delta Lloyd? Is H1 reasonable to expect that?

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Yes.

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Crean from Autonomous. Please go
ahead with your question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Good morning, all. A couple of questions. One, I just wanted to explore a bit more on the
improvement in the combined ratio from 102 to 97 in the First Quarter. I think there were
GBP71 million of weather losses in the first half of last. I just wonder -- I assume those are
all largely First Quarter. I wonder whether you could give us the weather impact in this
quarter.
And I suppose related to that question, you were 97 at the half year last year, which
implies that the Second Quarter was about 92. And that is with -- and the improvement
this year you're saying is with lower reserve releases. Is that the sort of pattern you tend
to get between First Quarter and Second Quarter, a 10-point difference between First
Quarter and Second Quarter? That's one question.
Second question is really just looking at some of your key bancassurance deals in both
Spain and Italy, as to whether some of these are coming up for renewal. The ones which
were written 10 years ago, were they done on a 10-year platform and whether they need
renegotiation.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Okay, Andrew. Thank you very much. Yes, look, on the general insurance side, you're quite
right. In the First Quarter of last year, particularly in Europe, we saw some significant
weather losses, primarily in France and in Ireland. So it's obviously, as you can see, a 16-

Page 9 of 30



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2011-05-17

point improvement in the European combined operating ratio Q1 2010 versus Q1 2011. So
it's good to see that real profit flowing through.

FINAL

In essence I think we believe that the First Quarter, both in Europe and in the UK was
probably a little bit more benign than we would have expected. So that helps. That's a
great start for the year in the business.
In terms of the run rate, Pat, coming through into the Second Quarter, would we regard
Q2 2010 as normal?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

I think broadly there's nothing out of the ordinary in that quarter. So the answer's probably
yes, Andrew. So if that helps you in terms of what your expectations might be, I don't think
we'd be misleading if we gave that message.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Just on that. So what were the weather losses in the First Quarter this year?

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Minimal. Minimal.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

So naught?

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

It's not a number that we would point out. Mark, do you want to comment on the UK?

A - Mark Hodges

{BIO 15503226 <GO>}

No. Andrew, morning. It's -- there is always weather. It's, in the UK context, it's January,
February and March. But it's much, much, much more in line with our normal expectations,
maybe a little below. But much closer to what you would see is a long-term average over
the years, as opposed to last year, as you know, when in the UK context it was somewhat
worse.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

It was GBP20 million in weather in the First Quarter, first half.

A - Mark Hodges

{BIO 15503226 <GO>}

Yes. That was the half-year number. So there's always potentially a little bit of -- some of
this comes down to what we allow for in terms of our pricing and in terms of our view a
long-term average. But the GBP20 million number was a half-year number for the UK.

Igal, do you want to comment on Europe?

FINAL

A - Igal Mayer

{BIO 15440055 <GO>}

Yes, Andrew, in Europe, just in the First Quarter results you're seeing about 10 to
12percentage points improvement from the weather, which is the two events, France and
Ireland. So you can assume somewhere around 4 to 5percentage points is the pure
improvement in year-on-year underwriting due to both actions on rates and portfolio.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Great. Thanks.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

On the bancassurance deals, there again I'll let Igal comment in more detail on that.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Igal Mayer

{BIO 15440055 <GO>}

Yes. I think -- let's take the two pensions that you spoke about. In Spain, those are
essentially perpetual agreements. Now, as you know, Andrew. And you've commented on
in your notes, with the Caja recapitalization process that are taking place right now, we are
staying very close to our partners. I don't have any new information to disclose today. But
obviously what happens in Spain will be contingent on the restructuring efforts and the
various mergers. We're very confident that our agreements give us very good protection.
And our goal is to, broadly speaking, end up with the same kind of distribution we have
today.
Italy, it is deal by deal. There is nothing imminent coming up for renewal. We did renew a
major agreement over the last nine months and that's really the only comment I have
about Italy.

Our next question comes from the line of Andy Hughes from Exane BNP. Please go ahead
with your question.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Hi, guys. A couple of questions, if I could. First one, could you update on the disposal
program, because I can't find any mention of how things are going or whether actually we
Page 11 of 30



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity

should expect anything imminently in regard to the non-core operations.

FINAL

Second question was on the UK motor growth and the direct pricing, is anyone else doing
that direct pricing or has anyone else followed you since?
And the growth that's happened in the UK motor stuff, this is all post the Experian system
being pulled, just to double check that. Thank you.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Thanks, Andy. No. There is no new news on disposals today. Obviously the feature of the
First Quarter on that was the 15% reduction in the Delta Lloyd holding. So that, in strategic
terms, I think that was the key event during the quarter. We remain focused on executing
the strategy that we talked about in November of last year. And we'll update just as soon
as we can if and when we have meaningful things to say.
On the UK motor growth and direct pricing, I'll let Mark come in on that one.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Hodges

{BIO 15503226 <GO>}

Yes. Morning, Andy. You remember I talked about this a little bit last November, when I
said that we were taking the Aviva risk index, which was our pricing methodology we'd
been using in the direct book, into the personal life broker market. You'll see that we're
very pleased with the growth. There's been a 60% increase year on year as we've rolled
that our increasingly to personal life brokers. It shows that there are personal life
customers who still want to work with a broker. And I think there is a bit more room for
growth through that channel to come.
And in terms of what others are doing, I can't really comment, to be honest. It's obviously
our focus is on our capability, developing our pricing methodologies and making sure that
we are selecting the risks that we think are the most appropriate to write. So we're happy
we're doing that. And you can see that coming through in the combined ratio
performance, not just in the First Quarter but through the back half of last year. And the
overall performance of the business, I think that's a good market for us to continue to
grow into.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

And on the Experian system, was that pulled, well, before -- because obviously your direct
pricing allows you to review things faster possibly than some of the competition. All this
growth has happened after that system. There's no possible exposure there to any RFT
investigation?

A - Mark Hodges

{BIO 15503226 <GO>}

Andy, I'm afraid I'll have to take that one offline. I don't know what -- when you're referring
to the Experian system, what --?

Our next question comes from the line of Greig Paterson from KBW. Please go ahead with
your question.

Q - Greig Paterson
Hi. Good morning. Had the name changed. Three questions. Igal, one's for Igal. I got some
sort of feedback from the market that when you arrived you put all product development
on hold in the European business. That's not a surprising action and we can see the
impacts on the sales. But I was wondering where you are within that process. And does -will we see -- initial thoughts, any change in strategy versus what the previous CEO was
focusing on? That's question one.
The second one is that I see your UK annuities on the individual side are up 20-odd %.
When you look at the entire peer group, they went down. Your strategy on focusing on
higher margin. And you book these annuities as lower margin in your Group margin, I was
wondering, it seems a little bit inconsistent, was actually pushing a low-margin product
quite aggressively with pricing. I was wondering how that fitted into the strategy.
Then the third thing, I see there's no mention, you usually don't mention it. But with the
net flows and/or surrenders on covered business, I'm wondering if you can give us an idea
whether flows are positive and how surrender experience is tying in with -- assumed in
your embedded value basis.

Okay. Look, thanks for those, Greig. And the first one obviously is pointed at Igal. So I'll let
him come in. But what would you like to say on that?

FINAL

A - Igal Mayer

{BIO 15440055 <GO>}

Yes. Greig, just that you do know me. You know this is an area that I absolutely focus on in
terms of insurance excellence. So absolutely we're looking at our product area. And I'm
looking at beefing up the capability there. That's the bottom line.

Q - Greig Paterson
Have you got any idea when you'll start -- restart the product development process?

A - Igal Mayer

{BIO 15440055 <GO>}

It never stopped. So let's be clear on it never stopped. What I'm trying to do is actually
get some more -- there's a couple of areas that I'm not pleased with that I think we can
strengthen when we do our assessment across markets. You wouldn't be surprised by it.
If you look at the big markets, take our business in France, very, very strong product
capability there, nothing to worry about or touch.

Bloomberg Transcript

But as I kind of go through the portfolio, if I, by contrast, take a country like Turkey, I think
there's a great opportunity for us, through the resources that we have in our larger
markets, whether it's the UK, France or the US, that we can grab some of the very
capable people that we have and infuse them into a smaller country like Turkey and see
some real meaningful leaps. So that's the kind of stuff that's going on.

Q - Greig Paterson
So there's no change in -- you know you did a quite a unique remuneration structure that
was rolled out in -- a sales remuneration structure was rolled out in Europe. It's business
as usual. But --.

A - Igal Mayer

{BIO 15440055 <GO>}

It's business as usual. And it's yielding the kind of results that we want. Again, if you kind of
look at the shift in mix that we've seen. And we can go into some of the detailed
examples, if you like. But there's no doubt that in terms of our direct sales force and even
some of our banking relationships that we have changed incentives to really get the sales
force moving business in the kind of mix direction that we want to see.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Yes. I think, Greig, on the whole, Igal, as always, has hit the ground running in terms of
taking over the region. And certainly I've been looking for cleaner, clearer execution. And
I'm really pleased with progress that we've made in the First Quarter.
But I think we will take some time at the half year to give a little more of an update when, I
think, Igal's thoughts around other things that we can do, update on things like the

Page 14 of 30

Quantum Leap program. That will be the right time for us to do that. So please watch out
for that one.

FINAL

On UK annuities, yes, you're right. I think we have performed well against the competition.
On the margin point, Pat, do you want to comment on that, or Mark?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. I'm happy to pick that up. Morning, Greig. The 21% increase in individual annuities
compares I think well to the market. The point you made around margins and IRR, this is a
higher than the average in the book margin in IRR product. So we've been driving, as you
know, for some time, I think, better pricing, better segmentation. We're able to process
this new business whilst reducing our costs overall in the business. So we're becoming
more efficient, which helps.
And if you look at the average margin on the annuity product and the IRR, it's certainly,
even when I disclosed the numbers last November, they are better than the portfolio
average. So we're growing into a business that's giving us very good returns. And I think
that's something we're confident we can continue because we are competitive.

Q - Greig Paterson

Bloomberg Transcript

So just to confirm, are you saying that the MCEV margin on annuities is higher than the
2.7%?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

The 3.7% UK average margin annuity business is performing better than that. I think last
November I'm sure I reported something around 6% in terms of MCEV margin on that.

Q - Greig Paterson
I'll have to read, because I can't read them so I'm just looking at the history. I know you
don't -- I'll take that offline. I need to chat to you about that then.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Greig. Net flows, Pat?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. What we'll do is obviously we published for the first time the -- at the year end the
full net flows picture across each of the business units. We'll repeat that at the half year as
we've got all the update on that. No particularly new news on that, Greig. We said. And
Mark talked about it, in the UK we'll see a little bit of an outflow in the with-profits
business from those old endowment policies. So we'll see a little bit of that. Then
generally good news on the non-profit business and no new news particularly on that
lapse rates.

Our next question comes from the line of Barrie Cornes from Panmure. Please go ahead
with your question.

Q - Barrie Cornes

{BIO 2389115 <GO>}

Morning, everybody. I've just got three questions if I may. First of all in respect of the UK
rate increases in Motor, I just wonder what impact it's having on propensity to acquire
motor insurance and also impact on frequency and quantum of claims. That's the first
question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second one, in respect of insurance brokers, they seem to be putting pressure on
insurers to increase commission. I just wonder whether or not you're seeing that,
particularly in Commercial.
And the last question, I think going back to Andy Hughes's question about the disposal
program, just wondered if you could give us some more color on that. And in particular
whether or not there's any movement in respect to the RAC in the UK please.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Okay, Barrie, thanks. UK Motor we are going into what we think is a strong market. Mark.
So --

A - Mark Hodges

{BIO 15503226 <GO>}

Yes. I mean there's not much more to say at this stage, Barrie. There's no new news on
things like claims frequencies or severity. Again I gave an update in November about the
work we've been doing to pick up trends, specifically the bodily injury trends. You know
that had an impact on volumes in 2009. We were out of the starting gate early in terms of
rate increases in 2009. Followed that up in '10. And '11, obviously, those are earning
through now, those rate increases which will help the combined ratio as we go into this
year. But there's no new news on the claims front to mention.
And to pick up the second question on Commercial commission increases, well again,
you'll remember in 2009 we took some very tough action around unprofitable schemes,
around business where the commission rates in our view were too high. We are holding
the line around that. We're not paying. There are always commercial arrangements we'll
enter into with people if it's high quality business. But across the board we're not seeing
big upward pressure on commission rates. Certainly if there were, we would resist it
anyway.

Q - Barrie Cornes

{BIO 2389115 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

FINAL

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

I think the macro point there as well, Barrie, is if you look at the cyclical movements over
the last few years, we are actually pretty happy with the way that we've approached it.
Inasmuch as back in '08, '09 it did contract at a time when markets, particularly in
Commercial, were difficult before the Motor had started to move. And we have, I think
very successfully, I think the team's done a fantastic job of growing the book back into the
strength in the market. And I think our timing has been good, I have to say. And I really
want to see that momentum continuing. And the policy counts on the Motor side are up
nearly 600,000 in 15 months, I think that's a fantastic performance for us in the UK
market. So I think we've been doing that at the right time, at the right price. So I'm really
pleased with that. And what I want to see, obviously, is the same thing happening in
Commercial now. And that's where I think the teams have to focus.
On the other question, on disposals you mentioned the RAC. There has been a lot of
press speculation over the course of the last few weeks on the RAC. We have not
commented on that. We don't believe it's in the interests of our shareholders for us to
comment on it. So I'm really not going to add to anything on that today.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Hi, Blair.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

A couple of points there to pick up after all the other ones you've had already. Just on
Non-Life, your expectations there for premium growth there stretching into the full year, I
think, in the UK in particular, the Q1 comparison was very weak. So what should we be
expecting by way of underlying run rate there?
The second question is rather dull. But just looking at the IGD, it was down against the net
asset values, which were flat to up, adjusting for dividend. So the question is what is
hitting the IGD that's not hitting the NAVs, both on an IFRS and EV basis.

significant do you think that is. Thank you.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

FINAL

Thanks, Blair. Non-Life premium growth, Mark? Okay?

A - Mark Hodges

{BIO 15503226 <GO>}

Yes. I think, Blair, we've grown in the UK book five quarters running now. We talked already
this morning about a number of the reasons for that in terms of the direct motor pricing
and advertising, in terms of the RAC panel, in terms of the rollout of the pricing to
brokers. I expect those to continue to deliver profitable volume growth.
We talked a little bit about Commercial rating. Any hardening there will improve our
position. Also. And it says in here, our position in the broker market it's actually a core
strength of ours, working with brokers in the UK market. And we are very, very active and
energetic in generating profitable new business in that line too.

Bloomberg Transcript

Mentioned the low-cost model around and into their only [ph] offering. That will give us,
not huge numbers this year. But as we go through this year, next year some ability to
grow.
We haven't talked this morning about corporate risk solutions. That's a business we
consistently said we'll grow slowly and profitably as we build up the capability. And last
year in Q1 we wrote around GBP10 million of business. This Q1 we've written around
GBP20m. So it's still steady, progressive -- steady growth in the book.
So all of these things I think we point to and say that yes, we can maintain that momentum
and keep growing the book as we go through the rest of this year, with the proviso that,
of course, we've very disciplined, as you know. And we are very focused on growing the
bottom line as well as the top line.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Thanks, Mark. IGD, don't apologize for that. It's not boring. Pat?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

I knew it was going to be my question when you said it was dull. In terms of the
movement versus MCEV, let me start there, the movement versus IFRS now isn't too big.
On MCEV, we obviously had some value of new business positively that helped drive that
forward and also some positive market movements, particularly in places like the US,
where there was some positive increase in net asset value which flows into MCEV but
doesn't flow through to the IGD calculation. Then probably the only other thing worth
mentioning is, it's almost in the rounding, is on pension contributions that impact IGD that
don't impact IFRS. But they're really your main items.

FINAL

Lastly there on HSBC, thank you for asking that question. This is an important
development for us. First of all the renewal of the UK general insurance deal to 2016 is
just fundamentally good news. And it continues, I think, our very, very strong position in
bancassurance here in the UK.
But the preferred partner status is broader than that. The way HSBC have been
approaching it. And I know this is not top of the list in terms of their strategy. But they do
make a lot of money from insurance. And their distribution power across their many, many
branches across the world is clearly very, very strong. What this does is give us the
opportunity to look at further businesses in their European operations, whether that be
France, or whether that be Turkey. But we still have to compete hard to win that business.
But it gives us the opportunity to do that. So I'm very, very optimistic about that, very, very
pleased to have gone through what was a very rigorous process to reach that preferred
partner status. And it gives us opportunities, Mark, that we haven't seen for awhile?

A - Mark Hodges

{BIO 15503226 <GO>}

Yes, I think anything like that -- thanks, Andy. The only thing I'd add, Blair is -- this is both
across Life and Non-Life. So although in the UK we've just renewed the Non-Life deal, it
means we can talk to HSBC about Life opportunities as well. As I've stressed before and
we've stressed before, bancassurance distribution is very, very important to us and
something we're very good at.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Can I just follow up and ask what proportion of sales is HSBC accounting for at the
moment?

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Mark, do you want to comment on that?

A - Mark Hodges

{BIO 15503226 <GO>}

We haven't disclosed the separate sales line for HSBC in terms of premium. I mean it's a
significant deal in terms of home. But frankly, in terms of the detail, that's something
probably best between us and them.

Q - Kevin Ryan

Good question, Kevin. The reality is we had revised it a few months ago down to 97%. So
obviously that was progress. So right now I don't think we have any plans to change the

The next question comes from the line of Nick Holmes from Nomura. Please go ahead
with your question.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Good morning, just a couple of questions. First one is on the US, just wondered if you
could give us a bit more color on the US strategy, in particular, what's your appetite for
indexed annuity sales.
Then secondly, on Solvency II, what are your thoughts about the Commission's latest
thinking on the illiquidity premium. I think there's been some new stuff out there and it will
be very interesting if you've had a look at it. Thank you.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Thank you, Nick. Morning. On the US, particularly on the annuity side in your question, yes,
we continue to price for profit. And so -- the market's down a bit on that side anyway. It's
got a little bit more competitive in the First Quarter, that's had a little bit of an effect on
the sales numbers as well. But the profitability of the business, with IRRs at 14%, the new
business is still very good. So we expect profits to improve further in the first half of this
year. The existing book is seeing very good persistency. And of course that's re-priced
too over the course of the last year.
So I think the outlook for profitability in the business is still encouraging. And we'll continue
to react tactically to changes in the market as we go through this year, with a view to
Page 20 of 30

FINAL

making sure that we get what we regard as a decent share of new business in that
market. But still with an eye to profitability, right in line with the strategic statement that
we made back in November last year.
On Solvency II, you're right, there is some further thinking in the course of the last few
weeks and months around illiquidity premium or matching premium, which is sort of an
alternative idea which is being considered at the moment. Pat, do you want to comment
on that?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Andrew. Hi, Nick. We're certainly in an interesting phase of Solvency II. The
industry has, as you all know, put forward quite a strong, I think, provocation to the
Commission a few weeks ago to say there were a number of these key issues that
needed to be dealt with. I think the positive element is we have seen some response
from the Commission, both in terms of specific working parties. But also the matching
premium concept they've come up with which, depending on how the final details are
ironed out, should be good, certainly for the UK industry.
I think a part of the key to that though is not instead of illiquidity premium, it's as well as a
illiquidity premium. And I think the conversation around that is developing okay. But there
is still quite a bit of detail to work out, both on how a matching premium exactly works and
for what assets. But also alongside illiquidity premium as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay. So just to clarify, you actually think it would probably be positive for the UK? I'm
interested in that just because some Continental European insurers have expressed
concern about it.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. That's why they've expressed concern about it. But yes, it a concept that works well
for a UK annuity-style book.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

I think the issue there though, Nick, as well is that's why maintaining both a liquidity premia
and the matching premium concept is important because whilst it might work well for UK
annuities, the fact is that whilst UK annuities as part of our sales, well, it's, I don't know,
between 5% and 10%, absolutely maximum of our total sales, for some of our UK
competitors clearly it's very much more than that. So it becomes almost an all-consuming
interest as regards Solvency II. We have a much more pan-European interest.

Page 21 of 30



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2011-05-17

And therefore, I think, seeing both the matching premium and the illiquidity premium, as it
was previously set out, giving companies choices as to which way they'd like to go is, what
we like to see. That will work for our business, it will work for the industry more broadly in
Europe. And we think that will be a constructive outcome.

Our next question comes from the line of Raghu Hariharan from Citi. Please go ahead
with your question.

Q - Raghu Hariharan

{BIO 15133573 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hello. Morning, everyone.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Hi. Raghu.

Q - Raghu Hariharan

{BIO 15133573 <GO>}

Raghu from Citi. I just had three questions if I may please. The first one was just on the
accounting impact of consolidation of Delta Lloyd, because in your press release you
were saying there is a 9p impact because of the change in the constituents of the ECB
AAA Curve. So that's in addition, I guess, to the 7% impact which you had quantified at the
time of the Delta Lloyd share sale on the balance sheet. I was just wondering in terms of
the P&L, if you look at net income, I remember there being a significant contribution from
movements in the ECB AAA curve in a net income loss there. I was wondering at a halfyear stage would you be restating your last year's numbers because this would be deconsolidated. So just some guidance on that would be appreciated.
The second one was on this deleveraging point where you're saying you're still
committed to reducing your debt. I see your IGD has gone down a bit I guess because of
the dividend. I was just wondering where is your thinking about how you'd fund the IGD, or
the maturity of the debt I guess. Is your idea still that it would come from retained
earnings? I think it's about GBP430 million every year.
The last one was on your appetite for AXXX in the US. I see some commentary around
FSA recalibrating how it impacts your IGD. I was wondering if that changes your appetite
Page 22 of 30



Company N ame: Aviva PL C
Company Ticker: AV/ L N Equity
Date: 2011-05-17

for AXXX and how that affects your capital generation target in the US. And around sales
and around new business strain. Thank you.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

FINAL

Thanks very much, Raghu. I think those really fall squarely on Mr. Regan.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Hello, Raghu. In terms of Delta Lloyd, you're right in all of your assertions in the sense that
we did have a positive impact on investment variances from the movements in the Delta
Lloyd sale last year. What that did is increase the net assets of Delta Lloyd; that
subsequently fell post March 31. As that decreased its net assets, that then
correspondingly reduces the loss on sale. So the loss on sale was struck as of net assets
at December 31. So any decrease in that obviously has a corresponding reduction in the
loss on sale. So therefore it's not doubled up. It just comes out of one pocket into
another.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of what we'll do at the half year, I think we'll just report as it is really. So up until
the date of sale, any movement in the DL curve will fall as investment variance -- as a
negative this year. Then that will correspondingly, as I say, reduce the loss on sale.
There's no new news in terms of the debt maturity. Our plans are very much as we talked
about before. So we feel confident, as we've stated here, around our operating capital
generation. We feel confident, obviously, about the underlying profitability of the business.
And therefore in the core plan in terms of the -- refinancing half the maturities and then
repaying half the maturities over that three year period out of organic cash and profit
generation, is as we stated before.

Q - Raghu Hariharan

{BIO 15133573 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

In terms of the AXXX structure, you're quite right. The FSA came out with new rules this
year. As we noted in the release, what we've done is adjust the structure of our existing
AXXX such that they now comply with new FSA rules. And now accounts again within our
IGD balance. So we can still do it. There is still a couple of ways that you can adjust them
to adjust within the new FSA rules. So they still form an important part of our capital
structure, both in the US and at the Group level.

Q - Raghu Hariharan

{BIO 15133573 <GO>}

But going forward it should not affect new business strain in the US, because I know that
helped your new business strain, especially in Life sales.

Morning, a couple of things. First of all, Mark could you talk about whether you expect the
Jackson review to be implemented and what difference that would make to your
business.
Second are we now at a new level of BPA sales or can we expect a snap back in Q2?

Bloomberg Transcript

And third can you explain why you did so well in Ireland. And was the investment bond
business offshore or onshore behind that?

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, James. Jackson and the outlook there, Mark.

A - Mark Hodges

{BIO 15503226 <GO>}

Yes, James. Good morning. I think in terms of Jackson and whether it will be implemented
or not, hard one to call. I think that generally the issue of the cost of motor insurance is -in people's minds more. There's more noise in the media around it, I think much more
focused on it from a political perspective. So you would assume that something would
happen.
In terms of their proposals as they were set out, it's pretty neutral. There are some
savings for us in terms of after-the-event costs. But they're all potentially some small
increases due to changes in general damages. It kind of nets off in the round for us. So
not a big financial event as currently planned.
In terms of BPA sales, yes, it's interesting. If you look at the number of schemes we wrote
in quarter one 2011, we wrote 13 schemes, which totaled GBP140 million of premium. Last
year it was 10 schemes which totaled GBP344m. So there was a big differential in size of
scheme year on year. I think -- I don't know whether I would say it would snap back. But the
pipeline is strong. We have over 50 schemes in the pipeline that we're currently working

on. We've maintained our discipline in terms of pricing. That's the key driver. If you look
through 2010 it was very different quarter by quarter, the level of sales that we saw. So I'm
confident that the market's there. But I'm equally, I guess, keen to assure you that we will
only write business that we think is profitable.

Igal, the question on Ireland?

A - Igal Mayer

{BIO 15440055 <GO>}

Yes. Two parts. Those were onshore. And as we highlighted in the press release, we did
benefit from a tranche of sales. Hard to predict right now whether the market still has
appetite for further tranches. So that's why we highlighted that.
If I look at the other lines of business in Ireland, despite the economy being under
pressure, we are seeing -- obviously the economy's seen some modest GDP growth. And
in our other lines of business we're seeing good progression, single-digit growth rates in
products such as protection and unit-linked which I'm pleased with.

Our next question comes from the line of Toby Langley from Barclays Capital. Please go
ahead with your question.

Q - Toby Langley

{BIO 15924432 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. It's Toby Langley from Barclays Capital. I've got two questions
on the GI business and one on the platform business.
The first one GI is around capital consumption. Given the growth in premiums that we've
seen in the First Quarter, how should we be thinking about capital usage there? And if
possible can you let us know whether it's the case that there has been net capital
consumption or not or whether we're still seeing some release of capital there.
Secondly on GI, I'm wondering if you can talk around the proposed Dear CEO letter from
the FSA with regard to reserving adequacy on the Non-Life side of the industry. And to
perhaps comment on your sense as to whether or not you feel your reserving is sufficient
to really meet FSA and your own expectations.

Then finally on platform assets, there appears to be quite a material change in the way
that you account for the assets that are included as Platform assets, with the number
rising from I think around GBP1 billion last year to GBP56 billion in the numbers today.
Could you please talk about how you classify what does and does not go on to that
platform total and how you see those assets evolving going forward?

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Okay, Toby. Thank you very much for those questions. Good morning. On capital
consumption, yes, I guess we are beginning to put a little bit more capital to work at what
we believe are very good returns. Pat?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks, Toby. If you remember this time last year we talked about the fact that we've
benefited by about GBP200 million on OCG from a reduction in CRR from the GI
business. But we set an expectation that that this year would essentially flatten. And that's
broadly what we're seeing now. Probably there's a small capital usage. But it's in the small
bucket. It's broadly -- we don't get the benefit any more that we got last year, as
expected.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Dear CEO letter, Mark.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Hodges

{BIO 15503226 <GO>}

Yes. In terms of reserve adequacy and reserving processes, we have said a number of
times and we are very happy to re-emphasize that we're very strong on our reserving
discipline. Very consistent in terms of our approach to reserving in the General Insurance
book. And there's nothing in the Dear CEO letter, from our perspective, really to make us
want to or need to change any of our processes. So we're very happy that we are
compliant with the requirements. And that we have a very, very strong discipline from the
front office in terms of claims management, through to the reserving process and then
actually, as importantly, through to our pricing disciplines as well, because that's an
important thing, from my perspective, in terms of generating value.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

And in terms of the platform assets, I think this is some -- sort of partly to do with
definition. We are making all of the back book of the UK Life business available to advisers
to be able to work on it by the way of our Aviva for Advisers portal, which I think has been
described as a platform. So that basically people can be writing new wrap [ph] business.
But also dealing with all of the old back book in terms of pension contracts, looking at
protection contracts, annuity contracts. And dealing with us once. So effectively the value,
the larger, the GBP56 billion you were quoting is the value of the back book that's now
available to advisors to manage online. That's key from an efficiency perspective, both for
the advisors and obviously from our perspective as well.

Okay. Just coming back on the Dear CEO letter, are you sensing that it's having any
impact at all -- not on yourselves clearly given your comments. But on the broader
market?

FINAL

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

To be honest, that's not something I can really comment on. As usual, very focused on our
business. We have we think, as I said, a really, really top-class reserving process. It may or
may not have an impact on others.

The next question comes from the line of Duncan Russell from JP Morgan. Please go
ahead with your question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Duncan Russell

{BIO 15944951 <GO>}

Thank you. Just one question. Could you -- you were quite specific on your comments on
Commercial Property pricing increasing in recent weeks or over the last month. And could
you just go into a bit more detail about why specifically that's happened so recently and
what it would take for you -- for those prices to become more -- price increases to
become more sustained. Thank you.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks, Duncan, good question. In the UK, Mark, I'll ask you to comment.

A - Mark Hodges

{BIO 15503226 <GO>}

Yes. Duncan, thanks. There's not much more actually I could say at this stage. It's a
sentiment thing. We've started to see a little more coming through. That gives us reasons
to be optimistic given the volume of business that we have in that market, the position
that we have in that market, the strength that we have in that market.
It's too early to be absolutely certain that that won't -- that that's the start of a trend or
the pace of that trend. But we're optimistic. I think most commentators in the market
believe that we need to see rating increases in Commercial. We certainly believe that and
we're taking a very disciplined approach to our underwriting. But at this stage there's not
much more we can give in terms of specifics.

Okay. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Duncan, the only thing I'd add is something more of a macro comment. We make a
comment in my review, that we've got no exposure to cat events in Australia, in Japan, in
New Zealand in the First Quarter. My discussions with other CEOs in the industry over the
course of the last six or so weeks indicate to me that even more than earnings events
[ph], that's beginning to hit capital in the broader, largely global market. And we all know
that over time these things can have a knock-on effect into the UK market.
So but it's early days, I think, to see whether that's going to really happen. There's some, I
think, evidence of reinsurance rates starting to move through renewals coming through, in
July and in the latter parts of the year. And inexorably that tends to work through into the
primary market. So I think it will be an interesting three months coming up I think. But we
certainly feel that having frankly, sat here for two years saying this needs to come, it's
going to come, the first real evidence of it coming is now with us. But next three months
will be fascinating.

The next question comes from the line of Marcus Barnard from Oriel. Please go ahead
with your question.

Q - Marcus Barnard

{BIO 2103471 <GO>}

Yes, morning. I've got two very quick questions. Firstly on the MCEV per share you gave,
could you give us some idea of what impact the change in the tax rate had on that? I'm
assuming it's about 4p or 5p.
And secondly on the differential between MCEV per share and EEV per share, this was
79p at the end of the year. Can you confirm that this is about the same or if it's changed?
I'm not sure why MCEV -- if there's any one-off changes to the underlying assumptions or
asset values? Anyway, thanks.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

Okay, Marcus. Thank you. Good morning. Pat, do you want to comment on those two?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Sure. Thanks, Marcus. In terms of tax rate, it wouldn't have made much difference to
MCEV at all. No underlying changes (technical difficulty) to any of the underlying
assumptions. So the growth in MCEV was profits-driven, new business profits driven, the
market movements, because (technical difficulty) has corrected [ph] particularly in places
like the US. So it shouldn't be a great change in the differential to the EEV.

Our next question comes from the line of Andy Hughes from Exane BNP. Please go ahead
with your question.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Hi, guys. Just a quick follow up question on HSBC preferred partner disclosure. Just
wondering on the UK, what is the kind of preferred structure at the moment, if you were
to do something on the Life side, given that you changed the RBS scheme to be 100%
protection owned and not investment?
When you say preferred insurance partner does that distinguish it away from savings, or
should we look at something more on the protection side if you were to do anything?
Thank you.

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

I think in terms of structure we're not looking at a JV arrangement. It would be more a
commission-based arrangement, it simply means that they have given us a preferential
status in terms of opening up discussions with them. Mark?

A - Mark Hodges

{BIO 15503226 <GO>}

Yes. Absolutely. So too early talk about what the new -- any new model would look like.
But I think distribution as opposed to JV is a good assumption. In terms of products, it just
Page 29 of 30

means it opens up the whole of the UK for us. And obviously talks about Europe as well,
to conversations with HSBC, which is very exciting. And I think just shows again the
strength of the composite model here in the UK.

FINAL

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

We have to work hard, Andy, to win that business. But the point is we have our foot in the
door in a way which is better than our competition. It's just as simple as that. But they are - having worked with them for a long time myself, I know that they are a demanding
counterparty. And we look forward to making our credentials really clear to them in a
number of different geographies.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Yes. And there will be no competition issues with having Santander, RBS and HSBC in
some markets in the UK?

A - Andrew Moss

{BIO 3628034 <GO>}

No. We don't think there are. And we're very pleased with the footprint that we've got
now in the bancassurance space in the UK. And we intend to continue to build it.
