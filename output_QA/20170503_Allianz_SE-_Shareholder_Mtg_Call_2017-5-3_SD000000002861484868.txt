(foreign language) Ladies and gentlemen, dear shareholders, as Chairman of the
Supervisory Board, I hereby open the Annual General Meeting 2017 of Allianz SE. On
behalf of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management, I would like to welcome
all the shareholders present just as well as all the ladies and gentlemen of the
shareholders' associations, of the depository banks and of the press. I would also like to
welcome those shareholders who follow our AGM on the Internet. Our Annual General
Meeting will be broadcast in its entirety for shareholders of Allianz SE as in previous years.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's certainly also in your interest that we stick to a reasonable time
frame with our AGM. So that you have the opportunity to stay till the very end.
Therefore, I would like to just give you some brief organizational remarks. I'd ﬁrst like to
state that the AGM was convened in due time and form on the 22nd of March 2017. The
minutes of the AGM will be taken by notary public, Dr. Tilman GÃ¶tte. He's on stage here
with us. The assembly hall contains all areas of the Olympic hall (sic) (Olympiahalle) that
you could get in through following the entrance control. That includes the side rooms and
the smokers' area. But if you want to hand in a request to speak or motions and especially
if you want to vote later on, you need to come down to the ﬂoor of the hall, the so-called
arena. If you want to speak in the general debate, we would ask you -- we would kindly
ask you to hand in your request to speak as early as possible at the speakers' registration
desk right here at the front from the right on -- from my view on the right-hand side. At the
entrance gates, you have exchanged your tickets against an AGM card, which replaces as
last year the voting card block, which you might have been familiar with from earlier
AGMs. You need this AGM card to take part in the ballots. So please keep the AGM card
until the voting process starts. If you do possess several entrance tickets and haven't
exchanged all of them against AGM cards, you can do so until the beginning of the
ballots. That is the only way to make sure that all the shares represented by you will be
counted in the voting procedures. I will explain the details about the ballots later on
following the general debate. Once again, your votes will cast and counted with mobile
registration devices. And I would therefore ask you kindly to familiarize yourselves right
now with the remarks on the voting procedure, which you can ﬁnd on your AGM card. In

case you need to leave the AGM early on, please also follow the special remarks on the
back of your AGM card.
All the reports and the documents required by law are present at the speakers'
registration desk where you can look into them. And they've also been published on the
Internet. If you want to hand in any documents, especially for the notary public, please do
so exclusively at the speakers' registration desk or you can also ﬁnd a representative of
the notary public.
The list of participants can be viewed in electronic form on the screens. And it will be
updated continuously until the end of today's AGM. You can ﬁnd the screens in the back
part of the arena. So down here on the ﬂoor.
I would like to inform you that video and voice recordings in the assembly hall are
prohibited, just as recordings of the online broadcast of our AGM. And I would also ask
you to switch oﬀ your mobile phones during the AGM here in the Olympiahalle.

So much on the organizational remarks. And now ladies and gentlemen, the members of
the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are all present today. And before I
turn to the agenda, I would like to inform you about some changes on the Board of
Management of Allianz SE, which have happened since the last Annual General Meeting.
At the end of June 2016, following his own wish, Mr. Jay Ralph left the Board of
Management in order to be able to spend more time with his family. Mr. Ralph had been
working in diﬀerent positions for Allianz since 1997. He started as CEO of Allianz Risk
Transfer in Zurich. Following that, he was the CEO of our reinsurance unit. And in 2010, he
then joined the Board of Management of Allianz SE, where he was last responsible for
Asset Management and our U.S. insurance business. Over his close to 20 years of work for
Allianz, Mr. Ralph has performed a great deal and has done a lot of eﬀort for Allianz. And
the Supervisory Board has paid tribute to his merits and thanked him explicitly.
Moreover, on the 31st of December 2016, Dr. Maximilian Zimmerer, with the end of his
term, entered into his well-deserved retirement. After joining Allianz in 1988, Dr. Zimmerer
used to work for more than 28 years for Allianz, focusing on the investment management
and life, health areas. From 2006 until 2012, he was the Chairman of the Board of Allianz
Lebensversicherungs-AG in Stuttgart. In the year 2012, he switched on to the Board of
Management of Allianz SE where he was responsible for capital investment in the Life and
Health insurance business. The Supervisory Board thanks Dr. Zimmerer for his longstanding commitment and especially for his prudent and successful asset management,
with which he steered us through diﬀerent capital market crises. So ladies and gentlemen,
I think can also thank Mr. Ralph and Dr. Zimmerer on your behalf once again cordially at
this occasion. And we wish them all the best for the future and good health above all.
As new members of the board, I would like to welcome onstage Ms. Jacqueline Hunt and
Dr. GÃ¼nther Thallinger. Ms. Hunt was appointed to the Board of Management of Allianz
SE on the 1st of July 2016 and Dr. Thallinger with eﬀect from the 1st of January 2017. Ms.
Hunt is responsible on the board for Asset Management and our Life Insurance business

in the United States. Ms. Hunt has long years of experience in the insurance industry. And
before entering Allianz, she used to work on the Board of Management of Prudential in
London. Ms. Hunt, may I ask you to just brieﬂy introduce yourself to our shareholders?

Jacqueline Hunt

{BIO 16204866 <GO>}

Dear shareholders and investors, I'm very glad that I may present myself today to you. My
name is Jackie Hunt. And ever since July of last year, I've been responsible for Asset
Management and the Life Insurance business in the United States. I was born in South
Africa. I'm married and do have 2 children. I'm looking forward to the challenges at
Allianz. And I thank you very much for your trust.

Helmut Perlet

{BIO 1469645 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Ms. Hunt. Dr. Thallinger is responsible for investment management.
He's taken over the responsibility from Dr. Zimmerer. After some advisory work, Dr.
Thallinger joined Allianz in 2009. And he was responsible at Allianz Investment
Management SE -- ﬁrst as a CFO and then since 2012 as CEO. Mr. Thallinger, may I also
ask you to just brieﬂy introduce yourself to our shareholders?

Bloomberg Transcript

GÃ¼nther Thallinger
Yes. My name's GÃ¼nther Thallinger. And as been mentioned, I've been responsible for
investment management and the centers of Competence, Life and Health Insurance since
the 1st of January. I'm a mathematician by profession. I live in Cologne and we have 3
children. And you can ﬁnd additional details in our CVs. So let me just take the
opportunity to thank the colleagues of Allianz and especially the team in the investment
management area because they, above all, were the ones who made it able for me to be
onstage here today.

Helmut Perlet

{BIO 1469645 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Mr. Thallinger. I may certainly also speak on your behalf, ladies and
gentlemen, in wishing new members of the board a lot of success and a lot of joy in their
new ﬁelds of responsibility.
Now I would like to inform you about the upcoming changes on the Board of
Management. We had to note -- with regret that towards the end of the year, Dr. Wemmer
and Dr. Zedelius, following their own wishes, will leave the Board of Management of
Allianz SE. The Supervisory Board with eﬀect of the 1st of January 2018 has appointed the
gentleman, Giulio Terzariol and Niran Peiris as new members of the Board of
Management. The presentation of the new members and also our praise to the
gentlemen leaving will be done in the next AGM. With the end of today's AGM, moreover,
some members of the Supervisory Board will leave their oﬃces. On the employees' side,
we have Mr. Dante Barban.
Due to the changes in employee numbers for the new Supervisory Board, a
representative of the United Kingdom needed to be elected, instead of a representative

from Italy.
On the shareholders' side, Professor KÃ¶cher and Dr. Bernotat are onstage today for the
last time. They've both belonged to our bodies since 2003. In line with our goals for the
composition of the Supervisory Board, they therefore cannot be reelected. Professor
KÃ¶cher, gentlemen, I think I can speak on everyone's behalf and thank you cordially for
the many years of your valuable and very fruitful support. Overall, these years, you've
been a great gift for Allianz, which owes you a great deal. That is why it's important for me
to thank you once again at this juncture. (Ms.) KÃ¶cher has asked for the opportunity to
speak now.

Ladies and gentlemen, not just Mr. Barban, Dr. Bernotat and myself will be leaving the
Supervisory Board of Allianz SE but also Dr. Perlet. And on behalf of the Supervisory
Board, I'd like to say a few words about that.
Dear, Dr. Perlet, Allianz owes you a great deal. More than 40 years, you've made great
contributions to make sure that the company is in the position that it is in now. For 12
years, you were responsible for controlling ﬁnances and risk management on the Board of
Management during very diﬃcult times because this was the time of the ﬁnancial and
markets crisis. And for companies such as Allianz, that of course was a huge challenge.
But the company came out of this challenge in a strengthened and more powerful way.
Over the past ﬁve years, you've been the Chairman of the Supervisory Board. And you've
coined the work on this body in your very own way. For our work, it was -- not just that
your expertise and knowledge about the whole ﬁnancial sector that was important to
Allianz. But, above all, your way of managing and controlling this body in a very factual
manner, straightforward and relaxed also, in an open and also very cooperative manner.
Your connection to the Supervisory Board but also to the Board of Management was
always coined by integrity and trust. You were always focused on the company and not on
yourself. And with this combination of skills of character and support, you've been a gift to
the company. For the Supervisory Board. But certainly also on your behalf, dear
shareholders, I would like to thank you, Dr. Perlet, cordially for your long-standing and
tireless work for the company. And I would like to wish you all the best for the future.
Thank you very much.

Helmut Perlet

{BIO 1469645 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Ms. KÃ¶cher for your friendly words even though you've come a
little too far in praising my merits, I would think. But I have to admit that I've been very
glad about this. So once again, thank you very much.
So ladies and gentlemen, even though I won't fully leave the Supervisory Board with the
end of today's AGM, provided you will elect me as proposed for the short time frame until
the 6th of May to the new Supervisory Board, nevertheless, this will be my last AGM as
your Chairman for the Supervisory Board. Since you elected me in May 2012 and to the
Supervisory Board, we've gone through what I believe has been a remarkable
development of Allianz. Even in its 127th year of existence, Allianz proves once again the

power and substance that it has. I will leave the oﬃce with a lot of good memories but
especially with gratefulness towards my colleagues and the Supervisory Board for the
cooperation that's always been highly constructive but also with gratefulness towards the
Board of Management for the close, uncomplicated and trustful cooperation but above
all, with thankfulness towards you, dear shareholders, for the trust you've put in me. I'm
very glad that I was -- that I've been able to work so long in a prominent position for
Allianz. I would ask you to stay loyal to Allianz also in the future.
Ladies and gentlemen, with this, we will now enter into today's agenda. I call upon
agenda item 1, the presentation of the approved annual ﬁnancial statements and the
approved consolidated ﬁnancial statements as of December 31, 2016. And of the
management reports for Allianz SE and for the group, the explanatory reports on the
information pursuant to section 289 4 (sic) (section 289 paragraph 4) and 315 of German
Commercial Code as well as the report of the Supervisory Board for ﬁscal year 2016. First
of all, I would like to present the documents. The annual ﬁnancial statements of Allianz SE
and the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as well as the respective management reports
were audited by KPMG AG WirtschaftsprÃ¼fungsgesellschaft and deemed in good order.
The auditors handed unqualiﬁed auditors' opinions for both statements. Board of
Management and auditors presented the documents to the auditing -- Audit Committee
and the plenary session of the Supervisory Board. And the Supervisory Board, after
detailed assessment then, deemed them in good order. And therefore, the annual
statements of Allianz SE have been approved.
Ladies and gentlemen, that brings me to the report of the Supervisory Board. In the ﬁscal
year 2016, we had 6 plenary meetings and in addition, there were 18 meetings of
Supervisory Board committees. You will ﬁnd a detailed presentation of the work of the
Supervisory Board in the group management report on Pages 5 and following. But let me
just pick a few focal points. In all meetings of the Supervisory Board, the Board of
Management explained the business development in the diﬀerent segments and regions
in detail. Amongst the most important focal points, we didn't just have the Renewal
Agenda of the Board of Management and its implementation. But we also looked at the
continuous diﬃcult capital market conditions and their inﬂuence on our risk strategy, on
capital investment and the business in Life and Health insurance. Further focal points were
the changed political framework conditions, the switch of our auditing company from
ﬁscal year 2018 on and the preparation of today's Supervisory Board elections for the
AGM.
Let me just say a few words about the compensation of the Board of Management and the
Supervisory Board. You can ﬁnd more detailed explanations in our Remuneration Report
on Pages 24 and following in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
The compensation system for the Board of Management, especially the ﬁxed component
but also the variable targets component, has remained unchanged compared to the
previous year. The assessment and the -- of the performance, achievements regarding the
variable compensation is based on the ﬁnancial success of Allianz and the
implementation of the Renewal Agenda of the Board of Management. We take into
account the individual achievements of the board members when assessing these ﬁgures.

The Supervisory Board deems the compensation of our Board of Management
appropriate. The compensation of the Supervisory Board has also remained unchanged.
It is a pure, ﬁxed compensation. And the membership in diﬀerent committees of the
Supervisory Board will then be remunerated accordingly. Part of the work of the
Supervisory Board is also to look at standards of good governance. And details on the
development of corporate governance of the Allianz Group can be found in the
declaration on corporate governance and the corporate governance report, both
contained in our management report from Page 14 onwards.
Board of Management and Supervisory Boards signed the Declaration on Conformity
regarding the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in
December in 2016 and published the declaration on the website of the company. All in
all, we follow all the recommendations and suggestions of the code in its version of the
5th of May 2015.
Ladies and gentlemen, against the backdrop of a continuously diﬃcult economic
environment with signiﬁcant political changes, Allianz once again improved its
competitiveness in the year 2016, especially looking at proﬁtability and the capital basis
that we have. So the remarkable result of the previous years was conﬁrmed once again.
And we've justiﬁed the trust brought into us by investors, customers and employees.

Bloomberg Transcript

The good result of Allianz is in large part due to the exemplary eﬀorts of all our
employees but also due to a successful and future-oriented management. I'm certain that
I can also talk, on your behalf, ladies and gentlemen, in thanking both the management
but also all our employees for the committed and successful work.
So ladies and gentlemen, before I will hand over for the reports of the management to
our CEO, Mr. Oliver BÃ¤te, I would like to say a few words about the strategy of Allianz
and its implementation. In the recent past, some of you might have gotten the feeling that
in the implementation of our strategy, not everyone is pulling into the same direction. But
I can assure you that, not just the Supervisory Board fully supports the strategy of the
Board of Management, also in our organization, there is broad agreement regarding our
strategy. And the management is working in a very committed way towards implementing
this strategy. But in successful companies. And Allianz without a doubt is a successful
company, there will always be some dissatisﬁed people who do not recognize the
necessity to further development in view of an environment which is quickly changing. But
with our strategy, we respond to this necessity. This is not a revolutionary strategy but an
evolutionary one but with necessary, appropriately high speed of implementation. With
these remarks, I would like to end the reports, reporting of the Supervisory Board and ask
you, Mr. BÃ¤te, for the report of the management. Mr. BÃ¤te, the ﬂoor is yours.

Oliver BÃ¤te
Yes. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, dear shareholders. Thank you very much, Mr.
Perlet, for your nice words. And also on behalf of the board of Allianz SE, I'm also
welcoming you to this year's AGM for ﬁscal year 2016.

Let me start with the key messages that I would like to render today and also that I will
also back up with a few more details later. Strong in the core business 2016, your Allianz
has again generated a very strong result in a diﬃcult environment. Committed to change,
the realization of the program of Renewal Agenda is gaining momentum. It's important
because when Mr. Perlet mentioned that we're using our strength in order to get ready for
the key changes that are coming up, speciﬁcally when it comes to digitalization.
Attractive for you, our shareholders. So the development of the share price in 2016 was
much above our competitors. At the same time, we are reducing excess capital as
promised. And we'd like to increase the dividend to EUR 7.60 per share. And also
rendering our high contributions for all groups of interest, basically, we're working for
you, our shareholders. But also we are aware of our social responsibility. And EUR 138
billion of from money was ﬂowing to our customers, employees, our distribution partners,
to the tax authorities and to you, our shareholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

Just let's look at shortly into the environment. If you look the great ﬁgures of Allianz, you
might easily forget that the competitive environment last year was anything than pleasant.
So apart from market volatility and regulations that challenged us, we are ﬁghting with
ongoing low interest rates. Last year at the middle of the year, the interest were even
negative, something as an economist you would never ever think of. And also on the
political scene, the Brexit was not ended. And we can't wait to see the results in France.
Before that, political development would not have that -- such a huge inﬂuence on the
market.
So given that scenario, I'm quite happy to say that EUR 10.8 billion operating proﬁt and
EUR 6.9 billion net proﬁt for our shareholders we've rendered a great result, 4% more
than in the previous year. Dividend per share has increased by 4.1%. And also that's the
fourth dividend increase in a row. And the equity, here, it was set at 12%, which is great
and is slightly below what we had thought for because we thought our equity basis was
increased strongly. That's a luxury problem. Asset solvency was 218%. That was at the
upper level of what we expected to do. As you can see, also in our 127th year of its
existence, your Allianz was able to convince with strong performance and trust.
Now let me talk about a few details and ﬁnancial ﬁgures on the segment level because all
areas of Allianz have contributed to the success of the company. As you know, we're
diﬀerentiating the P&C, Life and Health and Asset Management. These are the major
sectors of reporting, our strategic management.
In P&C, we showed a solid internal growth of 3.1%, which is a historic challenge, meaning
that this segment is not growing worldwide apart from a few areas in Asia. With a
combined ratio of 94.3%, we're closer to the target COR of 2018 of 94%. Now the results
have improved because our diﬃcult portfolios like, for example, in Latin America, we
consistently worked on that. And that's why the result in Latin America improved by EUR
18 million alone. And we hope that we're going to (plug) ﬁgures after three years of
making losses there. And the 13.1% return on equity, for our industry, we are receiving a
very good value. A lot of our competitors would like to be that proﬁtable. And also in Life
and Health, despite the challenges of the low interest rates, we are quite happy,
particularly because our cost -- colleagues in the main country entities have continued to

FINAL

improve the product mix, which also resulted in our new business margin despite the
lower interest. So we were able to go up by 0.5percentage points to 2.7%. This trend will
go on in this year. And please remember, 3%, new business margin, that'll be the target
for 2018. And we're getting closer with big steps.
The sale of the Korean life business had a strongly positive eﬀect, ﬁrst of all, on our
solvency and, as it is shown on the Solvency II, our capital ratio. And this also have a
positive inﬂuence on our proﬁtability this year. Please remember last year, we had EUR
450 (sic) (EUR 450 million) that we had to take as losses. All in all, despite these special
burdens in life, health, we had EUR 4.1 billion of operating income that led to a record
level and a record result and a 2-digit return on equity despite 10.3% and despite that
expenses. And we are receiving the return on equity of 10.3%. A lot of competitors look at
Allianz.

Bloomberg Transcript

In our third segment, in Asset Management, we had a lot of challenges since 2013
because of the management crises within PIMCO. That has been overcome since 2016.
We not only have a new management team but also an excellent investment
performance. As a consequence, in the second half year, that led to net inﬂows of more
than EUR 11 billion, after continuous net outﬂows since the Third Quarter of 2013, notably.
And we're quite happy that the disputes with Bill Gross were settled this year. That means
PIMCO is fully on track again. And as you're going to hear, this year again, the business is
running excellently.
We should not forget Allianz Global Investors. Our second investment subsidiary showed
an excellent yearly operating proﬁt worth of EUR 543 million on absolute record level.
And we're particularly proud of our Allianz Global Investment colleagues.
And if you take a look at these results, all these segments of Allianz have developed
excellently. And I'm quite proud that despite having temporary diﬃculties with PIMCO,
that the entire Allianz team was able to compensate. And if you render a lot of work, then
the performance would come back. That is a strong company. But it's not only our
ﬁnancial ﬁgures that were outstanding. But also we made progress in the implementation
of our Renewal Agenda. And I would like to now show you a few examples in order to
show you the progress for the individual areas.
As you can see on this page, we addressed 5 important triggers and levers and the most
important is the customer centricity.
Last year, 55% of all Allianz entities reached a customer satisfaction level above market
average, which is 5% more than in the previous year. And when you look at the more
critical environment, that is not a matter of (calls)-- and now I'd particularly (today) say
thanks to the employees because you are the ones who have to render these services for
your customers. The second main lever in the ﬁeld of our Renewal Agenda and consistent
customer orientation is the new implementation of a method in order to design a core
process as we've done this in 24 of our units last year. And in the years to come, we are
going to continue working on that. The key change is that we're not only looking at
individual customer experience and measure an individual segment like for one call in a

Page 8 of 14

FINAL

call center. But we're also analyzing the entire customer process from claim notiﬁcation all
the way to payout. And we're analyzing that integratively. And that helps us to service our
customers much better.
Consistent digitialization, that is deﬁnitely a focus on our customers. And digital, by
default, is not a matter in itself. And with the introduction of our Global Digital Factory in
Munich and in some of our major entities, we have made progress and (grew) across
groups from customer perspective, calls and processes are being redesigned. And they
will be changed systematically over the years to come.
In addition, the productivity improvements are on track when it comes to implementation.
Like in the past and like we discussed, these productivity improvements will be reinvested
for the further development of the company.

Bloomberg Transcript

So when it comes to technical excellence, as I mentioned before, the composition of the
product mix develops even better than planned. And in addition, the sale of the Korea
business that was running in the deﬁcits. And that was a diﬃcult transaction. In the P&C,
initiatives about technical excellence are running according to plan, which is also
expressed in the very good combined ratio. And then we can add more here.
So with regard to growth ﬁelds, in 2016, we set up strategic partnerships with important
banks. And we expanded them in line of the growth engines. I'd like to say thanks to our
partners, Commerzbank, Unicredit, Vereinsbank, Santander also Standard Chartered for
the trust they put in us. And we ﬁnd that we are a partner of the choice for the leading
banks in the world and were an important growth source for Allianz in the future. And
also, we're also working on unproﬁtable activities, they're either being improved or, like in
the case of Korea, we consistently stopped them. And also, we have lots of ideas for
further growth, even externally. But when it comes to external growth, we keep continuing
to be quite working in details. And we're going to use capital in a careful manner.
When it comes to leadership culture, this is measured with a particularly specialized index
that has improved last year from an index value of 68% going up to 70%. So by 2018, we
want to lift it up to 72%. And it's quite important for us that we are going to attain this
target. And for that, on a group-wide level, we have used an analysis basis and an
evaluation basis and system for management, executives that have already reached 5,000
executives worldwide. What is the key change?
So our executives in the future will not only (be) measured by the result they generated
but even more strongly, we will also evaluate them based on their personal leadership
behavior, not only which results are being achieved. But how are they being achieved.
That is a fundamental change that we have to exercise. And it's going to be an important
contribution to our culture.
Now I'd like to talk about sustainability. Sustainability played -- continued to play an
important role for our strategy in 2016. That's why we're particularly happy for internal
results and successes and external awards. Further, to internal success. So the investment
into renewable energies was further increased in the past ﬁve years. They increased by
Page 9 of 14



Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2017-05-03

FINAL

254% to EUR 4.6 billion. In the same period, the energy consumption per employee was
reduced by more than 20%. At the same time, our so-called Employee Engagement Index
increased, which reﬂects the motivation level of our employees. That increased by
5percentage points. And the number of transactions and the investments that we're
carrying out have increased since 2014 by 239%. That means we keep checking whether
our investments and insurance decisions are also related and in consistency with the ESG
guidelines.
Ladies and gentlemen, that's why we have received a few major awards that are listed
here. There are many more. And the Board of Management and the employees and,
speciﬁcally, the young employees are really happy about these awards. And also, this is
covered by our claim to have a forward-looking approach to create long-term value for
you, our shareholders. And we're on a good track in this way.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now let me call the equity story (inaudible) the value levers of Allianz. Also in 2016, all
value levers were changes. There are 3. The most important element is the protection
downwards, as we call it. First of all, we're oﬀering our strong capital position. And by this,
we are oﬀering a very solid risk proﬁle. And global diversiﬁcation of our units provides a
good hedging against shocks whereas risk management is a core capacity. As Mr. Perlet
just mentioned it before, out of the 3 ﬁnancial crises of the last decade, we have learned.
And we keep on learning because there are new risks coming up. So for example, cyber
risks. But also the topic of reputation in the environment of digitalization.
So the second important value driver for you as shareholders are our attractive dividend
policy. And I'd like to talk about that in more detail in a minute. So we'd like to propose to
increase dividend by 4% to EUR 7.60. That is the fourth dividend increase in sequence.
And beyond that, the promise of the Board of Management from November 2014 that we
don't use excess capital just lying around. And in fact, we'd like to give it back to you. And
that's why we fulﬁll it. And that's why we have a share buyback amounting to a total of
EUR 3 billion. This share buyback has been running since the 17th of February this year. So
shares amounting to EUR 1.1 billion were bought back. And you can check the current
status of this share buyback in the Investor Relations portal in the Internet.
The third value driver is what we call potential upwards (sic) (upside potential). That
means unused proﬁt potential. There's a lot. So we want to increase the share -- growth
per share by over 5%. And we want to use the economies of scales and in our program of
Renewal Agenda. And we want to achieve it by that. In order to make this clearer, despite
special or extraordinary expenses by the sale of the Korean business resulting in EUR 454
million of further costs of the second settlement of Fireman's Fund and also the follow-up
expenses from the PIMCO crises or losses in Latin America, we still had proﬁt growth of
4% last year. That was not easy. And I'm very proud of our colleagues.
Let me talk about the dividend policy and give you some more insight that we have
clariﬁed. Fifty % of the dividend will be disposed on a regular basis. And I'd like to remind
you we want to promise dividend continuity that even if there are ﬂuctuations in the
annual surplus, dividend still needs to be held on the level of the previous year. That is
our claim. So those funds that we don't disperse, we want to use in order to ﬁnance
growth and, like I mentioned before, in order to support the dividend continuity if

needed. But basically, if it cannot be used for attaining growth, we are going to use and
reduce excess capital ﬂexibly. And that's why in 2017, we started the ﬁrst share buyback in
the history of our company. And as you can tell by the capital market reactions that -- -obviously, that was a good decision.
Like I mentioned before, Allianz is not only working for its shareholders but also for many
interest groups of our society. And we are fully aware of this responsibility. Let me start
with our most groups of interests, which are our customers who are paying our salaries
and, at the end of the day, they're also paying our dividend as well. Our customers have -86 million and the customer satisfaction is at 55% of our units, above the market average,
5% more than in the previous year. Then 75% of our units want -- will be kept above
market average. And we're doing ﬁne. And it's important to have the conﬁdence of our
customers. We're one of the few companies that received the AA rating. Our
capitalization is even stronger than the AA rating.
The second most important interest group is our employees. So we have roughly 140,000
employees in more than 70 countries. So in Germany, you can forget about that. I mean,
thanks very much for the employees for their great performance. And we've got EUR 11.7
billion from -- that we paid for salaries and pensions and other and social beneﬁts.

Our distribution partners make us really successful. So there's a total of 152,000
representatives and that bear the Allianz logo and 200 banking partners and lots of other
broker companies who are relying on Allianz. And I would like to say thanks to their trust.
And we're also a taxpayer. You're likely to forget because a lot of large groups who don't
pay that many taxes. So we have a tax rate of 30%. And we're paying taxes in 50
countries. And through our performance for the shareholders, I was talking about that
already, it's just important to note that you'd get the overall picture about what Allianz is
doing for our society.
And at this point, I'd like to say thanks on behalf of my board members and to our
distributors and customers. So without your support, Allianz could never be that
successful. And my particular gratitude is for our 140,000 employees. So without their
continuous and committed performance, it would not be possible for Allianz to make this
and render this performance. So it's important that these virtues of competence, integrity
and sustainability will be rendered every day newly. Thank you very much. I'm so happy
about that.
Now I'd like to look back to the investors, performance -- on the performance of Allianz.
Each year, we're carrying out on investment survey, ladies and gentlemen, which is new.
And so we're asking about the strengths and weaknesses from the perspective of analysts
and investors. For that, over the past three years, I've always -- I've evaluated the investor
feedback. So let me talk about the weaknesses and strengths and then the eﬀects on the
share price.
Historical strengths of Allianz are the market position and the strength of the brand and
the progress in digitalization, related to the competitors. And also the capital

management. So how did we perform from the perspective of our investors? And how
have we changed? In 2014, 16% of our shareholders believe that we're doing ﬁne. Today,
we have 36% who believe that, speciﬁcally focusing on the strengthening of the good
units and improving the less performing units. When it comes to brand, 2014, there were
12% of our investors who believed that we were strong in this respect. And this value has
increased to 24% in 2014 (sic) (2016) by consistent brand management and continuous
business result. Digitalization, 2014, 4% of our investors thought this was a strength in
particular. Coming through our program these are 24% and we should never lose sight of
that. Capital management was at 16% in 2014 and is now 18%. EUR 3 billion of share
buyback and ﬂexible-ization of the capital management made their contribution.
But it's not only our strengths which we were able to increase from the perspective of
investments -- investors. But we also addressed our weaknesses. Two years ago, from the
perspective of investors, we had to identify 4 main weaknesses: ﬁrst of all, PIMCO; low
interest rates; the German life business; and also an intrinsically low growth of earnings.
So the feedback has developed. When still -- almost 50% thought in 2014 that PIMCO was
a problem. By the change now. And now, this went down to 18% who believe that it is still
a problem. New management, the strong investment performance and net inﬂows
instead of outﬂows make a key performance in this improved picture.

Bloomberg Transcript

Low interest rates doesn't go away. But it's extremely important for us, ladies and
gentlemen. It's not that we just watch. But instead, we should take measures on the capital
investment side, for example, by the expansion of alternative assets, which is a speciﬁc
merit of Mr. Zimmerer and Mr. Thallinger, I'd like to mention that. But also the sale of
Korea, that we're showing a strong deﬁcit and also the change of the life business that we
have been doing for a few years.
Then the German Life Insurance business, because of its size and because of those long
durations, that used to be a challenge. So 24% of those providing feedback thought in
2014 that this is the problem that went down to 18% because we focused on capital
eﬃcient products. And the low revenue growth, that was also a topic here, for 12%. And
it's still organic and it's much less a topic today because of the digitalization and also
capital management is deﬁnitely a good contribution in order to support the revenues
and proﬁt per share. So the Board of Management is quite proud that (about) we are able
to increase the strengths and reduce the weaknesses and that you also believe we're
addressing that. And we're not going to reduce these eﬀorts.
So what were the developments on the valuation of the Allianz share? During the past ﬁve
years, we've started to be compared in the STOXX Europe Insurance Index. That is
basically our competitors who are working in Europe and who are also facing the similar
challenges. So the orange line is put on 100. And if you look at the Allianz share price, you
can see -- you can be quite happy about the 5 past year, Allianz shareholder who started
in 2012 has tripled their stake. That is on 190%. That's the return. So we have increased the
index by 34% and outperformed it. And particularly, in '15 and '16 and in the years '17, we
were doing so continuously. And thank you very much to the employees as well. And we,
as Board of Management, can be quite proud. Thank you very much.

So dear shareholders, I would now like to give you a short overview about our targets for
2017. We're cautiously optimistic and, therefore, expect an operating result to the tune of
EUR 10.8 billion plus/minus EUR 500 million. And just to remind you, in the previous year,
the average point of our bandwidth had been at EUR 10.5 billion so below the EUR 10.8
billion. And we plan this even though, as was mentioned before, the low interest rates are
still reﬂected in our results. Moreover, I would like to give you some previous ﬁgures for
the First Quarter of 2017 that we're extremely proud of and with which I would like to
conﬁrm this outlook for 2017.
So in the First Quarter, we've reached an operating proﬁt of EUR 2.9 billion. Ladies and
gentlemen, this is 9.4% more than in the previous year's quarter. And with this, we already
reached 27%. So more than 1 quarter of the medium value we're aiming at. But please just
don't just multiply this by 4. It's not as easy as that. But the surplus for shareholders in the
quarter was at EUR 1.8 billion. That is 15.3% lower than in the previous year's quarter,
which is due to the fact that last year, we had one-oﬀ proﬁts from the sale of ﬁnancial
holdings in the First Quarter, which cannot be repeated obviously this year.
We do not have any precise ﬁgures regarding solvency. But what I can show you is that
our balance sheet continues to be very strong. We've published a press release today on
the cornerstones of the First Quarter. And Mr. Wemmer will inform you in detail about the
ﬁgures of the First Quarter on the 12th of May in proven quality. So on the basis of these
ﬁgures, we do take an optimistic view into the future even though our environment
remains highly diﬃcult as I've mentioned before. There's the topic of politics in addition
to market volatilities and the topic of the obvious polarization in our society should not
just be something that we take a look at. But we need to actively commit ourselves against
this. And we're well prepared for this environment. The last few months have,
nevertheless, shown that there are new challenges coming up time and again. So we
need to move and to respond to this. And that's the most important point. Allianz, in spite
of its results or because of its strong results, can't just be left standing there. We see the
positive side on the Board of Management our diversiﬁcation and the economies of scale,
which are especially important in the digital world and the consistent implementation of
our agenda -- of our Renewal Agenda, all this on the foundation of the virtues of Allianz:
of skills, of integrity and sustainability.
Ladies and gentlemen, we can only perform change with our employees. And that is a
point I would like to talk about now. Our employees are doing exemplary work because,
on the one hand, each and every one of them contributes to the strong results that we can
deliver time and again in our core business year-by-year across all the segments. On the
other hand, they support us. They support us in the reshaping of a group towards a more
customer-oriented company, which is especially well-prepared for the digital world.
Doing all this simultaneously is highly challenging. And I know that many of our
employees ask themselves what this will mean for them and their personal employment.
But I would like to ensure them, our employees. But also you, our shareholders, that we're
familiar. We know about these challenges. And we will not be just a part of that. But we
will be an active part of change.
So we need to look at new focal points and technology and digitalization and customer
orientation and leadership behavior. And this, as I said, before, will be put more into the

focus. And that makes me optimistic that we'll continue to be successful in our core
business. But also follow through with these necessary changes with a lot of energy. So
dear shareholders, you can be certain that we'll continue to do the utmost to fully seize
the potential of your Allianz. So please be loyal to us even though -- even if the headwinds
might be stronger again in the future than they used to be for some time.
Finally, I would like to talk to some of the supporters, who have a great share in making
sure that we had this great result of Allianz. First of all, I would like to thank the colleagues
on the Board of Management for the strong year 2016 but also to the Supervisory Board
for their support to -- during these times of change. Now I would especially like to
mention my colleagues on the board who have their last AGM today and without whose
great contribution, that wouldn't have been possible. Dr. Zedelius will have been 30 years
at Allianz on the 1st of August 2017. So thank you very much for your support. And the
same holds true for Dr. Zimmerer who will -- who left us at the end of 2016 after 28 years
at Allianz. Thank you for coming today. Thank you for your great personal support. Then
ﬁnally, I would also like to thank Dr. Wemmer. Without your work, Allianz wouldn't be as
resistant as it is today. So thank you very much to the 3 gentlemen.

And even though Ms. KÃ¶cher has already spoken also on behalf of the Board of
Management as well as that's how I felt, thank you very much for your great speech, Ms.
KÃ¶cher. I would nevertheless like to thank Mr. Perlet myself, not just as the Chairman of
the Supervisory Board. But also I would also like to thank him as my mentor. So thank you
very much for your advice and your support and all the best for your future, where you will
stay loyal to Allianz. And I'm looking forward to that. So ladies and gentlemen, with this, I
