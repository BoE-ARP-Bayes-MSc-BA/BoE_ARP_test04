Thanks, Peter. Good morning, everyone. I'll start the call today on the same format we've
used for the last couple of calls with me starting off with some high-level comments. Then
I will flip it over to Jeff to discuss the financial results. And finally, I'll come back to provide
more detail on our book of business and the market.

Bloomberg Transcript

2013 was a strong year for us, and we are pleased to report growth in tangible book
value per share plus accumulated dividends of 19.7%. We also posted strong results for
the Fourth Quarter.
Our performance benefited from excellent underwriting and solid investment returns.
Having had another year lacking in significant cat events is a double-edged sword for our
industry. On the one hand, results were strong and capital positions were boosted further.
This resulted in abundant capacity.
On the other hand, for 2013, demand remained roughly flat in aggregate with reduced
purchases by some large savings offset by some increased buying in Florida. That
resulted in pressure on pricing heading into January's renewals. We anticipated rate
reductions, but the deterioration in pricing at 1-1 was in fact greater than we expected.
And I will talk more about that in a few minutes. Consequently, we are revising our
guidance, as Jeff will outline in a moment.
In light of the increased competition, we focus more than ever on serving our clients by
expanding our footprint and growing our product offerings. We are consistent in the way
we approach the market and we are able to allocate the most efficient capital to the best
risks, structuring products to provide more options to our clients.
Our Lloyd's unit continued to make good progress in building out its business and had a
good year in 2013. We strengthened our underwriting capabilities there and deepened
our team to better compete in the market. We expect continued improvements in this
business for 2014 as we see greater benefits of scale.

FINAL

During 2013, our ventures team worked hard to deliver excellent results on an expected
basis and on an actual basis whether through DaVinci, Top Layer or various limited light
vehicle such as Upsilon. Although we kept DaVinci the same size year-over-year, we
brought on new, high quality long-term capital partners. We remain focused on bringing
capital to markets when needed by our clients and withdrawing it when it is not, increasing
the size of UpsilonRe and nonrenewing Tim Re III.
Compared with 2012, this was a relatively light year for share repurchases. Nonetheless,
we bought back over $200 million of our stock, paid down debt, and refinanced half our
perpetual preferred stock at very attractive levels. We remain committed to intelligently
managing capital, deploying it in the business when appropriate, and returning it when it is
efficient to do so.
I'll discuss the market conditions in more detail, but let me turn the call over to Jeff to go
over our results.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. In my prepared remarks, I will cover our results
for the Fourth Quarter and full-year 2013, and also give you an update to our 2014 topline
forecast.
We reported solid Fourth Quarter results which capped off a very profitable year for the
company. Many of the trends, such as low cat losses and strong investment performance,
were ones that we saw play out through most of the year. Results in the quarter also
benefited from reserve releases.
For the Fourth Quarter, we reported net income of $269 million or $6.05 per diluted share
and operating income of $207 million or $4.64 per diluted share. The annualized operating
ROE was 24.3% for the Fourth Quarter.
For the full year 2013, we reported operating income of $631 million at an operating ROE
of 19.4%. For the full year 2013, we reported a combined ratio of 43.8% and underwriting
income of $627 million.
Our tangible book value per share, including a change in accumulated dividends,
increased 8.1% in the Fourth Quarter and was up 19.7% for the full year 2013, benefiting
from strong underwriting results and favorable investment results.
Before covering the segment results, please note that we made a slight change to our
financial reporting in that we now report Catastrophe Reinsurance and Specialty
Reinsurance as separate segments. In prior periods, we had reported them separately
and then also aggregated them to constitute the Consolidated Reinsurance segment.
The change made here is only in presentation and does not affect any of the figures we
have previously reported for catastrophe or Specialty Reinsurance.

FINAL

Turning to the cat unit results for the full year 2013, managed cat gross premiums written
totaled $1.2 billion. Managed cat premiums declined 2.1% compared with a year ago when
adjusted for $24 million of net negative reinstatement premiums in 2013 and $18 million of
net reinstatement premiums in the prior-year period. This compares with our guidance for
the full year 2013 for a decline of 10% in managed cat premiums.
As we referenced earlier this year, full-year premiums included $66 million related to
quota share transactions. We also had $27 million of premium related to a three-year
transaction for which premiums were booked upfront during the Second Quarter of the
year. Adjusted for these two transactions, managed cat gross premiums written declined
approximately 9.5% in 2013, which is obviously a bit closer to our original guidance.
The Fourth Quarter combined ratio for the cat segment was negative 12.8%. Reserve
releases totaled $59 million in the quarter. Most of the favorable development related to
recent large cat events, including Storm Sandy of $45 million, the Tohoku earthquake of
$13 million, and the second New Zealand earthquake by $6 million. This was slightly offset
by a $9 million increase to our loss estimate for the 2010 New Zealand earthquake.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Fourth Quarter accident year loss ratio was a negative 3.7%, primarily due to low loss
activity and a $14 million reduction to our loss estimate for the Central European flooding
which we had booked in the Second Quarter of the 2013 underwriting year. For the full
year 2013, the cat segment generated an underwriting profit of $559 million and a 22.8%
combined ratio, again reflecting generally benign loss activity and $102 million of favorable
reserve development.
Specialty Reinsurance gross premiums written increased 24% for the full-year period 2013
to $260 million when compared with the year-ago period. This was well above our
guidance for the full year 2013, which was for slight growth.
As we have cautioned many times before, percentage growth rates for this segment can
be uneven on a quarterly basis given the relatively small premium basis.
The Specialty segment generated a $23 million underwriting profit and a 58.3% combined
ratio for the Fourth Quarter as loss activity was generally benign. Favorable reserve
development totaled $11 million in the quarter. For the full year, Specialty Reinsurance
generated an underwriting profit of $74 million and a combined ratio of 65.6%, also
reflecting low loss experience and $34 million at favorable reserve development.
In our Lloyd's segment, gross premiums written increased 42% to $227 million for the full
year 2013 as we have continued to expand our franchise there in profitable, diversifying
classes of business. The Lloyd's segment came in at an underwriting loss of $3 million and
a combined ratio of 106.3% for the Fourth Quarter. Loss activity for this segment was also
generally light and favorable reserve development totaled $5 million. The expense ratio
remained relatively elevated at 50.5% but has been consistently declining sequentially as
business volume has increased. For the full year, the segment generated an underwriting
loss of $5 million and a combined ratio of 102.9%.

FINAL

Our investment portfolio was a strong contributor to operating and net income during the
quarter. We reported net investment income of $79 million in the Fourth Quarter, which
was driven by a few factors.
Recurring investment income from fixed maturity investments remained under pressure
due to low yields on our bond portfolio and totaled $25 million in the Fourth Quarter.
However, our alternative investment portfolio generated a solid gain of $55 million in the
Fourth Quarter, driven by a couple of factors.
The private equity portfolio continued to perform well with a $15 million gain. Alternative
investments also included a $38 million gain related to the upward marked-to-market
adjustment for our investment in Essent, reflecting the difference between the valuation
of the company at the end of the Third Quarter and at the time of its IPO on October 31.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, while not included in net investment income, the appreciation in the value of the
Essent stock following the IPO resulted in $36 million of unrealized gains on the portfolio
through the end of the year. Recall that we had stated on the Third Quarter conference
call that, following the IPO, we would begin to report Essent as a part of our equity trading
portfolio. Subsequent changes in the value of the stock are reflected through realized and
unrealized gains and losses and as such are excluded from operating income.
The total investment return on the overall portfolio was a healthy 2.1% for the Fourth
Quarter and 3.6% for the full year. We are pleased with the performance of our
investment portfolio and especially given the low interest rate environment and the
increase seen in interest rates during the year. We believe our strategy of maintaining a
high quality, liquid and short duration portfolio is the right one in the current environment.
Our ventures team had an active Fourth Quarter and early this year announced the
formation of a third iteration of UpsilonRe targeting primarily structured aggregate
reinsurance and retro deals on a worldwide basis. Capital for the vehicle was provided by
third-party investors and us.
On January 1, we also made the decision to return $300 million of capital to the
shareholders of DaVinci in the form of an annual dividend, bringing the capital of that
vehicle to roughly the same size as it was a year ago. We will continue to right-size the
overall capacity that we bring to the marketplace given the current opportunities. Inclusive
of other transactions completed over the course of the year, our ownership in DaVinci
stood at 26.5% at January 1.
During the Fourth Quarter, we continued with our share repurchase program, buying back
729,000 shares for a total of $67 million. For the full year 2013, we repurchased 2.5 million
shares for an aggregate cost of $208 million. So far this year, through end of day
yesterday, we have repurchased roughly 1 million shares for an aggregate cost of $93
million.
Given the strong growth in our capital base in 2013 and the more limited opportunity sets
to deploy it in the business, we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders

FINAL

over the course of the year and anticipate share repurchases will remain our preferred
method of doing so. We ended 2013 in a very strong capital liquidity position and continue
to have industry-leading financial strength and enterprise risk management ratings.
Finally, let me turn to update our topline forecast for 2014. For managed cat, we currently
expect premiums to be down about 15% in 2014, excluding the impact of reinstatement
premiums. This compares with our prior guidance for managed cat premiums to decline
10% during the year.
In Specialty Reinsurance, we are maintaining our topline guidance of up 15%. Keep in mind
that growth in the segment can be uneven due to the relatively small size of the premium
base.
And in our Lloyd's segment, we still expect premiums to be up over 20%. Recall here too
this growth is off a relatively small premium base and we remain in the building phase of
this platform.
Finally, as always, I would remind everyone that premium estimates of this nature are
subject to considerable risk and uncertainty. Our goal in providing them to you is to give
you our best estimates at this time.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin.

Bloomberg Transcript

Kevin O'Donnell
Thanks, Jeff. As I mentioned, the renewal at 1-1 was a challenging one with rates down
more than we expected and placements completed earlier than in the past.
I think there are a couple of interesting comments to be made here. Although the decline
in rates was meaningful, it was largely acceptable, by which we mean that after
recognizing each premium dollar has less profit embedded in it, we were able to build an
attractive portfolio.
We often discuss cat reinsurance business in terms of three buckets -- attractive, low
return and negative return. Because our long-standing relationships, established track
record and disciplined underwriting, we continue to find opportunities in the attractive
bucket, maintaining our share, even growing in some instances on lines we wanted most.
However, to give some context, our exposures are relatively flat year-on-year.
Much of the international market is at levels below our return hurdle. However, a
substantial portion of our international book consists of private deals and bespoke
transactions, which experienced less pricing pressure than the overall market.
After all the discussions of the last several months, we did not see business shifting
materially between rated and non-rated capital at 1-1.

Page 6 of 22

FINAL

The interesting question is whether or not a pricing floor has been reached. I believe the
market stabilized because price reduction tolerances have been reached and not
because an absolute pricing floor has been hit. It's my belief that the speed at which rates
are changing is probably flattening out, but that does not mean to say that it will stop
altogether. Hence, we have increased our downwards guidance.
At the highest level in a soft market, underwriters can do one of two things. They can
protect market share or they can protect margin. It would seem that at 1-1, we did see a
broad-brush approach by many to protect market share. Ultimately, the market will not
stop declining until underwriters and capital seek to protect margin over market share.
While pricing for retro was under pressure like most of the rest of the cat reinsurance
market, we did see continued increased demand for our worldwide specialized retro
product written through UpsilonRe. In order to provide greater flexibility to investors to
invest in the manner that best suits them, we tranched the fund to provide different
options on the risk-reward continuum. This had the added benefit of increasing the
efficiency of UpsilonRe's capital and attracting more capital than we required.

Bloomberg Transcript

One may ask why we are raising additional capital at a time when there is already an
abundance of capacity? UpsilonRe represents an interesting confluence of events which
allowed us to match efficient capital and desirable rates. Our clients were telling us that
they wanted to cede risk on an aggregate basis. Determining that it will be more efficient
assume this risk in a collateralized balance sheet, we were able to quickly raise the
necessary capacity and serve our customers.
As with many of our vehicles, we are not only the manager but also an investor in each
fund, reassuring our partner capital that our interests are well aligned. This highlights a
point I made earlier. We bring capital to markets when needed by our clients, and we
withdraw it when no longer needed, and we eat a substantial portion of our own cooking.
We do not raise capital solely because it's available and might result in fees. Our partners
appreciate this approach, and as a result, we have good access to additional capital.
In terms of ceding opportunities, we will continue to look for ways to optimize our
underwriting portfolio. We consistently see opportunities to share risks with others and
have tremendous resources to measure the capital import and efficiency of any product
on offer. We will remain innovative and willing to match capital in any form against
appropriate risk, evaluating all options, both traditional and nontraditional.
Turning to our specialty business now, we continued to find opportunities at 1-1 while the
market as a whole became more competitive. We were able to do this using several
different approaches. With the launch of our US platform earlier this year, we now have
access to business we weren't able to see before and enter markets we hadn't
traditionally participated in. We've benefited from strong relationships and a known brand
to gain shares on attractive programs despite abundant capacity from competitors. In
short, buyers made room for us and we are seen as a core partner with whom they enjoy
trading.

FINAL

Even in a soft market, there is attractive business to be found. We were able to achieve
significant growth in the Fourth Quarter due to some opportunities in mortgage
reinsurance where the market has your competitors and favorable fundamental risk
characteristics.
Our ventures team continue to work closely with our underwriting team, establishing
capital partnerships as a cornerstone of our franchise. I think of our ventures unit as doing
two things predominantly, first, managing third-party capital vehicles, and second,
managing strategic investments we make. Many of these investments are with our
reinsurance customers to help them grow their businesses. Others a little further from our
core, as in this quarter is a good example, have provided us with significant gains over the
last few months.
Our capital partners and cedents appreciate the industry-leading real-time risk and capital
analysis we are able to provide. The integrated system we operate across underwriting
capital management allows us to offer innovative vehicles that support our fundamental
principle of matching attractive risk to efficient capital.

Bloomberg Transcript

The past five years, we've launched five limited life vehicles and launched a new cap-on
fund. We've raised over $900 million of new capital from a wide variety of institutional
investors and at the same time have return in excess of $1 billion of capital.
As I reflect on the market and the increased competition that we are seeing, I am more
grateful than ever that I am at RenRe. I firmly believe that our structure of having both
highly rated balance sheets and strong access to other forms of capital is the best
formula to serve our customers by having efficient capital to match against their risks. We
are a core reinsurer to our clients and a trusted steward to all of the capital we bring to
the market. And my belief is no matter what Res are doing today, we can still build an
attractive portfolio going forward and continue to extend our 20-year track record of
outperformance.
And with that, I will turn it over to questions.

Questions And Answers

(Operator Instructions) Greg Locraft, Morgan Stanley.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter and a great year. I wanted to actually isolate
on the guidance and specifically the downward trend from down 10% to down 15%. Can
you talk a bit about what's changed November versus February?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Page 8 of 22



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2014-02-05

FINAL

Sure, thanks. The fundamental change really was just -- really resulted from competition.
There is no new capital, there's no initiatives that I can point to that significantly change
the fundamentals of the business. It was just there was much more proactive reaching out
by some markets to protect market share. That was sensed by both buyers and brokers,
and with that, there was increased pricing pressure. But it's nothing fundamental in the
market that's changed.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

But I guess, again, you guys are in the markets. You're sitting in November. You are having
conversations. You put out a down 10%, and then now all of a sudden it's a down 15%. In
your commentary, you suggested that actually the rate of descent is flattening out, but
the movement in your guidance would suggest otherwise. So I'm wondering what will
prevent the down 15% from becoming a down 20%, let's say, in July or something like that
once we get to the Junes?

A - Kevin O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. So we are giving updated guidance today, but obviously early in the renewal
process, I think earlier than most, we recognized that rates were sliding further and we
readjusted our strategy for the renewal.
I think, for 2014, the June renewals in 2013 had a more significant reduction than the
January renewals in 2013. So I think we're going into the mid-year renewals with already
some of the reduction built in. I believe there will be further reduction, but I also feel that
our process, which is both the ground-up and top-down process by account looking at
where we think rates are going, what we think buyers will do from increased purchases
and reduced purchases, I feel comfortable that the down 15% at this point in time is our
best estimate. Obviously, the future is unknown, so there's things that can dislocate that,
but I feel, at this, point with what we know and the work we've done, that it is our best
estimate as to where we think the market is going.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Then second topic is just on capital deployment. I'm trying to -- it sounds like
DaVinci gave back everything that was earned on the year, so call it 100% payout ratio for
the DaVinci owners. Why didn't the RNR owners, the public equity owners, receive the
same kind of payout ratio in 2013? It was significantly lower when you look at dividends
and buybacks as a percentage of total earned.

A - Jeff Kelly

{BIO 20911735 <GO>}

Yes, so, I think the only difference there is the DaVinci shareholders go in and out at book
value. And what we are trying to do in our share repurchase activities is to repatriate
capital at levels that we think are very attractive for the shareholders of RenRe who do not
get in and out at book value. And so we are just trying to capture the best share
repurchase opportunities we can.

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Page 9 of 22



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2014-02-05

FINAL

Let me add one other point to that too. We keep financial flexibility at RenRe Holdings as
well for opportunities that may emerge, and some of those opportunities could be
emerging at DaVinci. So we could increase our share in DaVinci at any given point in time if
there was an opportunity for that book to grow. So the more financial flexibility is kept at
the holding company then we will keep at DaVinci or any of the operating levels.

A - Jeff Kelly

{BIO 20911735 <GO>}

Yes. That is a good point. We do manage DaVinci closer to -- a little closer to our
exposures than we did at the holding company just for the reasons Kevin cited.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Then last topic is actually away from the core property cat business. Kevin,
can you talk a bit about how -- what are your ambitions in the Lloyd's and specialty
segments? Obviously, the growth there is significant. Can you talk a bit about the historical
profitability of those businesses and where you see this thing going as perhaps another
leg to the stool emerges?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Sure. Let me start with Lloyd's. Lloyd's is a business in which we, in entering Lloyd's, we
made the decision to build versus buy. The cost of that decision is really an expense ratio
that will take time for us to grow into. We've had slower growth in topline in Lloyd's than
our original estimate, and that's really a result of market conditions, so we are
comfortable with that. That's consistent with how we would manage any of our
underwriting businesses. I believe we built the right team there, we built the right
infrastructure, so as we look back in 10 years' time, I feel very comfortable about the
investment we are making in Lloyd's, that it will provide long-term profitability to the
group knowing that the start has been a little slower because of our disciplined
underwriting.
I think, for specialty, we have a much longer track record, and if you look back over
inception to date for the specialty lines that we've written, we've made in excess of $1
billion of profit by being in that business, so although it's not as large as our cat business,
we do see it at as core. We think it as a very efficient use of capital on a marginal basis to
bring on to our portfolio. And by expanding our footprint into the US, we have gained
access to new lines of business.
A lot of the business that we have written in specialty is really from core clients we have
on the cat side, and we have been very fortunate to have a good reception from those
buyers, making room for us in some of their best programs. So it's kind of a little different
story for each one, but both of them I believe will be long-term contributors.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thanks for the answers, guys, and congrats again on an excellent quarter
and another great year even as the macro is getting more difficult.

FINAL

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Thanks. I guess I was -- first on capital. Is there an element -- can you tell us how much
money is at the holding company, or is that an element you think that's material?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
I believe, at the end of the year, we had about $600 million, nearly $700 million in cash
and securities at the holding company, which is a little higher than normal. And that, I
wouldn't say that is a -- that's not a proxy for what we view necessarily as excess capital,
but it does represent kind of the raw material with which we can execute capital
deployments among the various balance sheets of the company or through share
repurchase. Then in addition to that, we have a revolving credit facility of $250 million that
we can draw on if need be.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Got it. And as a follow-up to one of Greg's questions on capital as well, so the $300
million redemption at DaVinci, is that a use of capital? Is that how we should think about it?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin O'Donnell
No. It's actually -- so we get an infusion of that to the holding company from the
standpoint that it comes out of DaVinci and goes to the parent. But given that we only
own 26.5% of it, the vast majority of that is the dividend to the third-party shareholders.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

I guess, as a further clarification then, if I'm looking at net income for the year, subtracting
out share repurchases or the use of capital, subtracting out the dividend, I shouldn't be
subtracting out that $300 million.

A - Kevin O'Donnell
No.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. I guess, lastly, on the topline guidance for cat, I believe in 2013 you guys
increased your quota share transactions. What do you guys think about that for 2014?
Could that potentially be a wildcard? Thanks.

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Sure. We did increase some quota share writings. One of the things we looked at is when
we write a property quota share it's often Atlantic hurricane exposure that's embedded
within the quota share and hence our interest.

FINAL

I look at the Florida market and I see the Florida market from a primary standpoint in
pretty good shape. So there could be additional opportunities for us to write some
property quota share. But it's very early in discussions with our Florida cedents to
determine whether that's going to be an appropriate product for them, but we certainly
have capacity to write it. We have the tools to understand the risks that we are taking. But
it's too early to be definitive as to whether there will be opportunities or not.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Thank you.

Operator
Amit Kumar, Macquarie Capital.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Two quick I guess follow-up questions. First of all, on the discussion on pricing, if I sort of
ex out the reserve releases and Essent gain, you're sort of looking at a midteens ROE.
And I'm sort of wondering. At what point do the returns on the catastrophe business
become unattractive versus the cost of capital?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin O'Donnell
So I think focusing only on what's going on with the growth rates isn't necessarily the way
that we think about it. What we are trying to do is build the most attractive portfolio we
can by bringing in the best deals in the market, but we are also constantly looking at how
to match the right capital against that. And obviously between the capital and the risk,
there is a margin for us. So I don't see that there is a point, a black line or a red line, in
which rates cross and you are either in or out of the market. I see it as a migration
between weighted balance sheets or permanent third-party capitals or temporary
vehicles as to how we would structure traditional retro as well. It's more of a continuum
but I don't see a bright line that we are either in or out of the market.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

I guess what I was trying to ask was you mentioned and it was still meeting your hurdle
rate, and it was sort of hard to put a range on what sort of earn hurdle return on rate
might be.

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Again, I think it's one that will be at the highest level. What we're trying to do is find
desirable risk and find efficient capital. I think the rate in which where -- the returns we are
looking for is different between fee capital and risk capital, but I wouldn't think that it's
something that I would focus in on as being of binary point or a single point of having
interest or no interest in a market.

Okay. Just related to that, as more business moves to your third-party ventures, including
Upsilon, etc., how should we think about how much incremental capital it frees up, and
thus makes it available for other users, including increased buybacks?

FINAL

A - Kevin O'Donnell
I think, at a very simple level, when we look at bringing unrated capital to the market, we
look at whether it's cannibalistic to our existing business or it's accretive. The Upsilon
specifically is something that is accretive to what we are already doing, so I don't think of
it as a trade against the risk capital that we've deployed. It's augmenting the footprint that
we have in the market by adding a product that we wouldn't otherwise sell.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Okay. And I guess, finally, did you mention the holding company capital? I think Mike was
asking that question? The number you gave, was that the holding company level?

A - Jeff Kelly

{BIO 20911735 <GO>}

Mike asked the question of how much cash and how much cash we have available at the
holding company. And I said approximately $700 million with an additional $250 million
that's accessible via a revolving credit facility. It's not necessarily the same as an excess
capital figure.

Q - Amit Kumar

Date: 2014-02-05

Thanks for taking the call and congratulations on a fantastic year. I wanted to ask sort of
like a longer-term question. You guys do presumably some long-term planning. I know you
are sort of a tactical an opportunistic firm, and the weather deals what it feels. But I
wondered if you could give us a little more color and sort of what division for RenRe really
is in five years, and sort of maybe put a finer point around it. If you could think in terms of
the markets you think are attractive as well as the relative size of your own balance sheet
versus third-party and perhaps as we think about the growth initiatives in Lloyd's and
specialty and sort of stabilizing and shrinking cat volumes, weather, what your core
business will be over that long period of time? Thanks.

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Thank you. When we look forward, there is a spectrum -- let me take the cat market to
start with -- there's a spectrum from it being in some people's view of going back to
100% weighted balance sheets to another view where it becomes an asset management
business and it's 100% unrated capital deployed into this space.
We believe that unrated capital is going to be in the business permanently. We wouldn't
have built the structures that we built if we didn't think that.

Bloomberg Transcript

We also think having the flexibility of providing risk solutions through weighted balance
sheets and unrated capital is going to be the winning formula over time.
So the future is uncertain as to which direction the market continues to move, but in any
direction we feel like we have the structure that has the highest probability of being
successful.
I believe the cat business will be a good driver of our results. Even though we will continue
to emphasize the growth in specialty and Lloyd's, I believe that the Lloyd's platform that
we are building is one in which we are very happy with the investment we've made there,
and we've built something that's highly integrated and highly culturally aligned. So I have
tremendous confidence that that will be a big contributor over time.
And our specialty business is one that has, over time, contributed meaningfully to our
results and I believe that the moves that we are making now will continue to allow it to
make positive contributions over time.
The final thing which we didn't really touch on on the call is our Singapore office. So I
believe our Singapore office will not be a meaningful contributor in the near term, but
over the long-term, it's imperative that we are in the region and will continue to find
opportunities and build relationships there.

Q - Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

That's helpful color Kevin. Thank you. I wonder if I could just talk a little bit shorter-term
about the coming year. So the renewal at 1-1 was bad. How should we be thinking about
how this bodes for renewals as we work our way here through the year? And I guess if
you guys have given us guidance, so we should know that the central estimate. But I'm
Page 14 of 22

FINAL

wondering what we should -- you think we should be watching to figure out whether it's
going to get better or worse and if there's anything you think that's on the horizon that
could reverse this. So definitely no changes in Florida, positioning from the rating agencies
or maybe some rational behavior by competitors. Because I think at the end of the day,
we are all kind of looking at it just trying to figure out whether there is a nearer-term story
or whether we have to first wait for new capital and sort more aggressive players to
exhaust themselves. Thank you.

A - Kevin O'Donnell
I think, if you look in the first six months of the year from the property cat perspective,
there's really two renewals. One is the April, which is dominated by Japan, and the others
the June/July which is dominated by Florida. The far more meaningful of the two is the
Florida renewal for us.
As I mentioned earlier, I think the Florida market is in great shape. There has been
significant migration of risk from the state facilities to the private market, and every
premium dollar that moves from a state facility to a private company has more
reinsurance dollars associated with it.

Bloomberg Transcript

We've also seen in the press that the FHCF is considering purchasing additional limits,
which, again, I believe is a positive for the markets. There've been some new startup
companies down there. So there's lots of momentum in Florida that gives me some
optimism that there will be increased demand.
All that said and done, there's a lot of capital that is prepared to be deployed at the right
margin in the business, which will temper the enthusiasm for the new demand. But I think
there's some reason to be optimistic about that but, again, our change in guidance
reflects that. So I think there's uncertainty as to what it is, but I look forward but leasing a
healthy market that we are going into in Florida.

Q - Mike Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks. I guess a question in terms of the specialty Lloyd's business. How should we
think about the margins that you're going to target there? And how does a mix change
towards those areas potentially away from property cat impact your target ROEs and
what you think you can sustain? And should we think overall ROEs, if this mix change
continues, will be lower but there will be less volatility, or how should we think about that?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Page 15 of 22



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity

So let me explain the way we think about it and then we'll talk about how it will represent
itself on the financials.

Q - Mike Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay.

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Firstly, I think these businesses, we do write some property cat out of Lloyd's, but absent
that component of the book, most of the risk we are taking in is, from a marginal
standpoint, requires limited additional capital in our economic models. So with that, we
believe, on a standalone basis, there is sufficient profit to warrant the embedded risk
within the transaction. And on a marginal basis, the economic returns are substantially
higher because it adds a degree of diversification our portfolio.
Looking back to our kind of GAAP representation, I would anticipate that, on a net basis, it
will increase ROE. And with the diversification, we hope that it has a different loss profile
than our cat book, so there should be some diversification benefit there as well. But that's
not the reason we are doing it. We're doing it based on our economic models and we see
that economically it has high marginal returns, which allows us to build more attractive
portfolios.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mike Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

So what kind of profitability do you need to see in specialty lines for that to be -- it makes
sense, the math makes sense. But is that market allowing you to see kind of increasingly
positive opportunities to invest just on a standalone basis, or is it more because of the
integration with the current structure of your book that allows you to kind of arbitrage
some excess returns?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
So most of the decisions that we make in the cat business are based on a marginal basis
against our portfolio, because that the more important measure because it captures
diversification. With the diversification being as high as it is on many of the specialty lines
that we are writing, most of our decisions are based on the standalone returns of the
individual transactions. So the standalone returns can be significantly lower than what we
require on our cat book because the marginal capital allocated is significantly lower as
well.
My concern is if the market only looks at the marginal return of these transactions, they
can quickly become unacceptable from a standalone return basis and we would not write
them. So we continue to be very focused on standalone within the marginal -- sorry, within
the specialty lines.

Q - Mike Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Do you expect others -- I knew you can't speak for others, but we've seen this sort
of math of diversification into specialty could make sense for others that are looking to
Page 16 of 22



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2014-02-05

deploy capital away from property cat. Do you expect that some of that competitiveness
that you're seeing on the property cat side for diversified writers could manifest in others
doing sort of the same thing, or are you seeing some of that now? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Sure. So on most of the specialty stuff we looked at, we kind of saw two trends. One is a
reduction in economics offered to reinsurers largely through increasing ceding
commissions. Offsetting that was in many of the businesses that we are looking at,
anyway, slightly better underwriting fundamentals from a pricing perspective for the
original business.
We haven't seen, or certainly the deals that we are on, we haven't seen negative
standalone returns. But in other markets, we've certainly seen that with an specialty lines,
but I feel like even though ceding commissions are going up, there's a bit of an offset by
primary fundamentals. So the business is still good, but we need to watch it closely. If it
does move to negative standalone returns, we would come off business in that area.

Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks. A couple of questions. First is, on the cat guidance, that is obviously a gross
number. Given your ceding of business in 2014 or expected sessions of business, is it fair
to expect the net premiums written to be down more than 15%?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
I think we don't provide net guidance, but in thinking about how we approach the market,
we have multiple ways in which we share risk. We have ownership in our third-party capital
vehicles. We have long-standing risk-sharing agreements that tend to be much more
stable over time. Then we have more of a trading account for retro.
I would say that the area of uncertainty is the trading account for ceded retro where I
believe we have great access to seeing what's available in the market and we have great
Page 17 of 22



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td

tools to determine whether it's accretive to the portfolio. We think that's the biggest area
of uncertainty within our net writings year-over-year.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

FINAL

Just tough to say at this point, then.

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Yes.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Okay. Second question was related to the operational expenses, which were higher than
they had been running. I'm assuming that was bonus accruals because you guys made a
lot of money this quarter and this year.

A - Jeff Kelly

{BIO 20911735 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That's part of it, Jay. I think you have to really compare Fourth Quarter over Fourth
Quarter, and typically the Fourth Quarter expense number is a bit higher than during the
course of the year. The jump from Fourth Quarter of last year to Fourth Quarter of this
year is largely reflective of an increase in compensation accruals, and it also reflects a
donation we made to a local charity to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the
company. Those two things account for almost all the difference.

are the targeted combined ratios in that line? Are they mid-80s%?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
In the specialty -- I think

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Kevin O'Donnell
-- that's not something we post explicitly. But let me make a comment that much of what
we are writing is quota share, or at least a lot of the new premium is quite a share. So you
Page 18 of 22



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2014-02-05

might want to look to what your estimates are for primary specialty players and think that
that is the risk that we are taking and might carry through.

FINAL

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay, helpful. Second question is on excess capital. Sort of looking at my math, you
bought back just 40% of earnings plus dividends this year. I'm curious as to what held you
back, number one. Number two is I think you mentioned $700 million of capital at the
holding company. How much cash do you normally keep there? So how much is it running
in excess of normal that you could use to buy back stock?

A - Jeff Kelly

{BIO 20911735 <GO>}

Yes, so the $700 million number that I discussed is probably a couple hundred million
dollars, $100 million to $200 million, higher than normal and is I think reflective of really the
strength we've had in earnings in the last several months of the year.
In going to your former -- first part of your question, first of all, as I said in response to an
earlier question, I wouldn't necessarily think of the cash as a proxy for excess capital. We
don't disclose how much excess capital we have, but we believe -- or we believe we have.
But I would say that the principal things that have been holding us back or did hold us back
in 2013 from share repurchase was just the price being a bit higher than we would have
normally targeted, given our outlook for the business and our ability to deploy it.

Bloomberg Transcript

Obviously, the Fourth Quarter was a stronger quarter than we anticipated, and that made
a very strong capital position even stronger.
So I would say our expectation at this point is that, with the current outlook on our ability
to deploy capital in the business, the capital position that we have today and roughly
where the price of the stock is, we think it's an attractive level to buy shares. We have
been buying shares pretty aggressively, and I would expect that would be -- if all those
things continue to hold, that would be our intent going forward.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. Just one clarification on margins sort of deteriorating next year versus
this year. Would it be fair to assume that your purchase of retro would have reduced the
negative margin deterioration impact on RenaissanceRe?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
So I think what you're asking is are we getting a positive spread on our ceded to our
inwards business?

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Kevin O'Donnell

Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity

FINAL

The answer, we are obviously looking at -- the proxy for that is the cost of capital from a
retro compared to our own cost of capital. And obviously we have more capacity that we
are willing to deploy into the market so that we are purchasing from -- on a trading basis,
we are certainly looking to have a cheaper cost of capital brought our balance sheet, and
therefore improve the overall attractiveness of our portfolio.

I've got one quick one and then one follow-up here for (inaudible). Tower Hill I noticed had
a pretty good income in the Fourth Quarter. They generally lose money or earn a very
small profit. Did something unusual happen there?

A - Kevin O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

No. I think it's -- Tower Hill has been an investment we've had for several years, and it's
performed pretty well, so I'm not sure what exactly the number is that we are looking at
there.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Just looking at your equity and earnings of other ventures and specifically Tower Hill. I
could follow up on this. It's not that important.

A - Jeff Kelly

{BIO 20911735 <GO>}

The only other factor that would increase our earnings there, Brian, is the amortization of
goodwill there is going as reasonably rapid in that, so even in a static earnings
environment, our earnings in that should go up over time.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Then my second question, Kevin, just a follow-up to Jay's question, on the ceded
side, when do you make your purchasing decisions on that? Is it later and that's why you
don't know necessarily whether you've got any attractive retro opportunities at 1-1?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
I think we approach the world a little differently than many, where they put out a retro
program, they build it into their capital structure and then go execute against that. We are
in the market every day looking for ceded opportunities, and we don't go out with a
formal program looking for it to build it into our capital structure. We have other
mechanisms to do that, so the type of retro that we are talking about here is something

Page 20 of 22



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td

that we opportunistically look for in the market, and add to the portfolio only when it's
accretive.

Q - Sarah Dewitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. You've mentioned that the pace of price decline is slowing, but it hasn't
reached a floor yet. How much lower do you see the floor versus current levels?

A - Kevin O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

So again, I think it's different by market. One of the things we mentioned is the
international markets declined as well. I think we are closer to a point of moving from the
low return bucket to the negative return bucket. I think that maybe that's the context to
have the discussion.
Within the US, we did see an increase in negative return business in the US, although a
very small proportion of the overall book is in that bucket, and that's something we look
for. That tends to be non-peak risk. But it's not an area that I would say there's going to
be a bright line as to when markets should stop participating in a market. I think we have
greater flexibility to structure capital, so we have a longer runway to participate in a
market. So I'm not particularly concerned that we are going to hit a pricing point again that
we're going to need to exit and we don't have a specific forecast as to what that could be
for others.

Q - Sarah Dewitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thanks. Then just another question on excess capital and potential share
buyback. I look back historically, the most you've ever bought back is $500 million a year.
Given that you have a significant excess capital position right now and your premiums are
going to be down for this year, any reason why we shouldn't expect a similar amount in
2014?

A - Jeff Kelly

{BIO 20911735 <GO>}

We don't like to forecast what we might do over the course of an entire year, but by my
description of the liquidity position we have at holdings. And I certainly don't see that we
are bounded by that number or any other number for that matter. We have already
bought back almost $100 million in essentially the first 35 days of the year, so that doesn't
seem like an outsized amount. But we aren't going to make a forecast about what we will
do for sure.
