Operator
Good day, and welcome to the a.s.r. Conference Call on the acquisition of Loyalis. Today's
call is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Michel Hülters.
Please go ahead, sir.

Michel Hülters
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to the a.s.r. conference call on
the acquisition of Loyalis that we announced earlier this morning. On the call are Jos
Baeten, CEO; and Chris Figee, CFO. And they will talk you through the transaction
highlights from a strategic rationale and the ﬁnancial metrics, and also (00:39). After that,
we'll open up for Q&A. And as is customary, please review the disclaimer that we have in
the back of the presentation as well as any forward-looking statements that we have.
So, with that, Jos, the ﬂoor is yours.

Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everybody. I'm sure you all have seen the
announcement this morning, so let's not waste too much time. I'll brieﬂy mention the
highlights of the transaction before we take any questions you may have. As you can
understand, we are very pleased to announce this transaction shortly after our CMD of the

10th of October, in which we detailed our plan to actively pursue proﬁtable and inorganic
growth, next to the normal organic growth, especially aiming for bolt-on acquisitions in
the SME space. I believe we have been able to present an oﬀer that beyond an eﬀective
ﬁnancial package, also resonated well with our strategic principle of putting clients ﬁrst.
This transaction truly ticks all the relevant boxes, and we will discuss that during the Q&A,
from a strategic point of view as well as ﬁnancially. With Loyalis, we signiﬁcantly
strengthened our position in a disability market. We gained unique access to an
important cluster of customer groups and expands the product oﬀering. In Disability, we
grow our market share to 28%. In Life, the acquisition ﬁts very well with our strategy to
consolidate service groups. We can unlock the synergies by rationalizing and migrating
these groups to the software-as-a-service platform what we already had.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you can see on this slide, the transaction that comfortably meets the ﬁnancial criteria,
we maintained for M&A and demonstrates our ability to deploy capital to enhance the
value of the organization. Pro forma impact on Solvency II ratio of a.s.r. at closing is minus
9% solvency points, so equal to the Generali transaction. And when the integration were
successfully done in 2022, the impact is minus 8% solvency points.
Return on investment is expected at well above 12% on all metrics. This is calculated on a
fungible capital investment of roughly €200 million. The transaction is expected to
contribute €40 million to the net operating results, and €35 million organic capital
creation in 2022. This represents an EPS equation of more than 8%, based on our last full
year results in 2017. The transaction will temporarily be ﬁnanced with a short dated bridge
loan, so a.s.r. maintains a very strong ﬁnancial ﬂexibility. The ﬁnancial leverage of a.s.r. will,
due to this transaction, increase to roughly 29%, well below our target of maximum of
35%. This short-term ﬁnancing basically means that we keep our options open for
developments in other strategic areas going forward.
So, let's move to the next slide, where I will provide a overview about Loyalis. As you may
know, Loyalis is an insurance company currently owned by APG and is located in the
Heerlen, a town in the south of the Netherlands. It employs roughly 300 employees.
Loyalis is mainly a non-life company with €161 million gross written premium in non-life,
and €105 million of gross written premium in life.
The IFRS earnings of Loyalis were €71 million in 2017. There are some diﬀerence in
accounting standards. Loyalis, for instance, applies fair value accounting, where market
movements including interest ﬂow through, therefore, this is not a number you should
expect going forward. Estimated standalone run-rate of net operating earnings is
approximately €30 million, and this is based on a.s.r.'s accounting standards.
Loyalis' balance sheet is just above €3.3 billion and is fairly well capitalized with strong
Solvency II ratios for the operating companies. Important to note is that Loyalis carries no
debt. The cooperation between Loyalis and APG will be continued and is covered on the
long-term agreements with APG. The cooperation pertains to knowledge sharing on the
sector, which enables Loyalis to develop insurance products in the future and will remain

FINAL

closely related to the collective labor agreements of the sectors Loyalis and APG currently
serve.
So, let's have a closer look at Disability and Life, starting with Disability. Loyalis
strengthens a.s.r.'s competitive position and sustainable employability segments as it
oﬀers a broad portfolio of Disability products with a strong emphasis on WIA accounting
for 86%; 68% of gross written premium in 2017. Out of the total earnings of Loyalis, 80% is
in a non-life predictable earnings stream.
With Loyalis, we also will have meaningful access to new customer groups, government
and in education oﬀering the opportunity for a.s.r.'s disability suite. Complementary to
a.s.r.'s strong proposition in the disability market, particularly for individuals and small
companies, is Loyalis' strong presence in the area of mid to larger size corporates with
over 100 employees.
Our objective is to safeguard current proﬁtable proposition. To do so, we aim to continue
running the business from Heerlen. At such, it will be only a partial integration of staﬀ
functions and IT rationalization. The relation with APG on knowledge sharing, product
development and eﬃcient client solutions will continue. We will keep the Loyalis brand
intact being well recognized in the sector they service.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you can see, there is also a relative small absenteeism portfolio which will be managed
as a closed book and now future oﬀering will come via the a.s.r. product line.
Turning to Life, this part will be fully integrated into a.s.r.'s platform ambulatory (07:43).
Migration expected mid-2020. As mentioned, this ﬁts very well with our strategy to
consolidate the individual Life market, and here, we can actually lever our proven
integration and migration skills and experience. Loyalis at scale through our existing
service books and increases the cost average. Also, we will manage the €2 billion
investment portfolio in Life.
Let's move to slide 5, and for those who attended our CMD in October, this is a familiar
slide. It depicts how we look at the various players and roles around sustainable
employability. It is an entire ecosystem in which we have a strong and unique position
with various entities that we either fully or partially own or with companies which we work
closely together. With Loyalis, we strengthened our position in underwriting and targeting
signiﬁcant classes of customers with products that meet their needs. This ecosystem will
continue to develop and I will expect us to continue our aim to further expand this in the
future. As it is shown on the right-hand side, Loyalis will increase our market share to 28%
and become co-leader in the Disability market.
So, now turning to the impact on Solvency II, that's slide 6. As you can see, the pro forma
impact on Solvency II when all capital and cost synergies are taken into account amounts
roughly 8 points. I will brieﬂy run you through the major changes. Day one pro forma
Solvency impact is 9 points, and this consists of the purchase price, as you have read, it is
€450 million cash out, partially oﬀset by capital synergies, which include diversiﬁcation,
ineligible capital, as well as the alignment of the assumptions and the impact of
Page 3 of 18

FINAL

combining the businesses. Given the fact that Loyalis already has very strong balance
sheet, the impact of the level is close to zero.
At legal merger, the impact is minus 1 point, reﬂecting the remaining capital synergies and
further alignment of assumptions. After the legal merger, we will pursue the realized cost
synergies which are expected to increase the Solvency II ratio with 2 points. This number
includes the capitalized cost beneﬁts, and it's partially oﬀset by non-recurring
restructuring expenses.
When determining the return on this transaction, we look at the amount of capital which is
required based on a.s.r. Solvency II level above the dividend threshold for the operating
companies. Fungible capital deployment amounts to €200 million. This number takes into
account the capitalized cost synergies we expect to realize. Excluding these capitalized
cost synergies, the fungible capital investment amounts up to €260 million.
Now, let's turn to snapshots of the ﬁnancial metrics on this transaction, and that's on slide
7. The acquisition of Loyalis is expected to deliver a return on investment of well over 12%
based on operational and capital synergies. Loyalis is expected to contribute €40 million
to the net operating result as from 2022 after realizing all the cost synergies. Loyalis is
expected to contribute €35 million to the OCC to be realized in 2022. I'm sure you will
understand we are very, very pleased with this acquisition not do only all the ﬁnancials
ticks the boxes, but also this acquisition is in the core of our strategy.

Having said this, I would like to conclude this presentation, and let's go over to Q&A.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now take our ﬁrst question, this comes from Cor Kluis from ABN
AMRO. Please go ahead.

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Good morning. Cor Kluis, ABN AMRO. Congratulations with this acquisition. A couple of...

A - Jos P. M. Baeten

{BIO 2036695 <GO>}

(12:35) it's midnight for you, I believe?

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

That's correct, but no problem. Yeah, this is regarding the question about the diﬀerence
between the €450 million and the €200 million, could you help us a little bit more with
the pieces between there, if we see the slide number 6, of course, but give a little bit
more granularity on (13:01) which probably is not at the Loyalis excess capital which we
will see their (13:10) where you're a little bit more conservative than they are. So, a little bit
more granularity for that gap between those two ﬁgures?

FINAL

And my second question is about the APG contract, can you just talk about long-term
contract, could you elaborate a little bit more on how does it works? How long can you
contact new APG clients or can you transform their website or how does it work ? My last
question is about the OCC, which piece – the €35 million, which piece is a capital release
SCR eﬀect, because I think the Life will be shrinking somewhat there, so to what extent is
that included in that and probably the disability thesis (14:03) my questions?

A - Chris H. Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Thank you, Cor. Good morning. This is Chris. I will take your – half of your question on the
capital spend. There is couple of points to note. This is a business that is well, well
capitalized. If you look at the own funds that are present in the two operating entities,
Loyalis Life or Loyalis Schade and excluding any adjustments we make or may not make,
but as it is today, the own fund in this business are €560 million, so you could argue of
being €460 million or €560 million of own funds.
Now, that's of course a value that will become (14:30) adjustment, but it shows you that
these businesses are well capitalized running at (14:46) levels of standalone €172 million in
Loyalis Schade, €175 million in Loyalis Life. This is one.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second thing what I like about this business, we are buying eﬀectively a Non-life earnings
business. If you look at the proﬁts of this business and also especially on a.s.r. accounting
standards, a.s.r. – 80% of the proﬁt of the business is Non-life. So, it's a Non-life earning
stream. So, we are acquiring own funds with a very little bit UFR or VA sensitivity. These
are, as I said, the own funds (15:22) the business are €560 million. If you took out the UFR
and VA as a whole, that would drop to €520 million, but before any adjustments.
So, we're looking at a business with suﬃcient and a signiﬁcant amount of capital in there
which have limited UFR or VA sensitivity. So, then the walk from the €450 million to €200
million is, we've paid cash out €450 million at this point. In our assessment, there is €100
million of (15:48) fungible capital that we acquired. You can say we're paying a euro for
euro, but as this capital is in this business based on our own dividends and our capital
management (15:59). So, we're paying €450 million for €100 million of additional fungible
capital (16:02).
Then there's about €90 million, 9-0, of net capital synergies. They consist of diversiﬁcation
beneﬁts as DTA, and it will leverage (16:18) more, but those are the main components.
That brings you to €260 million of spends of capital, and then there is about €60 million
of capitalized cost beneﬁt, and solvency is the lower expense charges in the Solvency II,
which brings you to the €200 million. So, the breakup is €450 million, minus €100 million,
minus €90 million, brings you to €260 million and if you take out €60 million, you'd get to
€200 million.
In those capital synergies, as I said the dominant one is diversiﬁcation beneﬁts. I mean,
Disability is a risk factor that naturally diversiﬁes very well in existing insurance book. Next
to mortality is the second best diversiﬁer in your risk base, and eﬀectively 20% of this
business is mortality and 80% is Disability.

Secondly, there is an ineligible DTA on the Loyalis (17:13) it will become eligible in our side
(17:15). And then there are a few smaller ones were on the negative side, we'll have some
adjustments on the mortality assumptions in the Loyalis book while we have a slightly
diﬀerent approach on quantifying and reserving for mortality risks. The small negative
from dealing with proﬁt sharing where we don't follow their methodology yet on high
yield count for proﬁt sharing and the (17:43) low absorbing capacity of technical provision
(17:46) don't apply and then there is small amendment on the interest rate with charge
and small positives on further synergy and disability solvency.
So, in summary, diversiﬁcation and DTA are the main drivers, then small number of
adjustments for mortality and proﬁt sharing those are the negative actuarial functional
alignment, and then the number of positives known mostly around reserve and
achievement of (18:18) expenses. But the core complicit is that you will pay €450 million
for business with north of €500 million own funds, ex-VA, ex-UFR is still north of €500
million own funds.
So, we take it out some-hundred-million of where – we're paying a euro for euro. That
brings to €350 million, take out €90 million of clear capital synergies that will be there
already, actually very quickly within the ﬁrst six months and then there is about €60 million
of opportunity on reserving which will show up if and when we complete the integration
that will take a bit more time, but we've got conﬁdent that we will deliver on those.

And on the contract.

A - Chris H. Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Sorry, go ahead.

A - Jos P. M. Baeten

{BIO 2036695 <GO>}

And on the contract...

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Jos P. M. Baeten

{BIO 2036695 <GO>}

We aim that it will be an indeﬁnite contract. However, we have agreed that we – every ﬁve
years we will evaluate how the collaboration works. So, of the ﬁve years we have the ﬁrst
evaluation of how we have worked together over the last ﬁve years and then a (19:31) of
the contract going further.
The aim of the contract is to keep up oﬀering current product suite of Loyalis under the
Loyalis brand, which mainly is WIA business, as I said 86% of their Non-life portfolio is in
WIA business, and there is a small (19:53) portfolio in involved also, but they are not
currently oﬀering active sickness leaves. We have agreed that we will be able to build on

Page 6 of 18



Company Name: ASR Nederland NV
Company Ticker: ASRNL NA Equity
Date: 2018-12-04

their current customer portfolio and oﬀer also other a.s.r.'s products. So for example, they
don't oﬀer any sickness leave today, we could decide to start on oﬀering sickness leave
and all kinds of other additional products too.

FINAL

So, going forward, it is keeping the current product in place and adding new products
that are not oﬀered yet by Loyalis.
And all the Non-life business runs at a very proﬁtable combined ratio. If we would supply
our own way of calculating the combined ratio, their combined ratio is already in the
target level of a.s.r.'s combined ratio for Disability, so in the very low-90s and sometimes
even below 90. So, having said that, keep the business in place, that's what we have
arranged with the contract and expand the business going forward.

A - Chris H. Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Cor, and to your question on the OCC, what's in there? As I said, this is 80% a Non-life
business. The proﬁt in 2017 was €71 million, but that's on fair value accounting which we
don't apply. So the numbers in 2017 when spread narrowed and overstate, especially the
Life earnings when you compare (21:38) on our standard, it's 80% Non-life proﬁt, about
20% Life proﬁt, it also shows up in the OCC, so the OCC really is all about underwriting
result and new business result in the Non-life business.
Think about your risk margin release of €2 million to €4 million in the ﬁrst year, SCR
release of €3 million to €4 million in the ﬁrst year, so about €5 million to €7 million of
capital release and the remainder is insurance business reference (22:08). Over time, you
can see the risk margin to decline gradually from €4 million to around €2 million in 2022,
and the SCR release will also be around €3 million.
Please note that in the OCC assumption is also – assumes a reasonable amount of new
business, so the capital release is actually netted which gives you about €2 million to €4
million of net contribution from risk margin in SCR release, in the long run, it would stop
writing new business, which as long as not a good (22:42) if we were to do that, then the
OCC will jump about €105 million. And I think the key point to make is that, out of say the
€30 million or €35 million of capital release, OCC will see in 2021 only up to €5 million is
really book release, and the other €30 million is underwriting business (23:00).

Hi, there. I hope you can hear me. I'm calling from home. Just on two questions. Firstly, on
the debt – the short-term debt that you raised, what is your intention there, so if you need
to fund another deal, what would you convert that into? And if you ﬁnd you don't need to
fund another deal, what are you going to do in terms of the kind of a long-term leverage?
That's question one.
And the second question is, on some of the things you haven't talked about, so the uplift
from looking at their investment portfolio and the uplift from cross-selling other products
that's not currently on the suite. What kind of case study can you show us in the past that
might be relevant here and the potential uplift? Thank you.

A - Chris H. Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Farooq, it's Chris. First of all, congratulations. When I dial in from home, you hear dogs
barking, kids screaming, so well done in keeping your house under control.

Q - Farooq Hanif

(24:17).

A - Chris H. Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

So, well done (24:22), so I'm leaving the chart there. On the debt side, look, we think this
business lends itself very well for hybrid ﬁnancing, I mean it's a €450 million cash out
acquiring a stable and predictable Non-Life earnings stream with long-term client
relationship than a good combine (24:42). So, this thing smells, greet, eats hybrid
ﬁnancing. And we will hybrid ﬁnance this transaction in the long run. However, the
instrument itself, the choice of instrument is something that hinged a bit on the other
M&A ﬁles that are out there, and I don't want to have a core on other ﬁles.
But please note that if Loyalis would be the last acquisition we do, this thing would be
ﬁnance a little bit Tier 2 (25:12) instrument. Hybrid capital keeps the Solvency stable at the
lowest cost possible. However, if you take into account that there are potential other
transactions out there that may or may not start that we may or may not buy and – who
knows, but it might be the case in other transaction (25:29) Tier 1 ﬁnancing to protect your
Tier 3, had to protect your Tier 3 space.
In a year from now, we will know better or we'll know what the optimal ﬁnancing against
the strategy is. Would we use a Tier 2, which should take on a standalone (25:48) basis or
would you rather issue a Tier 1 instrument which may make sense if you include other
transactions out there?
So, with that in mind, it's (25:57) with a hybrid ﬁnancing, so our Solvency will be stable
against this transaction over the instrument itself, it's fair to choose, better to choose in a
year from now than to choose the day in order to protect and preserve optionality. With
that in mind, we are going for a short-term ﬁnancing or one-year ﬁnancing. Options there
could be either a public or one-year senior in the capital markets or a group ﬁnancing
with a bank. We have until closing to do that. I think I hypothesis is that a group ﬁnancing
with a bank is slightly more – oﬀers more ﬂexibility in the phase of ﬂexibility, what we're
Page 8 of 18

FINAL

looking for. And a bit of cost of ﬁnancing today are relatively low, most banks have fair on
(26:44) liquidity and are willing to extend short-term credit at an attractive rate.
So, our view is, one, solvency of the deal will be unchanged because we will fund this with
hybrid inside the leverage ratio that we have. However, it's not wise to choose a date with
instrument deal (27:00) and to preserve optionality take one-year loan at a very low rate.
The option doesn't cost a lot these days. And that actually provides time and room to pick
the ﬁnal instruments over there.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Sorry, just to interrupt, if you don't mind, when you say solvency will be neutral, I mean,
actually it will go up wouldn't it? Have you raised say through the (27:24) Tier 1 of (27:27)
saying?

A - Chris H. Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Yes, exactly, yes. So the – yeah.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Chris H. Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

So the €450 million will be met by (27:35) at least the €450 million (27:35). For example,
your Tier 2 is going benchmark size of €500 million, so you would expect if you issue a
Tier 2 bond, you'd issue a €500 million Tier 2 bond which nearly perfectly matches the
cash out (27:47).

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Chris H. Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

So – and do you want a little bit more – I mean, there will be less (27:54) from what I have
benchmarked Q1 bond is, but it's probably in the same order of magnitude. So, the
(28:00) issues.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Chris H. Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

And to the other point, uplift of the investment portfolio, there could be a small uplift in
there. It's not in the numbers yet. Their portfolio bears a reasonable amount of asset risk.
It's slightly less yielded than our portfolio. There is some room to add mortgages and real
estate. If you compare the Loyalis investment portfolio to ours, (28:26) not in the numbers
at this point in time. Similar to Generali, we think that re-risking an asset book is never the

FINAL

key reason to do a deal or to justify doing a transaction. So, the ROIs that you see are
solely based on operating and underwriting synergies. Re-risking itself is the icing on the
cake, which is not justify the case.
So you're looking at relatively single-digit numbers. If you look at the asset base and what
you can do, there's a couple of million we could add probably, but that's not going to
move the dial. And in terms of the cross-sell, something similar, we can see opportunities
for cross-sell, but we haven't quantiﬁed them yet, maybe Jos you can elaborate on those.

A - Jos P. M. Baeten

{BIO 2036695 <GO>}

Yeah. I would – you know us as very conservative, so we haven't issued any topline crosssell assumptions going forward as (29:19) and closing, we will start developing plans with
the management team on what the product demand from their customers is, which we
can add back, for the time being we have said let's assume no further additional growth
to justify the business case. So this business case is based on the current product suite
without any future cross-sell involved.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. That's very clear. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Now we move on now to our next question, which comes from Robin van den
Broek from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.

Q - Robin Eduard van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Congratulations on the deal. My ﬁrst question is what
kind of cost per ﬁnancing have you assumed in the €35 million of OCC you've guided for?
That will be question one. The second one is, you lean back on the 140% Solvency II ratio.
I think that was also the rebase you used in the Generali Nederland's deal.
Now, I was also wondering this doesn't really talk about the quality of capital. Loyalis
clearly has no debt on the balance sheet, so that that 140% for them is a lot better than it
would be for potentially other assets. So I was just wondering if you could explain to us
how your rebalancing act on the capital position works if there would be more leverage in
place. And on the last question is on whether this deal makes you come closer to the
potential incremental model validation process? Thank you.

A - Chris H. Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Robin, I will ask quick question, and a bit a little more clarity and clariﬁcation on the
second question. So, on the ﬁrst question we assume a small couple of million cash out
for the year, with a funding (31:10) at the bank loan work. The all-in funding for a one-year
bank loan including commitment fee, renewal fee, interest rate fees is probably up to 70
basis points (31:20) which mean our negotiations haven't been closed. So we will not
(31:23) there yet, so think about €2 million to €3 million of ﬁnancing cost can be – and you

have seen in the ﬁrst year, for latter years we have not yet included those as they depend
on the transactions – on the ﬁnal deal we will make, but in principals you've got €2 million
to €3 million in the ﬁrst year?
And the second question, well, I'll pick up your third one, both as being as close to an
internal model, a tiny step but not the ﬁnal step so to speak. So it has a €3 billion AUM
portfolio to our assets, the re-risking will be done in areas of mortgages, and real estate
that, to some extent, are less aﬀected by the internal model; real estate a bit more.
Internal model helps, but this is not moving to dial or making the ﬁnal call on requiring
internal model (32:18). It still works standalone with or without an internal model.
And your second question, could you elaborate – I couldn't (32:26).

Q - Robin Eduard van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

I mean, Loyalis, basically, all the own funds are – is on unrestricted Tier 1. If you would look
at – I guess the big elephant in the room here is (32:37) you have a lot more Tier 1 and Tier
2 capital in there as well. If you then would do a rebase of capital towards 140%, you could
even argue that, yeah, (32:48) has excess capital. So, just wondering how leverage
basically is aﬀecting that excess capital within these M&A frameworks.

A - Chris H. Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

(33:00) Robin, I think I'll – let's keep this call to Loyalis, not hypothesize or speculate on a
ﬁle that may or may not come. On the Loyalis situation, look, this business is actually fully
debt-free. And what I ﬁnd very important is not so much on the leverage, but also
speciﬁcally about the VA and UFR. Loyalis, our estimate, if you exclude the UFR, exclude
the VA, it would still have, for example, in Life, a solvency north of 140%. In IFRS, Loyalis
Life solvency, (33:34) 149%. And in P&C, it would still be around the 170% mark.
So, I think at this point, we think it's fair to assume that, for this transaction, we did a
normalized business, not sensitive to UFR, not sensitive to VA, that our existing
management letter is fully consistent and could be applied in this case. And in essence, I
am more looking at sensitivity to assumptions, mostly UFR and VA, to be set to 140% level
of business. If you would buy (34:06) diﬀerent leverage situation, we may want to revisit it,
but in (34:11) transaction both Generali and the Loyalis business without leverage and we
are very limited to UFR, VA sensitivity, we think the 140% makes perfect sense.
By the way, if you were to run the number at say 160%, that means our capital
commitment, the fungible capital would be roughly €60 million higher. So, we did (34:37)
what if we did not deﬁned fungibility on 140%, but on 160%, this €200 million ultimate
capital commitment would become €260 million, (34:49) €260 million, the deal still holds.
So, even if you do the transaction, the numbers on 160% basis, it's still the north of 12%
ROI. And secondly, you still are north of beating, for example, spending the same of
capital on buying back our own shares. So, in short summary, we talk about Loyalis-only
sensitivity to UFR and VA is more important than leverage at this point in time. The 140%
holds for us, holds for them, holds for Generali, but also at 160%, the deal is still (35:28).

Thank you. We will move on to our next question, and this comes from Albert Ploegh from
ING Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions from my side. First one is, maybe on the
customer base currently of the Loyalis (35:56) I think it was mentioned. Yeah. What
percentage is that basically, what you would call, civil servants? Because I guess Loyalis is
also opening up to, let's say, (36:08) customer base as well. And you mentioned retention
rates are still high. Can you give a bit more color what they are and what the trend has
been in recent years as far as you have to post that information?
And the second question is related to the cost synergy potential of €10 million, €15
million, and let's say, the guidance of OCC and net operating result of €35 million to €40
million, where you put a year 2022, of course, still some years away. So, can you maybe
give us a bit more color on the phasing of that? I guess, (36:46) largely due to the let's say
consolidation of total Life portfolios. Little bit more color would be helpful there. Thank
you.

{BIO 2036695 <GO>}

To your ﬁrst question, roughly 80% is in the area of universities, schools and civil servants
of the portfolio, mainly Disability portfolio, and 20% is in the area of large corporate
institutions like, for example, some hospitals. So, hopefully that answers your ﬁrst
question. And that's the area where we aim at further growth going forward, but what is
not yet included in the deal speciﬁcs and in the ﬁnancials. And, Chris?

A - Chris H. Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Yes. On the synergies, I think about the only worry is in the initial set of synergies in 2019,
mainly around the asset management stage, where in-house – the asset management
today is done by APG. We'll bring back the asset management to our own business and
that of course is highly capable activities.
Secondly, there are some cost allocations from services provided by APG to Loyalis that
(38:09) a.s.r. So, in essence, there will be some savings early in the year one, think about
something like up to €5 million in 2019. That will move to around €8 million in 2020.
When you think about in 2021, you're pretty close to the run rate of up to €50 million
synergies. So, in the ﬁrst year, it's savings on services provided by APG, that a.s.r. will take
on board with very limited additional cost, and then further cost savings will commence in
2020 and mostly 2021. And with that 2021, you will be looking at closer to €50 million run
rate synergies.

Thank you. We will now move on to our next question. That is from Steven Haywood from
HSBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Thank you, and good morning. Just to clarify on one point that you mentioned about a
low 90s combined ratio. Could you be a bit more speciﬁc on that combined ratio,
whether that's been achieved or whether that's sort of the forecast you expect to get from
Loyalis?
And then, secondly, on your service book consolidation process, can you remind me of
where we are, particularly with regard to your internal books, your Generali Nederland
book, and then what – where the Loyalis book will come in to the sort of consolidation
process here?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then, ﬁnally, is there any chance you can give us a.s.r. standalone Solvency II ratio or
sort of guidance towards what it should be for the end of Q3 or even for the end of
November? Thank you.

A - Jos P. M. Baeten

{BIO 2036695 <GO>}

Hi, Steven. This is Jos. On the combined ratio (39:54) we recalculated their combined
ratio based on our way of calculating the combined ratio, and they had been in the space
between 85% and 90%. So, if I say low-90%, I actually mean it's 90% or even a bit lower.
And that's within the target range of our own Disability targets going forward being
between 92% and 94%. So, this perfectly ﬁts in our Disability targets going forward, and
we don't have to do a lot of repairing on that like we had to do in the Non-Life business of
Generali, for example, where the combined was above 100%. So, it's a healthy portfolio.
On your second question, Steven, where are we in the integration of the diﬀerent
individual Life books, we had ﬁnalized all the own books except one, that was actually an
outsourced book to India. We're now considering whether we should insource that again
and bring it over to our own Software-as-a-Service platform. If and when we decide to do
so, then it will be gone half 2019. So, the half is next year.
Also, the Generali integration will be ﬁnalized somewhere in the second or third quarter
next year. So, if we take three to four months for closing the transaction of Loyalis,
preparing the integration of the Loyalis book, we will be able to start the integration of the
Loyalis book as from the end of 2019 and ﬁnalize it, as I said in my introduction, in 2020.

And to your question, Steven, on solvency for Q3, well, we don't disclose solvency on a
quarterly level, so let's not go into there. But the numbers you can see on the pack were
on the pro forma half year numbers. Without disclosing too much, I think you'll be very
safe to work with these numbers and the ranges.

from Degroof Petercam. Please go ahead.

Q - Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Only one strategic like and
another one is more of a little bit detailed. So, ﬁrst, on the Life for Loyalis, is there any unitlinked, any DC in there? Or should we just see this as additional service books that will be
run oﬀ? And how is the maturity hedging of the liabilities regarding the reserves?

Bloomberg Transcript

Talking about reserve, there are €3.4 billion, while in the press release, you're talking
about asset managers of €3.1 billion. Could you explain the diﬀerence? And then ﬁnally,
probably on the cost savings, there will be some restructuring charges. So what is the
amount and the timing of this? Thank you.

A - Jos P. M. Baeten

FINAL

We have looked into the Life portfolio, there is a small – a very small amount of unit life
policies involved. Hardly any legal cases on them, and they have delivered on all the
agreements that were made with the government and with AFM to deliver on
compensation. So, from a risk proﬁle of the transaction, our judgment is that we are not
onboarding additional risk on the unit-linked ﬁle.
And then, on the diﬀerence between the €3.1 billion and the €3.3 billion, the €3.1 billion is
the assets we are going to manage ourselves. And if you look at their balance sheet, there
is some liquidity and the diﬀerence between the €3.1 billion and €3.3 billion is mainly
liquidity.

Q - Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

Okay. (44:35) maturity hedged liabilities assets?

A - Chris H. Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Bart, it's Chris. We have a slightly diﬀerent hedging proﬁle, and the existing hedging
proﬁle by Loyalis is more aimed at protecting the IFRS balance sheet and less on Solvency
II, because they were in IFRS mark-to-market balance sheet. So, their hedging strategy is
slightly diﬀerent from ours. (45:04) our strategy will, once we control the business, moving
to our interest rate hedging policy, which eﬀectively is a combination of duration of the
maturity hedged.
We try to be as much as possible (45:17) in terms of our duration, but eﬀectively, there will
be some practicality that not only require you to completely (45:28) especially for long
dated dues, but fair to say that the relatively short maturity book of Loyalis will be when it
comes into our balance sheet, predominantly, be cash and maturity hedged.

Q - Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

And then, the cost of all this integration and restructuring? Thank you.

A - Jos P. M. Baeten

{BIO 2036695 <GO>}

Then, on the timing, we assume that all the integration is done in end of – mostly it'll be
done end of 2020, and well – on the cost – and the results of (46:18) 2021. And on the
cost, we haven't yet disclosed an exact number, but given our experiences in integrations,
you can assume that the numbers we have presented and those already includes the
integration cost that they are fairly conservative.

Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Benoît Pétrarque
Hi, there. Good morning. Just one on the combined ratio side, could you talk about the
(47:07) cycle combined ratio for the business? Obviously, (47:12) business well particularly.
So, just wondering how is the behavior in terms of combined ratio (47:21) that's seen in the
books. And related to that, is the 85%, 90% kind of average cost of cycle or we kind of
currently only expect in the current cycle? Thanks.

A - Jos P. M. Baeten

{BIO 2036695 <GO>}

Thank you, Benoît. Over time, we have seen a relative stable development of the
combined ratio of the last – by heart, over the last ﬁve years at least, which has been
consistently based on our way of calculating the combined ratio between 85% and 90%,
so it's a very healthy and stable portfolio going forward. And that's what we'd assume that
we are able to continue to deliver going forward.

Q - Benoît Pétrarque

Thank you. Now, we'll move on to our next question. And this comes from Robin van den
Broek from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.

Q - Robin Eduard van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

Yes. Sorry to come back on the cost of ﬁnancing question I asked before, but, Chris, if I
understand your reasoning during the call correctly, you indicated that Tier 2 ﬁnancing
would be the most logical way to deal with Loyalis. I think Tier 2 correctly has a yield of
4%. And when I asked the question what's baked into that €35 million of OCC, you
seemed to imply that that's not 4% of the potential ﬁnancing, which would be roughly –
yeah, probably more than half of the €35 million, if you pay 4% on the €500 million. So,
am I seeing something wrong here or could you elaborate a little bit?

A - Chris H. Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Yeah. (49:03) is no, indeed. We've baked in the one year (49:08) cost in the OCC. Going
forward, the new realm, we haven't. Although at the same time, if you were to raise €500
million of hybrid, that would probably change the asset allocation for business somewhat
because that will mean you'd have more capital spent on the (49:25) side. So today, we
keep the asset mix as it is. And that's why we're spending 9% points of solvency on this.
If you were to fund it with a Tier 2 hybrid, which, for example, could cost you €4 million,
you have say €500 million of capital value (49:40) supporting the further risk allocation
that would also be added to the OCC. So, if you do the OCC number correctly, you take
up some funding costs but you add more market risk income at the time, if you could
Page 16 of 18

have more €500 million of more capital in your base. In today's situation, we spend 8% of
solvency points, but we keep the existing investment portfolio. So, both sides (50:07).

also from a ﬁnancial perspective, it is very, very value creative transaction, which perfectly
ﬁts in our strategy to build an ecosystem in the area of disability. And as you may expect
from us, we will deliver on the integration targets that we have set and also we will deliver
