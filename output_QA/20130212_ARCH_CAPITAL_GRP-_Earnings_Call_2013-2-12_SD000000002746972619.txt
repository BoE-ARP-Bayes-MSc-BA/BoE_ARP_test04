Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The Fourth
Quarter from an earnings point of view was negatively impacted by the catastrophic
activity of Superstorm Sandy for which we recorded approximately $200 million of net
losses. On a more positive note, as we announced last week, we have entered into is a
definitive agreement to purchase CMGMI and the operating assets of PMI. We will
comment on this transaction and on Sandy later in this call. On an operating basis, we lost
$0.18 per share for the quarter, bringing our annual operating earnings per share to $2.54
for the year, which produced a 7.7% return on equity. Reported underwriting results were
significantly affected by Sandy as we recorded a combined ratio of 112.4%, with Sandy
contributing 26 points to that combined ratio, while our investment performance for the
quarter, including the effects of foreign exchange, was a total return of 80 basis points.
For the year, our total return on investments inclusive of foreign exchange was excellent
at 5.88%. Our cash flow for the quarter was good at $190 million, an increase of $80
million over the year-ago quarter.
Our book value per common share decreased slightly to $36.19, mainly as a result of the
impact of Sandy and the temporary effects of share repurchases. On a year-over-year
basis our book value per share increased by 14%, an excellent result. We also had very
strong premium growth for the quarter, which I will comment in a few minutes. On the
market, the market environment continues on a path of modest improvement across the
board. We estimate that for our insurance business the rate increases in the quarter
exceeded our estimated loss trend by approximately 230 basis points in the aggregate.
These improvements on a line-by-line basis ranged from minus 100 basis points to plus
1,200 basis points. The movement of business from the admitted markets back to the
EMS markets is continuing. This provides us with additional opportunities. However, on an
absolute basis, most long tail casualty business, based on the current interest rates
environment, still require more rate improvements to meet our return requirements. On a
consolidated basis, gross premiums were up 16.3% and net premiums were up 20%.
Looking at growth by segment, the Insurance Group's premium rose by approximately
5.6% on a gross basis and 7.2% on a net basis. And similar to last quarter, slightly over 0.5
of the increase in gross return premium was due to increased rates and the balance was
due to additional exposures. The Reinsurance Group premium volume was up 51.5% on a
gross basis and 50.6% on a net basis. These increases primarily resulted from several
opportunities that we capitalized on during the past three years. Namely, UK motor
reinsurance and mortgage insurance, as we discussed last quarter, and increased activity
in our property cat and property FAC operations. Superstorm Sandy had a localized effect

on rates, primarily on loss-driven accounts in the Northeast, but had little other effect
elsewhere around the country. Group-wide, on an expected basis, the return on equity on
the business we wrote this year will produce an underwriting year return on equity in the
range of 10% to 12%. The underwriting margin improvement that I mentioned earlier will
not affect the expected return on equity as the improvement in expected underwriting
results has been largely offset by the reduction in expected investment yield.
During the Fourth Quarter, we repurchased 3.9 million shares at a cost of $172 million. We
remain in an excess capital position and we expect to still be in an excess capital position
after the mortgage transaction closes. As always, our position is to return excess capital
to shareholders unless we can deploy it effectively in our business. As a result, we expect
to continue with our share repurchases at a level approximately equal to our quarterly
earnings for the first half of the year and will follow the same approach to share
repurchases in the coming quarters as we have done historically. Now let me update you
on our cat PML aggregates. As of January 1, 2013, our largest 250-year PMLs for a single
event were basically unchanged with $867 million in the Northeast or approximately 18%
of shareholders' equity, $862 million in the Gulf where Florida Tri-County PML now stands
at $602 million.
Before I turn it over to Mark for more commentary on our financial results, as I indicated
earlier, I have a few additional comments on our recent announcement. During the quarter
after an extensive due diligence process we entered into definitive agreements with
Cuna Mutual and PMI for the purchase of CMGMI and the operating assets and
infrastructure of PMI. The transaction is expected to close in the latter part of this year as
it is subject to obtaining approvals from insurance regulators, the Arizona receivership
court, and the GSEs, as well as customary closing conditions. This transaction will provide
us with an approved operating platform and nationwide licenses that would allow us to
participate in the mortgage insurance space on a direct basis.
This new operation will complement our existing reinsurance capabilities and our
European-based mortgage capabilities. We expect to continue to support our value
customers in the mortgage insurance space as a stable long-term reinsurer. And of
course, we would enter the mortgage insurance business on a direct basis in the United
States following the closing of the transaction. We're looking forward to partnering with
Cuna Mutual, who will continue to service their credit union customers on our behalf.
We're also pleased with the opportunity to hire the existing employee work force of PMI.
We intend to create a stable employment environment for them for many years to come.
We believe that the combination of Arch executive management and PMI's senior
management, together with a strong capital position and disciplined approach to
underwriting, will create an enduring enterprise in the mortgage insurance space.
Although the transaction is not expected to be accretive to earnings for the first two years
subsequent to closing, we believe that the mortgage insurance business will be profitable
over the long term and we expect that this transaction will meet or exceed our target
return levels and will create long-term value to our shareholders.
With that I'll now turn it over to Mark to comment further on our financial results. Mark?

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Great. Thank you, Dinos. Good morning, all. The consolidated combined ratio for this
quarter was 112.4% with 25.8 points of current accident year cat-related events that have
reinsurance and reinstatement premiums, compared to the 2011 Fourth Quarter combined
ratio of 89.7%, which reflected 10.5 points of cat-related events, also net of reinsurance
and reinstatement premiums. The 2012 Fourth Quarter reflected 26.1 combined ratio
points from Superstorm Sandy with the balance emanating from minor adjustments to
other 2012 cat events, such as the First Quarter of 2012 US storms and First Quarter
southeast Australian floods. Our best estimate of the Sandy loss is consistent with our
December 19 press release and reflects an approximately 60%, 40% mix for our
reinsurance and insurance segments, respectively.

Bloomberg Transcript

The 2012 Fourth Quarter consolidated combined ratio also reflected 7 points of prior-year
net favorable development, also net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums and
acquisition-related expenses, compared to 15 points of prior-year favorable
developments in the 2011 Fourth Quarter. This resulted in 93.6% current accident year
combined ratio excluding cats for the Fourth Quarter of 2012 compared to 94.4% in the
Fourth Quarter of 2011. Over 90% of the net favorable development in this quarter was
from the reinsurance segment, with approximately two-thirds of that due to favorable
development on short tailed lines concentrated in the more recent underwriting years,
roughly 8% from medium tailed lines spaced throughout many underwriting years, and
about 25% due to favorable development on longer tailed lines, primarily from the 2004
to 2008 underwriting years. The remaining net favorable development comes from the
insurance segment and was mainly driven by shorter tailed lines predominantly from the
more recent accident years.
Similar to prior periods, approximately 69% of our total net reserves for loss and loss
adjustment expense or $7.1 billion are IBNR or Additional Case Reserves, which is a fairly
consistent ratio across both the reinsurance and insurance segments. On a consolidated
basis, the 2012 calendar year produced a 95.4% combined ratio on a reported basis
compared to 98.3% for 2011, representing $99 million improvement in underwriting
income and reflecting a lower level of catastrophic activity than in 2011. The 2012 expense
ratio improvement reflects in part the expense control initiatives instituted over the last
few years, mostly in the 50 bps improvement in the operating expense component. The
full accident year 2012 combined ratio excluding cap was 94% compared to the full
accident year of 2011 combined ratio of 93.6%.
Overall, on a consolidated basis, the full 2002 year saw $433 million of gross written
premium growth or 12.6% and $375 million or 14.2% on a net basis. About two-thirds of this
growth in gross written premiums came from the reinsurance segment and one-third
from the insurance segment. On a consolidated bases the ratio of net premium to gross
premium in the quarter was 75.3% versus 73.1% a year ago. In the reinsurance segment
the net to gross ratio was approximately equal to one year ago at 92%, and the insurance
segment was a 68% ratio compared to 67% a year ago as a result of our strategy to grow
the lesser volatile smaller account businesses and reduce our exposure in the higher
severity businesses.

In the reinsurance segment, the 2012 accident quarter combined ratio excluding caps was
83.9% compared to 83% even in the 2011 Fourth Quarter. The reinsurance segment
results this quarter reflect, as Dinos mentioned, changes in the mix of business on a
written basis with a higher contribution from mortgage reinsurance lines, UK motor and
property insured tailed businesses than in the Fourth Quarter of 2011. Additionally, this
quarter saw some escalation in recorded reinsurance crop losses for accident year 2012,
which the company does not classify as cat losses, based on additional reports from
cedent plus our own additional case reserves. Lastly, this quarter had 1.9 points of bonus
accrual adjustments stemming from favorable prior-year development. The restated
accident quarter combined ratio without this effect was 82%.

Bloomberg Transcript

The 2012 Fourth Quarter results for the Reinsurance Group, as has been true in the last
two quarters, includes the effects of the April 2012 acquisition of the international credit
and surety operations of Ariel RE based in Zurich, Switzerland. This acquisition accounted - under purchase accounting rules contained an unearned [ph] premium reserve that was
not included in the premiums written but is reflected in premiums earned on an ongoing
basis. Net premiums earned for this quarter included approximately $17 million from this
acquisition, with the remaining December 31 on a premium reserve of approximately $34
million to be about 50% earned over the next two quarters and the balance substantially
earned within one year after that. In the insurance segment, the 2012 accident quarter
combined ratio excluding caps was 100.4% compared to 100.9% a year ago. The Fourth
Quarter of 2012, however, contained one expense ratio point of bonus accrual
adjustments as a result of prior-period favorable reserve development.
The accident quarter combined ratio is 99.4% when this effect is removed. The insurance
segment had net premium growth predominantly emanating from the US operations. This
US growth came from programs, executive assurance, and lender product units with a
continued reduction in US casualty lines and declines in the tech risk line across all
geographies. The program's unit saw growth primarily from two large existing programs
along with growth from a newer program which we regained back in the First Quarter of
2012. Net investment income in the 2012 Fourth Quarter was $0.53 per share, substantially
unchanged from the $0.53 per share in both the 2012 third and Second Quarters. Our
embedded pre-tax book yield before expenses was 2.6% as of December 31 compared
to 2.8% as of September 30. The duration of the portfolio lengthened slightly to 2.06
years from 2.9 years as of September 30.
As Dinos mentioned, the total return on the portfolio was 80 basis points in the 2012
Fourth Quarter with emerging market investments and some high-yield corporate bonds
augmenting the returns in our core investment grade fixed income portfolio. Excluding
foreign exchange, total return was 67 basis points. Our exposure to Eurozone countries is
listed in the financial supplement with minimal exposures to counties currently undergoing
severe economic hardship. The 2012 year total return on the portfolio was 5.88%,
including the effects of foreign exchange, compared to 3.81% in the 2011 year. Excluding
foreign exchange, the full year return was 5.59% compared to 4.1% in the 2011 year.
Our effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income for the full 2012 year was a benefit of
3.8% compared to an identical benefit of 3.8% in the full 2011 year. The impact of Sandy
produced underwriting losses thereby reducing our full year effective tax rate as a result.

FINAL

Fluctuations in the effective tax rate result from variability in the relative mix of income or
loss reported by jurisdiction. Current quarter preferred dividend expense of $5.5 million
was identical to the Third Quarter of 2012 but less than the $6.5 million of preferred
dividend expense occurring in the 2011 Fourth Quarter. As discussed on last quarter's call,
this reduction relative to the Fourth Quarter of 2011 is due to the refinancing of our
preferred shares by retiring our series A and B classes and replacing them with the more
cost-effective series C class. The $5.5 million is the true quarterly run rate.
Our total capital was $5.57 billion at the end of the 2012 Fourth Quarter, compared to
$5.75 billion at the end of the Third Quarter and $5 billion at year end 2011 with the
decrease in the current quarter largely due to the effects of $172 million of share
repurchases. This represents an 11.6% increase in capital from year end 2011, and our debt
to capital ratio remains a low 7.2% and debt plus hybrids represent only 13% of our total
capital, giving us significant financial flexibility. At the end of 2012, we continue to estimate
having excess over our targeted capital position. Book value per share decreased $0.60
to $36.19 versus $36.79 in the Fourth Quarter, reflecting primarily operating results and the
short-term effects of share repurchases. Brook value per share, however, has increased
by 13.9% relative to year end 2011.
With these introductory comments, we are now pleased to take your questions.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

First from the mortgage insurance perspective. What are the long-term ROAs that you're
looking in this? Is it 15% or is it higher than that?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well it's-- I would say is 15%. It can be better than that. You know, let's keep it at 15% and
we are happy with that.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. And you're saying that the accretion would only happen in maybe 2015 if this
transaction goes through?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

The accretion will not happen until actually 2016. We estimate this to close by probably
third, Fourth Quarter this year. There is a process we have to go through. So that first full
year of operation will be 2013. Second year would be 2014. So those are-- those two
Page 6 of 21

years we don't expect any accretion. Then after that we expect to be accretive in 2016.
Mark, you want to add anything to that?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

FINAL

I agree. Just a clarification that the first full-- two full years are 2014 and 2015.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Right.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

So 2014 and 2015. No income and 2016 will be okay. And also looking at the amount of
capital that you plan to invest. You've planned to spend about $300 million. Do you think
that you can up-size that based on the opportunities out there? Or is it too early right
now?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

It will depend on the opportunities. Traditionally as a company we always want to operate
all of our units with a strong capital position. That's a commitment we make to customers.
That's a commitment we make to the rating agencies. That's a commitment to make to
our employees. So depending how well that business and how good our penetration is in
that market, we will make sure that we have adequate capital supporting that business.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Second question is on growth. Your top-line growth in the primary insurance segment was
lower than some of your periods has been. Just curious as to your perspective as to
where pricing is right now and where you would like it to be so that it could significantly
ramp up the top line.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I think where we differ with some of our competitors is on the very long tail lines. When
you factor in new money yield through the duration of the liabilities and you do those
calculations, even though some of these lines are getting actually the bigger rate
increases, we still don't see them needing our returns. And for that reason, we're holding
back our units in writing more. And to be more specific is some of the primary casualty
lines, some of the excess and umbrella lines we're being very cautious about it. And it's
excess workers comp, the workers comp line we'll be more cautious about these lines
because of where interest rates are. Mark, you want to add to it?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yes, Dinos. I would say, just echoing what Dinos said, the specialty casualty line over the
last couple quarters haves gotten 12% to 14% to 15% increases. The way we look at it
though, as we stated before, it's what's the absolute return those increases give us, not
just the fact that they're increases. We still think that has a long way to go. Just to give you
a little insight, our specialty casualty unit in the month that just went by, a little look
Page 7 of 21



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2013-02-12

forward, only wrote a couple hundred thousand dollars of new business. Why? Because
we don't yet [ph] forgetting those kind of increases, but the absolute margin isn't there
yet. So we could make the same comment on excess work comp. We could make the
same comment on other longer tail lines of business.

FINAL

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

But I don't want to mislead you. I think the market is improving, so we are not disagreeing
with some of our competitors' comments. It's just maybe it's our view on the absolute
profitability of certain classes that differs. We have been always a patient Company
because-- on premium revenue because, to tell you the truth, we love to grow high
percentages if the market allows us. But we will not hesitate to shrink if we don't think
we're getting the right rates. So it's a mixed bag right now. We got segments we're bullish
and we're letting the units grow. Then we have segments we're not bullish and we
actually shrinking.

Bloomberg Transcript

The combination of that, though, is giving us a growth which is not-- I'm not disappointed. I
think 7% on the net and about 5% on a gross on the Insurance Group is-- in this market
environment is not a bad result. And from-- the First Quarter I can talk about January 1. I
think our growth in January 1 business was even a little higher than that. But one month
doesn't make a quarter over year. So in essence the momentum is going in the right
direction as far as we're concerned.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

One follow-up on that. Just curious as to what do you think the tradeoff is by being more
conservative now, versus some of your peers saying we want to go write the business
now and on the next renewal we will just take pricing up?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

That's a strategy that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. If you like to be a
prophet to see what's going to happen, sometimes things happen to you because you
might be reading the obituary pages and you find your name on it. So I don't like to
predict the future. What we see, we instruct our units this is the market that you're
operating. What you see today, you take actions today. And if that changes tomorrow, you
have the right to change your approach. And that's why we're a Company pays very little
attention to premium budgets. Our units, they get capital allocation on a quarterly basis.
We reevaluate that based on market conditions and we expect that agility from our
operating units to be able to adjust and reflect what's happening in the market. So that
formula has worked for us for 10 years and I'm not going to change it.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

And that strategy that you just talked about isn't just a forward look in the insurance
market. It's a forward look in the economy. So the idea that the economy would have

recovered enough that customers would be willing and able to make-- and pay a big rate
increase a year hence is also a bet we don't quite believe in yet.

Amit Kamar with Macquarie Group.

Q - Amit Kamar
Just a couple of follow-ups on the prior discussion of-- on the USMI business. If you factor
in the earn out, what would the deal equate on a price-to-book basis?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

We want to pay true book value. So the earn out will give a fair price based on how the
book evolves over the next two, three years. And that's what we negotiated.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yes. And that has to-- the proof's in the pudding on that. As the in force of business is
tracked over that period of time it will indicate an additional payment or no chance there.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And it could be a lot more. It could be a lot less. But we'll let the book evolve. If it's more,
we don't mind paying it. At the end of the day we are getting the value out of it.

Q - Amit Kamar
That leads to the related question. Does that tell us something about the state of the
market with so many companies trading below book in the insurance land? If you are
willing to look at other segments is that sort of overreaching what the state of the cycle
is?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It has nothing to do with the cycle. We've been in this space now since 2009 and Andrew
Rippert which is the subject matter more senior expert in our operations was hired over
three plus years ago originally was for us to see if we have reinsurance opportunities and
later on to evolve into insurance opportunities both here in the United States and also in
other parts around the world, European Union, Australia, and other parts of the world. So
this is-- this was a strategic move by us. But in our way we try do it as we acquire talent
and as we find opportunities to acquire additional talent licenses, et cetera.
So it goes in that continuum. It has nothing-- we view this a long-term play. Mortgage
insurance has been around for a long time. And with the exception of four or five years
that, unfortunately, bad underwriting decisions were made by most in the space, if you
examine the history of the product it's been a profitable line as long as you remain
disciplined in underwriting.

Q - Amit Kamar

FINAL

Makes sense. Final question, and then this goes back to your remarks regarding capital.
How do you think about the capital needs for this business? What I'm trying to ask is the
deal is done and then you sort of ramp up. At that point of time how much capital-- is that
a range of capital would you need and how would that play against capital management,
let's say, for 2014 and 2015? I am trying to think of some sort of relative proposition.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well you have to, I think, fundamentally, you have to think about capital a little differently.
First off any final capital decisions is going to be a function of two things really. It's the
implied business plan and our growth and the opportunities that we see and also
discussions we have with GSEs and perhaps other regulators. But it's not really a premium
to surplus ratio or reserve to surplus ratio. It's a view of what's called really risk in force so- to capital. And the industry has generally been operating around a 20 to 1 ratio. There is
variations on that for different kinds of businesses and so forth.
But 20 to 25 to 1 is what's going on right now. A lot of the key competitors in that space
are 23 to 25 to 1. That's the ratio to the risk to the capital. So 20 to 1 would be 5%, 25 to 1
it would be 4%.But again that's going to be a buildup over time directly as a function of
our business plan.

Q - Amit Kamar

Bloomberg Transcript

So if I simply add up the risk in force numbers I can usually come up with the capital
number?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

That's correct.

Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

One question on the reinsurance side. We heard other carriers talk about just low level of
non-Sandy large losses in the Fourth Quarter. Did you see that in-- on the reinsurance side
at all in the Fourth Quarter?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes. I think the quarter was good other than Sandy. We saw that.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

If we were to back out the crop losses that were in the underlying and the impact of a
benign 4Q on that front, would they generally offset each other? Just trying to think about
what's underneath this sort of noise, the underlying sort of look like in reinsurance.

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, I would think that's a reasonable approach, backing out the crop. The crop is the
really the outlier in this quarter out of the reinsurance segment. We could always talk
about-- there is always going to be a few large claims that come through here and there. I
would say that's a fairly reasonable approach.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

One question on the portfolio. It looks like the turnover is pretty high. I am guessing it's
not the entire portfolio that is turning over but maybe a subset. Could you give us a little
bit of color on what the strategy is there and whether the source-- whether this activity is
the source of the realized gains that you have seen over the last few quarters?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

A lot of that strategy is-- first, the subset is generally in the treasury auction space. So the
treasury auctions would come up and we would participate perhaps to varying degrees.
So yes, that would be a source of some of the realized gains. But it's really done for
liquidity purposes as well. Over time the view of the yields of it when you're holding it for
a while, it changes in the marketplace. But to your core question, it's really the treasury
auction space is the core source of turnover.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So--

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

And let me add to that. Our philosophy is for total return. So we are not going to hold
some of this to maturity just for the simple reason that we can be clipping the coupons all
the time. If we see opportunities that we can make a trade, our investment department
will make that trade. And we don't-- I know you guys like investment income versus
realized gains. But at the end of the day we don't really care too much. As long as our
book value per share keeps going up, eventually what you consider core earnings versus
non-core earnings. Earnings are earnings. At the end of the day we like that approach.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

I guess the question is how much turnover-- so it looks like if I just add all the cash that
was up for the year, it looks like you've got about twice the total portfolio turning over in a
given year. So roughly every six months. I am guessing that's not right. I am guessing there
is a small sleeve of the portfolio that's turning over maybe three or four or five times. Is
that what-- is that it that level of turnover?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes, there is some portions of the portfolio-- actually, they have turned over six times.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

FINAL

Following up on Mike's question. The reinvestment of the TALF assets, what's that going
to do to yield in the coming year?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

The TALF had-- first talk about what it does by not being there as opposed to what it's
reinvested in. There is a two-pronged impact. You do have reduction in net investment
income but you also have reduction on interest expense because this was a levered
investment. It had some debt associated with it. There was roughly a reduction of a $1
million and change on the interest expense and it was about $2 million and change, I think,
on the net investment income on a run rate quarter. Where that gets reinvested it's-- you
should I guess really look at it as a distribution across all our asset classes. We can't say
the TALF numbers went specifically to this investment or specifically to a different
investment.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We have an asset allocation. It goes to the different buckets. And they get funded by
either things that they mature, things that we trade or things that they come-- do. So we
don't specifically say we're going to take the TALF asset and we got to put it into this
place. It gets into the mix and then the investment department would say where do we
have obligations? Like we-- in our alternative asset classes we have probably close to $0.5
billion of unfunded yet commitments.
So when we get the calls from these managers, then we have an obligation to fund. So
sometimes we will go to alternatives. And if there is no calls for alternatives, we will put
them into the regular portfolio.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Well I guess more specifically in numbers, the-- I'm trying to figure out what the impact will
be in the coming year. I assume the TALF assets were generally high yielding compared to
other stuff in the portfolio? Or maybe that's incorrect.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It was high yielding, yes. And so the nature of it was--

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

So can we talk about the difference between the bet [ph] yield and what is available to
you in the market right now I suppose?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well it depends which sector, right? The TALF yield was in the low double digits. I don't
know if it was 12% or 13%, thereabouts. But we have high-yield investments in alternative

FINAL

space, which is exactly that. So I don't know if we're going to utilize all of it in there or not. I
-- every month when we sit with the investment committee and our Chief Investment
Officer we decide where, based on the asset allocation we have in the different asset
classes, where they are going to put-- so it's very hard, Josh, to tell you is this going to
reduce the investment yield by a point-- I mean, by 10 basis points or 5 or 3, or it will be
neutral. My guess will probably be neutral.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yes. I think, Josh, the one thing that you perhaps should not do is look exclusively
backwards at some of the net investment income or even on some of the total returns
because that asset allocation mix has changed over time. It's not necessarily reflected
immediately. And as Dinos said, there are still unfunded commitments that clearly
wouldn't be reflected in the financial statement. It has got to be with a view towards a
changing mix as approved by our finance committee that gets into some of these
alternatives.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

The other question, I'm looking at the numbers. Maybe it's just the crop. But it feels to me
of the accent [ph] your numbers in 2012 were a higher combined ratio than 2011 when you
adjust for the luck of the good weather. Is that wrong? How do you view the two years--?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

You've got to see the mix as to there is that equation. And also you got to see as to
where we choose to book the accident year. We're not anxious to be aggressively
booking good accident years even though the data indicates that we can if we wanted to.
We just-- we feel nobody's sticking their hand in our pocket taking the money out. If it
comes in the future, it will come in the future.

We know we have. We don't believe. We know.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Page 13 of 21



FINAL

Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2013-02-12

Well no. Our approach to investments is the investment department gets a capital
allocation depending on the asset classes that-- and the amount of assets that we
allocate in each one of asset class. So yes. In general, in theory, the more capital you
have-- excess capital, it allows you to be in more-- in more asset classes that require
more capital allocation. But we sit down with the investment department and we make
those allocations. Then we know what the capital grow will be because at the end of the
day we're very, very fond of our ratings and we don't want to do anything to jeopardize
those.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

And just for the sake of clarify, assuming nothing else changed, you'd wind up with the
excess-- if nothing else changed other than the shifts to some of these other
investments, the level of excess capital would drop because of the distribution of those
assets getting a higher capital charge. So as we look at our excess capital, it's fully
adjusted for forays into riskier investments.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

That makes perfect sense. When you look at the return potential for casualty lines, the
ones where you are pulling back, is that anticipating a risk-free investment income-investment return? Or --

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes, that is our approach. Our approach is if you have a five-year duration or a seven-year
duration business, some of these lines they get there, some of them they get excess
com [ph]. It might even be 12-, 14-year duration. We apply the risk-free rate to the
calculation. Yes.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks for clarifying that. Can you comment at all on the year-over-year decline in Fourth
Quarter reinsurance segment reserve releases?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I didn't view it as a decline. At the end of the day we do it ground up. A lot their releases
that were short tail-- I think two-thirds of it, it was all short tail. And we haven't looked very
hard on the long tail in this particular quarter. So I wouldn't read anything into it.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

And also you're probably comparing it to the Fourth Quarter of last year whereas I think
the reserve releases over the course of 2012 have been probably relatively consistent. I
will have to go back and look.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Yes. I was looking year-over-year. But it's certainly basically flat with prior quarters.

Bloomberg Transcript

Can you talk about the ROE potential for the new differentiated types of programs you're
putting on? You talked about the purchase commitment for the mortgage insurance
business, for example. I know you have gotten-- you have had that business in Europe
already and then of course the UK motor reinsurance. I am trying to get a sense of what
that-- what the ROE profile of those programs are relative to the rest of your book.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Don't forget, in the mortgage insurance space we believe that it's at 15% our ROE
business. And it can be better. It depends on your underwriting discipline and selections,
et cetera. Having said that, the UK motor is not quite as good as that, but it's double
digits. And as we said in prior calls, if it drops below that we would be willing to walk away
from it if we can't get double-digit returns. So that's where those businesses are.
Now, we have high ROE business in other segments. Small amounts, but for example we
just launched a facility on the internet to sell travel accident insurance directly. And if you
go on the site it's called RoamRight. You will be able to see our offerings. Of course, it
might take years before it becomes significant and adds to-- but those businesses have
pretty high ROEs and we're excited about it. These things that we usually have in
incubation for some time until we put them out. I think we did put a press release on that.

A - Mark Lyons

Yes. We did. Yes. We did.

Q - Ian Gutterman

A few clarifications. First, the MI, why is it not accretive the first two years? Is there an
amort that's higher initially and then drops off ? Or is it just the way the growth comes in?
What's the math there?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

I think it's pretty straightforward. You-- it's a labor-intensive business. It's-- there is a lot of
infrastructure that's needed. That's what we're purchasing. And in addition to that with the
employee forces in order to utilize that infrastructure. So it's-- just think of it as having over
a short period of time an employee force that outstrips the revenue generation. Then
that-- and then it reverses itself.

didn't catch the number. About how much was that impact?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

In the quarter it was-- on underwriting gain or loss it was almost $8 million.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

$8 million. Okay. Do you have the reinstatements for this quarter and last year's Q4?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Last year's? I'd have to get back to you. This year the reinstatements-- are you talking
Sandy reinstatements?

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Exactly.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

It was about 10. Between 10 and 10.5 in this quarter.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

And the last one just to address the TALF again. I got a little confused. I think, Mark, you
said it was about $2 million or so quarter of investment income. Then Dinos said it was a
12% yield and it looks like the balance is around $200 million. So $200 million at 12% yield
would be $6 million a quarter, so what am I missing?

Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td

Well you have to get into the details. But it wasn't the entire TALF. We, over the course of
the year, depopulated some of that, mostly in the second half. So it wasn't going to zero.
Even in the Fourth Quarter it would have had a partial reflection of it.

FINAL

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

As deals that were coming off, it was throughout the year. So your calculation-- your math
is correct but incorrect in the degradation of those amounts. We can give you the details
as to how it happened over the year. It wasn't all done in the Fourth Quarter.

Which in all likelihood would be the First Quarter of 2014.

A - Dinos Iordanou

Okay. So I can procrastinate on that one.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes. And I didn't get into the names and all that. But Mark Grandison will be the executive
in charge of the segment. He already runs all of our reinsurance. Then of course I did
mention Andrew Rippert, which is the most senior subject matter expert responsible for
all of what we do in that space. Then David Ginsberg will be our CEO at the PMI and
CMGMI facilities.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Is there a good rule of thumb that we can use in terms of if there is an extra $100 million
of catastrophes in the quarter what the impact would be on variable compensation?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Not-- the $100 million, if it's coming from cats, it doesn't have a huge impact because our
compensation system, even though it's purely ROE based, it spreads cat earnings and cat
losses on a rolling five-year average. We don't want anybody to either get hurt or benefit.
I don't want them to bet their lunch for one year and then the next year I have the major
loss. So if our entire book of business deteriorates by $100 million, I can give you the math
surrounding that because our incentive compensation is pretty straightforward. We earn
8% or better. That's the cliff. At 15% they get 100%. At 23% of ROE they get 200% and
they get 400% if we get into the high 30%s. Then they get nothing if we are below 8%.
So what $100 million on the entire book does to ROE, it will give you the answer.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Just to augment that a little bit, Dinos' description was for the majority of-- within the
group of cat, which is in the Reinsurance Group, the minority, let's say 20%, in rough
terms. The Reinsurance Group doesn't smooth because they already have smoothing,
called the enuring [ph] covers and the cat program that they have.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Right.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

So depending on where that $100 million got felt in the group, it's either smoothed over
five years on the reinsurance side or if it's really hit, the cat program responds and,
therefore, limits the impact on the group.

Operator
A follow-up from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

One quick one. I think, Mark, you talked-- or Dinos I guess talked about the PMLs and the
net change from last year. I was curious. Property cat premiums in reinsurance and in also
non-cat property were a bit higher in 2012 versus 2011, 4Q versus 4Q. How should we
think about the cat load in reinsurance, if that's a fair question? And does that change a lot
from what we might have thought it would have been before that?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

As we said many-- we allocate on the basis of the insurance versus reinsurances. If I have
$0.5 of cat, I give $0.4 to the Reinsurance Group and $0.1 to the Insurance Group. So that's
our allocation. Then we leave it up to the cat teams to determine which zones how much.
As long as we don't exceed the 25% to capital ratio that we superimpose from corporate
down to the operating units. So as you see, sometimes you will see some changes like
the Gulf was our higher zone a quarter ago. Now it's the Northeast. We're a little
underweight in Florida. We had only $602 million in some-- in Florida.
Sometimes we were even higher on a lesser capital a couple years back. But those are
the determinations of our cat underwriting teams as they see what comes in and do they
like the rates, et cetera. And in a lot of other zones we are not totally utilizing our capacity
either because the available business is not there and/or we don't like the rates. I'm
talking about Japanese quake or wind or South American quake or Australia and New
Zealand, whatever other part of the world would be very, very underweight because
we're-- in Europe for wind [ph] because we don't like the rating environment. And that's
individual Company-- we're not thinking that we're smarter than anybody else. We're just
a different opinion, you know. Other people who provide the capacity think they're getting
adequate rates. Our guys don't feel they are getting adequate rates, so we don't utilize a
lot of that capacity.
