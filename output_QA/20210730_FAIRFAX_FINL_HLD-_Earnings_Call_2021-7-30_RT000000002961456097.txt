Presentation
Operator
Good morning and welcome to Fairfax's Second Quarter Results Conference Call. Your
lines have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a
question-and-answer session. (Operator Instruction) For time's sake, we ask that you limit
your questions to one. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections,
you may disconnect at this time. Your host for today's call is Prem Watsa, with opening
remarks from Mr.Derek Bulas. Mr.Bulas, please begin.

Derek Bulas
Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's 2021 second quarter results.
This call may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ, perhaps
materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result of a variety
of uncertainties and risk factors. The most foreseeable of which are set out under risk
factors in our Base Shelf Prospectus, which has been filed with Canadian Securities
regulators and is available on SEDAR, and which now include the risk of adverse
consequences to Fairfax's business, investments and personnel resulting from or related
to the COVID-19 pandemic. Fairfax disclaims any intention or obligation to update or
revise any forward-looking statements except as required by applicable securities law.
I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa.

Hey, thank you, Derek. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Fairfax's 2021
second quarter conference call. I plan to give you some of the highlights and then pass it
on to Peter Clarke, our Chief Operating Officer, to comment on our insurance and
reinsurance operations; and Jen Allen, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide some
additional financial details.
Fairfax had an outstanding second quarter with net earnings of $1.2 billion or earnings per
share of $43.25, and gross premiums are up 27% for the combined ratio of 94.3%.
Insurance and investments are working well together. Fairfax's booke value per share in
the first six months of 2021 increased by 15.2% adjusted for the $10 per share common
dividend paid in the first quarter to $541 per share. Our net earnings of $1.2 billion were a
record for a quarter, but of course, they reflected significant unrealized gains. All of our
major insurance companies generated combined ratios of less than 100%, more on this
from Peter Clarke.
In the second quarter, operating income was strong at $398 million. Net gains on
investments were $1.3 billion with gains on net equity exposures of approximately $900
million, and a $425 million gain on our preferred shares and Digit Insurance. The net gains
on equities included unrealized gains on BlackBerry, Stelco, and BDT. Not included in the
net gain numbers, mark-to-market movements and unknown insurance investments in
associates and certain consolidated investments, which we have described in our annual
report. These investments increased in the second quarter by approximately $340 million.
Any gains or losses in these securities will typically only be accounted for when sold. We
have provided a table on our MD&A on Page 73, that provides the unrealized gains and
losses on these securities.
As we've mentioned at our Annual Meetings and in our Annual Reports and quarterly calls,
with IFRS accounting where stocks and bonds are recorded at market and subject to
mark-to-market gains or losses, quarterly and annual income will fluctuate, and investment
results will only make sense over the long term. As I've said previously, long-term value
investing has gone through a very difficult time for many years now. Valuations of valueoriented stocks versus growth stocks, particularly technology, have never been so
extreme in the recent past, exceeding even the extremes of the .com era in 2000. As the
economy normalizes, we expect a reversion to the mean with value-oriented stocks
coming to the fore. After the Pfizer vaccine was announced last November, we started to
see this take place.
In June, we increased our ownership interest in Singapore Reinsurance from 28.2% and
94% for about $103 million. Through the completion of a public cash offer and
commenced consolidating the assets, liabilities, and results of our operations of
Singapore Re. We expect to acquire the remaining 6% and delist that company from
Singapore's -- from the Singapore Stock Exchange. Singapore Re is a general property
and casualty insurer, that underwrites business primarily in Southeast Asia. Singapore Re
will join our Fairfax Asia operations and will facilitate our continued expansion in the region.

On July 14, 2021, that company increased its interest in Eurolife to 80% by acquiring the
interest of almost for cash consideration of approximately $143 million. The remaining
20% equity interest in Eurolife continues to be owned by Eurobank. The company will
commence consolidating the assets, liabilities, results of operations Eurolife in its
consolidated financial reporting in the third quarter of 2021.
Eurolife is a Greek insurer, which distributes its life and non-life insurance products and
services throw Eurobank's network. Since our initial investment in Eurolife, the company
has increased its book value by 22% annually, thanks to exceptional underwriting and
investment results. We continue to have approximately $1.5 billion at the holding company,
predominantly in cash and short-term securities. Please note our cash in the holding
companies submit any and every contingency that Fairfax might face in the future. We're
not making any long-term investments with this cash other than the support our insurance
and reinsurance operations.

Bloomberg Transcript

With the closing of the RiverStone Barbados transaction, which we expect in August 2021,
we intend to fully pay off our credit facility while maintaining $1.5 billion in cash at the
holding company. At June 30, 2021, the company's insurance and reinsurance companies
held approximately $18 billion in cash and short-dated securities, representing
approximately 40% of our portfolio investments. Should interest rates rise as they may,
the value of our fixed-income portfolio will be relatively unaffected as we have not
reached for yield. Rising interest rates will lead to increase investment income as they are
positioned to take advantage of it.
We continue to invest with Kennedy Wilson in first mortgages with the term less than five
years. Our insurance subsidiaries are growing significantly, on track to generate $23 billion
to $24 billion of gross premium this year at a substantial underwriting profit. Our
investment portfolio now exceeds $45 billion, and our reported book value per share has
risen to $541 with strong underwrite -- underlying upward momentum. Most importantly,
our fair and friendly culture developed over 35 years continues to serve as well. We think
the future is bright and the best is yet to come.
I will now pass the call to Peter Clarke, our Chief Operating Officer, to comment on our
insurance and reinsurance operations. Peter?

{BIO 15243793 <GO>}

Thank you, Prem. Our company is continue to produced outstanding results, the 27%
growth in gross written premium over the second quarter of 2020 with one of the highest
in our history, generating premiums of approximately $6 billion in the quarter. We also
produce the combined ratio of 94% or $228 million of underwriting profit despite
additional COVID-19 losses of $69 million and increased provisions on the first quarter U.S.
winter storms of $87 million. By comparison, in the second quarter of 2020, we produced
an (technical difficulty) primarily due to higher COVID-19 losses of $308 million.
On the underwriting front, Northbridge and Zenith reported the lowest combined ratios
being 85% and 93% respectively. All of our major companies again produced combined

FINAL

ratios well below a 100%. As mentioned, our gross premiums for the quarter was up 27%,
approximately 25% adjusted for foreign exchange, an increase of approximately $1.3
billion in the quarter from the previous year. This growth has been made possible by the
favorable market conditions that prevail in many of our markets, particularly in North
America.
Allied World grew its premiums by 29% with growth especially strong in the Directors and
Officers and excess casualty segments. Odyssey Group's gross premiums were up 25%
with expansion in both its insurance and reinsurance segments. In Canada, Northbridge's
top line expanded 36% in U.S. dollar terms, as it continues to register impressive rate
increases, strong retention, and new business. In Canadian dollars, premiums were up
22%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Crum & Forster increased its premium by 30%, driven by its accident and health division,
and includes the rebound of its travel business that was significantly affected by the
COVID-19 shutdown in 2020. While these four posted the most impressive growth among
our major companies Brit and Zenith also increase premiums this quarter as well. Of note,
Brit launched its innovative follow on syndicate key in the first quarter of 2021 and key had
gross written premium of $77 million in the second quarter which contributed to the overall
18% growth rate at Brit.
Growth was strong in our international operations as well with expansion in South America,
Eastern Europe, and South Africa. Overall, our international companies grew by
approximately $125 million year-over-year. We expect growth to remain strong as overall
price levels continue to rise at a double-digit pace. Our global footprint and exceptional
management teams gives us the ability to generate significant organic growth.
In the second quarter, our combined ratio of 94.3% benefited from a lower level of
catastrophe losses in the quarter but included increased provisions on extraordinary -- the
extraordinary winter freeze event in the U.S. in the first quarter. This added 2.2 combined
ratio points in the quarter. In addition, we absorb COVID losses of $69 million or 1.7 point
in the combined ratio. Principally, in our reinsurance operations at Odyssey Group and
Allied World.
With respect to COVID, our inception to date losses now totaled $787 million of which
approximately half is held in IBNR. Based on knowledge today, we expect these provisions
to adequately cover our exposure. At the same time, the pandemic is ongoing as is much
litigation and therefore some uncertainty remains. In the fourth quarter, we recorded
favorable reserve development of $32 million or 0.8 of a combined ratio point, which
includes unfavorable development of $60 million of the previously mentioned COVID-19
losses that were attributable to the prior year's. Excluding the COVID losses, our reserves
develop favorably again by $92 million. Our reserved position continues to strengthen as
our companies expand with today's well-priced business.
Another important side effect to the growth we are experiencing is the reduction in our
expense ratio component of our combined ratio. Our premiums are growing faster than

Page 4 of 20

FINAL

our underwriting expenses. Once again, this is most apparent at Allied World, where the
expense ratio in the quarter dropped the full 2 points from 2020.
We expect market conditions to remain strong throughout 2021 and well into 2022. Lowinterest rates, social inflation, and reduced industry risk appetite will keep the pressure on.
Our companies are well-positioned to continue growing organically. Our decentralized
system allows our companies to respond quickly to opportunities in the markets. When
conditions are improving, this is an especially critical Fairfax advantage.
I will now pass the call to Jen Allen, our Chief Financial Officer, to comment on our
investment results, our non-insurance company's performance, and overall financial
position.

Thank you, Peter. The results of the second quarter of 2021 were very strong, building on
the momentum we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2020 and in the first quarter 2021.
We delivered earnings attributed to shareholders of Fairfax of just over $1.2 billion in the
second quarter of 2021 and a book value per basic share at June 30, 2021, of $541, which
represented growth in book value per share of 15.2%, adjusted to include the $10
common share dividend paid in the first quarter 2021.
Turning to some highlights on our second quarter results. Peter provided detailed
commentary on our insurance and reinsurance operations, so I'll start with the results of
our non-insurance company's. In the second quarter of 2021, our non-insurance
consolidated companies reporting operating losses of $44 million compared to operating
losses of $80 million in the second quarter of 2020. The second quarter of 2021 included
Fairfax India's performance fee accrual of $43 million compared to nil in the second
quarter of 2020. In the first six months of 2021, Fairfax India recorded a performance fee
accrual of approximately $100 million. With pre-tax earnings attributive Fairfax
shareholders benefiting by about $71 million, as Fairfax India's non-controlling interest was
allocated 72% of Fairfax India's expense.
Excluding the (technical difficulty) our operating losses from our non-insurance
consolidated companies decreased to a nominal loss of $1 million in the second quarter of
2020, that compares to $80 million in the second quarter of 2020, with a significant
improvement noted in the restaurant and retail segment. The second quarter of 2021, we
saw stronger results from our restaurant and retail segment, reporting operating income
of $16 million compared to an operating loss of $43 million in the second quarter of 2020.
As restrictions eased across Canada, we saw increased foot traffic at the bricks-andmortar locations. This, when added to robust, e-commerce platforms, drove significant,
double-digit revenue growth in certain companies. These factors combined with expense
management programs that were already in place, delivered healthy gross margins
increases across our key operating companies, with recognition for golf count for
achieving outstanding results in the second quarter of 2021.

In the second quarter of 2021, Thomas Cook India continue to be negatively impacted by
the reduced travel restrictions as a result of COVID-19. During the second quarter of 2021,
India's economy impacted by a second wave of COVID-19 pandemic. But it appears that
the economic damage was less than experience during 2020 with two primary reasons
for this. First India now has a vaccine program in place; and second, there was no
nationwide lockdown that has imposed during the second wave as was done in 2020.
With the vaccinations penetration in India expected to continue to improve and the
declining case numbers from the second wave, Thomas Cook has seen increased
positive travel sentiments. To this end, we saw positive increases in revenue in Thomas
Cook in the quarter as compared to last year. However, each follow-on wave of COVID-19
may continue to have an impact on revenues, but with global vaccine rule-outs, we're
beginning to see international travel increase and expect this trend to continue.

Bloomberg Transcript

At June 30, 2021, we've seen significant improvements in the pre-tax excess of fair value
over the adjusted carrying value of our non-insurance associates and certain consolidated
non-insurance subsidiaries of the company considers to be portfolio investments. I'll walk
you quickly through a few highlights. At June 30, 2021, the pre-tax excess was $754 million
compared to a deficiency or our adjusted carrying value was higher than the fair value at
December 31, 2020, by $663 million. That's an improvement in the first half of 2021 of
over $1.4 billion that is not reflected in our book value per share, but the regularly
reviewed by management as an indicator of investment performance.
With the restaurant and other segments and Thomas Cook India contributing a $169
million and $65 million respectively. Refer you to Page 72 and 73 in our second quarter
interim report for further details on the underlying positions, that are driving at $1.4 billion
improvement.
As we mentioned before, we are focused on organic growth supported by smaller
friendly acquisitions with a commitment to growing long-term shareholder value. Given
our focus on the long term and the near-term concerns on inflation, we continue to hold
significant portion of our investment portfolio and cash, short term investments, and other
short-dated fixed income securities that represented approximately $18.1 billion or 39.5%
of the insurance and reinsurance companies investment portfolio. While we've been
extremely at low-interest rate and inflation rate environment for some time, thinking -return quickly, and significantly, and we want to make sure we're insulated from large
swings that may happen. This position dampens our interest income in the short term but
protects us from rising rates and inflation. A trade-off willing to take to align with the focus
on providing long-term benefit to our stakeholders and expect to drive long-term growth
in our book value per share.
Our interest and dividend income of a $161 million in the second quarter of 2021 was down
from the $205 million in the second quarter 2020, reflecting the lower interest income
earned principally due to the general decrease in sovereign bond yields. Sales of
maturities of our U.S. Treasury bonds through 2020 and net sales of our U.S. corporate
bonds in the first half of 2021.
We added net purchases at first mortgage loans of $408 million in the first six months of
2021 that is secured by high-quality real estate in the U.S., Ireland, and the UK, and of

terms less than five years. These investments will provide some benefit to our interest
income in the later half of 2021.
Our consolidated share of profit of associates of $75 million in the second quarter 2021,
reflected strong results from our investments in associates and principally we're
comprised to share profit of $27 million from Eurolife, $26 million from Resolute, $23
million from Eurobank, $18 million from outlets core, and it was partially offset by $11 million
from Bangalore Airport, primarily related to the continued COVID-19 related travel
restrictions.
We had very favorable quarter with respect to our investment portfolio. Our net gains on
investments of just under $1.3 billion and over $2.1 billion in the first six months of 2021. The
net gains on investments in the second quarter were primarily comprised of the following;
with the largest component coming from our net gains of $884 million on our long equity
exposures, which included unrealized gains on our blackberry common stock and
convertible debenture positions, Stelco and BDT capital.

We continue to hold our long equity total return swaps of approximately 2 million Fairfax
subordinate voting shares, that that had an original notional amount of approximately
$733 million or just under $373 a share. As we look at potential investments that are
available to Fairfax and fit within our long-term focus, Fairfax was among the best,
especially when you consider where our share price is trading. We feel, it's a very strong
investment and the total return swaps structure allows us to preserve cash and liquidity in
a very effective way.
Secondly, $443 million of net gains on our preferred stock with $425 million of that related
to our investment in the Digit compulsory preferred shares, which help provide details on
shortly. Third, 94 million net gain on a deconsolidation of a non-insurance subsidiary, that
related to Fairfax India sale of its 48.8% equity interest in Privi for a $465 million for a gain
of $95 million. And lastly, $43 million on our net gains on bonds, principally related to our
corporate bond portfolio.
A few additional comments on the $425 million unrealized gain recorded on our
investment in the Digit compulsory convertible preferred shares. During June 2021, the
company's 49% equity accounted associate Go Digit Infoworks Services or we refer to it
as Digit, entered into agreements with certain third-party investors were underlying
general insurance subsidiary Digit insurance will raise approximately $200 million of new
equity shares, valuing Digit's insurance of approximately $3.5 billion.
At June 30, 2021, Fairfax estimated the fair value of Digit using a probability-weighted
valuation model where we ascribed 60% waiting to the fair value determined through an
internal discounted cash flow analysis and a 40% weighting ascribe to the risk-adjusted
transaction fair value. Implying a fair value for investment in the Digit compulsory
convertible preferred shares of approximately $900 million, that resulted in a net
unrealized gain of $425 million, representing on an after-tax basis, a book value per share
of $14.60.

FINAL

Upon closing of the Digit insurance equity issuance anticipated in the third quarter of 2021,
and upon final approval by the Indian government of its previous announced intention to
increase the foreign ownership limits from 49% to 74% as well as the company obtaining
regulatory approval specific to our holdings and digits, we anticipate recording an
additional gain of approximately $1.4 billion, that represents an increase in book value per
share of approximately $46.
As we continue to advance our plans to monetize certain investments and strengthen our
global insurance footprint, we have a number of key transactions that I would like to
highlight that were completed in the quarter or subsequent to. Starting with our insurance
company transactions. On July 14, 2021, we increased our interest in Eurolife to 80% from
the 50% by acquiring a joint venture interest of OMERS for cash consideration of
approximately $143 million. I want to remind you of the disclosure and our 2021 annual
report where we provided you with Eurolife's gross premiums written of $512 million and
investment portfolio of $3.7 billion. These are significant operations that will be
consolidated into our results, commencing in the third quarter of 2021.

Bloomberg Transcript

On June 17, 2021, we increased our ownership in Singapore Re from 28.2% equity interest
to 94% for $403 million to completion of a public cash offer and we commence
consolidating the underlying assets, liabilities, and results of Singapore Re in the Fairfax
Asia reporting segments. And finally, as I mentioned previously, we also anticipate
consolidating Digit in the third quarter of 2021 following the receipt of the required
approvals.
Over the last few years, Fairfax has been quite active with the strategic monetization of
investments. In the second quarter of 2021, we had three transactions to note. The first
was the investment and Mosaic Capital will be entered into a privatization arrangement
with a third party purchaser, which will exchange our current holdings of our debentures
and warrants and cash of approximately $11 million for newly issued Mosaic 25-year
debentures will also acquire a 20% interest in the purchaser for approximately $4 million.
And upon closing, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2021, we anticipate
consolidate Mosaic Capital and commence applying the equity method of accounting
toward interest position of the purchaser.
The second transaction on June 11, 2021, which was with Recipe. They entered into an
agreement to sell substantially all of the assets and liabilities comprising it's Milestones
Restaurant brand. Transaction will enable Recipe to focus on the larger brands that
generate significant free cash flow and dominate their segment with younger brands that
offer attractive opportunities for accelerated new restaurant growth. The assets and
liabilities for both Mosaic and Milestones were recorded as assets held for sale at June
30, 2021. And lastly, as already noted in the net gains commentary, Fairfax India sold its
equity interest in Privi. Various initiatives are underway as we continue to look for
opportunities to monetize our investments.
Turning to our liquidity position. We remain strong with our cash and investments at the
holding company with being just under $1.5 billion at June 30, 2021. The cash provides us
with distinctive advantage that supports the decentralized structure and enables us to
deploy our capital to the insurance companies efficiently. We're not making any long-term
Page 8 of 20

Date: 2021-07-30

FINAL

investments with this cash other than to support our insurance and reinsurance
operations. We continue to be prudent in terms of our deployment of capital strategy.
And to note, on June 29, 2021, we amended and restated our $2 billion unsecured
revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders, which extended our term from
December 2022 to June 2026. Our total debt to total cap ratio excluding our
consolidated non-insurance companies decreased to 28.4% at June 30, 2021, from 29.7%
at December 31, 2020. Primarily reflecting a significant increase in our shareholders equity.
And we anticipate at the close of the RiverStone Barbados transaction that we would have
paid off the facility completely and our total debt to total cap ratio would have been at
27% over the closed prior to June 30.
In summary, it's been a very positive first half of 2021 with the dynamics of the market
remaining strong. Our plan is to remain focused on organic growth. Looking forward to
strong insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries focused on the underwriting possibility and
the prudent reserving combined with our conservative investment managed philosophy
positions Fairfax to continue to deliver excellent long-term results.

Before closing, I just wanted to touch on our commitment to ESG, which has been
meaningful from Fairfax since we began. As you seen earlier this year, we published our
first ESG or environmental social governance report that highlights the importance and
achievements we've made to date. We think about ESG is being truly committed to doing
good by doing well. Recognizing that there's always room to grow and improve, we will
continue to enhance our initiatives through 2021 and beyond.
Thank you for your attention, and I'll turn it back over to Prem.

Hey, good morning.

FINAL

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

Hard markets continue to be very beneficial for Fairfax. I know you're making the most of
it. So, just wanted to touch on that this morning. The first one was with Brit, there's been a
period of time here where they've been reorienting the business and we're starting to
see some very good results there and the benefit from there in their key insurance
platform. I noticed in your release there that you intend to sell 14% of Brit to OMERS in a
transaction. Just wondering what's the decision to do that as a -- to help bring in some
additional capital to continue the growth or why would that decision be made?

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yeah. So, Jeff, the reason for that is just would be announced sometime back, and we're
going to conclude that with the RiverStone UK sale and basically, it gives us a lot of
flexibility. We just thought we should have the flexibility. We have a very good relationship
with OMERS and we can buy that back soon.
So, Peter, you want to add to that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter S. Clarke

{BIO 15243793 <GO>}

Yeah, no I think it just -- it all relates, Jeff, to the RiverStone UK transaction, OMERS had an
investment in there and now they're moving some of that --those proceeds over to Brit.
And like Prem said, continue our long-term relationship with OMERS which has worked out
extremely well.

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then just one more with respect to Crum & Forster.
Crum really saw a very significant step up in the reported premium growth in the quarter.
It had been doing well, but this quarter was up 30%, I believe, year-over-year in terms of
net premiums. So, what sort of triggered that acceleration at Crum? Is it just pushing on
some new lines and taking advantage of hard markets there or any color you could offer
on that might be helpful.

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Peter?

A - Peter S. Clarke

{BIO 15243793 <GO>}

Sure. Yeah. I think the biggest thing at Crum & Forster was their -- they started writing
premium again in their travel book '20, in the second quarter of 2020, essentially their
travel premium went to zero and so now they're starting to write that business again and
it's starting to grow. So, that was probably, Jeff, the biggest factor in the sort of the
significant growth and -- at Crum & Forster.

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Hey, Good morning, Tom.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah. With respect to Digit, is it still the intention that you expect $1.4 billion unrealized
gain in the third quarter? And then another potential $400 million when the final approval
to increase foreign ownership comes in? Is that still the thinking?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Tom, no, it's like $400 million per $25 million, that's what Jen talked about in the second
quarter. The $1.4 billion will come after the regulatory approval and the approval by the
government. It's more like the administrative rulings to go to 74%. It's already passed by
legislation, but those two things have to be done, and either it gets done in the third
quarter or the fourth quarter whenever it gets done. But the addition will be $1.4 billion.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. So, the total addition will be $1.4 billion --

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yeah. So, the other way to look at it is the -- we got $1.8 billion and in a total of which $400
million. We -- it's mark-to-market accounting rules, we don't like reporting it till it's actually
happened, but accounting rules are very specific. You have to show the -- because that's
$200 million that came in, you have to show the increase in value of Digit. And so, that's
what we did.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. So, it was $1.8 billion sort of in total and you booked $425 million of that now so,
there's another $1.4 billion to come? Is that the way to think of that?

That's the way to look at it. Yes.

FINAL

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay, that's great. And just with respect to the two other transactions up to close soon
RiverStone and Brit, it look like you booked some gain from the RiverStone transaction in
the second quarter, would we anticipate any sort of gain when that closes in August of
2021? And then what about Brit as well as their potential gain when that 14% sale
transaction is completed? Thanks.

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yeah. The SOB of RiverStone transaction will close, but there's a portfolio of
approximately $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion -- $1.3 billion that we will be buying back in the next
two years at the end of next year, so the year and a half, Tom and that's for our account
and the fluctuations in that portfolio accrued to us. At the end of the first quarter, it was a
small deficit at the end of the second quarter there was a positive number. So, you'll see
that going up and down over the quarter, still we actually take -- we can take it anytime up
to the end of December 2022.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

And now in Brit, is there a gain there?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

In Brit, no. Brit, there's no changes that -- it's fixed and we don't get any gain, we don't
get any loss.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

FINAL

Good. First question is on the reserve development in the quarter and I guess for the first
half of the year, kind of coming in the 1%-ish range. I'm seeing some -- a little bit more
favorable reserve development from other insurance companies. I'm just wondering if you
can give us a little bit more detail as to what you're seeing on that front? If there -- if you
can have any comments and maybe around Odyssey where we saw some unfavorable
reserve development?

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Well, Jaeme, we've got data here with our Chief Operating Officer and he used to be our
Chief Actuary, so Peter, (inaudible)

A - Peter S. Clarke

{BIO 15243793 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. Yeah. I guess Jaeme, I think what's storing the numbers a little bit is we had
approximately $60 million in development on COVID losses. So, that's sort of a one-off
thing in our minds. And excluding the COVID losses, I think we had favorable
development of around $90 million, which isn't that far off from the previous year. But
generally speaking, it's the second half of the year, where we do more thorough reserve
reviews, specifically of third quarter reserves and that's when we'll make more significant
adjustments. Our reserves continue to be extremely strong, and I think our companies are
very conservative on the loss picks they're making on the current years. So, we would
expect that we'd be building up some redundancy as we go through this strong pricing
environment.

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Our basic view, Jaeme, that we've said for many, many years now is that the cash
reserves could develop favorably or unfavorably, and we just want it to be developing
favorably. So, it's a risk in the property-casualty business and we've had favorable
development, I think, for more than a decade now and perhaps even longer than that, but
that's a very important requisite in the property-casualty business.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

I understood. On the -- on those COVID loss development, can you describe what it was
that was driving that? Is that anything related to BI or a little bit more color on those
COVID reserve (inaudible).

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Sure thing. Peter?

A - Peter S. Clarke

{BIO 15243793 <GO>}

Yeah, really it relates to -- on our reinsurance business primarily at Allied and Odyssey,
and it's non-U.S., so it's in Europe, where there's still uncertainty around what's covered,
what's not covered, is it one event, many events. So, it's really just IBNR that's still being
put up on the reinsurance books mostly in Europe.

Related to BI. And some of the BI issues, you might remember there is, the UK ruling
came out late last year and that's still filtering through the system.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Okay. Good understood. And my second question would be on the share buybacks, stock
trading is fairly low, the cash position is building, and I saw some buybacks for after
treasury. Just can you update your comments and views and thoughts on share buybacks
and as it relates to, I guess, the swap that's still in place?

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yeah. So, yeah, the swamp as Jen mentioned, we're very -- we think the shares are -- we
agree with you that shares are undervalued. And in terms of buybacks, we always balance
that as being financially sound, we've got a hot market, we're expanding, so we have to
be cognizant of that. So, we take all that into account, Jaeme, and then react accordingly.

Good morning. Congratulations on the great job you've been doing. Prem, much like a

share anything on that front in terms of what the future holds when you maybe retire or
aren't available to run the show at Fairfax? Thank you.

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

That's a very good question, Jack. It's a very important question. And it's a question that
we focus on, of course, all the time. My directors focus on that. I focus on it because we
have tried to build our company over the long term. And so, we -- if something happens
to me today, the directors know exactly what to do. 62, the controlling company knows
exactly what to do. And so, of course, very much focused on what you say.
A lot of companies have succession plans right through the organization and you might
have seen over the years, its -- internal succession always be internal succession, it will be
in terms of succession for each of our companies and it will be internal succession for me.
So, we've always revealed it and feel very comfortable that we've got the right people to
take over. But good question, Jack. Thank you.

FINAL

Q - Mikel Abasolo

{BIO 3756596 <GO>}

Very much for taking my questions. I have two if I may, but the first one is on the valuation
of Digit. If I understood correctly, your value as a combination of this year and based on
the transaction the company is doing with the private equity firms. My -- if I understand
correctly, the revaluation of Digit despite not being totally dependent on the private
equity people has been performed following the investment by the private equity people.
So, my question would be if that transaction finally doesn't come to fruition and
regardless of any penalties from the investors or anything like that, would you revert back
to the old valuation you had Digit? That's my first one.
And the second one, if I may, has to do with the reconciliation on Page 73 of the -- of the
report. Because I've looked at it and I see that for the non-insurance associates that are
not listed, the reconciliation is not necessary because the dollar figures coincide, but
that's not the case with the restaurants and other Fairfax (inaudible) India. And if you could
help me bridge that gap or understand why the figures are different, how to go from one
to the other roughly that would be of incredible help. Thank you very much.

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, thank you for the -- both questions. First one on Digit, there's a when $200 million
comes out at $3.5 billion market capitalization, very good investors, but a very significant
market cap on a company that's growing significantly, but is running at the last number we
gave you all was about $450 million of revenue going at a huge rate in India, India is itself
growing, but the market cap is very significant.
So, the $3.5 billion results in a $1.8 billion gain. And the question is, how much do you
recognize at the second quarter and how much do you recognize in the third whenever
those two things happen that I talked to you about. And so Jen explained that using
models, we figured it was $400 odd million, $425 million. But that's just the judgment call.
The $1.8 billion will be the number at the end of the day, but that's subject to -- very
subjective because it's only $200 million that's gone in on a $3.5 billion market cap.
We think Digit is going to grow very significantly. We got a great guy Kamesh Goyal, who's
building the company, but there's no risk of that number being turned back, if for that -- if
we don't get regulatory approval or whatever. Because these are done deals, that $200
million has been signed, sealed, and delivered. So, there's no risk that they can back out.
It's only regulatory approval now, and the 74% going through. On your second question,
why don't I pass it to Jen?

A - Jennif er J. S. Allen

{BIO 20542595 <GO>}

Yeah, and I think, if you wanted additional details, you're more than welcome to call after,
but high level, I think, the easiest answer to explain it would be your biggest driver is for
Fairfax India's portfolio on Note 6, where we show the total carrying value versus fair
value. You have Bangalore airport in there, which is the way the accounting standard works
is that Fairfax India's carrying value and Fairfax only has a 28% equity interest in Fairfax
India. So, when you actually look to the back of Page 73, we're then taking only our 28%
interest. So, that would be your largest disconnect on how we look at it because Note 6 is

Page 16 of 20



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td

almost like a gross-up basis and then in the back is what our attributable book value per
share would be accretive for Fairfax India. But if you want more details, I can walk you
through it offline.

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

And Jen, we talked about that in our annual report and we explained all of that. Peter?

A - Peter S. Clarke

Q - Alan Parsow

{BIO 1446024 <GO>}

Hi. I think I heard this Friday on a (inaudible) on a mobile, but I think I heard that you talked - when you talked about the unrealized in the equity portfolio, you mentioned in the
second quarter that there were significant gains in Blackberry and unrealized in both the
debentures and the common.

Yes.

Q - Alan Parsow

{BIO 1446024 <GO>}

Does that infer, which I think it does, but I don't know. Does that infer that none of the
Blackberry was sold in the second quarter?

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yeah, that's exactly right, Alan. None of the Blackberry was sold because it's all unrealized.
Yeah.

Q - Alan Parsow

{BIO 1446024 <GO>}

Okay. So, up to this point, the company hasn't been able to take advantage of the NIM or
the other significant or outsized gains and well fluctuations, let's just say, in --

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yeah, I think that's right. We haven't been able to take advantage of it. We're insiders,
we've got restrictions and we talked about that last quarter two. And of course, we're
very supportive of John Chen and all the good things that he's doing with BlackBerry.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Alan Parsow

{BIO 1446024 <GO>}

Right. But I thought if I heard you correctly after the first quarter call that any restrictions
disappeared, or is this after the first quarter or is that mean that this company is
permanently on the restriction list of --

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

No, that's a good question, Alan. And no, it's not permanently, but when you're on the
board and we've got the significant interest that we have, there are at times quiet
periods and restrictions that apply to significant shareholders. And -- but it's not, no,
there's -- it's not, you're not permanently restricted, no.

FINAL

Thanks. I was going to follow up on the performance of non-insurance. It looks like it's a
little bit better in Q2 and hoping you can give us some additional color and commentary
on how the non-insurance subs retail restaurants (inaudible) are performing early into Q3
and in particular in Canada, where we're much more open this month than we have been
in the past year?

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yeah. So, Jaeme, the restaurants, you'll see their results, their results haven't come out I
think for recipe, they'll come out and they're doing much better. But of course, Ontario
has just opened for dining -- indoor dining. And for most of the year, they had a very
difficult -- restaurants had a very difficult time in terms of being closed. If you see what's
happened in the United States, once they -- once restaurants were open, they've gone
through 2019 levels.
So, we expect the restaurants will bounce back significantly. Fairfax India had Thomas
Cook, its business went to zero. No travel to speak of, so that was difficult. So, this
pandemic for many of our investments was difficult. But that's all I'm exaggerating to
make the point, but that's all in the past. It's on its way back and these are good
companies, good management and we see over the long term, good returns from them.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Yeah, I was also just going to ask in terms of like I mean the revenue side looks like it's
going to be good. Are you -- what -- do you have any comments on the labor side of it or
expense side of it on this -- as you're reopening, are we going to see that revenue uptick
flow into the bottom line in those?

A - V. Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yeah, Jaeme. All of those things, including the restaurants, we think the revenues would
be through 2019 levels, once we back up. And unfortunately, lots of smaller other
restaurants have gone out of business. And so, if you want to go out dining, just the big
restaurant chains are where the action is going to be. And our recipe expects in the years
to come to do well.
