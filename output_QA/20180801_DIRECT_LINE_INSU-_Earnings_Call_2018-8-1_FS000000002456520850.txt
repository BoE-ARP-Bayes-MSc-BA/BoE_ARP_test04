Operator
Hello and welcome to the Direct Line Half-Year 2018 Results Call. My name is Molly, and
I'll be your coordinator for today's event. Please note for the duration of the call, your
lines will be on listen-only; however, you will have the opportunity to ask questions later in
the call.
I now would like to hand over to your host, Paul Geddes, CEO, to begin today's
conference. The line will now go quiet until we're about to start. Thank you.

(00:00:45) by saying that as you all have seen, this morning, we announced that I will step
down as CEO next summer. As I approach my 10th anniversary, I think it's right to put a
successor in place to lead the company in the exciting years ahead. Announcing it today
well ahead of time will help us achieve an orderly transition. In the meantime, I'm fully
focused on working with my fantastic management team to deliver the initiatives which
I'm going to be outlining later in the presentation. But turning to the pressing matter of
the day, our half-year results, and I'm joined by our CFO, Penny James, and members of
the management team.
And without further ado, let's kick oﬀ with the highlights. 2018 has started well with a
good ﬁnancial performance and good progress on our strategic priorities. After

FINAL

normalizing for the ﬁrst quarter weather losses, our operating proﬁt was up compared to
a very strong comparative in 2017. And even including that weather, we delivered a good
combined ratio. We continue to grow our direct own brands and we're able to continue to
reduce our expense and commission ratios. And Penny and I see further opportunity here.
And this was supported by our strong balance sheet with solvency of 169% after growing
our interim dividend to £0.07.
As we've shown, our model has given us resilience against market pressure on individual
lines. The inherent diversiﬁcation in terms of product, brand, and channel gives us options
in diﬀerent market conditions. And of course, there has been plenty of commentary on
pricing in the Motor market in recent months, which Penny will address.
The observed behavior of the past few years gives me optimism that the market will
continue to remain rational, but we are well prepared for a scenario where it doesn't
(00:02:29). Indeed, the reiteration of our targets today shows our conﬁdence in the
strength of our diversiﬁed business model, our pricing discipline, and the good progress
our talented team are making on the many initiatives we currently have in train. I'm going
to come back later and talk you through those initiatives.
But ﬁrst, I'll hand it over to Penny to run through the ﬁnancial performance of the ﬁrst half.

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Turning ﬁrst to slide 6, I'm going to give you
an overview of the main features of the results with more detail in the preliminary
statements and the appendices for the pack. This is good results, particularly in light of
the weather losses this year and the Ogden release last year.
Now, turning to the speciﬁcs. Operating proﬁt was £57 million lower than a very strong
ﬁrst half 2017. Normalized for weather, operating proﬁt was up slightly. Freezing weather
in the ﬁrst quarter costs us £75 million compared with just £9 million in the ﬁrst half last
year. Last year also beneﬁted from a £49 million release in relation to the Ogden discount
rate, while this year, we made a £10 million gain on the sale of our Bristol oﬃce and had
higher investment gains.
So, when you look past all the one-oﬀs, how's the business actually performing? Well,
prior-year development continues to be favorable compared to our reserving
assumptions, further demonstrating our prudent approach and resulting in a release of
£30 million higher than last year, largely from the Home and Commercial book. In terms
of current year proﬁtability, we continue to make good progress. So, overall, I'm very
happy with how the businesses performed in the ﬁrst half.
On slide 7, we summarized some of our key ﬁnancial priorities, and I'm pleased to say
we've made progress against each of these this half. We've said 12 months ago that we
have three priorities: one, to grow our revenues across the cycle; two, to improve our
eﬃciency; and three, to continue to deliver underwriting and technical excellence.

FINAL

Looking at each of these, on the top left, you can see we grew our own direct own brand
premiums 3.3% with Motor continuing to drive performance. On the top right, you can
see our expense and commission ratios are both down year-on-year. The bottom left chart
shows that the combined ratio was 93% or approximately 91% on normalized weather,
demonstrating our strong technical performance. And the result is a return on tangible
equity of 21.8%, showing we continue to deliver excellent returns for our shareholders.
Turning to premiums on slide 8. On the left here, you can see the group's premiums. And
on the right, the table shows the growth in our direct own brands. Direct own brand
premiums grew 3.3% compared to last year, whilst overall premiums were down 5% due
to the exit from Nationwide as expected.
Motors growth of 1.9% was slower than in recent years with lower prices and less
shopping around. The exit from Nationwide drives the headline Home ﬁgure, although
own brands grew 0.6%. Green Flag, our direct Rescue brand, continued its strong growth
trend, up 13.3%, largely oﬀsetting lower partner volume. And Direct Line for Business
grew premiums 6.5%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to the loss ratio on slide 9. The headline loss ratio increased by 7.3 points to 62.1%.
And the diﬀerence splits into the following three areas. The ﬁrst is weather, which
increased 4.2 points relating to the freeze claims in the ﬁrst quarter. Our view of this loss
(06:17) has remained quite stable from our initial estimate in the ﬁrst quarter, so nothing
new to report here.
Second, the current year attritional loss ratio increased 1.7 points, which is primarily a
consequence of a change in product and channel mix as we exit from the Nationwide
partnership. This is oﬀset by improved commission ratio. So, we'll come to that on the
next slide. At a segmental level, Motor delivered a 3-point improvement in current year
loss ratio as it continued to earn through the strong pricing from 2017.
With higher reinsurance costs and lower price increases in the ﬁrst half of this year,
proﬁtability of the business written this year is more characteristic of 2016 than 2017 and
will start earning through more substantially in the second half. The strong Motor results
was oﬀset by higher ratios across the other divisions, which we'll come to shortly.
Third and ﬁnally, prior-year releases reduced 1.4 points, although releases remain
signiﬁcant at £207 million or 13% of earned premium. As normal, we conducted our large
bodily injury reserve review in the ﬁrst half. This is our biggest risk pool and has
historically resulted in the ﬁrst half prior year releases being higher than those in the
second half.
We still expect the level of prior-year releases to reduce over time, as lower reinsurance
retentions that we've been vying in the past few years reduce the opportunity for reserve
releases or strengthening.
Turning to expense and commission ratio on slide 10, this is an area I've been very
focused on with the ExCo since my arrival. And Paul's is going to talk, give a few more

details on this later.

FINAL

Starting with the expense ratio though in the ﬁrst half shown here in the dark blue, we
were able to absorb inﬂationary cost and achieved higher earned premiums which has
provided us with the leverage to improve the underlying expense ratio 50 basis points to
24.4% in the ﬁrst half of 2018.
The commission ratios, shown in the light blue, was 6.5% in the ﬁrst half, 2.4 points better
than last year. There's two parts to this improvement. About half of the improvement
reﬂects changes to business mix and new partnership arrangements, which oﬀset the loss
ratio movements we've just described on the previous slide. The other half of the
improvement relates primarily to the impact of our partners sharing weather, current-year
and prior-year experience.
Now onto the Motor business on Slide 11, I'll describe some market perspective in more
detail in a moment. But on this ﬁrst slide, the facts (00:09:10) of our portfolio. In the ﬁrst
half, our average premiums were up 0.7%, but you can see from the table on the top left
that pricing in Q2 became more challenging, ampliﬁed year-on-year by the rate rises seen
in the second quarter last year after the Ogden announcement.

Bloomberg Transcript

However, we have achieved our target loss ratios in the half and with claims experienced
returning to our long-term claims inﬂation expectations of 3% to 5%. So, you can see our
more modest premium growth reﬂects our discipline to prioritize our target loss ratio over
volume.
Also, as many of you would've read (00:09:51), the Ministry of Justice has recently
announced it's now targeting implementation of the whiplash reforms for April 2020,
some 12 months later than originally planned. All these lead to a less benign claims
outlook in our view than we've seen over the past year or so. I'll come back to this in a
moment.
Turning to the good proﬁtability actually achieved in the ﬁrst half, Motor proﬁt was ﬂat at
£238 million. The ﬁrst half last year beneﬁted from a onetime release of £49 million
relating to a new Ogden discount rate, which was not repeated this year. And after taking
this into account, prior releases were ﬂat. As mentioned earlier, the current year loss ratio
was strong.
Finally, at the end of December, we renewed our excess of loss reinsurance and 16%
higher costs, reﬂecting the change to the Ogden discount rate, (00:10:44) through this
year and next. We're pleased with the overall outcome and continue to look for ways to
ensure that we're using our reinsurers as optimally as we can.
Now, slide 12 shows what the market has been doing. Here you see the ABI Motor
premium data index at the start of 2014. The Ogden announcement in February last year
triggered a sharp rise in premiums, which you can see in the chart.

Page 4 of 23

FINAL

In September 2017, the government conﬁrmed that they intended to revise the Ogden
process and indicated that the discount rate might rise between 0% and 1%. As a result,
premiums started to come down, and this continued into the second quarter of this year.
So what's really going on through these tariﬀs? Starting on the left of slide 13, this time last
year, we saw signiﬁcant increases in claims costs from the Ogden announcement on top
of normal claims inﬂation expectations. And insurers responded by increasing premiums.
Through the latter part of 2017, claims experience was favorable and claims expectations
were falling as Ogden was revised. Premiums follow suit.
During these two periods, the market responded quite rationally, we think, to current and
anticipated changes to claims cost and showed healthy competitive dynamics. But where
are we today? Well, moving to the right, I think the Ogden position is relatively stable,
albeit the legislative process is yet to complete.

Bloomberg Transcript

Underlying claims inﬂation has returned to long-term trends, and the implementation of
the whiplash reform looks set to wait until April 2020. Based on the evidence to-date,
we're optimistic the market remains rational. And, of course, you know what we will do,
which is prioritize our target loss ratios over volume, focus on cost management whilst
remaining committed to disciplined and targeted investments to improve our costs,
pricing and claims eﬀectiveness across the cycle and strengthen our competitiveness. I
hope this gives a very clear picture of our priority.
Moving to Home on slide 14 where underlying performance has improved with a
combined ratio normalized for weather a little over 2 points better. Starting with pricing
where we were able to achieve price increases in the half both in direct and the PCW
channels, our average premiums remained ﬂat as we particularly grew in PCW business
which has typically lower premium. New business volumes grew year-on-year while
retention levels remained strong.
Turning to operating proﬁt which is £47 million lower at £21 million, weather losses were
£65 million before sharing some with our partners through proﬁt commission
arrangements. Normalizing for weather, our combined ratio improved by about 2 points.
We've been able to absorb the loss of Nationwide and expect to continue to do so as the
loss of the book runs oﬀ over the course of this year. Prior-year releases returned to more
normal levels in the ﬁrst half having dropped last year due to high escape of water claims.
We're pleased with how the team has been able to absorb the exit of Nationwide and
continue to make current operating proﬁt levels when normalized for weather.
Now, I'll talk to other businesses on slide 15. Commercial delivered a good result having
incurred approximately £10 million of weather losses in the ﬁrst half compared to none in
the ﬁrst half of 2017. The Commercial current year loss ratio was up 2.2 points, reﬂecting
slightly higher claims inﬂation in its Motor book but broadly in line with the full-year 2017.
Higher releases on the other hand was strong at £38 million compared with £27 million in
the ﬁrst half of 2017 as we continue to see good development on the property and liability
books.

FINAL

But overall, the market remains competitive, but we've been able to get enough straight
away (00:14:54) across the portfolio to broadly maintain proﬁtability level. Strategically,
we've taken another signiﬁcant step forward with Direct Line for Business, which Paul will
update you on in a moment. Finally, Rescue and other personal lines proﬁt was £8 million
lower.
Within this, Rescue was £2.5 million lower as headwinds on that part of the business and
some weather costs were partially oﬀset by the strong Green Flag performance
underpinned by new strategic plan which is now underway. And we look forward to
telling you more about this in the future. Other personal lines was impacted by weather
and some timing issues on our reserve and recognition which should even out over the
course of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking at the investment return on slide 16, total investment return was ahead of the run
rate for the year, largely as a result of realizing in the ﬁrst half most of the gains we expect
for the year. Net investment income was £7.1 million lower primarily as a result of lower
assets under management. As the construct of our balance sheet stabilizes for our current
reinsurance program, we expect the trend for modestly lower assets under management
to continue for the next couple of years.
As you can see, the continued divergence between U.S. and UK interest rates led hedging
cost to remain high as we convert back to sterling ﬂoating rates. Available-for-sale reserve
of £7.7 million was £72.5 million lower than at the end of last year, reﬂecting credit and
interest rate movements and the realizing of gains in the half. Given the expected gains
proﬁle for the year, we continue to expect to achieve approximately £150 million of total
investment return in 2018.
Turning to slide 17 on capital generation, going from left to right, you can see there hasn't
been too much movement to report. We started the year with a surplus above
requirement of £910 million. Solvency capital requirements remain broadly ﬂat. Rising
interest rates and modest credit spread widening all contributed to a negative impact
from the value of our investments, as you will have seen by the reduction in our AFS
reserve under IFRS.
However, this is partially oﬀset by a reduction in our technical provisions which is included
in our capital generation column. This totaled £310 million of capital generated in the half,
a strong performance. Capital expenditure of approximately £60 million is in line with our
expectations. And ﬁnally, the dividend of £0.07 for the interim is just over £95 million
taking oﬀ surplus at the end of the half just shy of £1 billion.
Now, on slide 18, there's not much news to report on dividends. In line with our policy,
we've increased our interim regular dividend to £0.07. As you know, it's our normal policy
to aim to be around the middle of our risk appetite range of 140% to 180%. And as usual,
the board will consider the appropriate of any additional capital return against this criteria
and in light of the business plans and results at year-end.

Page 6 of 23

FINAL

Finally, our solvency ratio on slide 19. After all this, the group's Solvency II position remains
strong at 169% after paying the regular dividend and comfortably within the risk appetite
range.
Before I hand back to Paul, I'd like to close with the outlook and target from slide 20. I've
now been in the business for nine months, and I can see that we can further strengthen
our business by improving our execution and eﬃciency and have a few speciﬁc topics in
my slide.
I'm conﬁdent that due to the investments we are making and by adopting a more
disciplined and focused approach, we have a real opportunity to materially improve our
eﬃciency. And this is key to achieving our 93% to 95% core target. As our investments in
the business yield beneﬁt, we expect to see a further rebalancing of our proﬁtability from
prior year to current year. Having re-based the regular dividend by 40% in 2017, we now
stick to grow the dividend in line with the growth of the business.
And ﬁnally, on capital, we normally expect to be around the middle of 140% to 180%
Solvency II target range. Of course, we maintain our long-term ambition to achieve at
least a 15% return on equity.
And with that, I will hand over to Paul who will give you an update on what we're actually
doing to achieve it.

Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Thank you, Penny. As I said at the start of the presentation, reiterating our targets today
shows our conﬁdence in our business model, our pricing discipline, and the good
progress we're making on our strategic initiatives.
So, here's the chart I put out last time with our channel strategies and over the next few
minutes, I'm going to update you on our progress here. I'm then going to take you
through the initiatives that we'll continue to improve the eﬃciency of the business and
drive down our expense ratio.
Combined, they will show that we can continue to make our own luck. So, let's kick oﬀ
with our biggest and most advantaged channel, Direct. And we've got a lot going on to
drive this channel. The growth we've achieved across Direct Line, Direct Lines for Business
and Green Flag demonstrates that if you give customers a reason to come to Direct, then
they will. In Direct Line, we had a busy ﬁrst half launching two new unique propositions on
Home and Motor.
And the new Motor proposition was our biggest yet. We've removed one of customer's
greatest frustrations and protected their no claims discount on non-fault claims. These two
new launches takes us to a total of nine propositions customers can't get anywhere else.
We've given them to all our customers new and old, helping deliver our strong retention
levels, and continuing our virtuous circle.

FINAL

Moving to Direct Line of Business, which has continued its proﬁtable growth, this time last
year, we said we launched a new platform to deliver bespoke insurance policies to small
and micro segments. We started, as you'll recall, with the power of hair and beauty, and
last time we spoke, we'd follow this up with bed and breakfast. I'm delighted to say that
we've just released over 500 new trades, taking us to 75% of our target trades on the new
platform.
And we said that once we have that scale, we'd ramp-up our marketing. So, last week, we
launched a national campaign showcasing the ﬂexibility our product gives these small
businesses as they evolve and grow. I'm going to show you that ad in just a moment, too.
The success of the DL4B team is in part due to working in new ways and demonstrate that
we have the capability and agility to quickly launch new innovative products to meet the
ever-changing needs of our customers.
Then we come to Green Flag. We believe our challenger brand has great growth
potential and demonstrated this again by having achieved another period of double-digit
growth in policy count and premiums. Our marketing is focused on showing customers
they can get a better deal by coming to us.

Bloomberg Transcript

We'll play you our latest ads in a moment. They target the two-thirds of AA and RAC
customers who renew without much thought. We aim to wake them up by dramatizing
that we match the best things about their service and we can do that at half of their
premium.
Service matters a lot in this market. Customers won't sacriﬁce it for price. That's why we
give it so much focus. Now, as you'll recall, we've just brought in new leadership and
brought the business together, not only in reporting lines but physically too, to create a
rescue center of excellence to deliver this great service.
And we've just approved the new team's plan to help realize Green Flag's full proﬁt
potential. We're going to be using many of the same agile techniques that proved
successful in delivering fast and aﬀordable change for Direct Line for Business. We look
forward to sharing more of that with you at a later date. Finally, Process
Automation/straight-through processing, I'm going to cover later as it will beneﬁt all of
our channels.
So before we turn to PCW, let's look at those ads. Apologizing for those on the phone,
you can only hear them.
[Video Presentation] (00:23:11-00:24:46)
Good. Three more sales (00:24:51). At the full year, I shared our plans next on PCW to
move towards best-in-class. We actually start from a pretty good position here, and it was
encouraging to see our Churchill brand start the year well, again proving that strong
brands and propositions are also relevant to customers in this channel. But we recognize
Page 8 of 23

FINAL

that great prices are critical in this channel, and that's why we're putting so many eﬀorts
into getting to be the best-in-class in fraud and pricing.
We've delivered some good practical initiatives, and our pricing team continue to make
reﬁnements to our pricing every day. But most of our work has been going on behind the
scenes as we continue to build our latest generation IT capabilities. We're on track with
the bills (25:33), which is going well. And we're going to testing late this year to begin
rollout next. These systems are designed to step change our ability to use internal and
external data in a split second to return a quote, allowing us to improve our loss ratios or
write more business.
Our new pricing engine will make it much easier and quicker to develop, test and deploy
new models, all with greater accuracy. This allows to better tailor our models to the PCW
channel and also helps to step change our capabilities in market pricing. The same
systems will also allow us much more product and underwriting agility, which is
particularly important in the PCW channel.

Bloomberg Transcript

Separately, we continue to make good progress on our alternative pricing project, which
will give us leading-edge capability by applying new data science methods and machine
learning. We believe this approach will complement our existing model and will increase
our competitive quote footprint at similar or better loss ratios to our main model. We are
progressing well with bills, again using agile methodology.
And ﬁnally onto partnerships. And again here, we are leveraging our digital capabilities.
In the ﬁrst half, we continue to grow our RBS home policy count and have a pipeline of
new initiatives to embed home insurance within the bank's core channels even further.
And the digital capabilities we've demonstrated through the RBS partnership is also
giving us a great opportunity to talk to potential new partners.
Moving across to Rescue and Travel, here we're building a new travel system that's
designed to enable customers to self serve and interact with us day or night, oﬀering
greater support when they need it most. Again, this digital-ﬁrst platform gives us a great
opportunity to talk to potential new partners.
And ﬁnally, on Motor where at the full year I told you about our new Motor partnership
with VW Insurance Services, and six months on, I'm pleased to say it's going well. We've
started by oﬀering ﬁve-day driveway cover to customers buying new cars from
Volkswagen's SEAT, Audi, and ŠKODA dealers, and we're pleased with the conversion
rates we're seeing. It's very early days, but we're excited about the future with these
leading Motor brands.
Finally, on to costs, and as Penny said, reducing our expense ratio is a key target, and we
are acting on it with a disciplined and focused approach. As we've shown before, we can
deliver cost improvements in tough markets, and the good news is that we can see a lot
of opportunity. Here, you can see the six key levers we're working on, focusing on our
largest areas of cost. Those on the left, the mature and have already delivered signiﬁcant
beneﬁts. And as we go further to the right, the future opportunity increases.

FINAL

Let's talk about marketing eﬃciency. Since listing, we've reduced marketing spend by
over 40% in ﬁve years, and at the same time returned our own brand to growth. It's not an
accident this happened. It is testament to the science behind our marketing, which means
that the eﬀectiveness of our brand is up there with the best in any sector. This team will
optimize our spend by channel and will play their part in delivering the next wave of
eﬃciency improvements.
Next, moving to more eﬃcient UK sites. Over the past ﬁve years, we virtually halved the
number of sites and reduced our annual rent cost by about 40%. A good example of this
is our Bristol oﬃce where we used to have about 1,200 colleagues and a warren of oﬃces
within a dilapidated building. We now have a new building that's half the price of the old
building.
So, oﬀshoring and automation, we reduced head count 20% to around 950 people and
coupled with hot desk and home working, our run costs in the new building are 55%
lower. We also realized the £10 million proﬁt on the sale of the old oﬃce, which you saw in
the results today. Our bright new Bristol oﬃce, there's a real buzz about the place, and
we're really looking forward to taking some of you there later in the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Next, automation and oﬀshoring, where we've now automated over 35 processes
representing tens of thousands of transactions every month. But we believe there are
more opportunities here. Where we can't robotize, we'll look for opportunities oﬀshore.
We now have over 1,500 people in three locations largely providing back-oﬃce services
but also some head oﬃce functions. Our benchmarking indicator, oﬀshore penetration is
ahead of the market but we still look of it as a source of opportunity.
These are all good examples of how we've already achieved extensive cost reduction in a
targeted way that enhances the business for the future and we do see further opportunity
across these. However, the ﬁnal three initiatives could unlock the greatest potential
opportunity starting with cost culture and agility.
Since becoming an independent company, we've made great progress in getting our
people to care about costs and to remove wastes. Over 10,000 of our staﬀ now own
shares in the company, which is a great motivator and thousands have participated in our
Idea Lab initiative where they share in their cost saving ideas. I recently gave a check for
£50,000 to a frontline colleague for a simple idea that save the business over £1 million a
year.
But there's much more to go after here. We've strengthened our central procurement
team to work closely with the business to get better deals on third-party spend which
makes up that much of our cost base. And as I said, we're increasingly using agile
methodology to deliver change quicker and cheaper. But we still have much to go after as
we roll out this more broadly into the business.
Next is IT run costs where we've recently signed a contract with a leading third party,
which delivers signiﬁcant cost savings from our new hosting and network strategy. Over
the next few years, we plan to wind down and remove our mainframe whilst growing the

FINAL

use of the cloud. This is planned to give us ﬂexibility in the future to deal with changing
business requirements and changes in technology.
Finally, our latest generation of systems is designed to enable much more customer selfservice and straight-through processing, giving our customers easier and quicker service
at a lower cost. The new systems are also expected to make some critical head oﬃce
teams much more eﬃcient. But, overall, I'm pleased with the progress we're making on
these new systems and lots of material progress on all our initiatives and a great focus on
costs.
Before we move to your questions, a quick summary. We've delivered another period of
good ﬁnancial performance and continue to fuel growth across our own brand portfolio.
As you've just heard, we've made excellent progress against our strategic initiatives with
an emphasis on cost and eﬃciency.
And against that backdrop, we're conﬁdent that we're going to continue to deliver against
our ﬁnancial targets. There is a lot to do over the next 12 months, and I'm fully committed
to ensuring that the initiatives we currently have in train will further improve our eﬃciency,
technical capabilities, and customer reach.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. And I will now open it up for questions. Right. Where
should we start? Let's start – yeah, start online.

Q&A
Q - Operator
Okay. Thanks. Just some company updates. First one is on whiplash (00:32:43) reforms.
Do you think that the market anticipates the claim savings from these reforms and prices
in advance? And is there a risk from that that vendor reforms are actually implemented
that government wants more evidence of this discounting passed on? So, is there any risk
of double discounting?
And the second one would be on this proposal from ABI and BIBA about reducing the
diﬀerence in renewal and new business pricing. So, ﬁrstly, what is the percentage point
diﬀerence between your renewal and new pricing? And can you give us a bit more color
on how do you expect it to feed through your book?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Sure. So, I think whiplash and Ogden are quite diﬀerent in terms of prospects and timings,
and I think Ogden is well expected to go through claims settling at zero to 1% level.
Obviously, the impact this year is minor because it's basically baked into our reinsurance
process. You saw it coming at 16%. I think the future whiplash reforms, we have pledged
that it will be passed on to consumer and we just need to make sure we do that in a
transparent and fair way, and you start point at the right stage and you measure it in the
right way and we, as you would expect, given our industry position are closely involved in
those talks.

FINAL

I think the initiative the ABI took to be proactive on this issue of the discrepancy, new
business discounting, I think is a positive step. I think it'd be more warmly welcomed. We,
for a number of years, have been paying attention to this topic and work within a
framework that we're happy with and we think it's really good that it needs an industrywide approach to make sure it's a level-playing ﬁeld as the industry moves forward on it.

Thanks.

Yeah.

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Edward Morris, JPMorgan. Two questions, please. First is on the commission ratio. You
had quite a big beneﬁt this year both on the Nationwide transaction and also perhaps
from lower weather claims. I wonder if you could just isolate the impact of weather on the
commission ratio, give us an indication of what you think a normal commission ratio is
going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

And the second question is on reserve releases. You've been guiding to these coming
down over time for quite some time. How far are we in this process? Can you give us an
idea of what we ultimately are trending towards in terms of reserve releases, so in three or
four years' time, what do you see as a normal run rate?

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Commission ratios ﬁrst. I think come down by, on Home, 7 points or 8 points over the
course of the year. And I think it's about half and half kind of price commission factors so
including weather, not only weather but including weather, and half sort of the MBS side.
The weather side, you're right, should all things being equal, reverse oﬀ a little bit,
equally, the MBS stuﬀ is just probably over halfway through. So, I think with there or
thereabout, make it a little further but not materially so.
And reserve releases coming down, and we haven't speciﬁed exactly when we've been
ﬂat, if you like, but the underlying performance keeps being better than our assumptions,
which is a good thing and a strong thing. So, we're pretty comfortable that'll still
strengthen those reserves in that some time to come. I guess the point I'd make is the
93% to 95% call reﬂects us being able to make that switch between prior year and current
year, and the initiatives that you here and that Paul talked about all drive towards
achieving that. So, that's the way we think about it.

Hello. It's Andrew Crean, Autonomous. Couple of questions. Firstly, I mean, you're clearly
putting your foot down on costs more than perhaps in the recent past. Are you prepared
to give any targets around – or improved targets around cost? And secondly, escape of
water, could you give us numbers what the impact in ﬁrst half 2018 versus 2017? And a
general sort of update as to whether this is an issue which is being solved?

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Okay. Cost ﬁrst, putting our foot down. Let's go to working harder as an ExCo. So, it's
deﬁnitely in our focus putting this turnaround there. And the business has made a lot of
progress to-date, but I think that further, it can – more it can do. And in this kind of
environment and this kind of inventory, we really need to keep doing that.
We are not at the moment putting numbers on that view. Again, it's within the 93% to 95%
trajectory. You've got the expense ratio passed, so a downward trend on the expense
ratio that's all feeding into that. So, at this stage, I don't want to put further numbers on it.
Escape of water. I think the key is we're back on long-term 3% to 5% trends in Home. So,
the actions that have been taken, both in claims and in underwriting, have kind of
addressed the increased inﬂationary trend and it's now operating back on long-term
track. So, back in shape.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Thank you. It's James Shuck from Citi. I had three questions from my side. Firstly is just on
the Solvency II development. So, as we roll forward to year-end and you think about how
you've modeled and captured some of the risk in there, obviously, you've got the Ogden,
which is reserved at minus 0.75%, it's obviously going to be – giving you a raise later in the
year. So, for the full-year solvency, will you actually switch that to 0 to 1%? There's
diﬀerence about how that goes through the IFRS accounts, but I'm interested to know
what the actual solvency impact would be when you recognize that at full year.
And linked to that, we've seen a big decline in the PPO propensity as opposed to taking
the lump sums. What would be the impacts on your Solvency II ratio at year-end on that
basis, please?
Second question, the Motor...

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Oh, that's both one, is it?

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

On the Motor attritional loss ratio, so 320-basis-point improvement in the attritional loss
ratio at H1. You do mention the reinsurance impact on that. I'm just keen to get a feel for
the actual underlying development of that attritional loss ratio, because pricing is up 1.1%,
claims inﬂation return is in normal levels. It seems that attritional is going to get worse
going forward at least on that basis. And ﬁnal question is my favorite topic is the policy
administration systems. Could you shed some light on how the pilot testing has been
going so far? Perhaps give us some data around customer experience and retention
rates? And just outline what phased roll-out would be in 2019 when that does go live,
please?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yes. Well, I'll start with your fourth question or three. So, our policy system and builds are
going well, going to testing later this year, rather next year, taking a phased roll-out.
Probably for commercial sensitivity reasons, we only give our competitors a sense of – in
fact, how we're going to roll it out. But we'll roll it out to bring it onstream in the way that
minimizes risk and maximizes beneﬁt. So, you're going to have to leave that down to us, I
think. But please, where we're at is going well. You can pin Steve down later at the coﬀee
break, look into his eyes. But, no, we're pleased how it's going.

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Well, I said last time, we'd be really surprised and that's not the way the program is
developing. We did what we needed to do. I think some of you and in the light of
experience of other people, the right time to pull and get things right before you launch
systems. But we think we're on the right track. Penny?

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Ogden. So, yes, it was running at 0.75% at the moment. Will it move at the year-end?
Probably depends where the legislation gets to. I think, we'll take a few ones, what stage
we are legislatively and may take a view on where to move in the range and so on at that
point. Will it knock through to Solvency II? There will be an impact. Solvency II kind of
reﬂects the range of possible outcomes a little more. There are other lows in Solvency II
that's linked to that Ogden rate. But you should see some ﬂow through from that.
PPO propensities. We don't automatically shift in line, you're right, at the very low rates.
But we don't automatically think the two. It's such a long-term assumption, but we
wouldn't automatically shift it and the sensitivities that we give around Ogden are pure, if
you like, they don't have a knock-on eﬀect of the PPO propensity and so it should be
positive, but they're as the same degree as IFRS.
Motor. Yes, motor attritionals. So, you're right. You're seeing a strong uptick in the ﬁrst half
from the premium growth from last year kind of earn through. As you roll that forward into
Page 14 of 23

FINAL

the second half, you've got two eﬀects. One is at the growth level (42:03), the premium
starting to come down again as the rates drops oﬀ into this year (42:08). So, you'll get
more of that earning through.
And then the reinsurance cost that's up 16% from 1/1 (00:42:15). And it's risk attaching
basis, so that's going to earn every two years (42:18). So, you're right. The second half, just
mathematically before you get to any claims, particular claims trends in any direction and
so on and so forth, mathematically, the second half should be lower just because of the
earning proﬁle, which is why we steered back in towards the 2016 levels to try and give
people a sense that – even of the level of we'd expect it to write at (00:42:39).

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Right. Yes.

Q - Dominic O'Mahony

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. Dominic O'Mahony from Exane BNP Paribas. So, just the ﬁrst question back on
Motor attritionals expectation. You said in the statement the business you're writing in
2018, you're expecting to be at roughly 2016 level attritional loss ratios. Could you just
conﬁrm whether that's written in 2016 or earned in 2016? And if you wouldn't mind
reminding us what that number might have been, that would also be very helpful.
The second question is just on the trends in PYD (00:43:13) which as you said, you expect
to come down. The way you described the driver, it sounds like a purely motor issue. Can
you just conﬁrm if that is true that there's no particularly structural reason to expect PYD
(00:43:25) in the other lines to decline or whether actually there is a reason behind that?
And then the last one on the investment return, some bumper items in half year, guidance
for the full year are unchanged. I'm just trying to understand whether actually that's an
implied reduction guidance (43:41) for the full year, because when you strip out the
bumper items, it's a lower number or whether actually the bumper items are just a sort of
an acceleration of what you would have expected anyway for the full year? I'm really trying
to think about more 2019, I suppose.

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Okay. Right. Okay. So, no particular order. Trends on PYD (00:44:00), yes, the most
structural point is Motor points rather than a wider book point. Investments, it's an
acceleration. It's really an acceleration of gains point (44:12). The only ongoing trend point
that I've pointed out is one that I've made about – because of our reinsurance proﬁle
again, the assets should see a tweak down on AUM. So, that bit is a longer-term structural
the gains point is facing.
Although I would just point out that given where property is in the cycle and so on and so
forth, the opportunity for unrealized gains and so on and that has to be reducing every
time, I think, from this point. But fundamentally, that's the investment story.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

Dhruv Gahlaut, HSBC. A couple of questions. Firstly, just going back to the question
around the current year, given you expect Motor to deteriorate the current-year attritional.
What are the areas where you'd see an improvement coming through from here on?
And maybe linking to that question, you haven't really said much about NIG this morning
as in, how did NIG do within that 90-ish combined ratio, and what's the trend there? As in,
how do you expect that business to move from here? Lastly, also on the Home business,
would you update – actually, Home and Motor both, the retention rate, how that has done
half year versus last year or last few quarters?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Go ahead (00:45:40), Penny.

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

I'm not sure I've got all of that. But I'll attempt and I'm sure you'll tell me when I get it
wrong. Retention on Home, that's the last thing I wrote, yeah, retention holding up really
just micro movements rather than anything else. So, really positive about that and I think
Home, generally, we've been positive (46:01) that we've maintained growth in (00:46:02)
in what's been a pretty competitive market overall, but retention, good.
NIG continue to make progress, so continue to move in the right direction. Our premiums
were slightly oﬀ but proﬁtability overall, a couple of points up this time, but actually
overall, we're comfortable with the plans and the direction they're going in. So, we see
that as a positive future.
And the last one was – I can't remember, (46:34). I can't remember. It's my writing if I'm
completely honest.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

So, the attritional loss ratio, what could improve it from here given Motor is going the
wrong way?

And I think the way to – we're writing at a core (46:46), normalized weather, is 91%. I think
we've – 2017 rolled into (46:57) this level of sort of super-charged numbers. So, I think
overall, we're comfortable with that underlying run rate. There is a point at which you
would trade the excess into growth at that strength.
So, the way you articulate it implies it's a problem, and I look at it and say that core is
fantastic and I'm very happy with the attritional. So, we'll be very happy if we hold the
Home book proﬁtability at the levels we have with the exit of Nationwide and the
competitive market space. And we're very clear that's what we mean to do. We think the
future growth potentials are in the Green Flag and the DL4Bs and some of the other
investments areas.

(00:47:45) What we have seen historically is, (47:51-48:00)...there'll be growth from above
that. And we're doing a lot of heavy lifting on NIG to improve its pricing eﬃciency. And
we've got more rate away (48:07) than claims inﬂation. I wouldn't always recognize that
that quickly because we're pretty conservative. Initial reserve is on Commercial, so not all
the heavy lifting is evident yet in the results. But we're encouraged by progress right now.

Good. Who's next? Right, yes.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Thomas Seidl from Bernstein. Three questions. Firstly is on claims inﬂation, you said it's
going back to normal levels, that includes small bodily injury (48:43) or is it continuing to
improve (48:47)? Secondly, the strong improvement on small bodily injury (48:51), how
much impact is left on the whiplash reform, right? I mean, we had 8%, 9% I think (49:01).
How much is really left after those strong improvements over the last two, three years?
And thirdly on the Home, how do you describe the pricing environment in Home. You
seem to have achieved good pricing. At the same time, you also reduced the risk mix. So,
what does it tell you, or rather tell us about the price environment in Home, please.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

So, let me have a go at Motor claims inﬂation. So, I think we roll out the sleeves
(00:49:23). So, just at frequency and severity, the frequency story is a really interesting
one which is 2017 was an amazing year for frequency. And we said at the time, we're not
going to trend it and I think we were right not that trend it. It looks like it was just one of
Page 17 of 23



Company Name: Direct Line Insurance Group PLC
Company Ticker: DLG LN Equity
Date: 2018-08-01

FINAL

those one-oﬀs that may have been a bit of weather which is perfect weather last year. 2018
has reverted, and it actually might be in a little bit above trend. We think that's because it
was the cold weather at the start and then hot weather and therefore it causes everyone
to drive lots. And therefore frequency probably will go slightly above trend at the start of
2018. So, that's the frequency story. So, kind of generally ﬂat but a bit down and then
maybe a little bit up.
Severity, we think, is kind of probably the bottom end of the 3% to 5% range. And as you
rightly highlighted, a game of two halves, accidental damage is above trend, probably
above the top of the 3% to 5%, bodily injuries probably negative, I guess. And the bodily
injury – and what's driving that is probably lots of things. It could be everything from car
technology to the previous Jackson reforms to MedCo (00:50:34) now.
So, that's a diﬀerent thing to whiplash. The only symmetry might be is obviously Lloyds is
may be preempting future changes in their business model, but the only kind of – that's
the only kind of thing you might already have a little bit from whiplash, because whiplash
beneﬁts are quite diﬀerent to the things we should – have driven it.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, the only kind of linkage between the two might be Lloyds business model planning.
Between the two, I think I might be saying gas up here as a safe bet. So, I think if you
multiply the two together, you can kind of see we had a better than trend year last year.
This year is probably like to be more – kind of a more on trend year.
Now, if you then say that the pricing versus us in the market is kind of requirements to
observe. So, you take a two-year trend, if you take the ABI data and strip out IPT, within
the market's price, it's kind of 6% to 7% on that two-year period. Maybe half of that, you
can say, is the real Ogden cost. So, it leaves about half of it left for covering claims
inﬂation.
Therefore, what I'm saying is actually against that backdrop given the positive claims
experience in 2017, it's not – it would take a two-year view. That's why we're saying the
market is rational, because probably it's pretty close, we think, depending on how the
market's done it. So, it's surprising that the real claims inﬂation observed in that period
given that's not a great experience in 2017 (52:00) Have we nailed the Motor answer now?
That's good for everybody. Right, shall we move on?

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

I'm sorry. So, there was one on Home. Sorry, Penny. Yeah.

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Home, I think, overall market is ﬂat. Within that, we think a lot of the market is getting rates
away. So, I think we are with – we're ahead also or thereabouts of the claims inﬂation.

FINAL

What we're ﬁnding is there's one or two players. They're probably moving around a little
bit who are pricing lower and bringing that down. So, overall, market is ﬂat. But within
that, there's quite a lot of divergence between the players.
I think we're pleased. We've managed to get rates away in both the main channels, and
we're growing in both of those channels. You're right. There's been some reduction in risk
mix and 00:52:52 and so on. But, overall, we're positive on that direction given that
competitive market.

I'm saying, Greig, that the – probably an average between accidental damage and BI

above 5% probably, and BI probably running negative.

Q - Greig Paterson
And you said something within the BI, you said...

A - Paul Robert Geddes

coming down are things that previously happened and whiplash is a diﬀerent thing. And
my only connection between the two is Lloyds is preempting whiplash reform to change
their business models, might be giving us some beneﬁt today from that. That's what I
mean.

Two other questions. One is if you just talk about the current year-on-year rate you think

what's the story with that? I'm just trying to ﬁgure out.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, (00:55:09) we run fairly regularly. It's a sign of conﬁdence in our pricing and
yet, people do sometimes claim on it. But we got good experience in what that costs us,
and we price it into the cost of the proposition. So, we've been running that since I've
been here, which is a long time. That's really established. Penny – sorry, this was the...

I'm not going to give you an August update. I mean, I think what we're saying is the
market is – well, Q2 and Q1 maybe our point of view is a little bit less deep in terms of
reduction. We're still 1.1% on a kind of risk adjusted, mix adjusted basis. Listen, we're
optimistic about the market. The market has turned left and right to claims trends pretty
well. Competitively, we're optimistic it'll do it again. Obviously, we don't know what's
going to happen in the future.

I'd say no jerk (56:26) but – and I think the other point is to think about how you'd stop
dripping that into your pricing, probably people would have risk adjusted the likelihood
of that anyway because there's narrative about that probably in Q2. And then it would

It's James Shuck form Citi again. Couple of follow-ups. Penny, just interested about your
comment around the Motor normalized combined ratio being, well, ex-weather, I think
you said 91%. Obviously, with the high level of releases in that currently, is that the view of
where the underlying combined ratio is? So, if I was to look through that reserve releases
and then where the attritional work eventually trend to so, i.e., is mostly really running 91%
kind of normalized level?
And then second question is on Commercial. I'm just interested – obviously, you've got
big plans to grow Commercial in the micro segment. You've got smaller areas that you're
focusing on to begin with. But what was the size of that addressable market and what's
your current footprint within that market size?

Yeah. I mean, basically, as we said before, our Direct Line for Business, which is a big
business, 450,000-plus policies. It's largely two businesses, which is a van business which
is like kind of Motor and a landlord business which is really like Home. And actually SME is
a relatively small part of it. We think that's £3 billion addressable market which is us
working trade-by-trade within that 500 and going, okay, this is likely to stay a broker
because the characteristics they've got, that sort of business, it's – their main task is very
professional and they want a broker and here's a business we think largely can go direct.
So, that's putting all those little slices together to get to the £3 billion.

(00:58:29).

No, that's the addressable market in the SME bit. So, we have – in our plans, we've got
ambitious growth from that working out. It's going to take us probably a little bit of –
trying out to get absolutely on the gas because we're requiring some behavioral change
but we're helped in that by other insurers actually going direct. And as we said before,
actually back in the 1980s and early 1990s, what made Direct Line grow was other people
getting with the pricing cycle and more than one person trying to do direct. So, actually,
our competitors are starting to do direct and SME, but we think it will be helpful to
reassure small businesses, that it's an okay way to ﬁnd things (00:59:09).
(00:59:11), do you want to clarify on (00:59:12)?

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Yeah, yeah. (00:59:14) Motor is, by way, the biggest book. I'd point back to the 93% to
95%, I think. 91% permanently would be kind of pretty rich, and we'd be well under I think
that 93% to 95% target range if we're running at that level permanently. So, that's the
place to look.

Jon Denham, Morgan Stanley. Penny, would you just, I would say, quantify the net impact
from Nationwide, the deterioration loss ratio and improving commission ratio?

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

It's not huge overall. It's more of a rotation between lines. So, I don't want to give an exact
number for commercial reasons, but it's not a huge impact on the operating proﬁt. Hence,
the fact with bit of work, we can absorb that and give some proﬁtability then.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Good. Last calls were within an hour, which is excellent. Any more on the phone?
Excellent. No one's asked a question about me, which is excellent. So, I think that was an
intuitive (01:00:20) conﬁdence.
