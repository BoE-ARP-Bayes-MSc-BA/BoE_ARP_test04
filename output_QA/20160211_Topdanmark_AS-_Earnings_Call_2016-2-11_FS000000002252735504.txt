{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody, and good morning to the USA, and thank you for joining us
in this conference call.
With me are, as usual, our CFO, Lars Thykier; and Steﬀen Heegaard, who is Head of
Investor Relations and Group Communications.
We are holding this conference because earlier today we published our results for 2015.
And we are now ready to answer your questions. Please ask them one at a time.
And operator, can we have the ﬁrst question, please?

Of course. We do have a few questions. And your ﬁrst question comes from the line of InYong Hwang. Please ask your question.

FINAL

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon. I've got two questions. Firstly on the buyback you announced of DKK
1.25 billion, on the slide 12, with the buyback potential, and you can assure the potential of
2016 as DKK 1.8 million and I think in previous year, you announced buyback was quite
close to the capacity that you showed. So I was wondering why this year it has – seem to
be quite a big buﬀer there and just your thinking around that.
And secondly on the premium guidance, I think at this time unlike the last communication
you declined to give a speciﬁc number. So just in terms of the way to interpret this, is that
– mean that the situation looks worse than they did last year and we should expect
something bigger than minus 1% that you guided to last time, just a bit of clariﬁcation
there, please? Thank you.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Concerning the share buybacks, we stated in Q1, 2015 that we would buy back DKK 400
million more than the result in 2016 and that is what we are going to do; there are no
other decisions.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Regarding the growth we have – we have been struggling with sort of targeting the right
level for growth, because growth in a very competitive environment as the one we're in is
extremely diﬃcult and surrounded by uncertainty basically because the growth does not
depend on only what we do ourselves, but also what the market does. We have for
several quarters been surprised and have to downgrade the growth somewhat, so instead
of being a very accurate on growth as we have been in for many years, we would like to
just say that growth is very diﬃcult. Our growth – our proﬁtability target is unchanged, but
top line growth is probably bound to be somewhat negative. We have not stated any
numbers, but since the competition is more or less unchanged, well, probably top-line
growth will be more or less unchanged as well from last year.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Okay. All right, that's great. Thank you.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Per Grønborg. Please ask your question.

Q - Per Grønborg
Yes. Thank you. It's Per from Danske; couple of questions from my side. First a bit in the
nitty gritties, the unwinding of your discounted reserves, the level of DKK 30 million in the
last two quarters. Of course, I wonder bit right doesn't come further down, like we saw in
the ﬁrst half. What has been your assumption for 2016 that the cost of unwinding the

discounted reserves will be, can you give any number on that? Secondly on the buyback,
the DKK 1.4 million – sorry, DKK 1.4 billion that you had said – the DKK 1.25 billion you
intend to buyback. Is that the buyback from now and until the full year report next year
and should we add on top of that what you have bought back year-to-date in the old
program?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Let me take the last question, Per. The buyback relates to the proﬁt in 2016 and will be
bought back from today and up until 23 of February next year. So there is this slight time
lag in the buyback period.

Q - Per Grønborg
But then we should also add our top what you have executed this year from last year's
buyback?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Well, that was part of the DKK 1.95 billion that was executed up until 10 of February.

Q - Per Grønborg
Yes. Okay. Perfect. I just want to be sure that I understood it correctly.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Unwinding?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Yes. I'm afraid, we're going to have to postpone the unwinding question to some other
time.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay. Let's take it tomorrow morning with this.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Per Grønborg
Thank you.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Christian Hede. Please ask your
question.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Good afternoon. It's Christian from Nordea in Copenhagen. I just have a question for
your share buyback potential. I am sure you've told us all before. But could you go
through again how you see the buﬀer between the surplus capital buyback potential,
which is I think DKK 1.8 billion as you see it and then the buyback of DKK 1.25 billion? And
how should we see this buﬀer going forward? Thank you.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

We have not stated that this buﬀer should be of any speciﬁc size. As I said that this buﬀer
will be larger and smaller according to what we see in the market. How concerned we are
about the productivity in the market in both ﬁnancial markets and insurance markets. We
guide for the buybacks of the year and this year we have guided that we'll buyback DKK
400 million more than the bottom line.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

But should we then see it as you being very concerned since you now have a DKK 600
million buﬀer to your potential?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

I look at the (6:48) my screen, and I am concerned, yes.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That's only fair, I guess. I guess that was my only question. Thank you.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

So was that all questions?

Operator
Thank you. We do have a few more questions, but our next question comes from the line
of Jakob Brink. Please ask your question.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Yes. Hi, it's Jakob from ABG. Sorry, just coming back to what you said before question on
premium growth. I know you've just said negative, but what did you say? You said the
market competitive situation was pretty much unchanged compared to last year, so did
you say that we should expect a growth rate that was basically unchanged from 2015 or
did you mean that the 1% you guided for in Q3 was unchanged?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Neither, what I said was that with the competitive situation as it is right now, we ended up
with minus 1.8 last year. And since we had diﬃculties in hitting quarter-by-quarter, hitting
the right level of growth with the accuracy that we sought, it doesn't make very much
Page 4 of 8



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2016-02-11

sense to try to be very accurate about top-line growth since we have had to change it.
And therefore, what I'm saying is that if the competitive situation continues to be the same
you should probably expect that our top-line growth in 2016 would be in line with the one
in 2015.

FINAL

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

The problem is that our forecast model – results from forecast model are quite erratic.
They changes from month-to-month in the current environment. So it's very hard to make
the forecast quality we used to do, we have not succeeded in 2015.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

One of the reason why it was diﬃcult in 2015 was that we saw some major clients in the
commercial market leave us, but they left us at levels that would deﬁnitely be loss making.
So I don't know if it is a good thing or a bad thing to increase the negative growth if the
bottom-line is basically proﬁting from it. So, it's diﬃcult and if we foresee during 2016 that
any large client might leave us in that year as well. We would deﬁnitely not violate our
mantra of proﬁtable growth. And therefore, it is extremely diﬃcult to make very exact
guidance to the top line.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

You can maybe give some comments on the private segment as well. Is it only in the
corporate segment that you sort of-

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Competition is all over – is in all segments right now. And competition is also ﬁerce in the
private line segment. We have lost more customers in 2015 that we've been – we've
gained from our competitors. And I think that this is something that you could also – you
probably also have to realize in 2016.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot.

Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Per Grønborg. Please ask your
question.

Q - Per Grønborg
Hello. It's Per on Danske again. I have a couple of additional questions. Can you – you are
guiding on well updated claims to 2016, can you also put a number of what is – what are
you assuming last claims to be in a normal year?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

No. We don't do this.

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

We don't have that guidance.

Q - Per Grønborg

FINAL

You don't have that guidance?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

No.

Q - Per Grønborg
So we take the average of the last ﬁve years and assume that's the best approach.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Please remember that the ﬁgures we show that is gross ﬁgures. That is before reinsurance.
And it makes a lot of diﬀerence whether the – how the distribution of the claim balance.

Q - Per Grønborg

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Regarding competition and premium volumes, it looks like it's primarily the
commercial book that is a challenge in U.S. at the moment portray it (11:57) to us out in the
beginning of the year talking about a fantastic renewal and a material growth also in
Denmark. Is it the weather compensation book that is taking hits from 1st of January, or is
that – that book that takes more gradual hits during the year when it comes to volumes?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Are you asking if the commercial line business is being hit throughout the year or January
1?

Q - Per Grønborg
The issue is – it sounded on (12:30) that they had written a lot of new business with eﬀect
on 1st of January. That business must have been taken from somewhere. Is that what
you're seeing now and the reason why you somehow see to bid more (12:42) than you
were a quarter ago?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Well. Yes, (12:46) deﬁnitely has been extremely aggressive, whether it is related to
Topdanmark, the business that they have written in January 1, I can't tell you that exactly.
But we have (12:57) throughout the year.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay. Thank you.

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

FINAL

Maybe I could add that a lot of our commercial business is renewed on the 1st of January.
And that means that we have this change in – from company to company, it's – the change
is by far the biggest in – on the 1st of January. And that was the case last year and that's
the case this year.

Q - Per Grønborg
Can you tell us what you've seen on the 1st of January renewal?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

No, no, I cannot. We have made the guidance and we are talking about the account from
2015.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Christian Hede. Please ask your
question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Yes, it's Christian from Nordea again. You talked about last that you were quite concerned
on the investment markets, which is understandable. Could you say anything about
whether you've done anything that will mitigate the eﬀects of what we're seeing now? We
heard, for example, yesterday that Sampo are now taking the opportunities to buy
additional Tier 1 capital at what they would seem to think is the distress level. So, can you
give us any guidance on how you're coming through this and I know that this is a question
on 2016, but still-

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

No. I don't think I will do that.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

That's fair. Then I don't have any more questions. Thank you.

Operator
We don't have any further questions at the moment. There are no further questions at this
time. Please continue.
