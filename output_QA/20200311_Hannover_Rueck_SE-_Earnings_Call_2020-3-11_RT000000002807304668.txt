Presentation
Operator
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you to today's Hannover Re
International Analyst Conference on the 2019 Annual Results. For your information, this
conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr.Jean-Jacques
Henchoz, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.

Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Thank you very much, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to welcome you
to our conference call, presenting our results for the financial year 2019. As usual, I'll start
with a short summary before our CFO, Roland Vogel will go over the financials in detail.
And for the Q&A, I'm additionally joined by my Board colleagues, Klaus Miller and Michael
Pickel.
The initial slide of the deck shows you the key metrics for 2019. We're generally satisfied
with the business development. Last year, we had double-digit growth in earnings and
premium, and we're able to achieve a return on equity of 13.3%, well above our minimum

FINAL

target. And it's particularly pleasing to see that the earnings growth kept pace with the
strong growth of our shareholders' equity.
Group net income increased by 21% to EUR1.28 billion, and this record result was based on
favorable underlying profitability and non-recurring items resulting from valuation gains
from two participations, which we mentioned in previous quarters: Viridium in Germany,
EUR100 million impact, and Skandia, a company in Scandinavia, EUR50 million impact,
positive for the result.
Gross premium increased by over 15% adjusted for currency, which was mainly driven by
P&C, where we saw an improving market environment. And P&C premiums were up by
20% from both our traditional and structured reinsurance business.
The combined ratio at 98.2%, was above our target, due to the large loss activities last
year, which exceeded the budget and the development of Typhoon Jebi which we
reported on in the past year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Earnings in life and health were very strong due to favorable underlying profitability and
better-than-expected U.S. mortality performance, plus the Viridium effect which I
mentioned a minute ago. Life and health growth was steady and came mainly from the
Asia-Pacific region.
The investment income was strong with a return on investment of 3.5% or 3.2% excluding
the one-off in life and health, significantly exceeding our initial expectations of 2.8%. And
the solvency ratio was at 252%, which was comfortably above our minimum target.
On Slide 4, you see the dividend development. And based on the strong set of results,
we intend to propose a total dividend of EUR5.5 per share, which will be equivalent to
EUR4 ordinary dividend and EUR1.5 special dividend. This dividend payout reflects the
company's strong performance and our net income growth in 2019. We continue to see
good growth opportunities this year and an improving price momentum, and part of the
earnings will be used to fund future growth.
Moving on to the financial figures for the full year 2019. Let's start with the cash flow. At
EUR2.5 billion, the operating cash flow is again very strong. And I'm pleased to add that
the underlying numbers are even better because we wrote a large pre-financing deal in
life and health reinsurance in the fourth quarter. This led to an operating cash outflow of
around EUR350 million and explains the relatively low number in the Q4 standalone view.
Such pre-financing is of course associated with future profits and respective positive cash
flows in future years if everything goes according to plan.
On the right hand side, you can see that it's not only the significant positive cash flow that
has led to 13% growth in assets under own management, additional factors contributing
to the growth were the lower yields and credit spreads at the end of the year, as well as
positive currency effects and the EUR750 million hybrid bond that we issued in Q4.
Overall, invested assets amounted to EUR47.6 billion at the end of 2019.

FINAL

On Slide 6, most of the effects mentioned are also supporting the strong increase in our
capital base, as presented here, especially the green portion of our policyholders'
surpluse reflects the additional hybrid capital outstanding with the first call date for an
outstanding bond in summer. This might come down in Q3.
Nevertheless, the most important contributor to the 20% increase in shareholders' equity
is the strong result that we achieved in 2019. The contribution from the valuation reserves
in our asset portfolio even went up over the course of the first quarter this year and is
now being impacted by some volatility, driven by the lower interest rates but also higher
credit spreads as a reaction to the coronavirus.
The next slide shows the impressive long-term outperformance of our ROE target, but
also the consistent delivery in each and every year with 2019 being the 11th consecutive
year with a double-digit return on equity. Over the last 10 years, we have more than
doubled our equity base, and at the same time we were able to grow our earnings per
share by 5.8% on average per year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Also in comparison to our peers in the reinsurance space, our return on equity is very
favorable with Hannover Re coming out on top for both the financial year 2019 and the
five-year average. Another point visible on this slide is that Hannover Re is outperforming
the industry in the years with below average large loss activity like 2015 and '16, and even
more markedly in very loss heavy years like 2017 and '18. This confirms the success and
profitability of the business model and our approach to managing the volatility of our
earnings by means of retrocession protection and conservative reserving.
With that, I would give the floor to Roland Vogel for more detail on the financials.

Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, and thank you, Jean-Jacques.
Let's directly move on to the group's figures for the financial year 2019. As usual, I will
come to the details in the segment reporting. But to sum it up. Hannover Rerecorded very
strong premium growth, driven primarily by our P&C reinsurance business, but also well
supported by life and health.
The group net income increased even more significantly by 21%. Admittedly the negative
effect from recaptures in 2018 on the one hand and two positive one-off effects in 2019
on the other played a part in the strong earnings growth. Nevertheless, we have
managed to achieve another record result, which is quite remarkable in particular against
the backdrop of the overall profitability for the industry, especially in light of the large loss
burden, which we will see in a minute.
Maybe worth mentioning on a group level, financing costs have increased compared to
the previous years. We issued the new hybrid bond in Q4 to potentially refinance a bond
with the first call date in September 2020. Still around EUR4 million of the increase is due

Page 3 of 23



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2020-03-11

FINAL

to the first time application of the new IFRS leasing standard, which led to the reporting of
such costs in the financing line.
Moreover, the tax rate came in slightly below expectation, which is to be attributed to the
nearly tax-free gains on the higher Viridium valuations as well as on another sale as JeanJacques already mentioned that of an agency with some EUR50 million and that was also
tax preferred. The latter amount is accounted for in the other income line as it is the result
of a de-consolidation exercise.
On the next slide, property and casualty, reinsurance gross written premium grew by
20%, adjusted for currency effects stronger than initially expected going into 2019. Drivers
here, were the slightly improved overall market environment in the reinsurance sector and
very healthy demand for Hannover Re as a business partner. The growth was well
diversified by region and by line of business. It is worth mentioning that this year, the
contribution from the traditional lines was even higher than the growth in structured
reinsurance, which had been the driver in proceeding periods.

Bloomberg Transcript

The increase in net premium earned was less pronounced mainly due to the change in
unearned premium, which is a normal phenomenon. When the book grows strongly, the
retention remains stable slightly over 90%.
Now large losses, was already mentioned came in EUR81 million above the full year
budget of EUR875 million, and on top of this negative development of Typhoon Jebi from
2019 impacted the underwriting result by another EUR80 million. As such EUR160 million
translate into 1.3 combined ratio points. So one could argue that adjusted for them, we
would have achieved our 97% target. Still, we will have a look at the development of the
reserve redundancies in a second.
The budget overrun of the large losses was supported by the fact that two major events
occurred outside our defined risk peak or peak risk definitions, so that the release from
our retrocession program was less beneficial than in the last two years. Altogether, the
combined ratio came in at 98.2% and with that a little bit above our target.
Initial reserving remained conservative as usual. The runoff of our reserve was again
positive within the expected range but impacted by especially Jebi slightly lower as
compared to last year. When it comes to the current confidence level in our loss reserves,
we have to accept that also we were not totally immune against the developments from
U.S. casualty losses. Conservative past reserving made sure that we did not observe any
negative run of result, but based on initial estimates, reserve redundancies overall went
down by approximately EUR200 plus million. As you know final numbers will be presented
in October, so this is -- these are the first indications.
The negative experience here has already been reflected in our reserve setting for the
2019 year and partially led to higher ultimate loss ratio assumptions for such segments. It
was mainly triggered by trends towards increasing healthcare costs as well as the opioid
crisis and the reopening of all sexual molestation cases. We have reported more than

Page 4 of 23



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2020-03-11

once before that our exposure here should be limited as the majority of our highly
diversified portfolio has a focus on small and medium players in the U.S.

FINAL

Apart from that, the somewhat unexpected decision to set the new opt-in rate in the UK
at minus 25 basis points, also had a negative impact on our reserve redundancies as the
reserves reflecting an opt-in rate below zero had been treated as redundant in the past,
which now up or down to minus 25 basis points had to be corrected.
Net investment in P&C increased slightly driven by the favorable increase in ordinary
investment income. Other income expenses include EUR49 million gain from the disposal
of our participation in the Swedish agency already mentioned. Apart from this, there are
no other material one-offs included in this line. Altogether, the EBIT margin is exactly in line
with our 10% target. The tax ratio was at normal level.
The next slide shows the profitability of our P&C portfolio by line of business, and here
the impact from large losses is quite visible. North America was mainly affected by
Hurricane Dorian. The Latin America reporting line reflects not only the riots in Chile, but
also worldwide agricultural business, because it's part of that business line. Here we have
seen losses from the bush fires in Australia and tornadoes in the U.S.

Bloomberg Transcript

The cat XL segment includes a large part of the losses of the typhoons in Japan, and the
combined ratio for UK and Ireland also exceeds the target affected by rather weak
technical profitability of the Lloyd's business, which we support.
On the other hand, aviation and marine are significantly below target, benefiting from a
favorable loss experience as well as some positive reserve runoffs. Additionally, the
German speaking countries made a good contribution to the technical results.
On the next slide, we have already commented on the large loss situation. Net losses
totaled at EUR956 million, exceeding the budget by EUR81 million. As you can see the
difference between gross and net is smaller compared to the year 2017 and 2018,
because retro was a little bit less effective this time.
In the first place, this is because no individual loss was large enough to figure our whole
account cover. Secondly, it was due to a high frequency of manmade losses, which are
less protected by our retrocession program. The third reason is Hurricane Dorian where a
large part of the loss comes from proportional treaties, which are not covered by our KCession. And the same is true for the credit losses. Here Thomas Cook came in -- came
slightly down, but still led to a burden of around EUR85 million nearly gross for net.
Looking at the detailed list on the next page. The large events were Hurricane Dorian and
Typhoon Hagibis and Faxai on the nat cat side. However, the overall level of nat cat losses
were still within expectations. This means that the reason why the overall large loss
budget was exceeded are the manmade losses, and here a combination of frequency
and sizable individual losses like Thomas Cook or the riots in Chile, and the refinery loss in
the U.S.

FINAL

So let's move on to our life and health reinsurance business. Gross written premium up by
6.7%, adjusted for currency effects, which was within our expectations. The main driver
was new business written in China and Australia. Additionally, we were able to grow our
longevity book.
The results from the U.S. mortality business improved significantly and even slightly more
than anticipated. Here the absence of last year's recapture charges helped as well as
better than expected mortality.
In 2019, it came only to minor recapture charges in the first half year. A few remaining
open cases where the rate increases have not been accepted and the business has not
been recaptured by the client yet are in arbitration. This means that the business will
either be recaptured or the clients will accept the rate increases at a later point in time,
assuming that we arbitrate successfully. We do not foresee any significant impact on our
expected yearly results from such proceedings at least of today.
As already reported with our half year results, we had some negative effects from
disability income in Australia and we added some reserves for our UK business. In both
cases, we did not see any further material negative development in the second half.

Bloomberg Transcript

Investment income increased significantly, supported by the EUR100 million one-off, as
part of the realized gains in the second quarter, while the change in fair value through P&L
was also positive.
Other income and expenses mainly driven by a further increase in the contribution from
the financial solutions business, particularly in the U.S. for which a large portion is
recognized according to the deposit accounting method.
Altogether, the EBIT of EUR570 million is well above our EUR400 million indications even
excluding the EUR100 million one-off. At 16.4%, the tax ratio is below the normal level
driven by the tax privileged valuation gains.
On the next slide, in life and health, the 2019 financial year was very favorable in terms of
not only earnings contribution but also new business production. The value of new
business written in 2019 stands at EUR363 million, well above the target. The main drivers
are financial solutions and longevity. Additionally, our Shanghai branch was very successful
in writing new high-value business.
Coming to the investments, we are very satisfied with the development of our
investments in 2019. The return on investment is appreciably higher than our initial
expectations of 2.8%. And I'm very pleased that we were able to increase the ordinary
income compared to the already strong number in the previous year, resulting in an
ordinary return on investment of 3.1%.
The realized gains include the Viridium one-off and that is then boosting the ROI to 3.5%.
But even if we adjust for that and Jean-Jacques has already mentioned it, the ROI would
Page 6 of 23

Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity

FINAL

still be very strong at 3.2%. Realized gains in the second half were largely driven by the
disposal of two real estate objects. The positive change in the fair value of financial
instruments was an additional factor.
Unrealized gains increased significantly to EUR2.3 billion, mainly driven by lower interest
rates and reduced corporate spreads resulting in an increase in the valuation of our fixed
income portfolio. As of today and driven by the balance of interests going down and
spreads widening, the number should even be EUR1 billion higher than it was by the end
of the year.
On the next slide, you can see that our asset allocation remained rather stable. In 2019,
we have slightly increased our corporate portfolio and improved geographical
diversification of our fixed income book, mainly expanding our investments in emerging
markets, where yields are still a bit more attractive. The overall diversified contribution to
ordinary income is again supported by the good and very good results from real estate
and private equity, but not to any extraordinary extent.

Bloomberg Transcript

Next, we come to the preliminary update of our solvency reporting as of the year-end
2019. And even though the audit of the numbers is not yet final, we are -- we do not
anticipate any material changes and are brave enough to present them today. We will
publish the full reporting with all the detail on the 9th -- on the 7th of April, so I have to ask
you to be a bit patient on full -- until the full details are available then.
The capital adequacy ratio has increased to 252%, very comfortably above our minimum
target. According to our internal metrics, the ratio is even better. The difference here lies
in the treatment of minorities, where we still think that this is capital we can work with. The
regulator still takes a different view.
For the first time, we have applied the dynamic rather than the static volatility adjustment.
We expect to get regulatory approval for this model change within this or the next month.
But it had been agreed with our regulator that we can already use it for this reporting.
In contrast to the static volatility adjustment, the dynamic volatility adjuster is dependent
on spread movement for different economic scenarios instead of being static for all the
scenarios. This reduces our spread risk and has a positive impact on the owned funds.
The first time application led to an improvement of around 15 basis points.
Owned funds have also been benefiting from the additional hybrid capital of which
EUR500 million might be called in 2020. That accounts for another approximately 5
percentage points. So in aggregate, the ratio would have gone down without the two
one-offs. This should not come as a surprise as we have been growing, so remarkably. Still
the comfortable solvency leaves us room or leaves us the room we need to take
opportunities in the future.
On the next page, you can see that the composition of the capital requirements. Property
and casualty has of course increased as a result of the business growth, now representing
the largest share. The market risk has also increased with the growth of our asset base,
Page 7 of 23



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2020-03-11

FINAL

and a slightly increased risk appetite, but the use of the dynamic volatility adjustment has
had a mitigating effect here. The diversification effect has improved by 2 percentage
points and -- as compared to 2018 and now stands at 36%.
The next page, here are a few more details on the development of the capital adequacy
ratio over time. Apart from the additional EUR750 million in hybrid capital, the main drivers
for the increase in 2019 are as already mentioned, model changes and in this respect the
first time use of the dynamic volatility adjustment, as already mentioned. This brings us
then to the 200 -- over the 250% mark. This is in line with the 237% guidance provided at
our Investors Day in October last year, because the latter number only partially included
the EUR750 million of hybrid capital and the use of the dynamic volatility adjustment had
not been taken into account at that point in time.
We now come to the reconciliation of IFRS in the Solvency II owned funds as well as the
composition of the owned funds compared to the same picture of the previous year. The
adjustments for technical provisions have decreased significantly by more than EUR1
billion. This can largely be explained by a higher risk margin, especially for our life and
health business, and due to the decline in interest rate and the growth of the business.

Bloomberg Transcript

I don't want to spend too much time on further details. The most important point is the
continued very high quality of the capital with 87% being Tier 1. The second important
takeaway is the high degree of flexibility with EUR1 billion of unused Tier 2 capacity still
left. Again details to follow early April.
I think this concludes my remarks, and I'd like to hand back to Jean-Jacques for the target
matrix.

Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Thank you very much Roland. So target matrics 2019 on Slide 27. Most matrix are met or
exceeded. The target matrix generally confirms the successful strategy execution and a
favorable year 2019. Almost all targets are achieved, but obviously in P&C the impact of
the large losses is being felt on the combined ratio and the economic matrics.
Let me move to the outlook for 2020 on Page 29. You have an overview on our
profitability and volume expectations based on the favorable renewals at 1-1. We see
further growth opportunities in 2020 in most lines of business of our portfolio. Also the
overall profitability has improved compared to the previous year. All lines of business
earned the cost of capital or a good margin on top of it.
For natural catastrophe risk, we intend to increase our capacities only carefully under
selected programs with key customers. And the overall market environment remains very
competitive, and large losses and results of the reinsurance industry in the past three
years show that generally further needs to see some improving. Reinsurance rates is
clear.

FINAL

On Page 30, you have the same overview for the life and health business. We also see
profitable growth in life and health reinsurance, mainly financial solutions and mobility
business. And overall we see particularly promising growth potential in the Asian market,
particularly China.
Profitability, as in P&C, is at or above cost of capital and our financial solutions business is
expected to provide us with continued excellent profitability, which leads me to the
guidance for 2020. The outlook for this year remains unchanged. We still maintain the
expectation of a group net income of around EUR1.2 billion, which is an increase of
EUR100 million compared to the initial expectations for 2019, if we remove the one-off
items mentioned earlier.
It's a bit early in the year given the uncertainties on the portfolio, on the renewals later this
year on the impact of the coronavirus on overall growth in the economy to move the
guidance. Obviously, we have some outperformance at 1-1 in P&C on the top line -- at the
top line level. But for the time being, we feel that the guidance should be maintained.

Bloomberg Transcript

Before closing, just a few words on a very topical theme, of course, coronavirus. I'd like to
make a few comments on the current situation on that front and the possible impact for
Hannover Re. We obviously look into our own activities and business continuity measures
are in place across the company. But there is no indication currently for operational losses
or non-delivery of services. We have some local crisis teams, which are working in
different locations. Traveling and meeting activities are downsized. Employees in some
locations work from home, where needed and for other locations tele-working options
are planned upon certain triggers.
Current insurance losses are minimal. We didn't see any impact so far, but depending on
the further development of the crisis, we might see some losses emerging rather on the
P&C side than life and health due to the low number of insured debt and feasibilities.
For the same reason, comparability to pandemic stress test with its focus on excess
mortality is limited losses depends on the progression of event cancellations and supply
chain disruptions throughout the year. Our loss monitoring is ongoing and current
estimates are a bit speculative, but based on the initial analysis, the bottom-up from the
different experts, we see some exposure for contingent business interruption and event
cancellation in the order of EUR200 million.
Capital markets have shown strong reactions, of course. And currently as you know we
have practically no listed equities and therefore are, on that front relatively comfortable.
Up-to-date, there are no defaults in our asset portfolio and we continue to monitor
market and asset portfolio performance on a continued basis.
The mid- and long-term impact will of course depend on the level and duration of the
economic downturn. But at this stage from a pure reinsurance standpoint, I would say that
situation remains manageable.

Questions And Answers
FINAL

Operator
(Question And Answer)
Dear ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question-and-answer session.
(Operator Instructions) And the first question we received is from Kamran Hossain from
RBC. Your line is now open, sir. Please go ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, afternoon everyone. Two questions for me. The first one is just I guess it's on the longterm impacts of where rates have got to in -- over the last few months, few days. How
should we think about 2.7 moving to the level that you're kind of reinvesting at today? And
how many bps should we be taking off a year going forward? And then are there any
obvious actions that you can put in place to mitigate some of that impact?
And the second question slightly less number-y, but on Asia, you talked at the Investor
Day about kind of expanding your capabilities, growing the business out there, hiring
some people. Maybe could you just update on kind of how far you've got with plans, how
happy you are and kind of when we should expect some kind of further concrete news on
that? Thank you.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

So I guess I should start with the rate environment. Not that we have not done any really
simulations of how many basis points we will lose. The reinvestment yields have of course
gone down on the one hand, because the -- especially the U.S. rates went down. I
mentioned that the variation reserves have increased today by approximately EUR1 billion,
so that is really driven by interest rates. If now the credit spreads widen remarkably
further, this might come down a bit.
We will -- we only have -- the turnover, which we have presented at various times at the
Investors Days, and we will have to expect that reinvestment yields, again are going
down. We mentioned that 5 to 10 basis points we might lose. This will increase. What can
we do against it? An immediate reaction, we cannot take. We pursue our programs in real
estate and private equity and others, but other than that, we -- the answer is the same as
always, at least medium-term, we have to reflect that in our reinsurance rates.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

FINAL

And Kamran on your second question on Asia, we have started the recruitment plan later
in the last year and are a little bit delayed. Of course the corona crisis has had an impact
on the planning. But for 2019, we didn't have much new recruits based on our plan. The
whole process is starting this year with some delays. So in essence, in terms of footprint,
not a lot of more FTEs, but we have a significant number of FTEs planned for this year and
next year.
The positive part is that the teams in Asia are within the plan or I should say the increased
plan expectations which creates a situation where we need to hire people to manage the
business. But so far, we're on track on the numbers, but are lagging behind a bit on the
resources and are focusing on that, I would say, in the second quarter of this year and
beyond, an increase in recruitment across Asia.

And the next question received is from Vikram Gandhi from Societe General. Your line is
now open, sir. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Hi. Its Vivek from SocGen. Good afternoon, everybody. Just a couple from my side. Firstly
in the Group Annual Report, I see the 200-year aggregate annual loss utilization has gone
up by nearly 20% year-on-year, while the 100-year and 250-year PMLs haven't moved up
a lot so is this just a result of increasing exposure at lower written periods, or is there a
completely different explanation to that deviation?
The other question is on the life and health re-EBIT for 2020 and beyond. Is your
expectation still around EUR450 million or perhaps that gets closer to EUR500 million,
given your actions on mortality results and the financial solutions business is doing
extremely well? Thank you.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Let's start with the second question on the life side. The EUR450 million is probably the
current plan and expectation for 2020. Of course, we work and hope that we can improve
that in the future, but the outlook right now is rather difficult. I don't expect any from the
corona crisis, but it depends on how clients will look for financial solutions in the next
couple of years in the aftermath of the corona crisis.

Okay.

Just -- Michael Pickel, just to your first question and do not have the figures exactly before
me. But in some countries, the regulator ask the clients to buy higher capacities for risk.
And therefore we followed this. And therefore it could give us certain shifts. So for
example, I make the practical example of Canada, where the regulator is very tough on
buying limits. And then we followed up, and this may distort some figures you might find
there. And maybe as well in Germany for example as well Solvency II always drives the
demand for cat business. And having the same line with our clients you follow them as
well in the upper layers and that could distort.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Just trying to understand, what is the biggest risk that you see to the growth in financial
solutions business?

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

Do you mean in terms of insurance risk or that we don't get any business in the future?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Yes. The growth kind of doesn't live up to the trajectory that it has shown overall for
financial solutions.

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

The biggest risk is definitely changes in regulation in the sense that the regulator like we
have seen in the transition from Solvency I to Solvency II, we had an awful lot of Solvency I
business, which was basically not helping the client any longer under Solvency II. And
therefore the client had some extraordinary cancellation rights. The same could happen
to all kinds of regulations around the world in China, in the U.S., in Germany, in Europe,
depending on how regulation is going.
What we're doing on the financial solutions side is basically getting the existing regulation
more in line with economic reality. And if the regulator for whatever reason decides like in
Germany, you need higher reserves to finance your guarantees, you have to build that
ladder. That's fine. We were prepared to do that. And then the regulator came around the
corner with a 16-year transition period. And suddenly all our business we wanted to write
disappeared. Because if the clients get it for free from the regulator, they're not
interested to buy anything from the reinsurer.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

open, sir. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Thank you for taking my questions. The first one, just thank you for the update on the
coronavirus. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more around how you see potential
exposures there. So you mentioned a figure of EUR200 million. Is that something that you
see as a sort of upper limit or what are the assumptions that you're including in that? I
believe that's mainly on the P&C business.
I'd also be interested to hear you talk a little bit around life and health. It seems that you
see it as pretty unlikely that there'll be an impact on the life business. But if you could just
talk a little bit more about why that would be the case? And what would have to happen
for you to change your assumptions there?
And then second question just coming back on the reinvestment rate. Can you just clarify
what is the reinvestment rate on the fixed income portfolio now? And yes, thank you.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think I'll invite Michael to comment on coronavirus and the P&C perspective, and Klaus on
the life and health side first.

A - Michael Pickel

{BIO 3139005 <GO>}

Yes. I think coronavirus for us and how we brought together the sum was a bit a risk
assessment of our current portfolio. This is not really the worst case, but it's a realistic
case how we address things because for the moment, we do not have any loss advice.
And therefore, I think it's essential just to ring-fence where something could come up.
And there are some closer cases and there are some longer shots.
So for example, property normally business interruption is not granted for corona,
because it's too far away, but it could be an implication on certain sub limits, which may
occur. And so far, we have assessed the number and put a figure for this. The other thing
is contingency. For example as well. For the moment, we are not very strong in this
market. But if you see on the longer horizon, how long corona could be Olympic games
are in danger. So we put there a figure for just addressing the figure.
Two other classes of business we've factored in. One is for example credit business.
There's as well really a question whether credit really and corona fits together, because
when you have a company which has financial problem, corona maybe is the last shot to
bring it in into insolvency, but it's not really the reason why. Therefore, I think we assessed
it. We said some countries are in better shape, in worser shape and then we put up a
number.

FINAL

And then last but not least, we figured in as well E&O business. I think it's very
questionable whether E&O is really a class of business, where you could address claims,
because then you really are not diligent for your people. And most people know about
health organizations worldwide what they should do and behave accordingly, but we have
assessed this as well in order to have a realistic scenario all over our offices. And this is
the number Jean-Jacques has laid out.

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

Okay. Maybe on the coronavirus impact on the life side. If you just take our standard
business and I have to use very simple numbers now in a telephone call. Let's assume we
have a 10% margin. So if mortality increases by 10%, what does that mean? In the U.S., you
have 350 million people. The average mortality should be about 1%. So that's 3.5 million
who die each and every year in the U.S. That's one of our largest markets.

Bloomberg Transcript

If this increases by 10%, then you would expect that our profit margin is gone completely.
10% of 3.5 million means you need 350,000 coronavirus deaths in the U.S. And as long as
you don't see that, I can't see that our bottom line will be impacted. I see much more in
the financial markets, nervousness there. But in terms of really death claims, this is very,
very unlikely, especially because we just talked or I just talked about population mortality,
which is usually much worse than insured population mortality.
And the real high sums insured are usually wealthy people who try to stay away from
infectious areas, have probably good access to the health system. And therefore the
likelihood is even lower than what I just tried to calculate. But this is really a back-of-theenvelope calculation. But I'm absolutely not nervous when it comes to the life and health
result on Hannover Re.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Hey. If I then continue with the reinvestment rate. You know the number we usually publish
is more than the yield to maturity. So what happens if I sell everything today and reinvest
tomorrow? The number today if I look at my report is 1.2%. For the fixed income portfolio, I
would expect that to increase as I mentioned that we would expect credit spreads to
widen a little bit against the decrease of the interest rates.
If the book yield, and that is also a realistic number is around 2.5, to date, we lose 1.2 or
1.5 with a modified duration of 5. And the very simple again back-of-the-envelope
calculation, which has led us not too badly over the last years would then result in 12, 13
basis points per year. Again, as I mentioned before, we had expected 5 to 10. Now it may
be 10 to 15 but the impact should be limited.
And again I mentioned with the strong unrealized gains, I think if we touch the portfolio,
we will at least in the first years also see realized gains. And in that regard, I do not expect
that our expectation for the year really comes under pressure.

Q - Edward Morris

And the next question we received is from Sami Taipalus from Goldman Sachs. Your line is
now open. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is just on the life new business value,
which was very strong this year. Is it possible to just provide a little bit more detail of how
that broke down between the different products? For example, was there a particularly
strong impact of the longevity business this year? That would be very helpful? And is it
also possible to give some form of outlook for 2020, what's the pipeline looking like in
terms of deal or should we really just consider this figure as an exceptional number for
2019?
Then my second question goes to the U.S. casualty reserve charge. Could you just talk a
little bit more about the extent of the adverse experience that you've observed here?
How big has it been and what does it relate to? And is your decision to reserve more
prudently purely related to what you've seen on your own books or have you used some
external data or external observation to take this decision? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

Yes. Maybe I'll start with the life side. The more than EUR600 million of value of new
business is dominated by longevity on one hand and financial solutions as well as some
new business in China on the other. The reason is value of new business is relatively big if
you have long-term treaties. If you have just a one- or a two-year treaty, value of the
business can't be that high because then it's only one or two years of EBIT margin. So
longevity has certainly an impact here.
And the second one is our financial solutions deals usually 10, 15, up to 20-year deals. The
only area in which we make a lot of a create value a lot of value of new business from
treaties which are already in force is probably in China where the market is growing,
population is large, and an awful lot of business is sold. This is really true new business in
the sense, we had a treaty and then new business was sold and reinsured with us.
Whereas in the other cases, longevity and financial solutions, it's usually block transaction.
And this is the reason why this is a pretty volatile number. It depends on five, six, seven
large deals we write in a year. Does this answer your question?

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Yes. That's very helpful. Okay. So I guess your conclusion then is that we should think of
this as normal volatility rather than anything to...

A - Klaus Miller

We will do our best to stay always above the EUR220 million and do whatever we can get.

Okay. Cool. But the EUR220 million is the best guidance. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Michael Pickel

{BIO 3139005 <GO>}

Yes. Look just from the U.S. side in casualty business, I think it's important for me to say
that we are a bit a strange animal in the U.S. casualty business because we hate larger
limit. So we focus always on limits management when it comes to casualty line of
business. And we are mostly writing regional business, no excess casualty program.
And our idea was really to create a portfolio where we do not underwrite auto business,
commercial auto. We have umbrella private line business. We are a bit on the general
liability, workers' comp. And we ring-fence these segments and saw that the half market
years develop nicely, but we saw that there is some development in the years 2013 and
2016. And then it was our take to reserve it more prudently and not to factor in that we
have positive development as we have seen that in the past.
So our data is, first of all, client information, paid, and then our own actuarial assumption
on the portfolio. And then finally as well we could not abstain from social inflation. We see
this in hte U.S. and this brought us a bit more to the conservatism that we reserved it
accordingly. Does this answer your question?

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Okay. So you're saying you're basically seeing adverse development on the 2013 and
2016 years but your response has been across all the prior years and in the current year
as well. Is that correct?

A - Michael Pickel

{BIO 3139005 <GO>}

As well in the current year, we used a conservative loss fix, but this we did already in the
past. So we always ultimate and then we are reducing them what we have not done, we
have not reduced and for the past years and we had for the years '13 to '16, we brought
precautionary measures.

And the next question we received is from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Your line is
now open, sir. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi, there. A couple of questions. First of all, a boring technical one. In your annual report on
the balance sheet, there's a very dramatic growth of the unearned premium reserve. And
I appreciate that's because you've grown new business, but it looks very high. Is there
some other accounting change? When I look at the year-on-year movement, there seems
to be some change of consolidation or something, maybe just clarify that.
Page 16 of 23

FINAL

Secondly, could you remind us about the scope for noise in the life and health results from
ModCo as credit spreads bounce around? This was obviously an issue a few years ago.
Just sort of can you give us any sense of the sensitivity as credit spreads widen and how
that comes through in ModCo?
The other question for Klaus. Why could your mortality risk requirement go up so much,
when you're not really growing some straight mortality business? I mean, you tell us
you're growing mostly in financial solutions and longevity, but the mortality risk
requirement went up nearly 40%. And then linked to that, with the financial solutions
business, in the past you've told us is essentially riskless, but there is tail risk. What is the
tail mortality risk on financial solutions business? Thanks.

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

The last one is the easiest. We have usually mortality rate which can easily deal with a
200%, 250%, in some cases even 400% of expected mortality. So as long as the
coronavirus does not go up to that level, there is basically no tail risk. And all these
treaties have a clear purpose for the client, which is usually driven by capital solvency in his
own balance sheet. And as soon as he has no problem with that any longer, he wants to
get the business back. Otherwise, he would just pay for something he doesn't need.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And there's no requirement to mark any of that should any of the clients retention be
consumed? Is there any requirement to reflect any of that in any additional reserve for the
financial solutions business?

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

It's so far out of the money that there is no requirement to do that.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

So Andrew maybe I come to your technical question. We have not changed any
accounting practices. We've looked at where it comes from and it comes from all over the
world. So in this regard the assumption should be that really the strong growth maybe
also in some financial or structured reinsurance contracts to a larger extent really have
contributed to the strong contribution to unearned premium reserves nothing
extraordinary.
I see that China has contributed to that as well quite remarkably, but again, it's obviously
driven by the growth. Maybe technically to come back to your question, why has the
capital requirement for the life business increased so much? I did mention and again we
will come with a deeper analysis early April. We have not yet seen each and every detail,
but one main contributor is the low interest rate, which is a little bit difficult to understand,
but you should bear in mind that the risk margin also depends on the interest rate. So that
Page 17 of 23

Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2020-03-11

FINAL

really goes up because also it's a discounted factor, and the discount factors go down
remarkably. So it's the risk margin plus the growth of the business which bring that up so
remarkably.
Now ModCo, the overall volumes, they have come down. So the volatility should be lower
than what we have seen at around 2009, 2011 and 2012. I cannot really tell you we will
have to look at the portfolio. We will have to look at exactly what is in there because to
now use the spread widening overall of the last week will not lead us there. Of course if
credit spreads widen, the ModCo derivative will be affected. It should be not as
pronounced as we have seen 10 years ago. But I have to admit I don't have final numbers
with me now. We will have to look into those portfolios on an individual basis.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

That's fine. And finally, is that unearned premium reserve more skewed by multi-year
deals? I mean, for example, some of the structure of these, so I shouldn't expect it to
earn through as quickly as normal, I mean just given the size of it or would you expect it to
be earning out over the next 12 months?

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Well, as I see here from the report in front of me, most of it is P&C. So in this regard, I
would not assume that it is really driven by multi-year contracts. The earnings pattern
should be comparable to the past years.

Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions. The first one would be for Roland. Maybe Roland,
can you tell us what is your credit exposure to sectors like oil and gas, travel and leisure,
and maybe also the automotive in your corporate bond portfolio?
Second question would be probably for Jean-Jacques. Maybe it could be difficult for you
to say something at this stage but we've seen two days ago big announced merger within
the brokerage industry between Aon and Willis Towers Watson, which is creating really a
giant. It's already a pretty concentrated market. You've got 67% of your P&C business

FINAL

Yes. Thomas, I start and I give you indications. Of course, it also depends on definitions.
We have a corporate portfolio of around a little bit less than EUR15 billion. The energy, oil
and gas contribution to that would be a little bit above EUR0.5 billion. Hotels and travel
and leisure is less than EUR150 million so that is more or less negligible. The same is true
for airlines.
Automotive is also an area or an industry which comes into question a little bit here. It is
around EUR600 million. So you see, we have always been really focusing on the fact that
we have a highly diversified portfolio. It goes all over the world, all over industries. So in
that regard, we will be affected, but there is no concentration whatsoever in those
industry which you have mentioned.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

So Thomas on the question on the merger, indeed, it's a little bit early to say. Of course,
this is very much in the context of continued consolidation in the brokerage industry, so
not totally astonishing. It'll take a little bit of time until this merger is completed. I think it
might be up to one year. On the negative, clearly for us choice and options are really
important and seeing the consolidation process gives less choices.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the other hand, we are a great partner to both companies and we continue to grow
with them. And what is clear is that the intent is also to increase the scope of insurability.
So it's not only about only of their respective market shares, but also to create new
concepts, new ideas. It's about innovation. And from that standpoint, having scale and the
wide range of services is important for a brokerage company and gives us access to
more business,
so clearly some negative, some positive. What I should say is that although the
consolidation process continues, this also triggers a lot of different moves from people
who want to establish new brokerage companies. So I don't see this as a unique process.
There will also be new players in the market to make sure there is healthy competition in
the brokerage industry.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. Does it change your view regarding the speed at which you would like to
enrich your product offering? I think that initially you thought that you told us that this is
something that you had in mind over the next maybe two to five years. Does this kind of
move, strategic move in the brokerage industry, I mean, potentially accelerating for you
the need to come up with this kind of new services you were talking about?

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

No, I don't think this news per se changes our intent I think we always had this
incorporated in our strategy. I think we need to continue to be very relevant to our
customers, but we continue to be very clear broker partner on the P&C side. So we also
wanted to stay relevant to the broker world. So it would not be for me a trigger for
shifting our strategy or starting having a more service focused approach to the business.

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity. I have one question, please. The
redundant reserves being down by EUR200 million and also accompanying that we have
the statement on the presentation that the conservative reserving on initial years
continues. Could you help me understand what's your kind of outlook, if you like, on how
soon this can be rebuilt?
And I'm also asking because one of the comments made was the casualty losses or
casualty impact on reserving and you mentioned that you're more exposed to SME
regionals. And then as the problem trickles down in that segment from large corporate,
that's always an open-ended question. So I'm just curious to know how you think about
redundant reserves, the rebuild and any risks to that from casualty this year? Thank you.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Yes. Vinit, if I start and I might then ask Michael to step in when it comes to the casualty
details. I think by the end of the third quarter, we were still of the opinion that 2019 might
be a year when we could add. So there would have been a little bit of room to do it, then
the large losses came in remarkably higher. We were well aware of the final impact of this
Ogden rate. But again, it also added a mid-double-digit effect to the reserve
redundancies.
So we went then into the reserving season with well nearly unchanged or some slightly
increased ultimate loss ratios, but the resulting redundancies then came a little bit lower,
because of the increased loss development assumption. So in this regard, we just have to
accept that the reserves have been used for an occasion. We have always told you that
this is why we have them.
Also when the Ogden rate event happened for the first time also there, we have been
using them. Now we had experienced a slightly less than expected performance, we have
increased here the reserves. And this is again why we have used them. We always
mentioned that we will use them in case we need it. And if there is an opportunity to add
Page 20 of 23



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2020-03-11

to them next year, we will do that again. And the most important thing is that we are very
transparent about it and that we have not changed our overall reserving policy as such.

FINAL

A - Michael Pickel

Yes. I think only just to add. In the Brazilian market, it's a developing situation. We are not a
big reinsure in the Brazilian market. Our sweet spot mostly fits in the agro and property
business. And so far we are sitting a bit on the side steps with a very limited exposure on
casualty and specialty lines. That's my take for the moment.

The next question we received is from Paris Hadjiantonis from Exane BNP Paribas. Your
line is now open, sir. Please go ahead.

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Hi, and good afternoon from my side as well. The first question is on your runoff
result. Basically, when I look at your triangles in your annual report, there is a large
negative effect coming from the 2018 underwriting year. I know it can be a bit technical,
but the absolute number looks quite large. So I don't think it's only explained by Jebi. So if
you could give us some details on that that would be helpful.
The second question is on financial solutions and the contribution to the other income. For
2019, I think it was EUR287 million. And you are saying that you plan to increase volumes or
your value of new business is showing that you have already increased volumes. So should
we be thinking that this EUR287 million is going to be growing quite a lot for 2020
onwards?
Lastly, and I know you don't really give a lot of details on Solvency II, but if I could just
check maybe qualitative your operating capital generation for 2019. I assume that it was
more or less in line with expectations given that the difference from the 237% that you've
shown in your last disclosure is more or less explained by the model changes from the
dynamic volatility adjuster. Thank you.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

So if come back to the runoff result, you mentioned, I think it's a little bit we've seen that
or it's a pattern. We've seen that before that the most recent years where we usually then
add reserves is negative. That had been the case before. It's a little bit increased this time
by Jebi. There is one other impact from a large advanced solutions contract which is
nearly risk free,
but this is more a technical change between a profit commission and losses. So this is
more technical. There is nothing unusual in that respect. Overall as mentioned, the runoff
Page 21 of 23



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE

result has been positive within the expected range and a little bit impacted by Jebi and
some other really overall developments going down, but nothing extraordinary.

FINAL

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

On the financial solutions side, yes, we expect to develop this business. But as I
mentioned in one of my earlier answers, this will be very lumpy. We have a changing
regulatory environment for our cedent. And therefore it's very difficult to have a steady
growth expectation here. But in general, yes, we would like and we expect this line to
grow.
So anything else we have forgotten?

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Capital generation.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

The capital generation question. Paris, could you rephrase your third question, please?

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, yes, sure. So basically I was just wondering whether or not your operating capital
generation for 2019 on a Solvency II basis was more or less in line with your expectations
at the Investor Day.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Yes. As mentioned, I think we gave you the forecast at the Investors Day. At the occasion
of the Investors Day, we only referred to the potential additional hybrid. So the difference
between the EUR750 million issue and the potential call in 2020. So we added EUR250
million, and we disregarded the dynamic volatility adjuster because BaFin approval was
not certainly enough to already consider that at that point in time. If you really add the two
components which we had not taken into consideration at that point in time, we are
exactly there.
