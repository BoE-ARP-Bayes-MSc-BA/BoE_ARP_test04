{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. Welcome. It's a great pleasure to welcome you to what is
actually our third set of results that we've put out since we became a public company. Lots
of familiar faces in the room, welcome back, and a few new faces as well, very good to see
you. Welcome to you also.
In terms of the agenda for this morning, I'm going to give you an overview of the results
for the last six months, a reminder about our strategy, I'll give you some more information
about the shipping decision that we've announced this morning, I'm going to have a look
at the operational performance in a bit more detail, and then I'll hand over to Jonathan,
our CFO, and Jonathan will take you through the numbers in more detail before ﬂipping
back over to me. I will then look at our priorities in the future and, of course, we've got
some time set aside for Q&A.
Now at our prelims six months ago, I was very proud of the fact that a year in as a plc, we
had absolutely delivered on the key objectives. So, I'm pleased to be able to say now, six
months later, that we've made a very good start to the ﬁrst half of our new year and we
have delivered a strong set of results. Trading EBITDA from our core Financial Services
and Travel businesses is up by 5.2%. That has been partially oﬀset by the fact that we now
have a full half year of plc costs, which, of course, we didn't have in the same period last
year when we were still a private company. Now, that delta will wash through and it won't
apply starting in the second half.

Group Trading EBITDA has grown by 0.8% to £131 million. And we've grown Trading Proﬁt,
we've grown PBT, we've grown earnings per share, and we've also generated high levels
of cash, allowing us to further reduce our net debt position. All of this means that we are
conﬁdent of achieving our full year proﬁt expectations and it supports the announcement
of our maiden interim dividend of £0.022.
Now, a quick reminder of the strategy that I outlined back in January at our Capital
Markets Day for building on our position as the UK's leading provider of products and
services for the over 50s. What we said then was we're going to deliver sustainable
shareholder returns by: ﬁrstly, unlocking the growth potential in our core businesses;
secondly, investing strategically in the business to generate future growth opportunities
including, for example, the announcement on a cruise ship that we've made today. And
thirdly, maintaining our capital eﬃcient model.

Bloomberg Transcript

How are we going to do that? Well, ﬁrstly, by expanding our insurance footprint beyond
the relatively modest market share that we have today. Secondly, growing our travel
businesses through the strong brands that we've got, the portfolio of brands and everexpanding range of itineraries for our customers; thirdly, broadening our personal ﬁnance
oﬀerings and, in particular, the launch of Saga Investment Services, which we'll talk more
about in a minute; fourth, enhancing the Saga database and the use of that database. It's
a very important resource within the company and it's full of rich data. And ﬁnally,
continuing to assess ways that we can develop the business through innovative ideas and
through processes. So, that's the reminder of what I said back in January and it is
unchanged.
So, what progress have we actually made since the start of the year? Well, ﬁrstly, we have
grown our core book, increasing motor policy numbers and maintaining our combined
operating ratio. The motor panel that we talked about a lot six months ago is now up and
running. This is complementary to our in-house underwriter, AICL. It gives us access to
third-party underwriters across all of our major product lines now and that should allow us
to compete in parts of the market where we don't have the data or the expertise to want
to underwrite the risks ourselves.
We've also completed the Bennetts acquisition. We're seeing positive early signs both in
terms of the performance of Bennetts as a business, but also its integration into our
current operations. We continue to grow our Travel business. That's evidenced by the
growth in Trading EBITDA and also forward trading data, which shows increases in both
our Holiday revenues booked and also in the load factors for Cruising.
The decision to invest in cruise ship capacity – in the refreshing of our cruise ship capacity,
I should say, has now been taken. That investment will be transformational for our cruise
business. I'm going to go into a bit more detail on that shortly. The work to develop and
then launch Saga Investment Services proposition is gaining momentum. Nici AudhlamGardiner joined us as Managing Director of that business back in August. She's putting
together an impressive team to lead the Saga Investment Service business. They're
working very hard on our customer-led proposition, which is on track, as planned, to
launch before the end of the year.

FINAL

And ﬁnally, as we projected, the sale process for Allied is due to be completed by the end
of the ﬁnancial year and is on track to do so. We announced, remember, back at our
Capital Markets Day in January that we had written that business down to zero.
Now, before we move on to talk about the rest of the business, I want to spend a bit more
time looking at two businesses, two key areas ﬁrst. First of those is Cruising and the
second is motor insurance. As we have said in the past, Cruising sits right at the heart of
the Saga brand. It plays a vital role in demonstrating the excellent customer service that
Saga is renowned for. Our cruise operations remain extremely popular with customers.
Over 98% of customers rate their experience as excellent or good. In fact, during August
of this year, both Saga Sapphire and Saga Pearl achieved their best ever customer
satisfactions scores.
So the business is performing well, demand is high, and we remain very committed to it
as a key part of the Saga oﬀer. However, we're currently running older ships. They're less
eﬃcient. They cost more to maintain. They make it harder for us to provide our customers
with a fantastic oﬀer that we want to. And we therefore announced today that we have
taken the decision to update our shipping capacity.

Bloomberg Transcript

After a rigorous selection process, I'm very pleased to be able to tell you that we have
secured the Meyer Werft shipyard in Germany for the build. We've signed a
memorandum of understanding with Meyer Werft for the delivery of a new purpose built
ship in 2019. And we have an option on a second ship to be delivered in 2021. We have
two years to make the decision about that second ship.
Cruising is a growth market. It's a market in which we have a proven track record, where
demand for our oﬀering is exceeding the supply, where new ships will be transformative
for our business. And the business case for this investment is extremely compelling.
Jonathan's going to give you a bit more detail of that including some expectations
around returns shortly.
There are few images up on the screen that you can see, which show how the new ship
may look. We'll be ﬁnalizing the design of the ship over the coming months with input
from our customers. Safe to say it's going to be a signiﬁcant upgrade for us, whilst
retaining the traditional features that our customers really value in Saga Cruises.
For example, all the cabins will now have balconies, which wasn't the case on our older
ships. But we'll still maintain the intimate small ship feel compared to some of the new
ships out there being built with 4,000, 5,000 even 6,000 berths on them. These ships will
have under 1,000, so it is the classic small ship cruising experience.
There will be a high crew-to-customer ratio as we have today. And we'll retain lots of nice
touches, which we know our customers value like single-seat dining, great public spaces
and excellent entertainment facilities. Overall, as I've said, the decision is transformational
for the proﬁtability of our cruise business and will oﬀer compelling returns.

FINAL

Let's talk a little bit more about motor insurance operations. Firstly, let me remind you of
why our motor insurance business has very strong built-in strength. Firstly, we have lower
acquisition costs thanks largely to our database, which now covers 11 million people in
over 50s age range. At the heart of this business is Saga Services, which is the retail end
of our insurance business. Saga Services is a diﬀerentiated and highly eﬀective distributor
of our products. And it can choose whether it underwrites policies internally or whether it
wrote them (07:59) externally through the new panel.
Our in-house underwriter, which we call AICL, remains in a position to price extremely
competitively in the narrow space of the market in which we are true experts. That is small
– low mileage, smaller cars and so on. We're very, very good at that. Finally, our claims
cost are kept very low compared to industry averages. We have an excellent claims
management process.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, this model has allowed us to deliver a strong performance in motor despite the
continued challenging market conditions. We have not seen the uplift in claims frequency
and personal injury claims that have been reported elsewhere in the industry. Our
exceptional claims handling also means that our claims costs have remained very low,
helping us drive proﬁtability. Where we do agree with the market is that there are signs of
sustainable premium increases coming in. This plays to our advantage. AICL's claims
experience and its pricing structure allows us to compete very eﬀectively in a market
where more people are starting to shop around.
Now, let's be clear. The numbers that we've announced today cover the last six months.
They are not yet the results of the new motor panel. The increase in customers that we've
announced is an increase of market share within our core market resulting from AICL's
expertise and claims experience and from Saga Services' ability to grow policy numbers.
So, the core business is performing well, but there's still a lot to be done to broaden a
market in which we operate. The motor panel, as I say, launched over the summer. It now
has its ﬁrst two external underwriters as well as AICL underwriting policies. As a reminder,
what we saw with our home panel when we launched that four or ﬁve years ago is that it
becomes increasingly eﬃcient and eﬀective as more underwriters join the panel. What
happens is they start to trust the data that we supply them and they start to build
competitive tension into the panel. We expect to add two or three more underwriters
between now and year-end, and then another two or three in the ﬁrst half of next year.
The motor panel will enable us to capture market share in areas that, as I said before, a
highly conservative in-house underwriter is unable to price for competitively. It might
sound amazing but, historically, up to three quarters of the customers who come to us for
a quote did not get competitive quote from us because we didn't really want to
underwrite that risk. We will now be able to pursue the whole of that market using our
motor panel.
The completion of the acquisition of Bennetts, the UK's premier motorbike insurer, will
also help us to drive our motor business forward. It provides a signiﬁcant opportunity for
us to cross sell and to up sell products to its customer base of over 200,000

FINAL

policyholders. Bennetts' core motorbike insurance sector is within a part of the market
that's growing very strongly. And it's very close to our demographic. The majority of their
customers are either over 50 or approaching 50. Early indications are that this business,
as I mentioned earlier, is integrating well into the Saga Group. And we will be in a position
to give you more detail on how that develops in the months to come.
Trading and home insurance was very encouraging in the ﬁrst half. Trading EBITDA
increased by more than 16% on the comparative period a year ago. That result was driven
by the competitive pricing advantage that we get from our home panel despite a
challenging marketplace.
During the ﬁrst half, market premiums continued to fall, resulting in less shopping around
by customers, i.e., less churn. Now, we're a relatively new entrant into the home insurance
market, and so we beneﬁt in a market where there's lots of churn. And as a result, we've
seen a small reduction in the core policy numbers for home in the ﬁrst half.
In other ﬁnancial services, which is mostly Private Medical and Travel Insurance, core
policy volumes and revenue were up, principally driven by performance of those two core
businesses. The slight fall that you see in Trading EBITDA was due entirely to investment
in future growth opportunities, in particular, the wealth management oﬀering, Saga
Investment Services, which I mentioned before, and also Saga Legal Services.

Bloomberg Transcript

Trading for the Travel business in the ﬁrst half of the year was encouraging. Growth in
Trading EBITDA, this was a result of ongoing implementation of the clear strategy that we
talked about back in January and the contribution made by Destinology.
We continue to win lots of awards. Saga Holidays was recently named by The Times and
Sunday Times as the Specialist Tour Operator of the Year. Titan Travel was named as the
Best Escorted Tour Operator. Saga Cruises was Best Value for Money Cruise Line for the
second year running at the Cruise International Magazine Awards.
Finally, we're focused on developing the cruise business through optimized pricing,
through growing our load factors and through maintaining the excellent levels of
customer satisfaction that we've got.
I'm now going to hand you over to Jonathan, who's going to talk you through the
numbers in a bit more detail. Thanks.

Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

So, thanks very much, Lance, and good morning, everybody. It's great to be presenting to
you all for the ﬁrst time as the Saga CFO and, especially, with such a solid set of numbers.
I've now been with the business for almost six months and it really is a very exciting time
to be joining the group. Built around the cornerstone of our fantastic brand, we have two
excellent growth businesses in our insurance and our travel with great growth potential.

FINAL

However – and our target customers provide us with many other areas where we could
grow a third and potentially a fourth substantial pillar to the group. However, we do need
to remain focused and clear on the scale opportunities where we can provide a
diﬀerentiated oﬀering, responding to the needs of our customers. And I'm really looking
forward to working with Lance and the team over many years to build from these solid
foundations and to grow the business.
So, moving on to the ﬁnancials, the income statement here represents the continuing
operations of the group and all the numbers exclude Allied. Overall, we've achieved a
robust performance during ﬁrst half of the year with encouraging growth coming from our
core businesses. Revenue increased by 8.7% to £478 million, largely due to the growth of
the Travel business with the acquisition of Destinology. Trading Proﬁt, which excludes
intangible – which excludes amortization of acquired intangibles relating to the group's
two acquisitions, Destinology and Bennetts, grew by 1% to £117.5 million. And it is
important to note that our Trading EBITDA from those core businesses of Financial
Services and Travel increased by 5.2%, oﬀset primarily by those normalization of plc costs
and I'll touch on that later.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking below Trading Proﬁt, the non-trading credit results mainly from the reduction and
we expect to defer consideration on the Destinology acquisition from the initial cautious
estimate and ﬁnance costs were £14.1 million comprising £10.2 million of interest costs on
debt and borrowings, £2.5 million of amortization of debt issue costs, £0.6 million of
ﬁnance charge associated with the pension scheme and £0.8 million of charge associated
with the unwinding of the discount on that deferred consideration on Destinology.
The group's ﬁnancing arrangements were put in place in April 2014, part of the way
through the ﬁrst half of last year, thus the £10.3 million cost in the ﬁrst half of last year is
not purely comparable to the cost in the ﬁrst half of this year. IPO expenses in the current
year relate to costs associated with options granted at the time of IPO. And overall, the
strong performance in continuing operations has resulted in a reported EPS growing to
£0.07 with H1 in the prior year including the signiﬁcant IPO and exceptional debt costs.
Moving on to dividend, we have today, as Lance said, announced our ﬁrst interim
dividend of £0.022. This is based on three factors: Firstly, our conﬁdence in delivering the
full year number; secondly, our ability to continue to grow our business sustainably and
proﬁtably going forward; and thirdly, those strong cash generation attributes of the
group.
As a reminder, the range of the dividend payout ratio was raised at the time of prelims to
40% to 60% of group net income, excluding exceptional items, and we also provided
guidance at the time of the IPO that interim and ﬁnal dividends would be paid in
approximately the proportions of one-third to two-thirds, respectively.
Our Motor and Home insurance businesses have performed really well, delivering
increased EBITDA against a tough market backdrop. Other ﬁnancial services have borne
those start-up costs as Lance said, of both the wealth management JV and the legal
services. Travel has continued to deliver another proﬁt increase on that journey to

improve its EBITDA over time. And the health care EBITDA relates to our continuing
Patricia White's, Country Cousins and Saga SOS businesses, as well as our pilot in visiting
homecare. We have invested in this pilot to enable us to consider scaling that up in the
future and this has led to a marginal proﬁt reduction.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

Media and Central costs increased from the prior year with these PLC costs and I'll talk a
little bit about those later.
Moving on to Motor insurance. Revenue has decreased by 1.8%. The core underwritten
business clearly has faced a market with reducing premiums, while Broked income has
increased as a result of the inclusion of Bennetts since its acquisition in July. Despite the
Motor market remaining highly competitive through the period, the positive claims
experience has allowed us to grow Trading EBITDA by 2.6%. Core policies sold in the last
12 months have risen as a result of two factors; the positive policy additions in H2 of 20142015; and the addition of Bennetts in the ﬁrst half of this year.
Moving on to the Motor core underwriting P&L, I will spend some time talking about our
Motor underwriting performance. The underwriting business has again reported an
exceptional combined operating ratio of 68%. The group has not seen the increase in
claims frequency experienced by the wider market, with frequency remaining broadly ﬂat
across accidental damage, third-party injury, and personal injury claims. We believe that
this is largely driven by the demographic factors within our customer base with the
majority of our customers being retired. However, we are not complacent and are
keeping an extremely close eye on changes in that claims progression. This demographic
factor seems to have reduced the impact of both falling fuel prices and the improved
economic growth.
Claims severity remains broadly stable across accidental damage and personal injury
claims and the group has continued to maintain strong levels of retention within the
Ministry of Justice Portal with ongoing eﬀective management of these claims types. We
have seen some impact in third-party damage severity in line with the market, chieﬂy atfault repair from the Coles v Hetherton judgment. The overall positive claims experience
led to strong prior year releases of reserves.
As we have consistently communicated, we constantly review the balance between
volume and value. During H1 2014, our pricing approach delivered a pure combined
operating ratio of 97%. Given the cautious nature of our underwriting and ones this year
would have worked through in terms of being earned, this initial pure ratio would be
expected to deliver an excellent underwriting result but at the expense of policy growth.
We rebalanced this in the second half of last year to increase policy volumes, achieving a
full year pure combined operating ratio of around 106%. We have continued to write
business just below this level in the ﬁrst half of 2015, which we would expect to ﬁnally earn
through at a signiﬁcantly better rate.
For the full year to January 2016, we should expect a pure combined operating ratio to be
more consistent during the ﬁrst half of this year and the second half of this year.
Additionally, the combined operating ratio is expected to be materially in line with last

Page 7 of 25

Company Ticker: SAGA LN Equity
Date: 2015-09-30

year. Finally, the positive claims experience has enabled us to release £40.5 million of
prior year reserves. And at the year-end, we will have no material change in the level of
reserved margin.

FINAL

Here you can see the aging of the releases from the prior years with the majority in the
three accident years to January 2014. Limited reserve releases have been recognized for
the accident year to January 2015, maintaining our cautious approach.
Moving on to Home Insurance, the market has remained highly competitive, as Lance has
said, in the ﬁrst half of the year. Those benign weather conditions also reported by other
insurers have led to reductions in claims cost across the industry, resulting in falling
premiums. This means that people tend to shop around less, reducing the number of
quotes and therefore resulting in a slight fall in new core policies. Despite these market
conditions, the home panel has continued to aﬀord us the eﬃciency to drive down net
rates that we receive from our underwriters and grow revenue by around 16% in Trading
EBITDA by just over 16%.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Other Financial Services, we have seen continued strong performance from the PMI
and travel insurance products, resulting in a 7% increase in revenue from broking and
other trading. Core underwriting policy volumes remain consistent to previous half year
on slightly reduced revenues by 3.4%. Trading EBITDA was £1.3 million lower due to the
impact of that investment in marketing and other startup costs to launch the legal services
product and the Saga Investment Services' wealth management JV.
Moving on to Travel, we have delivered a strong performance in this ﬁrst six months of the
year despite uncertain times in the market. The acquisition of Destinology in August 2014
has contributed to the strong growth in revenues and proﬁts. And the Holidays business
revenue has increased by just over 25%, the majority of which was contributed to by
Destinology and the rest by a shift towards higher value, higher proﬁt long-haul holidays.
Gross proﬁt was 22% higher with Destinology contributing £4.1 million and the remain
attributable to this – the remainder attributable to this mix shift. Cruising business'
revenue reduced slightly by 1.2%, predominantly due to the change in itineraries during
that period compared to the period a year before.
Improved yield management has continued to deliver beneﬁts to average daily rates and
load factors were 83.8%, marginally down on the (24:41) 85.3% in the ﬁrst half of last year.
These occupancy levels are impressive when considering the demographic of the ships,
where single occupancy in the absence of children in cabins lead to a natural reduction in
load factors.
Gross proﬁt in the cruise business was down by £0.8 million, reﬂecting the marginally
lower revenues and some increased expenditure on repairs and maintenance for the
ships. But from a full year perspective, the group expects the proﬁts to be up from the
Cruising business.

FINAL

Overall Trading EBITDA was £16.9 million, 11.2% higher with just under half of this increase
attributable to the acquisition of Destinology and the remainder being driven by the
margin improvements across the other tour operating businesses.
In terms of current trading, the current outlook is pretty solid with the businesses pretty
much fully sold for this year and improving proﬁts expected for the full year. The business
is currently in a robust trading position for next year, with growth expected in tour
operating volumes. The cruise business for 2016-2017 is load factored 1% behind year-onyear; however daily rates are strongly ahead. Against this, we will have Sapphire in dock
for a couple of months of next year, which will hold back proﬁt growth of the Travel
business in 2016-2017.

Bloomberg Transcript

Media and Central costs increased from the prior period with an operating loss of £10
million, resulting primarily from the normalization of plc costs, accounting for £4.2 million
of the increase. These plc costs include head count costs, long-term incentive costs, which
have increased as another year's grant has been added. It should be remembered that we
were a public company for only two months of the comparable period last year and only
at plc costs of around £0.5 million for that period. We ﬂagged then that costs would
clearly increase in the second half of last year and into the ﬁrst half of this year. This
increase in Central costs in the second half of this year compared to the second half of last
year will be signiﬁcantly reduced.
The business remains highly cash generative, where there is an (27:01) available operating
cash, both from (27:02) continuing businesses of just around 107% of Trading EBITDA.
While proﬁt was higher within the respective businesses, we have increased the dividends
paid from these companies. And as before, the day-to-day CapEx requirements of the
Group are relatively limited.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We have £2.7 billion of assets on our balance sheet. Of
these, £1.5 billion relates to primarily the acquisition of Saga by Acromas in 2007.
Goodwill and intangible ﬁxed assets increased by around £28 million, primarily due to the
acquisition of Bennetts and just over £700 million of cash and investments were held for
regulatory purposes in our Travel and underwriting businesses. We also have around £60
million of assets in relation to our existing cruise ships. The increase in other liabilities is
due to higher current tax liabilities and seasonal deposit levels.
At IPO, we said we will reduce net debt by half a turn compared to EBITDA per year. The
continued strong cash generation has allowed us to make good progress so far this year,
enabling the group to reduce its debt ratio to 2.35 times from 2.5 times at the start of the
year.
Having been in the business for six months, I've had time to assess the future capital
requirements of the Group, including the implication of the announcement today
regarding the renewal of our cruise capacity. We are clear in the need to have a balanced
approach between investments in our businesses, debt reductions, and returns to
shareholders. We intend to reduce the debt ratio to between 1.5 times to 2 times of net
debt-to-EBITDA subject to the achievement of our expected proﬁt and cash ﬂow targets.

FINAL

We are aiming to be at the lower end of this proposed debt range before taking on any
debt in relation to new shipping capacity. And even after this investment, we should
remain below the 2 times level. This is also consistent with our current dividend payout
ratio.
Moving on to Solvency Capital, we continue to hold suﬃcient capital reserves in our
underwriting business under Solvency I. The coverage ratio of 234% is materially in line
with the same point a year ago. And obviously, the regulator requires us in order to pay
dividends to hold a minimum of 200%, and therefore the Group has a signiﬁcant buﬀer.
We continue to make excellent progress ahead of the implementation of Solvency II and
are intent to go down (29:41) an Undertaking Speciﬁc Parameter route for the calculation
of Solvency reserves. We are conﬁdent that the underwriting business will be fully
compliant as at the 1st of January 2016 when the regulations commence.

Bloomberg Transcript

Following careful analysis of the regulation, we remain conﬁdent that AICL will not require
any additional capital as a result of Solvency II and expect to have a solid buﬀer in excess
of the requirement at the year-end. We have also reviewed our investment strategy in
light of Solvency II and intend to implement a lower risk strategy, which will reduce the
Group's SCR with a limited impact on investment return.
The ﬁnancial case for the ship investment is robust, mainly predicated on increased
eﬃciency of our new capacity. Roughly half of this is driven by reductions in the use of fuel
and the other half by repair, maintenance and general running costs. The business case
delivers an ungeared IRR in the mid-teens and includes suitably cautious assumptions
with no uplift in load factors and daily rates on a marginally increased capacity.
In terms of payments, 20% will be payable in four installments before delivery of the ship
with the remaining 80% payable on delivery. And this is likely to be funded by eﬃcient
asset-backed ﬁnance. Returns are expected to be signiﬁcantly in excess of the Group's
cost of capital.
Finally, in terms of outlook for the year, we are conﬁdent in delivering that Trading EBITDA
growth in line with market expectations. The amortization of acquired intangibles will have
an incremental year-on-year eﬀect of around £4 million. And with the ongoing gradual
reduction in the level of net debt through the second half, the ﬁnance costs will be
marginally below the charge in the ﬁrst six months.
I'll now hand back to Lance.

Thanks, Jonathan. So let's move forward. In Financial Services, our aim is to drive growth
through the core Financial Services businesses in the second half of this year, whilst
maintaining the right balance, as Jonathan said, between proﬁt generation and policy
growth. In Motor Insurance, we're going to monitor the claims environment extremely
closely to ensure that we stay on top of our claims experience and we react appropriately.

FINAL

We are going to retain our prudent approach to underwriting, focusing on our core area
of expertise. And ﬁnally, we will add further new underwriters to our motor panel.
In Home Insurance, we aim to capitalize on the pricing advantage that we get from our
home panel, using it to compete for market share in the second half of the year. In Other
Financial Services, we are going to look to grow our travel insurance and our PMI
products by continuing to evolve the products to ensure that they remain relevant to our
customers. And we will, of course, launch Saga Investment Services by the end of the
year.
Growth in the Travel business remains a key part of our strategy. We'll be focusing on
maintaining momentum into the second half of the year and beyond by developing the
distribution channels for our products, maintaining our focus on targeting customers via
digital channels and optimizing their digital experience, oﬀering exciting new products in
the form of new destinations and itineraries.

Bloomberg Transcript

And ﬁnally as described earlier, the cruise business remains absolutely central to the Saga
brand. We've made the decision to enhance it with an investment in replacing the
shipping capacity. We will now work very hard over the coming months to ﬁnalize the
details of the new ship. However, remember, we won't take delivery of a new ship until
2019. So our immediate focus is on providing the excellent service that keeps our
customers coming back again and again.
So let's wrap up. What are our priorities for the second half of the year? Firstly, to build on
the launch of the motor panel to add new insurers, to maximize the pricing eﬃciency as
we've done with our home panel, and to therefore allow us to compete for additional
market share in the broader over 50s market. Secondly, to ﬁnalize the details of the
investments in shipping. We have a team in place now to deliver the design and then
build for 2019; to launch Saga Investment Services under the leadership of Nici AudhlamGardiner. Fourth, to focus on the use of the database and the customer journey within
Saga.
We now have the team in place to deliver this, including a Chief Digital Oﬃcer, a Head of
Customer Engagement, a Customer Director who owns cross-sell, all of them reporting to
our new Chief Marketing Oﬃcer, Matt Atkinson. As I've said previously, this is a long-term
project and I look forward to keeping you updated on it at our prelims next year and
beyond. Finally, we are going to complete the sale of Allied Healthcare.
So, in conclusion, we are well positioned to build on our momentum into the second half
of this year and beyond and we are on track to deliver on our target of 5% EBITDA growth
for the year.
So we'll open the ﬂoor to questions. There are a number of mikes in the room. Please wait
till you've got a mike before you ask your question. It would really be helpful if you would
state who you are and where you're from. That would be appreciated.
Ravi?

Q&A

FINAL

Q - Ravi Tanna

{BIO 16926941 <GO>}

Thank you. Morning. It's Ravi Tanna at Goldman Sachs. Three questions please. So the ﬁrst
one was on your Motor Insurance result. Obviously, the reserve releases came in a bit
stronger, but your current year loss ratio came in a bit weaker than I was expecting. I was
just wondering, going forward, is there going to be any spillover impact on the current
year loss ratio in your underwritten business from the launch of the new insurance panel?
And then will there be a kind of tradeoﬀ in terms of growth and proﬁtability on what you
are underwriting in-house?
The second question was just on the reserve releases themselves. Obviously, you'd
guided in the past to £50 million, being quite an elevated level. Given the strength of the
number in the ﬁrst half, how can we think about reserve releases going forward and
what's the outlook there, please?
And then ﬁnally, just on uses of cash leverage, payout ratio, et cetera. Again, previously,
you had talked about, once the leverage ratio fell below 2 times, there was potential to
consider a diﬀerent dynamic in terms of the long-term payout ratio for the group.
Obviously, given today's announcements around the shipping investments and the 1.45
times to 2 times target, is it safe to assume that's now oﬀ the table or how should we think
about the longer-term payout ratio trajectory please? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

I'm happy to deal with those three questions in reverse order. The ﬁrst question in terms
of the payout, I mean, you should assume that we'll stay within that range in terms of
where we get to, we get the lower end of the range consistent with the current payout of
40% to 60%. We will then invest in one ship and potentially a second. What you should
then consider is that the – there will be signiﬁcant EBITDA growth per ship delivered into
the business. And at that point, to the extent that we do not invest that in other
businesses, then there is a simple calculation of how we distribute that further to the
business.
We have clearly said, we are an asset-eﬃcient business. We put our money into assets
where we believe that that will give us some form of competitive advantage, and be that
in our underwriter or elsewhere. We are not talking about investing in other businesses
where we have a signiﬁcant capital requirement.
In terms of the reserve releases in the long-term guidance, we have had an exceptionally
good claims experience during the ﬁrst half of this year and that is being reﬂected in
terms of the reserve releases. We do still expect those reserve releases to reduce over
time gradually as we said at the time of the IPO, but that is just deferred because we've
had an excellent claims experience during the ﬁrst half.
I think your next question – and sort of, that's why I did it in reverse order, because
obviously the reducing releases will have an impact potentially on the motor underwriting

FINAL

core P&L. But on the ﬂip side, we have various things going the other direction, which will
enable us to grow the business. The ﬁrst of those is clearly the panel, which will come into
our broking P&L within that motor. So that will grow as we add complementary and
adjacent areas of the market where we do not underwrite, and we could increase our
market share within those speciﬁc areas.
Secondly, we have always talked to you about an ongoing eﬃciency and productivity
drive within that business, and we delivered signiﬁcant beneﬁts year-on-year-on-year. We
will aim to continue to do that. And then thirdly, what we are also seeing is, the start,
we've had some very tough years of both Motor and Home markets. We've seen a start of
a turn in the Motor market and we've seen the ﬁrst hint of a turn in the Home market as
well. So to the extent that we may see a market improvement from this low point, then we
have the opportunity to play both our underwriting book and the panel to grow both
volume and value. Does that answer the question?

James. Sorry. Come back to you in a moment.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Thanks. It's James Shuck from UBS. I had three questions, please. Firstly, on the crew ship
investment, could you just clarify – I mean, are you moving from two ships to three ships
or are you sort of intending to take one of the other two or both of those ships out of
service or update them in some way because I mean they've been around for a while now,
they're like 30, 40 years old, so could you...

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

This is a very quick answer. It's a replacement strategy; so when the new ship arrives, an
old ship will go. So we expect to maintain a two-ship ﬂeet.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

So at some stage you will need to – you also need to buy another ship, and hence the
option with a 2020, 2021.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Correct.

Company Name: Saga PLC

Okay. Fine. And could you just clarify on the ﬁnancing of that ship. You mentioned assetbacked ﬁnancing. But roughly what kind of capital expenditure are you thinking of?

FINAL

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

We can't actually divulge that because it is commercially sensitive. And so we are not in a
position to tell you exactly what the capital is. We are looking at an ECA-backed loan,
which would be 80% of the value of the ship. That will obviously be on balance sheet, but
will be very eﬃcient ﬁnancing in terms of the cost of debt.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

What does a ship like that sort of cost roughly?

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

We are not in a position to make that speciﬁc comment. I think you can probably look at
comparable out in the market. If you can ﬁnd anybody that's actually stated how much
they paid for a ship...

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

We were looking out. So I – no one seems to ever put this into the market, but if you ﬁnd
something, I'd love to see it.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Okay. Great. So, second question, just returning to the combined ratio on the motor side,
I mean, previously you had indicated that the reserve releases would come down and that
you'd be able to keep the motor combined ratio broadly ﬂat because the accident year
loss ratio would be improving to help to oﬀset that. And clearly, that hasn't happened in
H1. We've got the loss ratio, the pure loss ratio getting around ﬁve or six points worse
year-on-year at H1. So could you just clarify kind of what your expectation is around the
motor combined ratio, please?

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Yes. I'm not exactly clear that we did guide that we would oﬀset with a better pure ratio,
the reduction in releases. I think what we said was, a mixture of the growth in the panel,
the quality of the underwriting, those two things put together would oﬀset. So I think
that's not what we are saying today and I'm not convinced that that may have been how
we guided before.
And you wanted to clarify the other elements of the question, around there's a (42:10)
deterioration from H1 last year to H1 this year?

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Yes.

FINAL

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

I mean, that's very straightforward. The outlier here is H1 last year; we wrote at a speciﬁc
level at 97% and when that earns through on our pretty conservative basis, that will give us
an excellent underwriting result in terms of pure ratio, but it will not give us a great
balance of volume and value. So in the second half of last year, we speciﬁcally took
actions in order to get that balance right and we've continued that into H1 of this year,
getting the right balance between volume and value. We are writing at 103% in the ﬁrst
half of the year, which we would expect to earn through signiﬁcantly better as we have still
maintained a cautious approach in terms of underwriting.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

I mean, perhaps just a – I mean, is thee – I think we got a diﬀerence of opinion about what
was said at – over IPO on that particular point. But is mid-80s kind of combined ratio on
the motor, is that still where you see an all-in kind of level?

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Two years ago, we were at the upper 80s level. I think we're at 87, we're last year at 77.
We've indicated something similar for this year. I would expect us to move back towards
where we were two years ago.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Thank you. And my third question then is just on the kind of customer growth. I mean, you
got the number of active customers and the contacts or names on the database. I guess I
would have expected those to have grown a little bit more, H1. I mean, they are operating
modestly versus full year. Could you just talk about what you're doing to increase those
numbers, please?

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

If you look back on average, over a decade, we grow at about 400,000 net customers per
annum, and we did that again last year. It does tend to oscillate slightly with the state of
the motor market. When there's a lot of churn, we get a lot of quotes and therefore, we
add extra names into the database. When the market's more suppressed, we pick up
fewer.
And then the other big driver for us is travel insurance, where we bring in a lot of
customers through that as well. It varies all the time. And we've hit the 11 million names
mark on the database. It's partly about continuing to grow that proportion, but it's also
about what you do with the 11 million names. And that's where I think things are going to
get exciting over the next year or two.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

So 400,000 a year increases?

You'd expect it to remain the case?

FINAL

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

It's hard to predict this early but it should be roughly in that order. I think we've had years
where we've been as low as 300,000 and as high as 450,000 – in that kind of bracket.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. Dhruv Gahlaut, HSBC. I've got a couple of questions. Firstly, just thinking
with this reserve releases, could you say what your reserve margin is or when you are
reserving, what is the excessive of the best estimate that you reserve for? Or – I also – have
you changed the reserving methodologies and have you been reserving with a similar
margin in this year vis-à-vis last year?
Secondly, on Solvency II, could you also say then what is the outstanding issues left for
you guys, as in, if you could talk a bit in terms of what do you feel your level of capital is
there? And also, I appreciate you guys are regulated by the FSC rather than the PRA, so
are you – do you have to have any discussions with the PRA as well in terms of the
structure, et cetera, or is that FSC pretty much who dictates? Thanks.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

We don't – I'll just answer the second of those ﬁrst. We don't obviously have any
discussions with PRA. We are at advanced discussion with the Gibraltar authorities. The
only technical thing we're waiting is the signoﬀ of the USP (45:52) which will come in early
Q4. Then we're done in terms of the process. The Gibraltar authorities have already
looked at our Solvency I and Solvency II ratios for the start of the year to the point at which
we paid our dividend and have asked to look at that for the year-end and they are
comfortable and we are comfortable that there is a substantial buﬀer within the
calculations. Hopefully that deals with the Solvency II question.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

Well, have you said in terms of where you are expecting your ratios (46:18) model or...?

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Page 16 of 25



Company Name: Saga PLC

We haven't said that; we haven't come out speciﬁcally with that at this stage. In terms of
your ﬁrst question...

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

FINAL

Reserve margin.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

We said at that time of IPO that we had circa 15% reserve margin. We have said at the
year-end that we were not fundamentally diﬀerent from that position. We have not given a
speciﬁc number. We expect this year-end what we have said is to be consistent with last
year-end and therefore we will be roughly consistent with where we were at the time of
IPO. So we are not changing our approach in any sense to the reserve margin in the
business.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

But I'm assuming the way you've coming down in terms of the overall reserve, the pound
number should be coming down now because I think you are doing a lot of reserve
(47:08)...

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

At some point, it may do and that will depend on the book and where the book goes as
well. So I think we need to see how that develops. If we see a market where we have an
increase in our underwriter, we shall see how that aﬀects the book and therefore what
happens to that reserve surplus.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

Thanks.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Nick.

Q - Nick Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Morning. Nick Johnson from Numis. Two questions. Firstly on home, can you just give a
bit more detail, please, on how you have achieved the revenue growth despite reduction
across the numbers? Is that purely diﬀerence between panel pricing and Saga services?
Just trying to get a handle on that dynamic and whether we should expect that trend to
continue. And also, is it logical for that trend to go in the other direction if home rates start
to increase? So that's the ﬁrst question.
And secondly, on the new ships, I was wondering if you could just quantify a bit in terms
of what you expect the impact on revenue per passenger to be and also impact on
margins from the lower cost of the new ships? Just trying to get a handle on what sort of a
quantum of EBITDA uplift per ship we should be thinking about. Thanks.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Do you want to do home and I'll do ships?

FINAL

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Yes, I'd love to. Yes, you are absolutely right. This is all about the diﬀerence between the
growth rate and the panel rate we get. So we've been able to eﬀectively increase the
spread between those two, which has driven the revenue increase. Your question then
was, if the market increases, will we expect that to go the other direction in terms of
narrowing? That all depends on what we do in terms of those levers of volume and value
and that will come down to the market circumstances across our portfolio of diﬀerent
insurance products. So I don't think you would logically suggest that that will narrow over
time. It depends what we are trying to drive out of that business at that point.

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

On the ships, our business case is not predicated on a signiﬁcant increase in revenue per
passenger. What it's predicated on is a slight increase in passenger numbers, but a really
dramatic diﬀerence in the margin that we make per passenger day because fuel eﬃciency
is dramatically greater in a new ship than it is in a 35-year-old ship. Reliability, the amount
of time required for maintenance and so on are dramatically better. You also get itinerary
opportunities and so on, all of which will signiﬁcantly improve the margin that we make
per customer day.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Nick.

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

Thank you. Andreas van Embden, Peel Hunt. Just coming back to the motor panel, just a
quick question, whether you would consider integrating your own in-house insurance
company, AICL, within the panel or you're just becoming another member of the panel
and competing with the panel. Is there anything that would sort of hold you back in doing
that over time?

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

In fact that's exactly what we've done. AICL is on the panel. It's on a level playing ﬁeld with
the other panelists. That's exactly how it behaves with home insurance on the panel, what
we have there, and it has to ﬁght for its own market share.

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

So the panel members will be openly competing with your in-house insurances?

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Correct, absolutely.

Company Name: Saga PLC

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Exactly as we do today on home.

FINAL

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

And what we ﬁnd with experience in the home panel for example is that AICL, because of
its in-depth understanding of a tight part of the market, wins a lot of share in that area
because it just knows more about how to price risks for the core cause of the customer.
But that it's less eﬃcient as we move further away from that core which is where the other
underwriters get a chance to win and gives us a chance to win market share.

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

So, you don't fear any cannibalization within that sort of footprint...?

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

If somebody is willing to provide risk to or set a lower (51:00) price and we can hold less
capital because of that within our underwriter, then that is what we shall do. We shall take
the increased proﬁtability and not take the risk on our own book. That is the only way you
can run a panel to make people want to join it for a start. And secondarily, if we can do
this through broking and make it as broking margin, we will do that.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

When that happens we'll make proﬁt essentially because we get the risk underwritten for
less.

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

So, have you thought about the margin beneﬁts you're going to get by doing this?

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Well, that will – sorry, that will...

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

So, you had a big margin beneﬁt in home, so...

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

That will all depend on how competitive, how quickly the panel becomes, whether we see
individual panel members wishing to win market share. It's very diﬃcult to speciﬁcally
quantify that. What you will see is a written to earn beneﬁt from eﬀectively going from an
underwritten business to having more of a broker business, because clearly we'll
recognize – we recognize the underwritten business over a – on a twelfth basis (52:00)
and we'll recognize the broker business as it is written. So, you will get a proﬁt uplift from
that eﬀect as we go forward. That is a primary end-point that you will see within the
numbers as we go into next year.

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

Thanks. Thanks very much. Ben Cohen at Canaccord. Just the ﬁrst question, just following
on from that, could you just say more about how the on-boarding expectation of the new
panel members has gone relative to your expectations six months ago maybe against the
home panel as well and maybe the incremental kind of beneﬁt you expect to get when
we're – in a year's time that's set?
And the second thing was on the Investment Services, again, now that you're sort of
starting the launch, I appreciate it's not fully rolled out. Can you give us any update in
terms of the addressable market for you, any kind of ﬁnancial metrics that you're looking
towards for that business even just in terms of who you think you're going to take share
from as you launch? That would be helpful. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Sure. So, taking this in order, the on-boarding process for the motor panel has been a lot
more straightforward for us than the home one was ﬁve years ago because we've done it
before. So, both from a process point of view and from an IT point of view, there is a lot of
knowledge that we could reapply this time.
We also have the huge advantage that a number of the underwriters who are joining the –
have joined or are joining the panel already worked with us on the home panel. So, they
know how the systems work, but they've also learned to trust the data because we give
quite a lot of information to underwriters to help them price risk accurately. We know a lot
about our customer base that other insurers don't know. And they've learned over ﬁve
years in the home panel that those data are extremely valuable to help them price
accurately. So, they trust us already.
So, broadly, we hit the milestones that we're expecting to hit. We intended to launch midsummer and we have. We hoped that we'll have two or three panelists by now, we do. I
mentioned earlier on that we're expecting another two to three by year-end and they're
all on track to sign up. It's just getting the IT plugged in. But, again, we've done this
before. I'm expecting another two or three next year.
So, we're very comfortable with where we've got to. Now, we have to learn, if you like, to
operate the panel with the underwriters. And that is something you will see evolve over a
period of years. We're still ﬁve years in with the home panel, are learning how to achieve –
to ﬁne-tune it to get the maximum possible returns from it.

The restriction here is the speed with which the third-party insurers can get into an IT slot
in their own companies to link in. So, we've set the platform up. It's working. It's just a
case of when they can get a slot to do the changes to enable them to come into our

Bloomberg Transcript

On Saga Investment Services, I can't say a huge amount because some of its still being
formed and some of its very conﬁdential. We are on track to launch by the end of the year
of our database of 11 million. We've done the cuts within the database. We know exactly
who we're targeting when we're ready to launch. There's a substantial proportion of
customers that look attractive to us. Remember also that we have 200,000 customers who
bought Saga shares, so we have an open dialog with them already in the context of
investing. And at the time they bought those shares, they shared with us quite a lot of
information about their personal ﬁnancial circumstances.
We have 180,000 customers who have credit cards with us. We've got £5.5 billion worth
of savings in our savings account. So, this is a territory where we actually know quite a lot
within our database about customer needs, behaviors and so on. And we're reﬁning the
proposition at the moment. I've got a reasonable feel for what we go live with at the end
of the year. However, the market changes all the time as you all know and we're watching
it closely to make sure than when we launch we've got a really exciting and competitive
story to tell and I believe we will.
I'm afraid I'm just not in a position to give you market share estimates and so on. What I
can tell you is the two core metrics that we will track above and beyond any others our
customer satisfaction. Remember that Saga doesn't go into these markets just to win
short-term volume and try and get money from people. What we do is part of the multidecade relationship with individual customers. So, we are going into that market to
delight the customer and that's number one for us.
Then number two will be assets under management, funds under management, how fast
does that grow. And of course, we'd run various projections on how fast it might grow,
but we just don't know. And our colleagues across Tilney Bestinvest, who has been in this
market for many years, they don't know either. What we do think is that what we're going
to bring to market is a really exciting proposition and should achieve some cut through.
Who hasn't we heard from yet? Anyone who's not asked, otherwise we go back around
again, Ravi?

for a couple of months next year and that would impact the Travel business. Can you give
us some kind of quantum in terms of should we think about the proﬁtability of each cruise
ship as being broadly equal and just take it through for a couple months or – and how do
we think about that in the context does that impact the longer-term Travel EBITDA
guidance that you've given at all?
And then just the second one was just the number of underwriters that you have on the
motor panel, up maybe eight, nine, 10 versus 16, 17 (57:58) on the home panel. I was just
wondering if there's any reasoning behind the number that you'd have on the panel.
You've said that more is better, generally.

Sure, happy to take those. So, ﬁrstly, think of the shipping business as growing with little
lumps in the road each time a ship goes into reﬁt or needs work done. The inevitability
with the ship is that it every few years, has to go in to dock for a couple months for
ongoing maintenance. And therefore, you will make less revenue and proﬁt in that year. It
absolutely does not impact on the long-term goals of the Travel business. This is – now,
one of the advantages of new ships is that they go into maintenance much less often and
for shorter, so you can get several years of growth from them before they have to go back
into reﬁt.
Second question around underwriters, we do expect to get something in the order of
nine or 10 underwriters on that panel eventually and that is fewer than the 16 or so – 17, I
think, now that we have on the home panel. And the reason for that is that there are fewer
players in the motor underwriting space. In home, there are some deep specialists who
focus on individual areas and those equivalents don't really exist in motor. What we know
is that once we get four or ﬁve or so, we start to get some real critical mass and
competitive pressure.

Dhruv Gahlaut, HSBC. So I had just one follow-up. In terms of the investment, somewhere
you mentioned that you might be loading the risk proﬁle of the investment portfolio you

have. Could you talk a bit more in terms of what changes are you thinking of making on
the investment portfolio?

FINAL

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Yeah, sure. We've got it. You'll see in the document a breakdown of the investments we
have. There are some of those which are and below A-rated investments under the
Solvency II. Obviously, you have to hold additional capital, about 25%, on the higher risk
assets. And we will – we've looked at that and determined that actually the best way to do
it is to move into a lower risk set of assets, de-risk the portfolio, take us marginally lower
investment return, but hold less capital in the underwriter.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

This is James Shuck at UBS. Two follow-up questions, please. Just on the sale of Allied,
you talk about what you're planning in terms of reducing the debt leverage to 1.5 to 2
times. Obviously, that doesn't have anything to do with the quantum of the debt. I'm just
interested to know what you plan to do with the proceeds from Allied. That's my ﬁrst
question, please. Is it possible you look at doing some form of special dividend perhaps?
And then secondly, private equity has a history of under investing in companies before
bringing them to market. Your messaging around the cruise ship is a bit diﬀerent from my
interpretation at the full year numbers, which was that you're looking to add incremental
numbers of ships to your – you were saying two, so I always thought two might go to three
rather than two staying at two.
So, my question is really a broader one, and that is when you – Lance, when look at the
business, is your feeling that it has been under-invested for a number of years and that
you're going to need to invest in a number of innovative style things, whether that's
digital technology or in addition to looking at new revenue streams? Is the IT
infrastructure and the digital capability really there for now?

A - Jonathan Stanley Hill

{BIO 16892113 <GO>}

Yeah. In terms of the Allied point, you should not – we have announced that the National
Living Wage has had an impact on the whole of the care market. You should not assume a
signiﬁcant return in terms of the sale of that business. We wrote it down to zero. I wouldn't
be putting in your models a signiﬁcant amount of money for the return on that business.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

So, it should still be tens of millions that which...

We will see what happens at the end of the process. And when we ﬁnalize the process,
we'll come back to you and tell you what we're going to do with the proceeds. But I
wouldn't assume that given the size of the debt at £536 million, it's going to be material
relative to that.

FINAL

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

On your second question, private equity under-investment, I don't accept that premise in
this case. We operate two ships aged in their 30s. It is inevitable that we will have to
replace those ships at some point. And I think we've always ﬂagged very, very clearly that
we would make a decision on that in the next couple of years. We've reached that point
now and we've announced the replacement of the ﬁrst of those ships. I don't think that
really relates in any way to the previous ownership structure of the business.
And indeed, when I look across the business as a whole, I don't think it has been
systemically underinvested in over the years. There will always be some investment needs
for us on an ongoing basis in IT and so on, but we are an asset-light and asset-eﬃcient
business. The ships are the only meaningful capital we have on the balance sheet and it's
time to refresh the ﬁrst of those.

In terms of the IT, I think our IT is actually in good shape. I've been coming from the
outside and looked at it afresh. I think we're in good shape there. There is some
investment in digital to be done, but it's in single millions, rather than tens of. So, I don't
think we're in a bad shape at all.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

You got a new Chief Digital Oﬃcer, could you just talk a little bit about what he's being
charged with?

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

I'd rather leave that to the prelims, if I may, by which time, we'll be able to give you a
multi-year strategic focus on where we're going with digital, with one-on-one marketing
with the kind of long-term relationship build for each individual customer. That's a major
stream of work for us that I'd like to talk about in six months' time.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Great. Thank you.

A - Lance Henry Batchelor

{BIO 6884486 <GO>}

Thanks, James.
I can see another question trying get out there. Anyone else – anyone we haven't heard
from who'd like to – okay. I think we're done. Thank you very, very much for your attention.
Nice to see you all again.
