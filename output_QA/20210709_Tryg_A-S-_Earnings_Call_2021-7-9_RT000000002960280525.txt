Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Good morning everybody, my name is Gianandrea Roberti. I am Head of Investor
Relations at Tryg. We published our Q2 results earlier on this morning, and I have here
with me Morten Hubbe, our Group CEO; and Barbara Plucnar Jensen, Group CFO. Just
with these few words over to you Morten.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you Gian, and warm welcome also from my side. We start on Slide 3 with the
highlights of the second quarter. Be aware in this quarter, of course, that most of the
numbers are Tryg Classic and are only in a few selected investment lines you can see data
from RSA.
We show on the left-hand side, a pre-packed Classic result of almost DKK1.3 billion for the
second quarter. And as planned as previously, communicated, we're seeing FX hedge
with a negative impact of DKK1.2 billion under investments in the quarter, and we see a
consolidation of RSA and Nordic only for one month's earnings and also under the
investment line.
Generally, we are very pleased to see a technical result, which is up almost 8% to DKK1.144
billion. The result of a very good top-line growth and improved underlying claims and the
delivery of Alka synergies.

FINAL

If you look at the investments, again the Classic investment line is plus DKK253 million
and this is then here we subtract the impact of the FX hedge and add the positive of one
month of equity accounting, so, one month of earnings from what we have acquired
including 50% stake of Denmark. Then we announced a dividend, not surprising of
DKK1.07 as guided for the quarter, resulting in a 175 solvency well in line with the previous
communication of an expectation between 170 and 180.
On Slide 4 we show the customer highlights. You may recall, in Q1 we mentioned a new
method for measuring customer satisfaction. We're very pleased to see that customer
satisfaction improves further from 83 to 84, and the advantage of the new method is that
we can measure both individual touchpoints, for instance, buying insurance, and the full
process from start to ﬁnish, for instance, claims handling. We do get signiﬁcantly more
responses with the new methodology. We get all touchpoints. And actually, that's quite a
lot of variation. So for instance beneath the 84, we see that the single contact on the
telephone in private Denmark has a score of 94 whereas a full process in commercial
Norway has a score of 74. So this new methodology provides a ton of new data that will
allow us to further improve customer satisfaction from a very high starting point.
On Slide 5, we elaborate on the technical results, very pleased that it increases almost 8%
to DKK1.144 billion in the quarter, of course helped by higher premium and also the
improved underlying claims. Really pleased to see that all business areas delivered a
strong performance and particularly private and commercial SME space.

Bloomberg Transcript

Corporate in Sweden continues to improve but for us, is really quite clear that the
proﬁtability initiatives in corporate needs to continue.
And on Slide 6 for the ﬁrst time we add information about the performance of the new
acquired business, assuming in only on Trygg-Hansa in Sweden and Codan in Norway. Be
aware that here we show both the half year numbers and the June month numbers. The
June month numbers is, of course, what ﬂows into the equity accounting under the
investment line together with half of Codan Denmark, together with investments, but
actually, we thought we would add the half-year ﬁgures because that actually gives a
better ﬂavor of the well-being of the businesses we've bought. So will allow you to
monitor the business performance better.
And we're really pleased to see strong performance in the businesses we've bought in
Sweden and Norway. Top-line in Sweden and Norway growing around 3.3% and then we
see a very, very strong combined ratio in Trygg-Hansa, Sweden of 76.4% for the six
months numbers, and then a combined ratio of Codan Norway of 88.2% for the half year.
But bear in mind, of course, a smaller portfolio in Norway, which will be more volatile.
But all-in-all, it means that the acquired businesses produce an insurance technical result
of DKK1.1 billion for the ﬁrst six months. Again, remember that only June is ours, but it tells
you the story of very, very strong businesses with very strong performance, and of course,
the zero synergies included in those numbers for the ﬁrst six months.

On Slide 7, we give a brief update on COVID, hopefully we won't be doing that for much
longer, but the social impact for the quarter is positive mainly due to lower level of travel
claims. We also see a couple of other areas like, break-ins [ph] that has had lower claims.
Then we have seen also somewhat higher level of motor claims both due to the growth in
private business, but also we see for instance in Q2 that after period where people have
not repaired their windscreens and they've waited during COVID, we see an unusual jump
upwards in for instance glass claims in motor in the quarter, but actually will then start to
normalize we believe the rest of the year.
On Slide 8, we elaborate on shareholders return. As I mentioned, we're paying out
DKK1.07 per share in the quarter as guided, and as guided, this will be the pattern for all
quarters this year, and despite the transition year that 2021 is and with the transaction
costs and with the restructuring cost, FX hedge, et cetera. As communicated, we expect
the technical results to roughly double by 2024, and we expect the dividends to follow
roughly the same trajectory and of course we look forward to a signiﬁcant increase in our
dividend.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then following the announcement of the sale of Codan Denmark, we announced a
DKK5 billion buyback, which will start next year in connection with the actual closing of
that transaction. And it shows our strong commitment to returning capital and to improve
the ROI of the deals further.
On Slide 9, we show the current status of the Alka synergies, and very pleased to see
continued strong delivery according to our plan. We see Q2 synergies of DKK35 million
bringing the half year to DKK63 million and bringing the total up to DKK239 million of the
DKK300 million announced. And we're very conﬁdent that we'll deliver the full DKK300
million by the year end. And we have learned a lot and the methodology, and the
process, and the responsible is proving very important also in the RSA process.
And if we move on to Slide 11, we elaborate on the composition of the top-line growth.
Total growth is 4.7% in Q2 and that is 7.1% before bonus and premium rebates. Very
pleased to see that our highest growth comes from the business areas with the highest
proﬁtability. We see the private as the most proﬁtable area has a growth of 5% after bonus
and premium rebates and 8.6% before bonus and premium rebates. You can see the
diﬀerence between the two numbers are -- is higher than usual. We see some spillover
impact of bonus and premium rebates that actually belong to Q1 that actually impact Q2
negatively. We're trying to avoid this but with the fast closing of the quarter, not all partner
contracts have been ﬁnalized when we do the closing of the quarter, so it's probably not
possible to fully avoid spillover from quarter-to-quarter, and when result are very strong,
of course, there is a strong sharing of that with the partners as well.
And then we're quite pleased to see that sales and the market is starting to normalize. We
have seen a period where particularly in Denmark the sale of new cars with the car
dealers has been lower than normal. Actually 40% of our inbound calls is new cars, the
new vehicle [ph] insurance and that has been subdued due to Corona but now
normalizing. And then of course, the purchase of travel insurance has been subdued, but
from May to June the sale of travel insurance is actually up 43% pointing to a world that is
gradually normalizing.

FINAL

In commercial, we see a growth of 8.1%, really positive, also an area with strong
proﬁtability. In Denmark, this is largely organic growth, in Norway it is largely price
increases. And then you see a roughly ﬂat growth in corporate, growth is not a target in
corporate stronger earnings is, so we're working hard with high price increases and that is
then oﬀset by sharing of the business resulting in a ﬂat development. Sweden, a growth of
2.4%, which is primarily price increases.
On Slide 12, we show the development in average prices, and clearly staying up-to-date
with price changes to match inﬂation is extremely important, Barbara will elaborate further
on that. This is a very, very high area of focus and in recent years, we've managed to
improve and professionalize our methodology. So I would say that today we are above
average in the insurance industry. Clearly, Alka has helped us in that process with
methodology and data, and we can see that particularly Trygg-Hansa in Sweden can
further help us improve this area.
In general, our price increases are following a healthy pattern, but bear in mind in Q2 last
year, there was a price drop in house insurance prices for large partner in Norway, still
impacting Q2 numbers this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then on Slide 13, we show the positive trend in retention levels. We've seen some
quarters where private lines had a slight drop in Denmark because of the churn of Nordea
customers. The retention in Denmark is improving in Q2, and we're seeing that the churn
of Nordea customers is more than oﬀset by the new Danske customers, but of course they
don't account in the retention numbers.
We're pleased that in Private Norway, that we have a continued increase in retention, and
also on Commercial retention we see stability in Norway and an improvement of 0.2
percentage points in Denmark. So, over to you, Barbara.

Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Morten. If you turn to Slide 15, you can see the development in the
underlying claims ratio. For group, this improved by 80 basis points in the quarter, while it
was unchanged for Private. Please note that the underlying claims ratio doesn't include
the impact from COVID-19 claims.
Price adjustments and the claims excellence program, including claim synergies related to
Alka are the main drivers behind the improvement. Also, bear in mind that the growth in
private has a positive impact on group ﬁgures even with a ﬂat development in the
underlying claims ratio for Private as Private is the most proﬁtable in Tryg.
The high growth in the Private business had, as expected, a modest negative impact on
the underlying claims ratio as new customers in general have a frequency approximately
3% higher than the portfolio in general. We are very satisﬁed that the initiatives in our
corporate areas and commercial Norway supports the improved underlying claims ratio
development for the group of 0.8, which is similar to the previous quarter.

FINAL

On Slide 16, we address a key topic at the moment that Morten also just mentioned,
namely claims inﬂation. As mentioned before, Tryg beneﬁts from having worked with
procurement for many years. Our procurement agreements as well as our diligent work
with our specialists in key areas of the claims handling team, makes it possible for Tryg not
to be hit by claims inﬂation in the same way as many of our competitors.
As you can see on the top-right corner of this slide, we have a very strong internal focus
on coordinating and collaborating across the whole value chain around our claims, in
order to help us understand the drivers of the claims development and prepare price
adjustments when needed.
Please turn to Slide 17. Life in the Nordics is still impacted by COVID-19, albeit signiﬁcantly
less than what we have seen in previous quarters. In Q2 '21, the total impact from COVID19 was DKK32 million, primarily related to property and travel insurance. Lower motor
frequencies also had a positive impact although to a lesser degree than what we have
seen in previous quarters.

Bloomberg Transcript

On Slide 18, we take a look at large claims, weather claims, and run-oﬀ. The level of large
claims was DKK105 million in the second quarter, which was higher compared to the
same quarter last year, but was still lower than a normalized level that we expect around
DKK140 million. Weather claims were slightly higher in the second quarter compared to
second quarter of '20, with DKK57 million in this year compared to DKK49 million last
year, and closer to normal levels as Q2 in general is the quarter with the lowest level of
weather claims.
The discounting impact in the second quarter was somewhat higher than the same period
prior year, due to increased interest rate levels. And ﬁnally, the run-oﬀ result was
somewhat higher with 4% in the second quarter of this year compared to 3.6% in the
second quarter last year, very much in line with the communication of run-oﬀ between 3%
to 5% for the year.
On Slide 19, we take a look at the expense ratio. In Q2 this was 14.1% slightly lower than
the comparable period last year. We want to invest in our business and by a continuous
focus on ﬁnding more eﬃcient distribution channels we tend to a larger group [ph]
ﬁnancing these IT investments. In the second quarter, a slightly higher number of
employees is driven by among other things, the higher business volume and also
resources needed to deliver development in IT and digitalization.
Please turn to Slide 21. As usual, you can see the split of Tryg's standalone investment
assets, where we are reporting total invested assets of approximately DKK44.6 billion split
between a free portfolio of DKK12.6 billion and a match portfolio of around DKK32 billion.
For more details on the investment income in itself, I want you to turn to Slide 22. Here
you can see more details on the Tryg's standalone investment result. In the second
quarter, ﬁnancial markets developed positively and Tryg reported good returns from
equities, properties and corporate bonds. The overall return on the free portfolio was

Page 5 of 22

FINAL

2.5% and the match portfolio was also slightly positive, while other ﬁnancial income and
expenses included slightly higher interest expenses and some quarterly periodization.
The chosen asset allocation has not changed much for a while. As Morten mentioned
earlier, it is important to note that in this quarter, the investment result was impacted by
the negative charge of approximately DKK1.2 billion related to the currency hedge put in
place to hedge the proceeds for the RSA acquisition and also a positive amount of
DKK181 million from the one month result of RSA Scandinavia since we closed the deal on
the 1st of June. Adding these three items, overall, the P&L reported investment income
therefore lands at a negative DKK757 million, but bear in mind it's very much driven by the
one-oﬀ items.
I will also use the opportunity to remind you that until demerger, the earnings from RSA
Scandinavia will be included in our investment income as it is taken in as equity
accounting. After demerger, the results will be fully consolidated into our ordinary
reporting.

Bloomberg Transcript

Please turn to Slide 23 on solvency. The solvency ratio as reported was a record-high 899
at the end of Q1, but obviously a more meaningful 180 when we adjusted for the rights
issue. At the end of Q2, we are reporting 175, right in the middle of our previous guidance
for end Q2 of between 170 to 180. We now expect a full year '21 solvency ratio at
approximately 180, slightly higher than what we previously guided.
Both own funds and the SCR are now included in -- now include the RSA Scandinavia
asset. The main movements in the own funds are shown in this chart and it's fairly clear
that as expected the inclusion of the RSA asset is the main drag on the own funds of
approximately DKK28 billion. Furthermore, own funds are impacted by the increased
eligible debt and the quarterly results and dividends. The SCR is also impacted by the
inclusion of Codan SCR, which is close to DKK4.8 billion, meaning that the SCR for the
entire group is now equal to approximately DKK9.9 billion.
Finally, it is important to remember that Tryg's solvency ratio mostly remains a function of
proﬁts and dividends, and hence, the underlying development should be stable.
On Slide 24, we're showing the additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capacity after the inclusion of
the new assets. Please remember that group SCR will decrease by approximately DKK1
billion once Codan Denmark is out of the picture, meaning that the Tier 2 capacity will be
approximately DKK500 million lower compared to what is shown here.
On Slide 25, we're sharing the main components of our SCR and the main components of
the market risk in the SCR. It should not be a surprise that equities due to the high capital
charge and spread risk due to a high proportion of covered bonds in our asset mix shows
the highest market risk charge.
On Slide 26, you see the historical development of the solvency ratio and for end Q2 the
solvency ratio is as mentioned, 175. For the year end '21, we expect this to be around 180,

Page 6 of 22

Date: 2021-07-09

FINAL

and in a year where we have closed a, for Tryg, [ph] a very large transactions with many
movements, we believe this to be a comfortable level.
On Slide 27, we show the solvency sensitivities as usual, which are broadly unchanged
compared to what you have seen before. The only change this time is that the ﬁgures are
pro forma, including the new asset and hence, the new starting point is of course, the
reported solvency ratio of 175%. The highest sensitivity remains unchanged to the spread
risk as covered bonds are by far the largest asset class.
This concludes my part of the presentation and I will hand back to Morten, to provide
latest outlook.

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you. Barbara. And rounding oﬀ, Slide 28, we show the outlook, where Monday this
week, 5th of July, we increased our guidance for the technical result for the year. So from
previously guidance of DKK3.3 billion to DKK3.7 billion to a new guidance of DKK3.5
billion to DKK3.8 billion. So very pleased with that. And today, we update our investment
guidance for the full year from previously DKK350 million to DKK500 million, to now
DKK450 million to DKK550 million. And also, a negative adjustment to guidance, other
income and costs actually related to the acquisition from minus DKK150 million to
DKK200 million to now minus DKK200 million to DKK300 million. And you will also
notice a few modest adjustments to the overall cost of RSA, but leaving the total
unchanged at DKK4.4 billion. And then, hopefully, you've all seen the Capital Markets Day
date and announcement of that for the 16th of November this year. Clearly hoping that we
will all meet in person, that is the plan.
And then ﬁnally, on Page 25 -- 29, we ﬁnish with our favorite quote from John D.
Rockefeller. Really pleased that we have an outlook for a very strong technical result by
2024 and a dividend trajectory, which will follow that path. And also, very pleased that
when we look at what we have acquired Trygg-Hansa Sweden and Codan Norway.
Standalone they made one point -- or more than DKK1.1 billion of technical result for the
ﬁrst six months of this year, before any synergies.
And while only June is ours then clearly that gives us yet another set of data showing very
strong quality in the businesses we've acquired. We look forward to the integration and
we look forward to adding the synergies between now and 2024.
I think with that, we'll turn over to your questions.

from Nordea. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Thank you very much and good morning from my side. First, question on solvency and
the capital gain related to the sale of Codan Denmark, could you maybe start by telling us
how should we look at this, i.e., the capital gains compared to the sales price please? So
what is it booked in your accounts?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I think as a starting point, it's -- the sale of Codan doesn't change any of our numbers at
this point in time that will be impacting the numbers once the deal is closed, Jakob, and
at that point, we will give you further details in terms of exactly how it will impact. But for
now, it doesn't change. You can say the numbers that we're looking at.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I understand that, but you did disclose a DKK5 billion expected share buybacks next year
after the sale has happened. So I'm just trying to reconcile that. So if we take consensus
have a DKK4 billion ordinary dividend for next year, and roughly DKK4 billion net proﬁt if
you adjust for amortization of intangibles, so that evens out, so still 180% solvency at the
end of next year then DKK1 billion reduction in SCR that adds 20 percentage points
around DKK2 billion. So I'm just wondering how you get to the last DKK3 billion, I would
have thought it was somewhat more. So that --

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I think what you should remember Jakob is that we are saying approximately DKK5 billion
for the share buyback because obviously when you do a trade and a transaction like what
we have done with Codan, there is a number of outstanding items relating to opening
balances, et cetera, et cetera. And we don't have you can say the full visibility on that. And
that's why we are guiding approximately DKK5 billion, but that will be conﬁrmed when we
are a little further in the process.
So I'm sorry, I won't be able to give you more speciﬁc guidance I think your logic is right,
and those are the drivers that will be impacting the solvency. But I think, it's also fair to say
that there are still a number of outstanding items that we don't have visibility on that we
will give you more details on, when we come closer to these items.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

As you can see, Jakob, that is completely fair question. It's also quite unusual to announce
such a large buyback 10 months or whatever the number is in advance. And separating
the legal entities in the Nordics is one thing that has not been ﬁnalized yet. There are also
changes in accounting principles from their regime to our regime, and of course, we have
plans and visibility for all of that, but there are details and moving parts that will change
some of the numbers before we get to the ﬁnal outcome and that's why we've chosen to
give them an estimate and we will give you more information when we get closer.

FINAL

That's fair enough. And just one follow-up though. So would -- if I asked this way, would
you prefer, I assume that you would still have 180% solvency ratio, but would you maybe
prefer a slightly higher and then postpone some of the payout for the two following years
in the forecast period or is it simply a matter of all those details?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I like your question, Jakob. I think we are very committed to returning capital to our
investors, but as you also understand, there's a lot of complexity still involved in this. So I
think you should revert, so you can say our position of the history and the track record we
have of returning capital to our shareholders.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think, generally, Jakob, you should get the segue that it is the caution and a lot of
moving parts rather than a desire to sit on capital.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Of course. Thank you. Then the next question is a bit more on the detail side, but just
looking at consensus estimates for investment income when things get normalized, i.e.,
'23 and '24, it's around DKK400 million. But I would have thought that, let's say, that you
have a DKK9 billion SCR, when Codan Denmark has been divested, the solvency ratio of
around 180%. That's own funds of around DKK16 billion times the normal investment
return of around 1.5% at least that's what people use to have times the own fund so free
portfolio that gives only around DKK250 million. This is something that have changed that
would mean that we should not use total own funds as a proxy for the free portfolio, or is
there something else I'm missing?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

No. You should still look at the old principals applying. I think what I would say about
investment result is obviously we don't get -- you can say, our hands on the investment
assets until the time of demerger. And you can say, we need to adjust a little bit on the
investment proﬁle of the assets that we takeover. And that will obviously been something
that we try to do as fast as possible. But it will take some time to make sure that the
portfolio we take over, which is in total around DKK24 billion of which DKK6 billion is the
free portfolio that needs to be adjusted for it. So again, the principles totally agree to that,
more details to come a little later, Jakob.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay. And my last question -- thank you, is on other income and expenses in Tryg's
standalone, if I calculate backwards from the table you gave us on one of the ﬁrst pages it
was a DKK113 million negative this quarter, I know it's not a big deviation, but it's usually
around DKK70 million, DKK80 million. Is there any reason for this pickup and sort of be
that new level going forward? Or is it still the DKK70 million, DKK80 million per quarter in
Tryg's standalone?

Tryg's standalone you should see the ordinary level. If you remember in Q2, we paid an
existing loan and raised new capital and so forth. So you have some other things ﬂowing
through that you wouldn't see in an ordinary quarter. So I would look back at the ordinary
levels in future quarters.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

It's got a new level. We will reverse to the old level.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Asbjorn Mork from Danske Bank.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Yes, hi. Good morning from my side as well. My ﬁrst question basically on the underlying
claims ratio improving the 80 basis points in Q2, I'm fully aware of course, that the Alka
synergies are somewhat higher this year than the previous years. But at the same time,
Private has been unchanged. So maybe a little bit of wording on, ﬁrst of all, on the Private
side, should we expect an actual deterioration here going forward, considering the claims
inﬂation environment that we have at the moment and that kick in. I know you say that you
have the situation roughly under control, but I guess all things equal. There is a headwind
to some extent. And then of course, if not, if you're actually able to improve Private going
forward, I guess we should look at the 80 basis points as the new 50 basis points that
used to guide, or any comments around that would be highly valuable? Thanks.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you, Asbjorn. You're right that Private has been unchanged. And we still
believe that the areas where we will want to improve underlying the most. It's actually
cooperate and to some extent commercial -- particularly, commercial Norway. And we see
largely that when we can deliver fairly high top-line growth in Private with very attractive
combined ratio than the value creation of that for shareholders is very high.
On your question on whether we expect underlying for Private to deteriorate going
forward, because of inﬂation, I think that's a very relevant question. The short answer is,
no. We don't expect that. I think we will even see some periods where we have a positive
underlying in Private, not changing the pattern that we believe Commercial and
Corporate should be the main drivers of improvement, but there will be some periods
with improvement in Private as well.
And can you then just add that on top of the level of Commercial and Corporate? Not
necessarily because whichever way we turn it Commercial and Corporate is always a little
Page 10 of 22



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2021-07-09

bit more volatile than Private, so no, Private will not deteriorate, yes, Private will have a
slight positive in periods, but watch out that you don't just add that on top.

FINAL

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

But is it fair to assume that if Private goes from basically ﬂat to let's say, 20 basis points, 30
basis points improvement over time. Admittedly, yes, Corporate and Commercial will not
improve as much as they do right now, but wouldn't the net eﬀect then be largely neutral.
Hence, your 80 basis points should be rather sustainable going forward?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, I don't think we have a plan that the current level should deteriorate. So I think your
line of thinking that there is stability in that makes sense. And then over time, the
composition will vary and honestly the number will not be ﬁxed per quarter either, but the
logic that over time will continue to do this underlying improvements make sense that is
our logic as well. And then, of course, we're working hard to make sure that we stay at or
ahead of the inﬂation curve, but that is the outlook we have and that is what we're doing.

In that context Barbara mentioned, that the claims ratio is around 3 percentage points
higher for new customers, I guess your churn is just below 10%. So is it fair to assume that
the new customer inﬂow has around 30 basis points negative impact at the moment and
hence your underlying is on the existing custom basis is 30 basis points better than what
we see here?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I think, if you look at the new customers and the 3%, that's basically what we look at in the
ﬁrst couple of years in the customer journey with us or the customer lifetime value. So,
again, if you look at the growth we have experienced, it sort of comes in various steps
where you have a gradual inﬂow of new customer portfolios. If you think for instance that
the Norwegian customer base that has been impacted by, we took Veneto which has
given us a very strong inﬂow. Then after some time, you have seen an increase in
customers and business from the car channel enter.
Last year, we also show inﬂow by a number of customers that were previously with the two
companies that have their licenses we've gone. So you see a gradual inﬂow. So it's not
that you see an inﬂow day one. And then after a certain time, you can say now that's over
and that has a certain impact on the remaining top. Bear in mind that just this year, we
have had an inﬂow of almost 7,000 customers in the Norwegian Private business. So it is
something where we're obviously you have to see it in a slightly longer perspective than
just on a ﬁxed time with the impact that you highlight there.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think basically your calculation logic is right as per annum and then bear in mind that
you can calculate the diﬀerence in the normal inﬂow/outﬂow if there's a net-net growth of
zero customers that I think was your 30 basis point calculation. And of course, what you
Page 11 of 22

should add to that is if the growth is higher, so there's a net-net growth which would then
change your calculation slightly. And I guess both this year and the year before, we have
seen a net-net growth in Private both in Denmark and in Norway. So right logic, but I think
you need to add a little bit for the net-net growth.

FINAL

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

All right. Fair enough. On Slide 16, you have this very detailed slide on claims inﬂation and
how you monitor it. Could you give us a little bit more ﬂavor on you're saying all things
equal, how has it on a group level? How has the inﬂation environment that we are in at the
moment? How is that impacting your total claims ratio? All things equal if you don't
change the pricing. So what kind of basis point eﬀect are we talking about?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

A very good question and very relevant given what we see right now. I would more look
at what are the areas that are speciﬁcally impacted by the changing places the key right
now. That is very much in the property area, which accounts for about 18% of our claims
business. And there, you should also look at what is the claims inﬂation when it comes to
the raw material? And what is the claims inﬂation when it comes to encashment.
So there are, there are various dynamics underneath. So I think, in general, it is a question
of where do we see the claims coming in and how does that then see through, but given
the structure we have, which is very much the message in our presentation today. We are
not as impacted by a certain spike in the month or in a half year like you would see other
companies be, because ﬁrst of all we have longer tenure on the agreements that we have
with our suppliers and encashment that we work with. And then also, you can say, if you
look at the duration of our insurances then you would also see that it is relatively short tail
so by adjusting prices we will be able to take into account the potential inﬂation that is
impacting certain areas.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

But it's fair to say also that we've left behind completely the logic of working with an
overall inﬂation assumption. So now it is an extremely detailed bottom-up build, not only
by country and by line of business, but by components within that line of business,
whether that is a ﬁxed compensation or it is salary compensation inﬂation or it's material
inﬂation, et cetera, et cetera. So it is becoming a very, very large hierarchy of data with a
lot of variation from product to product.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

All right. Fair enough. So it seems like the risk at the moment seems isolate to 3%, 4% of
your total claims, is that the ballpark?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes, that's --

That's a wise summary.

FINAL

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

All right. Fair enough. And then on the Trygg-Hansa and Codan slide that you have. Just
really one question on Norway. I guess, I'm looking Sweden, there's a lot of reasons why
the combined ratio was slightly higher versus the ﬁrst half of last year and I don't know
how many details you have at the moment on the Norwegian business, but the
improvement there, can you give us a little bit of ﬂavor there, is this sort of the run rate we
should expect from Codan Norway ahead is that DKK100 million in technical proﬁts or
how should we look at that?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, I think if you look at the historical data and obviously, we don't have full access to
that data yet. So you will hopefully understand that we don't have the insight or level of
detail into that data yet, but what is quite clear when you look at the historical data is that,
Trygg-Hansa Sweden has been very stable with a very healthy combined ratio. When you
look at the Codan Norway, the combined ratio has been signiﬁcantly higher and longer
periods around a DKK100 million and slightly above a DKK100 million particularly with
very high cost ratio.
So when we see the improve or the delta between last year and this year for Codan
Norway, one driver is that there were more larger claims in the same period last year and
a more normalized level of large claims this year. The second is that we are now in a
period, where for several years they've worked with price increases, which is starting to
pull down the run rate. So I would say that what they saw last year is clearly above what is
the future run rate.
I would hesitate to say that what we see now is a new run rate. We're quite conﬁdent that
when we get the synergies through and we get the cost ratio level down, we will
approach an even stronger run rate than this. But standalone, I think that the stability is
not really there and that the combined ratio we see in the ﬁrst half and come in Codan
Norway is a little bit too ﬂattering to just we assume there's a new run-rate. So watch out, a
little bit even though the numbers are small.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

All right. Very clear. My ﬁnal question on Slide number 12 on the insurance pricing in
Norway, I'm just a bit surprised to see the house insurance pricing again ﬂat looking into
the, I guess potential claims inﬂation we have already talked about. So should we expect
that to trend upwards I know this competition but still, and of course, looking to the motor
insurance, where you see quite signiﬁcant repricing in Norway. So obviously, you are
getting some re-pricing through on the Private side there I supposed to, any comments
on the housing insurance?

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes. So the short answer is, yes. We do expect that to trend upwards. And the only reason
why house in Norway is not trending upwards, is there's one rather large adjustment,
actually a year ago in the house prices for one very, very large partner, the largest one we
have, and then the earned premium impact of that adjustment for that single partner is
what keeps the total ﬂat in house Norway. So ﬁrst of all, I believe that subsequently that
partners pricing on house will go up once again, and we are seeing in all of the other
areas of our portfolio in house Norway prices are going up. So it is really a large isolated
impact in the portfolio where all of the other customers are seeing increases and this
partner will see increases as well. So your expectation for the future is correct.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Per Gronborg from SEB. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes. Hello. Just a single question from me. Great, as we get some numbers on the
acquired business. Can you elaborate a bit on the development in Sweden, like you able
to do in Norway? I think the underlying numbers one-oﬀ large claims on cost?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes, we can do that. So I think it's positive to see if you start on the top-line that growth is
3.3%. I think, if you look at the past ﬁve years the average has been closer to 2%, so 3.3%
is closer to being the market growth. So I think that's one important area and we see that
both in the Private and in the Commercial SME space. Then we've seen a number of good
months in the ﬁrst half, but we also saw a period with Private lines in Sweden, where
weather claims were signiﬁcantly higher than planned.
So actually, if you take the individual months and actually also the impact on the full year,
we can see the underlying being very positive, both in private lines and in commercial
SME in Sweden. And then we can see a negative, a clear negative on weather impact
particularly in Private lines Trygg-Hansa Sweden. So it's a little bit combination of very

Page 14 of 22

strong underlying and then quite negative on weather and then I think fairly stable on
large claims in general. So mainly weather playing a role.

Late spring. Okay. Just one ﬁnal --

A - Morten Hubbe

This is the summary for the six months and therefore not split into the quarters as normal,

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

What about the prior year gains in Sweden? Any impact from those, are they at
unchanged level they were not last year?

A - Morten Hubbe

Yeah. Better much in Sweden. Forgot about that comment [ph]. Any changes to prior year
gains in Sweden?

No, I think, Per, in all fairness we have had the access to the business for one month and
next quarter, we will have a signiﬁcantly more insights, because there we have had the
business in full, but I think we'll leave it at those more generic comments and as Morten

was saying focusing on the half year and just giving us a very good comfort that what we
expected in terms of the business and the business result is actually what we see overall.
And then I think it's positive to see that also after being interacting with our new
colleagues in Sweden and Norway, we can see that there is a whole lot of areas that we
will be working on together going forward.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Generally have -- we have -- we haven't seen big moving parts on prior year's gains or
losses. I think the main volatile thought we've seen are these weather claims in the spring
around Stockholm.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. That explains why the numbers are trending in the wrong direction. I'll be not that
concerned about that. Just one ﬁnal question. Amortization of intangibles, it looks like you
won't start amortizing that before you consolidate the data designed by line, is that
correctly understood?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Correct. Remember that right now, we have them as we're taking them in by equity
accounting, they are an associated investments, and not until demerger where we have a

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. Just following up on the claims inﬂation questions. I guess, can
you provide us with a few more tangible examples by act [ph] of how you've achieved this
signiﬁcantly lower average claims for the motor? And how much of that advantage you
think is sustainable? And perhaps a follow-on to that is, do you think some of the smaller
players perhaps are ﬁnding this a bigger challenge and that's making you increasingly
competitive, is that a fair comment?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yes, I think that's absolutely a fair comment. I think we have been prioritizing this with our
procurement team and our claims team for a number of years now. So we have built
strong competences in the areas. It is something that requires that you are well equipped
also with technical experts in certain areas both in order to challenge and make sure that
you negotiate the right terms and use with year supply chain. But I think, what we have

demonstrated in the last couple of years and exactly like you see in the example with the
claims cost promoter, then it is something, where we believe that we are in a good
position.
I deﬁnitely believe that it is something that all our peers are also looking very much into,
because it is something where in particular in select areas like properties that we have
talked about today. It does have an impact and it does impact composition in terms of the
results and so forth. But we will focus on and you can see ensuring that our business is as
strong as possible and as much as possible in control in the area.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

We note as well that even some of our larger competitors has been trying and have been
stealing a few of our staﬀ in this area, so I believe that's probably because they are good
and our methodology is better than the industry. I think longer term we'll see that the tops
of the three, four players will become professional at this. And then exactly as you put it
the smaller players will struggle. And that is part of, I think the scale advantage with that
will allow the bigger players to perform in this area and make it more challenging to be
competitive as a small player.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Martin Gregers Birk from Carnegie.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Martin Gregers Birk

{BIO 19920552 <GO>}

Thank you so much. Two questions of my side. The ﬁrst one on Norway, where I believe
you book a check, the results of DKK388 million, I guess that's the highest technical
results. I have -- I can remember at least what's happening there? And then coming back
to your claims costs inﬂation slides. When we talk about price hikes, can you put any
elasticities on how much are you actually able to raise prices without seeing any notable
churn?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, if we take the ﬁrst question, gross margin. I think that we've seen, I think if you put
out the -- if you look at the data series in a longer time horizon clearly there is a bigger
diﬀerence between the summer quarters in Norway and the winter quarters in Norway
and we've seen in Denmark. And if you look at the combined ratio from Norway as a
country in Q2, we're seeing a combined ratio just around 79. So clearly a very strong
quarter for Norway. It should be a strong quarter given that its Q2, but we're also seeing
the fact that Commercial Norway starting to contribute more, we're seeing the Corporate
Norway is starting to contribute more and we see less volatility on large claims. So it's a
combination of underlying improvements, the summer quarter and then less large claims

Page 17 of 22



Company Name: Tryg A/S

FINAL

in the quarter. So hopefully we'll be seeing more quarters that are good in Norway going
forward, but probably still more volatility particularly between quarters.
I think on the pricing and elasticity, it's a little bit easier to see the elasticity question in a
private and SME context, where you largely see that as long as you're not above 5% of
price diﬀerences the reaction is very, very limited. And when you move to Corporate's it
does to a large extent also depend on what the rest of the market does. And I think what
we're seeing at the moment is to a large and larger extent that competitors particularly
Norway are increasing prices as well. We see in Denmark a little bit of more of a mixed
picture in terms of competitors pricing. But also, there was starting to see a tendency of
competitors increase in prices. So we've seen examples of price increases of more than
25%, 30% of corporate where the customers stay, but we've also seen price increases of
7%, 8% where the customer leaves.
So I wouldn't say that there's a sort of statistically clear pattern of elasticity on pricing in
corporate. And that's probably why we need to continue standing ﬁrm that we do the
price increases necessary and we accept what are consequences we'll see on the top line.
But of course, it is helpful that compared to the following suit particularly in Norway and
starting to see the same in Denmark.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Youdish Chicooree from
Autonomous. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. I have got three questions please. And the ﬁrst one, sorry to go
back again on this just on claims inﬂation, you have -- clearly you have procurement
agreements that protects you against the spike in claim inﬂation, but considering these
agreements will come up for renewal, is there risk of a large adjustment in the coming
year? And should you not be adjusting your prices today? So that's my ﬁrst question.
The second one is on claims frequency and coronavirus-related restrictions. I was just
wondering, have you seen a material change in frequency trends has -- some of the
restrictions have been eased and what are your expectations going forward? And then,
ﬁnally, a question on the Swedish business, your own Swedish business, I mean, the
results seems, I mean, they were down quite signiﬁcantly, year-on-year, and part of that
seems driven by run-oﬀ, so could you just give us some color on what's driving this,
please?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yes. I think, if we start with the claims inﬂation Youdish, I think when it comes to the
tenures of the agreement, I think it's important to understand that this is not just
Page 18 of 22



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2021-07-09

FINAL

something that beneﬁts us, it actually also beneﬁts the suppliers that we are working with,
because by having a counterpart like us when it comes to the claims handling it also
means that they have a more stable inﬂow of work activity and so forth, which is stabilizing
their own businesses.
So it is not something, where you should see this only has a beneﬁt for us in terms of
better pricing as we should see an increase, but it is actually also beneﬁting the
counterparts that we are working with in the various areas. And hence, because you have
that mutual -- you can say interest in having those agreements in place. It is also
something where we don't foresee that there will be a sudden large spike related to the
agreement when also renegotiating them.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

So I guess it's fair to Youdish, that don't expect sudden spikes, but we do ourselves
expect that some of them will have increases and we have built those assumptions into
the price increases we are doing and have been doing for a while. So I think we
completely agree with your logic, but we don't expect big spikes.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Got it. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

When it comes to the frequencies, I would say, related to COVID, what we have seen in
the last quarter is very much building on the trends that we saw in the second quarter
where you start seeing, you can say an increase in areas like health and dental insurance
and so forth. But also where we have a catch-up related to glass repairs in the Motor
segment, which is increasing the number of frequencies there in this particular quarter,
but we see that as a backlog that we are addressing right now.
Overall, we see that you can say the car claims outside the glass repairs as mentioned
they would typically follow the increased volume that we have in the area. Where we have
seen an increase as well and whether that is COVID-related or not is within pet, I think
everyone in the Nordics have seen an interest in getting cats and dogs so ﬁrst of all, we
have seen an increase number of policies, but is also an area where we see a slight
increase or actually quite an interesting increase in the level of claims on pets. But so far, it
is still a very small part of our business.
In general, I think you should expect which you can also see under COVID-19 impact that
we are getting back to more normalized level. What we assessed to be the COVID impact
in the quarter is around DKK32 million now. And I would expect that to gradually
decrease further going forward unless we see sudden new third waves or whatever might
happen over the course of the summer. Last question was around Sweden?

And the run-oﬀs? I think again, that is something where some of the areas where you have
the run-oﬀ is related to the motor area, where you have seen a slightly diﬀerent
development, which has supported the business in this particular quarter. I think, when
looking ahead, yes, I wouldn't sort of guide that this is a new level as such.

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks. I just have two, two small questions list. And the ﬁrst one is on the bonus
and the premium discounts. Of course, I realize it's not a negative thing that it's growing
from DKK150 million last year to DKK279 million in Q2 this year, but could you help up a
bit with what you expect for the remaining part of the year here? Will it come down in Q3
and Q4 or what should we expect here?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I think, as such we do guide on the bonus premiums. I think again, you should look at,
where does it impact, probably the majority is related to the Private business, and again,
we have seen a very strong performance somewhat also held in the ﬁrst quarter by
COVID-19, somewhat less in the second quarter, which is supporting the performance
there, and how that will look in the coming quarters depends and you can say whether we
will see any major impact again, but, yeah.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

In the current run-rate is a little bit higher than usual and the spillover is a little bit higher
than usual, but it is generally a reﬂection of strong performance in Private as you put it,
Barbara. So in periods where we deliver strong performance in Private, we will see an
elevated level of premium discounts, but the current level is a little bit high, I think we'll
have a little bit high level also the next couple of quarters, so -- but again reﬂecting a
positive underlying trends.
Personally I think it's a bit confusing that accounting-wise you need to subtract, a, what is
in a sense sharing some of the proﬁts comes up as a deduction in top-line is a slightly
challenging principal and that's why we try to give data on both before and after. So you
can monitor, what is the actual growth that the machine is delivering and then what is after
subtraction of what is essentially proﬁt sharing.

Yes. And thanks for giving that information. And then just a more high-level question.
Now, I think was asking about, I mean, perhaps a bit conservative buyback guidance or
indication for next year. Do you have any thoughts about normal buybacks? I mean, I
know you love your Rockefeller quote but I mean, could you, are you entirely against
having a part of your normal distribution as buybacks, how do you see that?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think, clearly our view is that a high level of returning capital to shareholders, it's
extremely important for us and we see that, that is extremely important for our
shareholders and for the value creation from the discipline of how we run the business. I
think as such for us it's not very important whether it is dividends or buybacks, but we get
a clear signal from most of our shareholders that dividends is preferred and that's why we
use a dividend as the typical route and we expect to continue to do that. If over time
investor sentiment changes and the preference for the split between dividends and
buybacks changes, then we will listen to our shareholders and the strategy willing to
change that, but as of now the signals we're getting from our shareholders is a very clear
preference for particular.
