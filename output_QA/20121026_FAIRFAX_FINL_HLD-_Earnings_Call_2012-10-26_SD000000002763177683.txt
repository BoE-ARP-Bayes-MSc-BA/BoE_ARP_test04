Good morning, Audra. Welcome to the conference call to discuss Fairfax's Third Quarter
results. The comments we make during this conference call may contain forward-looking
statements. Actual results may differ perhaps materially from those contained in such
forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of uncertainties and risk factors, the
most foreseeable of which are listed in Fairfax's Annual Report which is available on our
website and set out under Risk Factors in our Base Shelf Prospectus filed with Canadian
securities regulators. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa.

FINAL

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Fairfax's Third Quarter conference call.
I would like to give you some of the highlights and then pass it on to Dave Bonham, our
CFO, for additional financial details.
In the Third Quarter of 2012, book value per share was up slightly 1.7% from year-end
adjusted for the $10.00 per share common dividends paid out in the First Quarter of this
year. We have continued improved underwriting results on increased premiums as we
produced a small investment loss due to unrealized investment losses, related to our
defensive hedging strategy. We finished the quarter with cash and marketable securities
at the holding company of $967 million.
The consolidated combined ratio for Fairfax in the Third Quarter and the year-to-date was
95.4% and 97.1%, respectively.
Reserve redundancies were $38 million or 2.4percentage points on the combined ratio in
the quarter. We continue to reserve conservatively.

Bloomberg Transcript

As I have said in recent calls, we continue to grow our premiums. The large catastrophe
losses in 2011, very low interest rate and the reduced reserve redundancies means that
there is no bridge as high for the industry. Combined ratios have to drop well below 100%
for the industry to make a single-digit return on equities received low interest rates.
In the Third Quarter, net premiums written by our insurance and reinsurance operations
increased by 5.6% to $1.51 billion from $1.43 billion in 2011. At the subsidiary levels net
premiums in the Third Quarter of 2012 were as follows -- for Zenith, up 27.3%; Crum &
Forster, up 19.7%; OdysseyRe, up 6.1%; Fairfax Asia, up 8.2%; and Northbridge in Canadian
dollars down 5.5% after eliminating the nonrenewable of Northbridge's US property line
which was transferred to OdysseyRe.
Net investment losses of $23.6 million in the Third Quarter of 2012 consisted of the
following. Please note the table on page two of our press release.
In the Third Quarter, the net realized gains and on bonds and equities of $340 million as
you can see from the table was upset by net unrealized losses of $364 million, primarily
from our equity hedges. In the nine months, net realized gains from equities and bonds in
the main of approximately $730 million were offset by net unrealized losses of $723
million primarily from our equity hedges and CPI-linked derivatives and other losses.
We continue to be approximately 100% hedged in relation to our equity and equityrelated securities which includes convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock. We
have said for some time that we are concerned about the economies of North America
and Western Europe, accentuated by the breaking of the real estate bubble in China in
late 2011. And we continue to believe that we are not adequately paid to take risks with
bonds and stock markets at current levels.

FINAL

As of September 30, 2012, we have almost $8.1 billion in cash and short-term investments,
about 33% of the investment portfolio, to take advantage of opportunities that may come
our way. In the short term, our investment income will be reduced.
On October 12, 2012, the Company completed the purchase of the runoff business of Brit
Group with a cash payment by the Company's runoff operations of $332 million at a
discount to book value, Brit Insurance at an investment portfolio of approximately $1.4
billion.
On October 1, 2012, the Company announced they had (technical difficulty) Cunningham
Lindsey for about $260 million and we expect it to close in the Fourth Quarter. In the
Fourth Quarter we also completed a debt offering of CAD200 million and announced a
note repayment of $200 million for (Chipec).
During the quarter, the Company completed the purchase of Thomas Cook India for
about $173 million. We are very positive about the long-term prospects of this company in
India.

Bloomberg Transcript

The class-action litigation against Fairfax was dismissed with prejudice which means that
no further possibility of appeal. Fairfax did not make any payments in connection with this
dismissal.
The New Jersey litigation against hedge funds and other defendants was dismissed
without prejudice on legal grounds. We believe the decision was incorrect and we plan to
appeal.
Now I would like to turn it over to Dave so he can give you some information on the
underlying financials. Dave?

Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

First I will focus on Fairfax's consolidated financial results for the First Quarter, then move
on to the key highlights of the operating Company's results and, finally, we'll discuss our
financial position.
So first, the consolidated financial results. For the Third Quarter of 2012, Fairfax had net
earnings of $35 million and fully diluted earnings per share of $0.90. That compares to net
earnings of $974 million and fully diluted earnings per share of approximately $47 per
share in the Third Quarter of 2011.
The biggest drivers of the change in our quarterly performance year over year were
decreased net gains on investments in 2012, offset by the significant improvement in the
underwriting performance of our operating companies.
For the Third Quarter of 2012, Fairfax's insurance and reinsurance operations reported a
combined ratio of 95.4% and an underwriting profit of $74 million. That compares to a
Page 3 of 16



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2012-10-26

combined ratio of 107.5% and an underwriting loss of $105 million in the Third Quarter
2011.

FINAL

The combined ratio in the most recently completed quarter benefited from lower
catastrophe losses of $61 million or about 3.8 combined ratio points compared to the
Third Quarter of 2011 which included catastrophe losses of $172 million or about 12.3
combined ratio points.
Catastrophe losses in the Third Quarter of 2012 were comprised of a number of smaller
or attritional losses, as we sometimes call them, with the largest relating to Hurricane
Isaac.
In terms of prior period reserve development, Fairfax's insurance and reinsurance
operations recorded $38 million of net favorable development to prior year's reserves or
about 2.4 combined ratio points in the Third Quarter of 2012. And that compared to $7.5
million of net unfavorable reserve development or about one half of the combined ratio
point in the Third Quarter one year ago.

Bloomberg Transcript

So that works out to an accident year combined ratio of 97.8% in the Third Quarter of 2012
and that compares to last year of 107%. The difference between the two accident year
combined ratios, about 9.2 combined ratio points, principally reflects the absence of any
significant catastrophe events during the Third Quarter of 2012, the likes of which
occurred in 2011.
The Company recorded a net loss in investments of $24 million in the Third Quarter of
2012 compared to a net gain of investments with approximately $1.6 billion in the Third
Quarter of 2012 -- Third Quarter of 2011. Last year's net gains included about $1.3 billion of
gains on bonds, principally government bonds.
In the Third Quarter of 2012, our equity hedges or our equity holdings did not appreciate
to the same extent as the indexes underlying the majority of our hedges. This caused us
to record a net loss of $162 million on our net equity related holdings. Partially offsetting
this loss were net gains on bonds primarily US, state, and municipal bonds.
Consolidated interest and dividend income decreased by 41% from $170 million in the
Third Quarter of 2011 to $100 million in the Third Quarter of 2012, primarily as a result of
sales during 2011 and 2012 of higher-yielding bonds, the proceeds of which were
reinvested into lower yield in cash and short-term investments. And the decrease also
reflected lower total return swap expense as a result of the timing of dividends payable
by Fairfax on the short total return swaps and that was partially offset by the impact of
additional short positions affected through total return swaps in late 2011.
The average portfolio size at fair value, including Holding company cash and investments,
was comparable on a year-over-year basis at $24.8 billion at September 30, 2012, versus
$24.9 billion at September 30, 2011. We ended up for with an investment portfolio at fair
value of $25 billion.

FINAL

Turning to our operating Company results, starting with OdysseyRe. OdysseyRe had a
strong Third Quarter, producing a combined ratio of 86.3% and an underwriting profit of
$95 million. In the Third Quarter of 2011, OdysseyRe had produced a combined ratio of
103.4% and an underwriting loss of $19 million.
On an accident year basis, the combined ratio at OdysseyRe in the Third Quarter of 2012
was 88.7% compared to 103.6% in the same quarter last year. Cat losses for OdysseyRe
were $44 million or 6.3 combined ratio points in the Third Quarter of 2012 compared to
cat losses in the Third Quarter of 2011 of $109 million or 19.7 combined ratio points. Cat
losses in 2012 were comprised primarily attritional losses, Hurricane Isaac being the
largest among them at about $10 million whereas in the Third Quarter of 2011, you will
recall the cat losses at OdysseyRe were comprised principally of reserve increases on the
Japan earthquake and tsunami, Hurricane Irene and other attritional losses.
OdysseyRe's net premiums written increased 6.1% in the Third Quarter of 2012 to $682
million from $643 million the same quarter last year, primarily reflecting increases in
property, quota share, and property catastrophe reinsurance.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving on to Crum & Forster. Crum & Forster had an improved combined ratio of 101.4%
in the Third Quarter of 2012 and a lower underwriting loss of $4.2 million compared to a
combined ratio of 102% in the Third Quarter of 2011 and an underwriting loss of $5 million
in that period. On an accident year basis, the combined ratio in the Third Quarter of 2012
of 101.4% was comparable to the accident year ratio of 101.7% in the Third Quarter of 2011.
Net premiums written by Crum & Forster increased by 19.7% to $318 million in the Third
Quarter of 2012 and $266 million in the Third Quarter of 2011. This increase primarily
reflected growth in Crum & Forster specialty lines of business, specifically in excess and
surplus casualty, property, specialty, and accident and health lines of business.
Zenith National. Zenith reported a combined ratio of 114.7% in the Third Quarter of 2012
and an underwriting loss of $23 million compared to a combined ratio in the Third Quarter
of 2011 of 124% and an underwriting loss of $31 million. Zenith did not have any net
development to prior year's reserves in its most recently completed quarter so it's
accident year combined ratio mirrors its calendar year combined ratio of 114%, whereas in
the Third Quarter of 2011, Zenith reported net adverse development of $9 million or 6.8
combined ratio points and produced an accident year combined ratio of 117.5%.
Much of the improvement in Zenith's combined ratio reflected a 5.6 combined ratio point
decrease in its expense ratio, excluding commissions on a year-over-year basis. And that
was principally the result of increased net premiums earned.
Net premiums written by Zenith were $128 million in the Third Quarter of 2012 compared
to $101 million in the Third Quarter of 2011, an increase of 27% reflecting Zenith's ability to
write new business and retain existing customers at higher prices.
Moving to Northbridge. Northbridge's Third Quarter 2012 combined ratio of about 100%
was stronger compared to its combined ratio of 101.4% in the Third Quarter of 2011, which
Page 5 of 16



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2012-10-26

FINAL

included 9.5 and 4.6 combined ratio points of net favorable development in those periods
respectively.
On an accident year basis, Northbridge's combined ratio was 109.7% in the Third Quarter
of 2012 which, compared to an accident year combined ratio of 106% in the Third Quarter
of 2011. When comparing the change in Northbridge's net premiums written year-overyear, keep in mind that on May 1, 2012, Northbridge transferred the renewal rights of its
US property book of business to an affiliate of OdysseyRe where it would be a better
strategic fit.
In our Interim Report on page 46, we have provided the details of Northbridge's
premiums in Canadian dollars to avoid the distortion caused by the effects of foreign
exchange and also excluding the premiums at Northbridge's US property business in 2012
and 2011.

Bloomberg Transcript

Making reference to that table in Canadian dollars Northbridge's written premium was
CAD217 million for the Third Quarter of 2012 compared to CAD230 million in the Third
Quarter of 2011, a decrease of 5.5% year-over-year reflecting decreases in new business
and lower retentions of existing business, partially mitigated by modest improvements in
pricing.
Fairfax Asia, for the Third Quarter of 2012, Fairfax Asia reported a combined ratio of
83.2% and an underwriting profit of $10 million compared to a combined ratio of 73%, an
underwriting profit of $15 million, in the Third Quarter of 2011. The Third Quarter 2012
accident year combined ratio was 84.3% compared to 75.6% in 2011. Net premiums
written by Fairfax Asia were $54 million in the Third Quarter of 2012 compared to $50
million in the prior year quarter with the increase of 8.2% primarily the result of increased
writings of commercial automobile, marine haul, and property lines of business at Pacific
Insurance.
Moving on to insurance and insurance other segment. Insurance reinsurance other
segment. That division in the Third Quarter of 2012 produced a combined ratio of 102.1%
and an underwriting loss of $3 million compared to a combined ratio of 147% and an
underwriting loss of $61 million during the same period last year.
Cat losses, once again primarily attritional cat losses, added 3.7 combined ratio points to
the Third Quarter of 2012 combined ratio. They were significantly lower in comparison to
the Third Quarter of 2011 when the combined ratio included 42 combined ratio points of
cat losses.
The calendar year combined ratio of insurance and reinsurance other included 2.9
combined ratio points of net unfavorable about to prior years reserves compared to 9.9
combined ratio points of net unfavorable development in 2011.
Net premiums written decreased to $113 million from $125 million, a decrease of about
10.1% primarily as a result of the combination of the nonrenewal of certain classes of
business or terms and conditions were considered inadequate at Advent and also lower
Page 6 of 16



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2012-10-26

reinstatement premiums at Advent year-over-year partially offset by decreased
reinsurance purchased by Fairfax Brazil as well as Advent.

FINAL

And finally, to runoff. Runoff had another positive quarter even though realized gains were
reduced. It produced pretax income before interest expense of $13 million in the Third
Quarter of 2012 compared to a pretax income before interest expense of $181 million in
2011.
So now, turning to our financial position starting with book value per share. Book value per
share at September 30, 2012, was $360, an increase of slightly less than 1% from book
value per share of $357 at June 30, 2012, and an increase of about 1.7% from our
December 31, 2011 book value per share of $365, adjusted for the $10 per share common
dividend that was paid in the First Quarter of this year.
Common shareholders' equity increased during the quarter by $65 million to $7.328
million from $7.264 million at June 30, 2012. The principal components of the increase
included the net earnings that were attributable to shareholders at Fairfax of $35 million;
the effect of increased accumulated other comprehensive income of $44 million, which
principally comprised unrealized currency translation gains; and these were partially offset
by the payment of dividends on preferred shares of $16 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of financial leverage, our quarter end total debt to total capital ratio decreased
to 26.2% compared to 26.4% at December 31, 2011. And this was primarily as a result of
the repayment of $86 million of Fairfax debt which came due in April partially offset by the
consolidation of the subsidiary debt of Thomas Cook India.
In October 2012, the Company issued $200 million of 10-year bonds with an annual
coupon of 5.84% and followed that up by announcing the settlement of the note we
incurred when we purchased General Fidelity Insurance in August 2010. That note will be
settled for a cash payment of $200 million.
The acquisition of Thomas Cook India Ltd. Limited for $173 million added $135 million of
goodwill and $41 million of subsidiary debt to our Third Quarter consolidated balance
sheet. At the end of the quarter, Fairfax had cash and securities of almost $1 billion at the
holding company and that concludes my section promptly.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Good morning. What we are seeing here, we are certainly seeing underwriting results
improve both for you guys and for the industry. But your, to some extent, your investment
portfolio was conservative and a cautious stance doesn't really allow you to participate
fully in any kind of earnings run-up associated with what could be potentially firming
markets. I'm wondering what you -- what's your message to investors, relative to this? Is
this just to continue to be patient? And what would it take to change your mind vis-a-vis
the equity hedges and the significant cash position?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That's a very good question. It is a key question. The underwriting operations for our
Company, all our Companies is improving as you pointed out, improving quite significantly.
But the investment side we are very conservative. We have got 33%, $8 billion in cash.
Common stock positions are fully hedged. We have very little corporate borrowings. Muni
bonds are predominantly guaranteed by Berkshire Hathaway. So it is a very conservative
portfolio and the reason for us conservative portfolio is very simply that we -- it seems to
us there is a disconnect between the fundamentals in terms of companies and
economies and markets so the stock price -- stock and bond markets are high. The
fundamentals, we think, are quite different, meaning on the low side.
And so, you'll either have the fundamentals go up over time to catch up with stock prices,
catch up with very low spreads, or you'll have the markets come down. And we have said
for some time, this time period we think of it as a one in 30; , one in 100-year event. It is
not a normal time period. So we just think you have to be very, very careful.
The fact that we have got cash in our portfolio is making no money today. It's a big
advantage as and when opportunities come, because of course the only people who can
take advantage of it is the people who have cash.
In 2008, Tom, 2008, 2009 you had a very significant -- two things happened, right. You
had the stock market drop almost 30% and the spreads widened significantly. And in that
time period we had 75% of our portfolios in cash and government bonds. So we could
take advantage of the opportunity that presented themselves to us and 2010, 2011 we
have started hedging and in 2011 we've hedged significant parts of our portfolio. But on
the other hand we (haven't) realized very significant gains. So in the first nine months I
think we realized $730 million, but it is masked in a way by the unrealized losses on the
hedges. And we expect that to reduce over time, and perhaps even become profits as it
has in 2008, 2009.
So to summarize, Tom, we just -- we have always been long term. Our long-term results
are excellent. In any single year, in any single quarter, we can't tell you what we will make.
Investment results have been lumpy. They are not smooth. We are not looking at
providing 5, 10, 15% growth every quarter. We don't know how to do it. We would love to

Page 8 of 16

do it if we could, but we have focused our Company from inception 27 years ago is on the
long term. And that continues to be the case.

Appreciate that. Thanks very much.

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Good morning. Couple of questions that kind of relate to the acquisitions recently and
divestitures. Let me start with the Cunningham Lindsey sales. If I am following the one
chart correctly, a $260 million proceed, that should put result in plus or minus around $150
million of realized gain in the Fourth Quarter?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes, I think that is right. That's exactly right.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I guess following on with that, $35 million that you will reinvest related to that, that will just,
I guess, remain as an investment and affiliate. I would deal it in with the new, but it is the
same thing.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

It is a small investment. Dave, would you put it and affiliates or where would you
characterize that?

A - Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

It will just go into our common stock portfolio and it would be carried on a fair value basis.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Very good. The second question I had if you just -- the acquisitions, the Brit acquisition I
guess that's closed now, if I am mapping that out right, about 75% of book value is -- was
the purchase price.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

No. It was more like, I think we had said in the past press release we said it was closer to
95% of book value and we had two things that are -- we had -- it was a discount to book
value, closer to 95%. We had the ability to, when we did our due diligence, any liabilities
we didn't like were able to put it in a reinsurance transaction back to the Company. Back
to Brit. And so and over 18 months, two years we are going to review those liabilities and
if we feel comparable we will commute that reinsurance transaction.
Page 9 of 16

FINAL

So from our standpoint, it was we -- the advantage of a runoff. We have got a separate
runoff company. They review every single claim. Claim by claim by claim, and so we feel
very comfortable with what we have taken on. And approximately a little of this comes to
book value. But what you have here is $1.4 billion in investment portfolios. That will pay off
over time and we can invest it and make a return.
The Chipec transaction that we did about a year, year and a half ago has been a very
positive one for us. In our Annual Report we will give you more the details. But it is working
out very well. And this one we think will work out. This is perhaps the biggest one we've
done. And we expect it to work out very well also.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

And what is the nature of the underlying liabilities? Is it auto or commercial liabilities?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

It is from around the UK. It has got a varied liability, book of liabilities. Dave, anything you
would add to that? I don't know if you disclosed some of that in our --

A - Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Yes, no, I think you are right there. It is an assortment of UK and domestic international
insurance and reinsurance businesses. So across the spectrum.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

The duration will be like in five years, say, half the liabilities will be paid. And the remaining
will be mostly paid by, say, 10 years. That is the sort of runoff that we get involved in. But
the advantage is we have got a separate marker. I'm sorry, the advantage we've got is a
separate runoff group that handles these liabilities. And there's maybe there's two or
three of these groups in North America that can do it.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

That's useful. Thanks for the detail.

Good morning. My question regards the OdysseyRe political donation. And I was
wondering if you could just help us understand a little bit more about why that was done
and how you see it as being important to the success of the firm? Thank you.

FINAL

Thank you for that question. Yes. The contribution was made by OdysseyRe and the
decision to make the contribution was made entirely by OdysseyRe. Fairfax did not
participate in the contribution or the decision to make the contribution. OdysseyRe chose
to make that contribution because it is one of the only remaining reinsurers in the United
States and it is paying US taxes.
The fact that competitors have moved offshore and pay lower taxes is a competitive
disadvantage to OdysseyRe and OdysseyRe believes Governor Romney is the best
choice to rectify this inequality. So that is why they made the donation. But thank you for
asking that question. Next, Audra.

Operator
(Chris Lafayette), (inaudible).

Q - Chris Laf ayette
Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about
how you manage risk to any single catastrophic event? Then, given various operating
structures and reinsurance agreements, how much of your book value would be at risk to
any single event?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

In, with catastrophe, right?

Q - Chris Laf ayette
Correct, yes.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes. That is a very good question. It's one that we, in the property casualty business,
catastrophe risk is the biggest risk that you trade. And we've, 27 years, we've focused on
it single-mindedly. Each of our companies look at it at their level and it comes right up to
Fairfax, comes right through our (cheap red carpet), comes to our officers and I am
involved in it myself because this is the type of thing that can impact our Company.
And what we do broadly speaking is OdysseyRe is our main source of exposures. And
they have said that they would expose their common equity, OdysseyRe's common
equity, to about 15% of shareholders equity. And we link that 15% to the rate of return we
expect to make over time. So if you think of 15% return that we make and 15% exposure, it
is sort of a one-year payback. So that we will expose our Company not to capital, but to
one year's worth of income. And last year is a good test because we had almost $1 billion
of catastrophe losses and we still made $40 million or $50 million after-tax.
But that is what we -- and we look at it very carefully. We look at it at different scenarios,
$100 billion event. Events that have not taken place. You have got to look at events that
have not taken place. So you have got to look at the possibility. We have never had $100

billion event or a $200 billion event. But we simulate that in our companies. And but our
exposure is mainly from OdysseyRe and to a large extent, Odyssey has limits so that we
know what the exposures can be. But that is a good question. It is one we are focused on
all the time.

Q - Chris Laf ayette
Illustrate helpful. Thank you. Then just one more if I could. You recently renewed the
buyback authorization. I was just wondering how you think about that with the stock
trading around book value. The Company has done more aggressive historically. What do
you look for as far as (multiple speakers).

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

We are always looking at the alternative of buying back our stock. But we won't do it at
the expense of our holding company cash and marketable securities that we'd like to
keep -- $1 billion. And in this uncertain environment, we are just very, very careful. But rest
assured in any deal that we make that we are always comparing it in by our stock and
retiring it. You pointed out in the past we thought maybe and this goes back a little time,
but we might have bought 18%, 20% of our Company back at one point in time. And over
time we expect to retire our shares. But in these times we will be careful doing it.

And it will never be done at the expense of our holding company cash and marketable
securities of $1 billion. We will always keep that $1 billion there for the unexpected
developments.

Good morning. Two questions. First relates to improvements in underwriting margins. So
one of the ways I look at the combined ratio is on an accident year basis less cat losses.
Year to date I come up with a number of 96.1% and that is versus 96.3% last year. So really
not much of an improvement year over year. But I would've thought we would've seen a
bigger improvement given some of the forces you highlighted in terms of lower
investment yields and that's necessitating higher pricing.
So maybe you can talk about why we haven't seen a bigger improvement and what might
change over the next 12 months to lower that -- the combined ratio -- on that basis?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

So Paul, whenever you are -- our premiums are up, I think, for the first nine months
approximately 11%. So whenever you -- and you look at each of the companies and you

look at the (technical difficulty) come through it, but whenever you have premiums going
up, your expense ratios come down. And so our expense ratios in the past have gone up
because we've had soft markets and we reduced our premium. Now expense ratios are
coming down because of the fact that premiums are going up.
So if you look at Zenith, for example, Zenith was up 47% in terms of its premium and so
the expense ratios came down significantly. The loss ratios we maintained, Zenith has
been historically maintaining a very -- 60%, 65% areas. But the expense ratios have come
down. And so the markets have bottomed out. The rates are going up. But it is not like
the hard markets of 2002, 2003, 2004. But the pricing has improved and improved pretty
well across the board.
It is very good and anything that is exposed to catastrophe, given the losses of last year,
the rates are still full up significantly and are remaining there. But should we see our
combined ratios coming down, they -- with these low interest rates even if you have a
combined ratio of 95% or less, you are going to have a single-digit return on equity. And
so, combined ratios have to come down.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now what you're seeing for companies that have not reduced their premium in the last
few years, you are seeing reserve development crop up. You are seeing reserves go up
and so you are seeing companies being put into runoff or lose their rating and that has
begun now. And this is usually a sign of change taking place.
We are very careful about our reserving. We like our reserves to be strong. It's in our 10year results, reserved redundancies run at 6% to 8% over time. And so we're very
comfortable with where we are right now and we -- and the business, it's improving. But
like I said, it's not a hard market. We are already approximately net premium -- it's not
gross, it's net. We are already at about $6 billion.
And in a really good market -- I've said that in our annual meeting and I've said it
elsewhere, that we can double that premium. And we have. We have different units and
different management -- really good management teams, all focused at the right time,
not on our forecast, but actually seeing prices to increase that premium. So we feel very
good where we are in terms of our underwriting and I might say in our investment
positions even though we are not making money for our shareholders. Our Company's is
poised to reap the benefits of being that conservative. So we like where we are.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

So I am going to try to summarize this, if I may. So the key to levers maybe over the next
12 months will be one firm's changing their -- with the industry broadly speaking changing
their positions on reserves, i.e., they've been releasing a lot of reserves over the last few
years and that has probably come to an end, and then also a decline in the expense ratio
as you ramp up your underlying activity.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes, I think that's fair.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Then my second question would be related to the additional investment you made
in the CPI derivative this quarter. Maybe just the thought process behind that.

FINAL

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes, so, all that is averaging down. We have done that before. And we added about $20
million. And in this case, we have structured it so that we have eight years remaining. It is a
10-year contract when we bought it. There's eight years remaining. The CPI has gone up a
little since that time. So we put $2 million and increased the strike price. So we increased
the strike price and we closed it to where the CPI is today. That's all we did. We just
freshened it a little for $20 million, but we will always look at averaging down as we
planned a significant unrealized loss by the way. More than two thirds of our investment is
now in an unrealized loss position. It's -- I think we have got it at $140 million, something
like that. And we've never paid more than $400 million to it. But it is all unrealized. It goes
to our income statement like it is a loss, but as I said in my prepared comments, it is -- we
haven't lost any money. It's just -- it is mark to market and that is what the accounting is
these days. So it goes to -- it flows to our statement as losses but we haven't sold
anything yet.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Got it. Thanks for your time.

Q - Tessad Oki
I think there is an error there. I am actually not with Fairfax. I'm a small investor in Fairfax.
And while a small investor, it's a significant portion of my very modest at work since I have
been invested with you since 2010. I think my question is really maybe a follow-on to the
gentleman from BMO Capital Markets where I guess I am looking for some guidance and
counsel from you. As it feels like you are going through potentially another seven lean
years as you did in the earlier part of 2000s where at least stock is invested, but book to
value hasn't moved very much given all of the various forces you talked about at length in
various quarterly calls and the annual shareholders meeting.
But if you have increasingly got -- as you said, either the markets will come down to the
fundamentals or vice versa and it just -- I just wonder how you feel about things given
every time the market seems to move down towards the fundamentals, the central banks
are constantly coming in and priming the pump. And I just wonder if you feel -- if you ever
feel you are fighting a losing battle against the Fed and the ECB.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes. That is a good question. And so the first thing I'd just to say to you is we have always
focused on the long term and when we went through our seven lean years so that we

were turning around our Company, we were turning around Crum & Forster and the tech
reinsurance and all of that and it took some time to turn it around.
Today, our companies are in excellent position. They are underwriting focus, they are well
reserved. They've cut back in the soft market and they are well positioned to expand
significantly at the right time, and as they are expanding today. You are seeing that in
Zenith, you are seeing it in Crum & Forster, you are seeing it in Odyssey and the Canadian
markets always lag, have lagged in the past. And you will see it in time in Canada.
So underwriting operations are very well positioned. And our investment philosophy and
positions are always long term. So when we have credit to form swaps in the past, it took
a few years for it to work out and then, as you know, we made a lot of money. And so
right now it is very important not to reach for yield. Because if you do reach for yield or if
you put money into the stock market at these prices, you could suffer permanent losses.
We will take temporary losses, but we don't like taking permanent losses.
So I don't think we will be in a position where our results will be poor for a long period of
time. But you are right, for the last year and a half, it hasn't been good. But our results for
year ending 2011 for the five years is among the best in the business. And of course, for
the 26 years ending 2011 it is better than anyone else in our industry.

So we are focused on the long term and we continue. We have always been focused on
the long term and continue to be focused on doing well for our shareholders.
