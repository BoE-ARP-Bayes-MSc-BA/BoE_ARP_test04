Presentation
Janne Flessum

{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

Welcome to the presentation of the Fourth Quarter and preliminary full-year results for
Gjensidige. My name is Janne Flessum. And I'm Head of Investor Relations. Today, our
CEO, Helge Leiro Baastad, will start with presenting the headlines for the full year, 2012,
before our EVP for International General Insurance, Kim Rud-Petersen, gives you some
insight into our activities outside Norway.
Then our CFO, Catharina Hellerud, gives us some more details on the ﬁnancials, both for
the Fourth Quarter. And the full year. And ﬁnally, we will open up for a Q&A session, as
always. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that the presentation can be downloaded
from our website, gjensidige.no.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Janne. Before I start on page 4, I would just say regarding the Fourth Quarter,
that it was a very strong conclusion to a record year for Gjensidige. But, as Janne said
initially, Catharina will comment the Fourth Quarter afterwards.
2012 was a historically strong year for Gjensidige; and you can follow on page four now.
The preliminary proﬁt before tax expense, was NOK5.6 billion, corresponding to a return
on equity of 23.8%. And the proﬁt per share was NOK8.56.

The underwriting result was NOK2.6 billion, corresponding to a combined ratio, 85.3%. If
you discount the reserves, as they do in some countries, for instance Denmark, the
discounted combined ratio for the Group, in 2012 was 81.7%.

FINAL

Our premium increases have been in line with underlying claims inﬂation. And we
experienced increased competitiveness in general, in 2012. This is reﬂected in a positive
development in the loss of customers.
At the end of 2012, we have almost the same amount of customers in the Norwegian
business, as we had year-end 2011. And the quality of the customer portfolio is generally
better than a year ago.
When we are to summarize these results for 2012, there is no escaping the fact that the
loss frequency was unusually low seen from the perspective of Nordic General Insurance
Company. This was especially the case in the Motor and Property Insurance. You have also
seen this, when you have looked into the ﬁgures from our peers, reporting before us. We
had no major weather-related events in 2012, unlike what we saw in 2011.

Bloomberg Transcript

The return on the investment portfolio was NOK3 billion, corresponding to a return of
5.4%. And given the appetite risk and risk portfolio proﬁle in our portfolio management
we are very satisﬁed with this return. These ﬁgures mean that we have achieved our
ﬁnancial target also in 2012.
The Board proposes a dividend of NOK3.4 billion, corresponding to NOK6.85 per share.
This corresponds to a distribution percentage of 8% of the proﬁt after tax expense, which
is at the high end of the stipulated range of dividend, between 50% and 80%.
Talking about dividend, I want you to look at page 5. And if we look at the distribution
percentage for the last three years, it has been at the high end of the stipulated range;
80% in '10, 83% in '11. And now 80% in '12. We wish to remind you that we had unusually
terrible tax situation in 2010, as a result of the conversion of the Company. This
contributed to listing the nominal dividend somewhat in relation to a normal level. We
had, as you maybe remember, 9.3% tax level in 2010.
And as mentioned, we had an unusually low loss frequency in 2012. But given the Group
strong capital situation, the Board of Directors proposes a distribution at the high end of
the stipulated range. So the arrows indicate extraordinary result, also regarding the
dividend, as you can see from the chart, related to 2010 and 2012.
On page 6, you can see some of our main focus and events during the year. We have
presented some of these tasks before. One main take-away from this presentation is
development in the loss of customers in the Norwegian private segment has been doing
worst.
It is very important. And a very important trend shift actually, in 2012. Our multi-channel
distribution has contributed on the Commercial side, to a signiﬁcantly more eﬃcient
Page 2 of 18



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2013-02-14

customer dialog in the Commercial segment, in 2012.

FINAL

The call center though, serves 15% more requests, with increased service level. And
unchanged number of employees, compared with end 2011. In addition web requests
have increased have increased signiﬁcantly in 2012.
We have had focus on cost eﬃciency throughout the organization also in 2012. But, at the
same time, we have managed to invest into the future. And in three Group-wide initiatives
for achieving the goal of both proﬁtable growth and more customer loyalty and
satisfaction, we have been presenting the tariﬀ rate in project before, the brand initiative
and simpliﬁcation and automation program.

Bloomberg Transcript

New tariﬀs have been implemented in large parts of the Norwegian portfolio and we look
forward to starting the rollout in the Nordic segment later this year. This is long-term work
that will include continuous improvement of existing tariﬀs. If you have more speciﬁc
questions related to the tariﬀ development and tariﬀ project we are so pleased today to
have EVP, Martin Danielsen together with us. So he can answer more speciﬁc questions
afterwards.
Secondly, simpler internal work processes, automation and self-service solutions will be
decisive in the organization for good customers in the time ahead. In 2012 one out of the
10 material damage claims and one of the ﬁve travel claims in the Private segment in
Norway were reported online and by mobile phone. The settlement of one out of the six
frequency claims was automated. A joint Nordic system platform with a ﬂexible service
architecture means that we are well-positioned for taking a leading role in this area going
forward; important key words are easier for the customer and easier for Gjensidige.
Finally, the development of the new brand strategy is about real changes in our relations
with the customers and a more modern whistle proﬁle adapted to digital channels.
Finally, the Gjensidige Foundation approximately in -- we had last tranche of these bonus
shares in December. And it was approximately 3 million bonus shares and were -- that
were distributed to about 40,000 shareholders.
We're also pleased that the Gjensidige Foundation had a massive marketing campaign in
2012 to create familiarity with our unique model, whereby the Foundation's share
dividend is distributed directly to our Norwegian General Insurance customers in the form
of customer dividend. They will continue with this massive market campaign also in 2013.
And ﬁnally, before I give the word to Kim Rud-Petersen, I would say that also a very
important achievement in 2012 is the fact that we have increased signiﬁcantly our
customer satisfaction in the Norwegian market. So, we had a trend shift related to
customers in both Private line and Commercial line. And we had also a trend shift related
to customer satisfaction and that, in combination with a strong result for 2012, we are
really satisﬁed with that combination.

FINAL

As you know, we took the ﬁrst step from being a Norwegian General Insurance company
to becoming a Nordic General Insurance company back in 2006. And since then we have
been on an exciting journey. And I will now leave the ﬂoor to -- not the ﬂoor, the table
here to Kim Rud-Petersen, Executive Vice President of International General Insurance,
who will tell you about this journey and give you an account of our International
operations; so please, Kim.

Kim Rud-Petersen
Thank you, Helge. I'm struggling a little bit with my throat. So I apologize if I have to pause
during the session here.
Growth outside Norway shall be achieved in General Insurance, primarily through
acquisitions. Carefully selected transactions and good operations have given us a
proﬁtable business and a strong position in Denmark. And I'm proud of the fact that the
Nordic segment delivers a result of nearly NOK500 million for 2012. This corresponds to
almost 20% of the Group's total General Insurance result.

Bloomberg Transcript

As Helge just mentioned, Gjensidige's international journey started back in 2006 with the
acquisition of Fair Insurance in Denmark. Our most substantial acquisition was Nykredit
Forsikring in 2010, which was a perfect match for our operations in the Danish market. We
doubled our market share and Gjensidige is now the sixth largest player in the General
Insurance market.
We now have critical mass to ensure rational and eﬃcient operations going forward. We
have a balanced portfolio now, half of the premiums come from the Private market; 35%
comes from Large Corporate and municipalities; and the rest from our Small/Medium
Enterprises and Agriculture.
Distribution in the Private market is a multi-channel model combined with strategic
corporation with selected distribution partners. We have access to more than 50% of the
property distribution in Danish market through our cooperation with Nykredit and EDC,
Denmark's biggest estate agent.
The Nykredit Group is our biggest partner in our Private segment. And that part of the
portfolio is operated and branded under a Nykredit insurance brand. We have a
continuous good dialog with Nykredit to further strengthen the cooperation in order to
realize our ambitions, setting new standard for customer service.
In the market our distribution model towards small/medium enterprises and agricultural
customers is the multi-channel model. While when we look at the Commercial customers
and the Municipal segment these are primarily shared through brokers. Gjensidige is
market leader in the municipal insurance market in Denmark.
We focus on proﬁtable growth, proﬁtability overgrowth and have delivered an
improvement in our combined ratio from 102% in 2010, 96 -- 97.9% in 2011. And now
86.5% in 2012. The most important measures have been reductions of risks; price

measures; systematic re-underwriting; and optimization of our Commercial portfolio in
particular, getting rid of the bad apples.

FINAL

In the Danish market we have established a sound foundation with a scalable, proﬁtable
business model. And this is geared for further proﬁtable growth; ﬁrst and foremost,
through acquisitions. But also through organic growth where we ﬁnd it possible.
We have a solid track and a competence for integration, a sound capital situation. And
ﬁnancial ﬂexibility on which we can capitalize when attractive opportunities arise. In a
consolidated market it's, however, a question of being rational and patient.
We have one common Nordic IT platform. And we can easily integrate new portfolios.
Helge also mentioned we're focusing on gradual automization and the simpliﬁcation of
work processes for customer service and our staﬀ; and self-service solutions for our
customers. And this will also help us to achieve both proﬁtability and customer
satisfaction targets.

Bloomberg Transcript

During 2013 we will start implementing new tariﬀs based on the Norwegian model,
starting with the motor insurance tariﬀ in the Private segment. We expect the eﬀect on the
loss ratio in the Danish operations to be positive. This indicates a signiﬁcant potential in
the years to come. We assume that over time new tariﬀs can be implemented in 60% to
70% of the Danish portfolio. But, I would like to emphasize this is a long-term project.
This year, implementation of our new brand strategy marketing initiative, a new customer
portal, on the Internet will further strengthen our position.
Over time we expect organic growth in line with GDP growth. However, it looks, as the fall
in the market -- the housing market has stagnant in the Danish market. (Technical
diﬃculty).
We are starting to see positive tendencies in the property sales in several areas around
the biggest cities in Denmark. We have a unique position in the market, as I mentioned
previously, which can take relative -- which we can take relative advantage of when the
housing market starts picking up again.
To look a bit deeper into the Baltic business, Gjensidige is the ﬁfth largest player in the
market overall. The market is quite fragmented, with a market share of approximately 70%
divided between the ﬁve biggest companies. The biggest share is related to international
companies, such as Gjensidige.
The market is immature and with good potential for growth. The insurance penetration is
very low in all three countries. The distribution is ineﬃcient. And there are high
expectations for the future economic development and general living conditions and
standards.

FINAL

In Gjensidige, as for the general market, motor insurance is by far the biggest product,
representing 62% of our premiums. We have yet to deliver proﬁtability in line with the
Group's target. So far we have delivered a relatively stable proﬁtability, also during the
macroeconomic crisis.
The relatively high cost ratio for this segment, which is in line with the market, is related to
the current distribution model in an immature market; with a broad broker network, direct
distribution through local sales oﬃces. We will incorporate the Baltic into the Nordic
model, focusing on our operational eﬃciency, using the same tools and expertise as we
have used in the rest of the International business. Overall, we beneﬁt from a structural
capital in Norway. But we also have highly capable employees at a local level, both at
management level but also professional expertise.
So to sum up I think there are three things I would like you to take with you from this
presentation. We have gained a position as one of the largest insurance companies in
Denmark; a scalable business model and a strong partner network, which makes us wellpositioned for growth. We have a good basis for playing a bigger role in the Baltics as the
market matures in time ahead. And, last but not least, proﬁtability is our main target over
growth in the Nordic segment, as well as for the rest of the Group. And I will now give you
Catharina Hellerud for a detailed presentation of our ﬁgures.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Kim. I assume that you have seen the reports. So, I will try to run through the
ﬁgures rather quickly.
The Insurance operations have delivered very strong results through 2012, which is also
the case in the Fourth Quarter. All the Insurance segments show an improvement in
ﬁnancial performance, both for the quarter, seen in isolation and for the year as a whole.
An important explanation for the good results in the quarter, in addition to good
underlying proﬁtability, lays a very low proportion of large losses and the major weatherrelated events in the quarter.
The Bank also recorded a positive performance in the quarter, while the result in Pension
and Savings was negatively aﬀected by a strengthening of claims provisions for disability
risk related to diﬀerent pension products. In addition to the fact that the return on
ﬁnancial assets for the year, above the guaranteed interest on the paid up policy portfolio
was allocated for a buﬀer for longer life expectancy.
Turning to page 14, the combined ratio for the General Insurance operations, ended at a
strong 86.4%. The cost ratio was 16.0% in the quarter. The costs for the quarter include an
investment relating to the brand initiative of NOK34 million, corresponding to an eﬀect of
0.8 percentage points on the cost ratio. This includes the launching of the new visual
proﬁle, new signs on oﬃces. And new customer portal.

FINAL

The cost ratio was 15.5% for the year as a whole. The ambition is to have a cost ratio of 15%
within 2015. And we continuously work to be even more cost eﬀective. And investing in
solutions to secure more eﬃcient internal processes, automation and sales servicing. This
also includes the recent investment in the Group's brand, which adapts LTV's visual proﬁle
to a digital channel.
The loss ratio was 70.4% in the quarter, to give underlying proﬁtability in the portfolio. An
important driver for the proﬁtability is the modernized tariﬀs. And the more analysisbased pricing.
In relation to the frequency development we are seeing a more normalization of the
frequencies for the motor insurance product, compared with the ﬁrst three quarters of
2012. On the other hand, the ﬁgures for the quarter do not include any typical winter
frequencies that you normally see in the Nordic region.
The same applies to the property product. There have also been a few ﬁres the in the
quarter, which normally accounts for some medium-size claims in the range of NOK1
million to NOK10 million. However, the loss ratio for the quarter was also positively
aﬀected by the leisure and accidents. And large losses and weather-related events.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to page 15, earned premiums for the Group increased by 1.1% in the quarter, with
an underlying increase of 2.6%. If you adjust for the agreement with the Norwegian Auto
Federation, NAF, that expired in 2011 and that we have commented earlier, in addition to
the negative change rate eﬀect in the Nordic segment.
Turning to page 16, as you can see from the ﬁgures, even a big portfolio there will be
elements of random variation as regards the scope of large losses, from quarter to
quarter, which the ﬁgures for this quarter clearly illustrate.
Large losses in the quarter had an eﬀect on the combined ratio of 0.3percentage points,
far below the expected value for the quarter of 5.4percentage points. And also for the
year 2012, the actual eﬀect of large losses was below the expected value.
Turning to page 17, you can see that there was a run-oﬀ gain of NOK75 million in the
General Insurance segment in the quarter. The largest part of the run-oﬀ gain comes from
the Nordic segment. And there was still a positive development in the occupational injury
portfolio. And in addition some large losses were adjusted during the quarter.
Reserving is done on a best estimate eﬀort, implying that the expected run-oﬀ level is
zero. The level of run-oﬀ will, of course, vary between the quarters. But, over the last 13
years, the run-oﬀ results have, on average, had a positive eﬀect on the combined ratio of
0.9percentage points.
Turning to page 18, there was a decrease in nominal operating expenses in the quarter of
NOK21 million. The segments were positively aﬀected by the fact that the cost of the
bonus was charged to the Corporate Center as owner expense in late 2012, while it was
Page 7 of 18

Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2013-02-14

FINAL

charged to the segments in 2011. So the Corporate Center then shows the negative
development in the quarter due to the bonus scheme, as well as the cost relating to the
brand initiative that I commented earlier.
Turning to page 19, the illustration shows the breakdown of the internal risk-based capital
requirement. There is an annual audit of internal and that was carried out in this quarter.
This has not led to any material change in the total capital needed for the operational
segment. There have been large changes between the segments. The capital requirement
for Commercial Norway has increased, while the capital requirement for the Nordic
segment has been reduced.
And the total risk-based capital requirement amounted to NOK10.7 billion at the end of
the quarter, reduced from NOK11.3 billion at the end of the Third Quarter.
Turning to page 20, it is still the rating requirement from S&P, the A rating, that is the most
binding of the three capital perspectives that we examine. And taking account of this
capital requirements, the (inaudible) excess capital amounted to NOK5.3 billion at the
end of 2012, that's an increase of NOK1.4 billion during the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

The increase in excess capital is largely due to an increase in available capital; that is the
gross proﬁt for the year. During the year it's nothing -- or proﬁt for the period is not
included in available capital during the year, while at the end of the year the retained
earnings are included; that is the total comprehensive income minus the proposed
dividend.
Turning to page 21, the Investment portfolio amounted to NOK56.3 billion at the end of
the quarter. And, as you know, it is divided into three separate portfolios; it's Match
portfolio, that is the biggest part of the portfolio, the portfolio is invested in ﬁxed income
instruments whose duration is adapted to the provisions.
The Free portfolio is also, to a large extent, invested in ﬁxed income instruments. But does
also include investments in equities, private equity and property. Then there's Associated
Companies, we're then on SR-Bank had a book value of NOK5 billion at the end of the
quarter.
Turning to page 22, the Investment Portfolio, you see it had a good result, both for the
quarters seen in isolation and for the year. The Match portfolio yielded a return of
1percentage point. The largest part of the Match portfolio is valued at amortized cost and
had a recognized return of 1.0% in the quarter.
At the end of the Fourth Quarter the end realized excess value from bonds valued at
amortized cost amounted to just above NOK1 billion, reﬂecting the decrease in interest
rate level. The decreasing interest rate level also aﬀects, of course, the reinvestment rates
in the bond portfolio. And the average reinvestment rate for the bonds, classiﬁed as
amortized cost, has been around 4.5% in the quarter on average, compared with
approximately 4.6% in the Third Quarter.

Page 8 of 18

Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2013-02-14

The return on bonds classiﬁed as short term bonds was 0.7% in the quarter. This item
includes also the interest expense or the unwinding of the discounted insurance liabilities
in Gjensidige's adverse cover, the annuities in the relative portfolio.

FINAL

The Associated Companies yielded a return of 1.6% in the quarter and part of the proﬁt is
due to a positive deviation of NOK10 million from the previous quarter.
The Free portfolio yielded a return of 2% during the quarter. Both equities and directlyowned properties made a positive contribution, while the return on the property fund was
practically zero.
All in all, a good return on the Investment portfolio, both in the quarter and for the year as
a whole. Then I leave the word to Helge to sum up.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, I think the last page is page 24 (sic), Priorities and Outlook. And what I would
just say there, we have commented that based on best practice in Norway we'll start
rolling out new tariﬀs, work processes and new tools in the Nordic segment in 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

We will also implement the multi-channel distribution model, as we have implemented in
the Commercial business in Norway, gradually into the Nordic segment.
We have signed the biggest new aﬃnity agreement since early '90s with DNT, that's the
Norwegian Trekking Association. And they have more than 246,000 members. So that's
also a very attractive customer group. And based on our experience regarding working
together with aﬃnity agreements or groups, we look forward to working together with
DNT as well.
We will continue to explore opportunities for growth, both organically and structurally. As
you know the Nordic general insurance market is mature and consolidated. And we will
continue to be patient and rational. And prioritize proﬁtability of growth. And you also
heard Kim Rud-Petersen said that for the Nordic business.
Related to new regulations, as for the Solvency II to regulations, we now expect that they
will not be implemented in Norway until 2016.
Regarding Life, the Banking Law Commission submitted a Norwegian oﬃcial report in
January 2013, which describes the rules that apply to the transition from the deﬁned
beneﬁt pension schemes to the new group occupational pension insurance. So-called
hybrid model.
The report proposes a transitional period of three years. And the Commission also
proposes higher maximum rates for deﬁned contribution pension schemes. So that they
enjoy equal status as new group occupational pension insurance.

FINAL

When it comes to Gjensidige, we will consider oﬀering the product. But await reaching a
decision to see what the enterprises will do and the actual proﬁtability potential of the
product. It is likely that several enterprises will convert their deﬁned beneﬁt schemes into
deﬁned contribution occupational pension schemes, a product that will continue to be
the most important pension product oﬀered by the Group going forward.
So the new Norwegian pension legislation is intending to enter into force in 2014. So with
that ﬁnal comment I think it's okay now with some Q&As.

Janne Flessum

{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

Yes, operator, we are ready to take the Q&A session.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Will Hardcastle, BofA Merrill Lynch

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

, Can I ask a couple of questions on capital, please? I'm looking at the diversiﬁcation
beneﬁt on the capital chart and it looks like it's reduced from NOK1.8 billion to NOK0.8
billion quarter on quarter. And was just really wondering what the driver of that was as
well as the move in the additional binding capital requirement, that actually looks like it's
gone up from NOK5.1 billion to NOK6 billion?
And the second question is relating to the frequency of normal losses. You talked about
that quite a lot in the call and I remember it being lower than normal in Q1 and Q2 on
motor and property. But can I just understand from what you said on the call, was motor
more normal in Q4. But property was perhaps a little less than normal as well still, is that
correct?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Maybe I should start with the question regarding the economic capital allocation that I -that you asked ﬁrst. What we have done in this quarter is to change the model based on
our annual audit and there are diﬀerent eﬀects that lead to the changes that you see on
slide 19.
It's we have increased correlation between the products, which has increased the capital
requirement for businesses Private and the Commercial Norway segment. We have also
we recalibrated the Norwegian inﬂation assumptions, which have then reduced the
capital need for the Norwegian segment. We have also improved the databases by
including more data in the model. And we have also changed our capital requirement
related to operational risk.

Page 10 of 18



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2013-02-14

FINAL

The net eﬀect of these changes leads to an unchanged capital requirement for the Private
segment, while the capital requirement for the Commercial Norway segment has
increased.
And in addition to the management eﬀect, there has also been an improved model for
the damage work with compared products, which leads to a reduction in the capital
requirement in the Nordic segment. So, all these changes in the model have changed the
capital requirements and the diversiﬁcation between the segments.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Related to the second question we have Mr. (inaudible) here. So --?

A - Martin Danielsen

{BIO 16715872 <GO>}

It's Martin Danielsen, Head of Product and Pricing, I think your comments -- your
understanding of the motor is right. But we have a slightly more normal development
towards the end of the year. Obviously, 2012 was a very good year for motor insurance.
But to the extent we see any the diﬀerence between the diﬀerent parts of the year, it was
especially the ﬁrst half of the year, which was the very best for motor.

Bloomberg Transcript

When it comes to property frequencies, one quarter is a very short time period to look at.
Obviously, there were no extreme weather incidents; it was hardly any large claims at all.
And as Catharina stated, we had very few medium-sized claims, typical ﬁres; so, yes, it was
a good quarter for property.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Great. Thanks. And I know this is an extremely diﬃcult thing to quantify. But do you
estimate, for example, that for the speciﬁc division that that that's in, that it maybe saved
an extra 1percentage point than normal or a bit more or a bit less?

A - Martin Danielsen

{BIO 16715872 <GO>}

We don't ﬂag too much numbers there, because it's also a mix of diﬀerent types of claims
and so on. But it was a fairly good quarter and also -- but no extreme movement.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Okay, thanks.

Operator
Matti Ahokas, Handelsbanken.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

A question -- or two questions, please. First on the dividend, a lot of your peers have
actually recently started to focus more and more about steadily rising dividend. And it
seems, at least in my opinion, that you guys are focusing more on the payout ratio.
Page 11 of 18



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2013-02-14

Obviously, if the development within claims next year or this year will be less favorable
than previous, the earnings will probably fall. So how do you feel about the kind of level
of dividend as opposed to the payout ratio going forward?

FINAL

The second question is regarding the tax rate, which was pretty high in the Fourth
Quarter. Was there something special? And what should we expect for the coming
quarters? Thanks.

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Well, I'll start with the ﬁrst question regarding the dividend. Well, we have a dividend
policy, which states that the dividend should be between 50% and 80% of the Group's
net proﬁts. And that is the current dividend policy of Gjensidige. And we have for the last
three years paid a dividend in the higher range -- or in the highest range of the dividend
range, reﬂecting our strong capital position.
But we have also, as you see on the slide in the package, illustrated that there are some
special eﬀects both in 2010 and 2012, reﬂecting -- or aﬀecting the dividend level, of
course, in the nominal numbers. But, again, the dividend policy is to payout between 50%
and 80% of the Group's net results.

Bloomberg Transcript

When it comes to the tax rate, there is nothing special this year or this quarter; so eﬀective
tax rate of 24%. The corporate tax rate in Norway is 28%. But there are some, as you know,
some eﬀects regarding losses and gain on shares or equities, Norwegian equities and
European equities; but, again, no special eﬀect in 2012.

I have a couple of questions. One, it's a bit nitty-gritty. But I was looking at your
investment return. I'm looking at the full-year number, which is slightly over NOK3 billion.
There are three segments where you made a really very, very high return, probably well
above what is normalized.
I can see on the other bonds, which is, if I remember correctly, it's mostly a corporate
bond portfolio, you have around 15% return. But also on convertible bonds and private
equity, the returns were very, very high. And I was trying to back out how much capital
gains you had. And it seems like, if I've done the math correctly that the number is around
NOK300 million to NOK400 million. But I'd really like to have an idea of what was a more
normalized investment income this year. That's the ﬁrst question.

And the second question, it's more related to the payout. And what is asked before. But
I'm more thinking like you're making enormous amount of money. So in a way, even with
an 80% payout ratio, you are keeping NOK1 billion of proﬁt for your shareholders' equity,
which seems really very high, considering the low growth.

FINAL

Is there any thought at all to increase this 50%/80% to 50%/90%, or just to go a bit
somewhat higher than the current level? Thanks.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Hi, Gianandrea. I can comment the last question. And Catharina can give you some more
information related to the ﬁrst question.
As Catharina said, our payout ratio, which we have communicated to the market, is 50%
to 80%. And you are right, we had an excess position. It's still a signiﬁcant part of the
result left. But as we have this structurally 50% to 80%, we think it's right now level to
deliver in the high end of that range.
And as we have said several times before, when we have visibility related to regulation,
both for ourselves and the life sector in Norway, we will look into this capital situation, in
more detail. I think we'll look into this during 2013. And then we can take a new type of
communication after that.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thanks.

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

And now your ﬁrst question about the normalized investment income level. Of course, it's
not possible to give you a normalized level of investment income. But I think what's
important is to bear in mind that the asset allocation -- or the asset management is not a
proﬁt of Gjensidige; it's there to support the technical -- or the Insurance operation. So, of
course, the main part of the Investment portfolio is the Match portfolio; reﬂecting a very -or a long investment risk proﬁle.
Of course, have some -- as we have the strong capital position of Gjensidige, we have risk
capacity; which is reﬂected in the Free portfolio, where we do have, amongst other,
convertible bonds and equities, etc. But I think, again, it's also a rather conservative
portfolio with a large degree of interest rate income -- investment -- instruments in the
Free portfolio as well.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yes. Well, I wasn't really trying to say that it's an aggressive mix. But there are these three
categories in there, where the returns are clearly signiﬁcantly above the normal. So I was
trying to get an understanding, how much with the current asset mix you are making a
normal year, because some of your peers give us that kind of information. But it doesn't
matter, that's helpful. Thanks a lot.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Two questions, a bit on the nitty-gritty part. But ﬁrst on the Bank, your loan-loss rate is
coming down quite materially in the Fourth Quarter. We have seen that you have built up
your loan losses quite extensively, over a period of time. Any chances that you will not
build as much loan losses up next year, as you have been doing the last couple of years?
That was the ﬁrst question.
And the second question, related to Kim's presentation on Denmark. And the growth
prospects. It seems now you're focusing a lot on the Danish residential property market
getting some life back.
Isn't the key issue that your key distribution partner, Nykredit, they are providing a lot of
residential mortgages. But they're not providing it themselves, they're providing it
through their partner banks, which are typically cooperating with Krogen on the P&C side.
Any chance, any ambitions to get into that deal. And take that deal away from Krogen,
related to the -- to take the Bank? That was the two questions.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think Kim can think about the second question. And maybe Catharina can comment the
Bank, Per.

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

If you are looking at the write-downs and losses in percentage terms, for the Bank it has
come down from 2011; 0.65% to 0.43% in 2012.
I think it also reﬂects the fact that the unsecured lending part of the portfolio decreases as
the secured lending part of the Bank actually increased in size more than the unsecured
lending part of the business. So there are no major changes in the portfolio as such, or
any speciﬁc events or trends in the portfolio.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

But I guess the actual realized losses, they are still extremely low?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Sorry?

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

The actual losses, the realized losses in the Banking portfolio, they remain pretty low, I
guess?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

It's -- if you look at the secured lending portfolio, it is, I suppose, a portfolio with a very -what we think a conservative risk proﬁle; as you can see, on average, the loan to asset
value ratio of around 60%. So these are many quarters of low risk lending.

FINAL

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

I'm thinking more about the consumer part of the portfolio.

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

The consumer part of the portfolio is relatively lower than the secured part of the
portfolio, as the secured part of the portfolio then increased in a higher percentage than
the unsecured part of the portfolio.

A - Kim Rud-Petersen
Per?

Kim here. I was just wondering, where are you from in Denmark?

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

I'm from Denmark, from Danske, I'm living in the Copenhagen area.

A - Kim Rud-Petersen
Okay. Thank you. I'm not sure if I understand -- understood your question right. But
related to our distribution power through real estate agents, due to our partnership with
Nykredit. But also EDC, I don't know if you caught that one. Well, EDC is the largest, as
you know, real estate agent in Denmark.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

But no ambition, no opening to actually get a cooperation with the banks that are selling
the Nykredit product, because I guess that would be the key entrance point to clients, to
be a better entrance point than (multiple speakers).

A - Kim Rud-Petersen
So you're asking if we in Gjensidige would sell Nykredit bank products?

Okay. You mean through Totalkredit?

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Exactly.

A - Kim Rud-Petersen
Well, it's diﬃcult for me to have creative thoughts on what future initiatives we can take.
But I think I can reveal that I want to explore as much of -- all the opportunities we can get
through the cooperation with Nykredit and EDC. I think -- as the situation is right now, I
think there are some restrictions for the distribution and cross-selling from Totalkredit.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Two things, ﬁrst of all you mentioned that you will be looking at this excess capital
position during the year; at least that's what I understood. But is there potential for the
ROE target to be also reconsidered, maybe a higher number on a post-tax basis or
something on those lines, which even if you say to me that we are reconsidering that also.
I just want conﬁrmation.
And second thing is on the normalization again. Because all the -- all of the Nordic
companies are reporting all-time low combined ratios, one question that often comes up
in mind is that as a cycle is nearing its peak or -- and which is probably nearing. But then
what would be the rate of normalization?
So if you could comment on just that thought because this is the ﬁrst time and the Fourth
Quarter normalization. But I'm wondering if the normalization has continued and at what
pace, or do you expect it to continue?
And just very lastly, very last question, in the Denmark presentation there was a lot of
mention of -- I think, twice or thrice a mention of how the IT system is ready to incorporate
any new portfolios. And just now there was a question as well. So are you deemed to go
in organically as well in Denmark? Thank you.

FINAL

I can comment on the ﬁrst question. As you know, the present capital situation, the
present dividend policy and the present ROE target are closely linked together. So when
we look into the whole capital discussion, we will, of course, look into all the related
targets.
And the ROE target today, it's a pre-tax target of 15%. It's related, of course, to the excess
position and the capital position we have today. So yes, of course, we will look into
combined set of targets when we will take this discussion with the Board of Directors in
Gjensidige. Did you catch the second question, Catharina?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Normalized levels of combined ratio.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Normal combined rations, okay. I can start on that question as well. Today we have an
overall target of 90% to 93% combined ratio. As you remember, we delivered 91.9% in
2011. 1.9% was related to extreme weather. And we had a run-oﬀ gain of 2.1%.

Bloomberg Transcript

When we operate with 90% to 93%, it's given that we had best estimate for run-oﬀs that
means zero. It's also given that we have a normalized situation related to large claims. So
when you adjust the 2011 ﬁgures, with the extreme weather, 1.9% and the fact that we had
2.1% run-oﬀ gain, we are just in the middle of that corridor 90% to 93%.
If you take the same exercise for 2012, we reported an 85.3% combined ratio. And if you
add 1.9% run-oﬀ gain. And we also had 1.5% less large percentage, related to less large
claims up against the normalized level, it's 88.7% and that's below the corridor 90% to
93%. But what we have commented. And this is in line with what we have seen from Tryg
and Sampo as well, it has been a very low frequency during 2012.
So the normalized combined ratio we really think that's in our corridor 90% to 93% for the
moment. That's the normalized situation related to the frequency. That's the normalized
situation related to large claims. So 90% to 93% is our best estimate going forward.

A - Kim Rud-Petersen
Then you had a question regarding Nordic related to the fact that we now have a
common Nordic IT platform and we now easily are able to integrate new portfolios. As I
believe I mentioned, we are focusing on proﬁtable growth. And then primarily through
acquisitions. But however, we feel it's a question of being rational and patient. With other
words, we don't want to pay too much for any portfolio.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay. And when you say portfolio, you mean business from seeded clients or you mean
companies? That was my question really.
