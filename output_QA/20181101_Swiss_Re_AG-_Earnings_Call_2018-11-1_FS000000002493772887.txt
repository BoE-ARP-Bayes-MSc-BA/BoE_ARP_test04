MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Thank you very much, and good afternoon or morning to all on the call. I'd just like to
quickly introduce the nine-month results with a couple of thoughts of my own. And then,
we turn quickly over to questions. The first to say the obvious, at nine months we do have
a very positive result $1.1 billion for our net income. I think the magnitude of the losses that
we've had from nat cat sector materially different than last year, but the third quarter
reminded us that in fact these losses will recur and recur across various jurisdictions.
The second point, the resilience of our P&C Re business in spite of those large manmade and nat cat losses $634 million of profit for the first nine months annualized ROE
above 8%. I think a resilient business, which we expect to continue to be able to grow as
we've done modestly in the first nine months of 2018.
Third, the very strong performance I would argue of the Life & Health Reinsurance, again,
$640 million of profits for the (00:01:20) nine months and annualized ROE above 12%.
Importantly, also a real growth in this business coming from a combination of an
expansion in high growth markets broadly in China, specifically and the continued success
in bringing home important transactions in more developed markets.

FINAL

Fourth, on the investment side a stable running yield of 2.9%, we started to see interest
rates move up in the U.S. Unfortunately, not much motion in Continental Europe.
Nonetheless, we've been able to predict (00:02:00) that running yield.
Overall, the return on investments of 2.8%, if you adjust for the U.S. GAAP change in
guidance, it would have been 3.0% for the nine months. And last, I'm sure most of you
have noticed, we published a Group SST estimate for July 1 of this year, a positive
movement from the beginning of the year from 269% at January 1 to 285% at July 1. This
reflects what we believe to be a continuing increase in the value generation of the Group.
We'll have more details on the full year number when we publish it based on the full year
EVM results.
And with that, I'd turn it over to our host again today, Philippe Brahin to manage the
questions.

Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Many thanks, John, and good day to all of you also from my side. So as you know, we have
adjusted the format of our reporting and our comments during the call will be focused on
our nine-month results, in line with the scope of our press release. Also and as usual, I
would like to ask you to restrict yourself to two questions and register again for follow-up
questions. In the room here today, we have also Edi Schmid, our Group Chief Underwriting
Officer to answer your questions.

Bloomberg Transcript

So with that operator, could we please have the first question?

Q&A
Operator
The first question here is from Edward Morris from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Gentlemen (00:03:33), thanks for taking my questions. Two, please. The first is on Life &
Health. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about the performance there,
because you seem to be suggesting that the capital generation and EVM and Solvency
Swiss – SST seems to be very strong. So I just wonder if you can talk a little bit more about
that and maybe anything that we can't see just from the – our first sort of U.S. GAAP net
income figure?
And the second question is on your comments about future actions on the capital
management. It seems to be a sort of slight change in tone from the way you've talked
about things previously that I appreciate you're still referring back to the Group priorities,
but can you just talk a bit about what you mean there and is there any sort of timing that
you may have in mind for something?

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Thank you, Ed. John, do you want to start.

FINAL

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Sure. I think. I probably take both of those. On Life & Health, I think, we've been trying to
emphasize two things. One, based on some important restructuring we did in Life &
Health Re in 2013-2014, we put ourselves on a path to long-term profitability. You see that
in the U.S. GAAP results, which have met the target, we put out of 10% to 12% ROE. But
more importantly or as importantly from our point of view is, the continued progress of
our EVM results on the Life & Health side.
We haven't released those for nine months, but reach back all the way to a year-end 2017,
I think you'll see a continued positive movement in the EVM earnings of Life & Health that
actually exceed the U.S. GAAP and demonstrated the what we're putting on the books
today provides the opportunity for future earnings, which will come through the U.S.
GAAP's accounts as these portfolios continue to mature.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, and since the EVM is the basis for the calculations on the SST, that's where you see
the positive impact coming through as well. Vis-à-vis capital management, I'd say the tone
is not materially different. We've said for quite some time, our goal in the first case is to
protect the dividend to be sure that we are able to fund new business opportunities,
deploy the capital organically in the first case inorganically should the opportunities arise,
we've demonstrated examples of this with a bolt-on acquisitions we've done in
Corporate Solutions.
And at the end of the day, if we find ourselves with more capital that we can successfully
deploy on a value creating basis, we will return it to shareholders. We started the buyback
program in 2018. And without the caveats that we've had on previous years, we're well
along in that share buyback program with respect to any capital management issues
regarding 2019. I think it's safe to say we'll wait for our full year results and engage in any
(00:06:47) appropriate discussions with our own Board of Directors and let people know
subsequent.
All right. Thank you, John. Thank you, Ed, for your questions. Can we have the next
question please?

Operator
The next question is from Gandhi Vikram from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Firstly, can I just check how far is cautious (00:07:10)
aggregate cover from attaching (00:07:12) and if you've already had some recoveries.
Can you share how far is it from the point of exhaustion? Secondly, given some of the
recent court rulings in the U.S., can you shed some light on your comfort level around the
Group's asbestos results? Thank you.

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Thanks. Maybe, Edi, you want to take those questions.

FINAL

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

So, the first one if I understand correct is on CorSo's aggregate cover we put in place as
we mentioned in previous calls to protect the portfolio a bit better not just from large
(00:07:41) events, but we have also put something in place that protects them against a
series of mid-sized hurricanes. I mean, so far we have seen Hurricane Florence, which
disclosed as a total for the group of $120 million and about half of that is in CorSo. So,
CorSo is still well protected by the aggregate. So, it's not yet close to that aggregate
cover. Yeah. I think that's how we've described the situation.
And the second is around A&D reserves. And actually our P&C reserves in the third
quarter a tiny bit negative, and that's one reason as we strengthened A&D to some
extent in this quarter. Overall, we think we're now fine in line with all the different
benchmarks we used to set A&D reserves. So, yeah, that's how I would describe A&D.

The next question is from Thomas Seidl from Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. First, ReAssure Life capital (00:08:45) suffered from
the weak UK capital markets. I wonder if you could give us an update on how this would
influence and where you are actually in your preparations to IPO ReAssure. Is it getting
more difficult now? And how are you doing there?
And secondly, I go back to this capital thing. I mean with this SST ratio, you published
today you have $11 billion of excess capital according to your own metrics. So, you would
need to write another $11 billion of premium to consume this capital, which probably is not
likely in the next couple of years. So, what keeps you actually from making a more
significant (00:09:25), let's say, bring it down by $5 billion, $6 billion?

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

All right. John, Back to you.

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Thomas, I'll take both of these. With respect to the IPO, what I can say is, the preparation
continues the pace. I really have no new insights for you compared to where we were in
August. We specifically said, we would expect to be able to go to an IPO sometime in
2019 without being very specific about precise timing. Obviously, we will pay attention to
Page 4 of 13



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2018-11-01

FINAL

market conditions, but that's not new, it's exactly what we've told you back in August. So,
again, nothing changed there.
With respect to capital, I take your point that 285% is quite some distance away from
220% and arguably is moving at least on one dimension further way during the course of
2018, at least as of July 1. The year is not over and let's see where we actually land the
year. But the opportunity is for us to rethink where the capital is required. We'll continue to
be a point of discussion for the executive committee and ultimately, the board of the
group. I will suggest that one of the reasons why this number remains relatively high
relates to our defensive posturing on asset risk.
We remain in a range that's defined by our strategic asset allocation. So, there's been no
fundamental change in the ranges that we've put on since the beginning of the year. But
we remain cautious in accepting additional asset risk. You could imagine the situations
where some combination of opportunities for writing new reinsurance and then primary
insurance business, plus a – some increases in asset risk in the future would provide
opportunities to deploy a substantial amount of those capital.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

All right. Thank you so much for your questions. Can we have the next question please.

Bloomberg Transcript

The next question is from Sami Taipalus from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my question. My first one is actually
coming back to the capital generation in the first half, which was very strong. Is it possible
to give just a little bit more of a breakdown of what was behind that capital generation? I
mean, you already alluded I supposed a little bit to the Life & Health Reinsurance new
business, but if it's possible to just potentially spit out any market movements, or
management actions or anything like that, that would be really helpful.
And then the second thing comes back to your I suppose comments about dividend
capacity, you linked be I suppose capital returns to this SST ratios somewhat in the
statement. Is that, we should think about it or actually, do we also need to cross check it
against the capital you have available at the holding company level, because I guess that
the two are not necessarily directly linked? Thank you.

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

So, Sami, to your latter point, yes, there are multiple dimensions which we evaluate the
dividend capacity. The Group SST is clearly, one of them available capital that we do have
at the holding company, a second and overall liquidity position. I'd say, at the moment, we
remain in fairly robust shape on most dimensions. And so, that's the starting point and
frankly a good place to be in these times where we've started to see some increase in

FINAL

volatility, both in financial markets and some real losses coming through in the third
quarter on the insurance side.
We're not providing much more detail about the development of the SST at six months.
I'd remind you that 285% is an estimate. We think it's probably a pretty good estimate,
but has not been audited. It doesn't go through the same rigor that we have for the full
year result and therefore, I think my comments before about, relatively modest levels of
asset risk in the big picture and a clear capital generation of our first half businesses
including in Life & Health is about as much detail as we're prepared to provide at this
point.

A - Philippe Brahin

The next question is from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, there. I think both questions for Edi. First of all, could you give us an update on the reunderwriting cost? So, well, both I guess both partly maybe underwriting, you were
planning to do the portfolio cleanups and also progress on achieved average increasing
rate that you've managed and of course so to-date?
And secondly, can I just follow-up on the reserve comment you made for P&C Re. I think
there was some adverse outside of the asbestos review. Is that the same problem areas
as in the first half, which I think was particularly U.S. also related liability? Is it something
new? Is this part of a sort of lumpy review process just any bit more color straightly
assurance would be helpful. Thanks.

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Andrew, for these two questions. On the first one around re-underwriting,
both P&C and CorSo. Like what we highlighted over the last few quarters that we took
quite a different deal particularly on U.S. motor that's a bit older, but also on the U.S.
liability and there, particularly when it comes to large corporate risks, where we have seen
just significant large verdicts and settlement.
So our portfolio prioritization clearly U.S. liability, is very much prioritized, or what we call
risk reduction, margin improvement and not for growth. And on the other hand, more the
short-term business, the property cat business with great stabilization, even some rate
increases. We have started to grow that business a little further. And actually, we're on a
good track to achieve this portfolio actions and that over time it will also help the
underlying combined ratio. So there's no change in this prioritization, we'll continue also
on this path into 2019.

And on the second one regarding the P&C Re reserves, so for nine months overall,
reserves development for P&C Re is positive. It's just the third quarter, it's a little bit
negative. And one comment I made, which strengthened asbestos and environmental a
bit and the other contributor is actually some man-made losses from previous accident
years that had to be strengthened this time on the P&C Re side. But we don't see any
let's say underlying voting trends and we continue to be very confident with the overall
reserves assessed independently at the Group actual control level in the 60% to 80%
range.
So A&E will strengthen a bit in Q3 and a couple of man-made losses from previous
accident years were strengthened. That explains the tiny negative, but overall still in the
positive territory for P&C Re.

A - Philippe Brahin

Thanks, Andrew for your questions. Can we have the next question please?

The next question is from William Hawkins from KBW. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you very much. First of all, in Christian Mumenthaler's closing remarks in your
press release, he refers to an inflection point in the P&C Reinsurance pricing cycle. Could
you elaborate on the extent to which that's a confident forward-looking statements?
Because we know the rates increased in the first half of this year, but my understanding
was the momentum was very much coming back, if not actually back in a declining mode
into January. So, could you just discuss a little bit more – you mean by an inflection point of
pricing?
And then secondly, clearly, we don't have all the detail for the nine months or third
quarter, so it's a bit tricky. But you've told us very clearly that P&C Re has had some pretty
big knockouts. You've talked about negative reserve developments. My inference from
that is the underlying attritional experience has been extremely good since you've last
reported, is that kind of fair? And if so, why has the underlying experience excluding cats
and reserve development being circa? Thank you.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Thanks, William. I think, Edi, this is all for you.

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Williams. On the first one, regarding inflection point. And maybe if we go
back after the record losses in 2017, that clearly was an expectation that there would be a
significant inflection point particularly for P&C Re, we have achieved in our business. In
P&C Re, on the cat business and other parts some improvement, maybe not as strong as
expected and it's fair to say that momentum was not too strong throughout the year.

Company N ame: Swiss Re AG

FINAL

Let me talk about the inflection point. I think it's more important not just to look at
reinsurance but to look at P&C business globally and there over the course of this year, if
you look at all the indices produced, we clearly see positive rate trend now in the
commercial businesses. It was still a bit slower in the first six to nine months. Just more
recently we see even a bit more momentum there in markets like Australia, markets like
Germany, where clearly there's more pain than before. We actually see positive
momentum and that paints this picture of an inflection point.
And then, I would also refer to a sigma study we released a couple of months ago, where
we analyzed by the institutes, the five, six biggest P&C markets overall. And there, you
can clearly see that if you want to achieve a sustainable return on equity above cost of
capital, these P&C markets overall, so really the original business likes quite a bit of
underwriting margin. So, these pictures together with the loss to the CDC development
see in many markets we feel as this is an inflection year.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then on your second one is the combined ratio for P&C Re at 99.5%. I think it's
important to look at it on a normalized basis. We have this significant loss burden from nat
cats and from man-made. But it's important to differentiate the first six months were
actually very benign. We had hardly anything on the reinsurance side and Q3 as a
standalone quarter, clearly above average, but if you take everything together, both nat
cat and man-made, this loss burden is broadly in line is what we would expect for the year.
And that's also why we still feel the target or the estimate we gave for the full year of
99% combined ratio. We are set to achieve this over the full year. Maybe what is important
to reflect that actually that the third quarter is quite a hectic one in terms of nat cat
exposure, so also we earn a lot of the margin in that year, that's make it a hint on why the
combined ratio could be bit lower in your analysis. And also, what I referred to before, we
continue to have a rather course stance on U.S. casualty business, while we try to go a bit
more on property cat again, which will also help the combined ratio a bit to trend a bit
more to the low end as.
And then obviously, we have achieved underlying improvements in the P&C Re book. The
quality is improving. So, that takes time to earn through, but we start to see some impact
of this. So, the bottom line is overall for this year, we still think the 99% combined ratio
P&C Re is a good estimate.

FINAL

Hi. I have two questions. The first one is just on I guess the different – I guess, the first one
to add is on the difference in renewals and the dynamics between I guess $1.1 billion and
$1.4 billion, and kind of how you think this might impact the 99% combined ratio's starting
point that you just talked about? So, that's first question. And the second question, just
coming back to ratio, ahead of any potential IPO share. Can you just remind us, if there
are any additional kind of pockets to cash, so any kind of cash optimization that you might
be able to do and kind of dividend up to creep ahead of that? Thank you.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Thanks. Edi, you start it and John, I guess.

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

So, the question is about, let's say, the different renewal timing, so you referred to $1.1
billion and $1.4 billion, maybe you also meant to include $1.7 billion, yeah. So, we had $1.1
billion, where we only have moderate price increases, it was mainly the European book.
Then we have Japan, $1.4 billion, where I think the picture was largely flat and then we had
probably some improvement, but also our business flattish into $1.7 billion, yeah. So,
actually, it was not a very different pattern across these renewal cycles.

Bloomberg Transcript

What is again important to understand is how these businesses earned, so it's the lag in
terms of renewal cycles and that is how the businesses earned on a GAAP basis. So, this
year still we earn about 50% of the business return in 2017, where there was some rather
quality reduction. Now, the business grow this year, 50% of these improved business will
only be earned into 2019, so there's as always this gap here.
It will turn out now in $1.1 billion, that remains to be seen. We still expect a flattish type of
environment. There's still capital out there and quite a bump ins, that's fair to say. But as I
explained before there's also losses. There is pain in the system. So, for P&C Re, a flattish
outlook I think is the least we expect.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

So, Edi, my question relates to the first half, as it relates to kind of your difference in
upcoming dynamic is for $1.1 billion versus $1.4 billion.

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Okay.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

I don't know $1.7 billion a little bit far away?

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Yeah. So, the only point I would make in this respect is obviously, there are significant
losses out of Japan with Typhoon Jebi, where we said it's about $6 billion market events
and our share about $500 million, they were also smaller losses. So, that will clearly drive
Page 9 of 13



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2018-11-01

the dynamics of $1.4 billion, which is mainly at Japanese one. And $1.1 billion is mainly
Europe, where there was not significant loss activity, so that is this flat picture. It's probably
a fair view.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

FINAL

Thanks, Edi. Maybe John, on the ReAssure.

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

On ReAssure, again, I'm not allowed to say vis-à-vis the actual IPO process other than we
continue to move ahead as planned. The one thing I would say is the Life Capital is a
division, demonstrated a continued strong growth cash generation up to $1 billion for the
first nine months here. And among other things, this provides opportunities for some
flexibility as we think about right capitalization levels and potential dividends before, after
IPOs. But the IPO itself is – there's no real news on.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Thanks, Kamran, for your questions. Can we have the next question please?

Operator
The next question is from Frank Kopfinger from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. I have also two questions. My first question is on your tax
effects. Obviously, if whenever you have high loss burden, there are some sort of offset
to our tax effect. Can you shed some light on how big they have been in Q3 in P&C and
CorSo? And then secondly, can you also provide some thoughts on Hurricane Michael and
your potential loss there?

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

All right. Maybe John on tax and Edi on Michael.

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

So, on tax – you're right, the geography which absorbs the losses has a different tax
impact. I would simply suggest, we are in a little different world with the U.S. corporate tax
down to 21%, the variations are smaller than they used to be. We have put in place the
Swiss Re AG Limited regional coding company in Singapore, which has a even lower tax
rate. So, some of the tax laws carry forward some losses that would be booked through
Singapore might be even more modest than the 21% that we'd see in either Switzerland
or the United States. But net-net our goal is to make money here and the after tax effect
and how important to us is less important when we get back on our feet in terms of the
underwriting.

On Michael, maybe I'll just jump in, Frank, we really can't say anything yet about what
those losses might be that will be part of the fourth quarter. And we've got no clear line
of sight of either our position or frankly our own Swiss Re estimate, you've seen the
market estimates here between CHF 6 billion and CHF 10 billion, that does not feel
unreasonable.

FINAL

Edi, you might have additional view?

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

I would also have quoted some of these loss estimates from CHF 6 billion to CHF 10
billion, that's not unreasonable. What I would also point out that Swiss Re is a little bit
under rate in Florida, as we have commented in the past. So, as John said, it's too early to
come up with any specific at this point. But also as we said, we still think the 99%
combined ratio is a reasonable estimate for the full year. So, I think that describes the
picture.

A - Philippe Brahin

The next question is from Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thanks for my questions. Two quick ones. So, firstly, how is the profitability of the
casualty book developing in recent underwriting, as far as your expectations please? And
secondly, what's your FX growth in both P&C Re and CorSo, going into 2019, should the
pricing environment be flat? And should we expect any mix changes in P&C? Thank you.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Edi, do you want to take the two questions?

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

So, the first one is on Casualty quality of the portfolio, as I commented on earlier,
particularly in the U.S. market, on the motor side, but also on the liability side, portfolios
where we push for risk reduction for margin improvements we have achieved. Some of
that this year. We still think that market has to improve further. I think the pain is increasing
in U.S. liability. But as always, I will not make too many forward-looking comments on how it
turns out.
Your second question is more about the outlook in terms of growth. I would also there
reiterate what we said earlier, which is let's say a flattish price environment, the quality of
our book in good shape, we will capture opportunities, speed on the transactional side
also in some of the core business, cat business we clearly have appetite. We like that
business so is the stable pricing of further slight increases will also grow in some of these

segments. So overall there is the potential for growth, but it goes without saying that we'll
still do that with underwriting discipline.

All right. Thank you Jonny for your questions. Can we have the next question please?

Operator
The next question is from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. First question please. Just maybe a bit of extra comment please on
Corporate Solutions where the 1H growth was 18.5% and the nine month data is 9%. Is this
just normal volatility? Is it just – is it that with management change CorSo, you're making a
step change or you're planning some step changes? Just to hear some thoughts on
CorSo growth please in the first half and nine months?

And second question is, just a bit more, in last night's reporting, AIG has flagged that they
expect a lot of the fourth quarter losses to come to the reinsurance market, because the
attachment points are being hit, I mean generally do you think there's been bit more
aggregate sort of covers being sold to clients from your perspective or market
perspective? And are these some things that are going to be important as we think of the
next year, but also fourth quarter? Thank you very much.

Edi, you take those questions?

On CorSo growth 18% (00:31:32) versus 9%, so 9% is for the first nine months, so that's in
line with strategy to grow that book and most of that comes from the Primary Lead
initiative which starts to bear some fruit and I would again also point to the joint venture
Bradesco in Brazil, that adds to the growth.
The reason why this is more in the first six versus now, because (00:31:53) is a one off
effect, but I don't want to go into the details there. And the second one regarding this AIG
comment, so we'll not comment on any company individually, but your comment was
more regarding aggregate covers in the market. I mean aggregate covers is nothing new
and have been around for a long time.
Since we have (00:32:13) written some of those and we'd also continue to do so. It can be
a very good mean to take out volatility from an insurance company. But, obviously, it will
be underwritten with the necessary rigor. All we have to be careful at this point in time
that as a reinsurer, you should not take let's say the better part of the business away from
the seeding companies (00:32:37). So it just has to make – to make sense. But aggregate
as such is a valuable reinsurance tool. We used to support our insurance company clients

with the necessary underwriting discipline that's a product, where actually we made
decent returns over many years.
