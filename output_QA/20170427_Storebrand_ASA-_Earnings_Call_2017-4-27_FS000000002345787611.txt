Operator
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Storebrand Analyst Call. My
name is Dave and I'll be your coordinator for today's conference. For the duration of the
call, your lines will be on listen-only, however, at the end of the presentation, you'll have
the opportunity to ask questions.
I will now hand you over to Kjetil Krøkje to begin today's conference. Thank you.

Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje
Thanks and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Storebrand's ﬁrst quarter
2017 conference call. My name is Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje and I'm Head of Investor Relations
at Storebrand. Together with me today, I have Group CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad, CFO, Lars
Løddesøl, Finance Director, Sigbjørn Birkeland, and Head of Economic Capital, Trond
Finn Eriksen.
In the presentation today, Odd Arild will give us an overall view of the development in the
ﬁrst quarter 2017 and Lars will give some more details on some elements in the result and
economic capital developments. The slides will be similar to the analyst presentation
released this morning and are available on our webpage.
After the presentation, the operator will open up for questions. To be able to ask
questions, you will need to dial in to the conference call.

Thank you, Kjetil. Let's turn then directly to the results. The Group results before
amortization and write-down was NOK 671 million for the quarter. This is a strong result,
driven by strong underwriting results and good ﬁnancial results.
The growth within savings continues while the guaranteed products are in long-term runoﬀ. This is illustrated by our asset growth of 17% within Unit Link and growth of 32% within
retail loans.
The underlying solvency position is increased by 3 percentage points during the quarter,
347%. Since ﬁrst quarter 2016, we have resumed dividend payments and increased the
solvency position with 30 percentage points. This represents a normalization of our
capital situation and the real value creation for shareholders. The solvency ratio including
transitional rules is 159%.

Bloomberg Transcript

The real value creation is also reﬂected in our disclosure of the group economic capital of
NOK 88 per share. Lars, will relate to this measure later on.
Then let's move to slide number 3. This slide illustrates the two-fold strategy we have
been implementing consistently through this last ﬁve years. The two-fold strategy will
continue to be important going forward, with capitalized growth within savings and
insurance and capital released from the guarantee's back book, which now have reached
its peak capital consumption level.
Then we move to slide number 4. Looking at Storebrand's solvency position, investment
allocation and segmentation together with strong returns and good results, strengthened
the solvency position without transitional rules with 3 percentage points from 144% to
147% in the quarter. With transitional rules, it's 159%.
It is also equally important to be aware of the sensitivities. EIOPA has announced changes
in the estimate forward rate, UFR methodology. It will fall from today's level of 4.2% to
3.65% over the next four years. This weakens, everything equal, the solvency position with
about 7% points when it's fully implemented. This is without transitional rules. And please
note that of course this change is very sensitive to the interest rate levels. The change will
gradually be phased in by 15 basis points a year and we expect between one to two
percentage points eﬀect from next year.
Then let's move to slide number 5. Looking at the changes in the solvency position in the
quarter, there are three factors worth mentioning. One, it's model and assumption
changes that causes a 3 percentage points reduction in the quarter. This is mainly due to
reduced volatility adjustment and increased equity stress, both of which are calculated by
EIPOA (05:22).

FINAL

Number two, Storebrand has had good results in the quarter, which has contributed to
increase solvency position in addition to strong growth in deﬁned-contribution pension.
Storebrand has now completed its resource strengthening for longevity, which means that
we have been able to further address our investment portfolios to Solvency II. This
contributes to strengthening their solvency position. On the contrary, the increase in the
paid up portfolio reduces their solvency. Overall, we see a strengthening of the solvency
position of 3 percentage points from operations.
Number 3 there has been good ﬁnancial markets in Q1. This means that, we have not only
achieved the expected risk premiums in the markets, but also achieved returns billings,
what we can normally expect in the quarter. We (06:31) to look at this as economic
variants and equity, real estate and reduced credit spread has yield returns in the quarter.
If we then move to slide number 6, to give some more comments around the peak capital
statements. As we enter 2017, more than 50% of our assets under management are from
non-guaranteed products.
Taking a longer view, we see that the proportion is expected to increase to more than
80% in a 10 years' time. This has very positive implications for capital requirements,
quality of earnings, free cash ﬂow and dividend capacity. We work to signiﬁcantly increase
the latter and see strong increase in free cash ﬂows going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

Growth in Savings and Insurance going forward is capital eﬃcient. So, we will be able to
combine growth and strong dividend capacity going forward.
Then let's move to slide number 7, and let's go a bit deeper into the growth part of our
strategy. The growth in the Unit Linked business and Asset Management continues. The
Unit Linked business grew by 17%, and the Asset Management business grew by 6%. The
growth within Insurance was lower than we want to see. This is caused by our shift from
expensive external distribution to more cost-eﬀective internal distribution. This together
with a transition to our new disability pension product in Norway, implies a lower growth
rate in 2017.
Last, but not least, we still grow (08:34) our retail mortgage portfolio. We grew the
lending portfolio by over 30%. The new loans are mainly placed in the Life balance sheet.
So by that, I'll leave the word to Lars.

Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Good afternoon. Please turn to page 10. NOK 463 million in operating proﬁt is somewhat
weaker than the market and we ourselves expect. It is the result of the speed of
conversion from deﬁned-beneﬁt to deﬁned contribution, as well as lower transaction fees
and somewhat inﬂated operating cost in the quarter.

FINAL

The Group result of NOK 671 million is strengthened by a good ﬁnancial returns, we've
had a good return on our investments beneﬁting both, customers and shareholders. With
a book (09:29) return in Q1, we have for all practical purposes ﬁnished the reserve
strengthening for longevity. The formal completion of this will happen at the year-end. We
also strengthened our buﬀers, especially in Sweden.
Please turn to page 11. Fee and administration result is down by 1%, currency adjusted in
the quarter, we've had a strong Insurance result with fewer large claims and reduced
payouts and claims already reserved for. The cost level is slightly up in the quarter, but
approximately NOK 30 million relates to issues that are non-recurring, relating to
expenses from 2016 or otherwise, say, one-oﬀ nature. Other costs are related to double
expenses as we continue the transfer of operations to Cognizant.

Bloomberg Transcript

We reiterate our stated objective of lower costs in 2018 compared to 2015. The number of
employees is down by more than 10% since the beginning of 2016 and will go down
further. We expect full impact from ongoing cost initiatives by the end of this year. The
ﬁnancial results are strong and lead to a proﬁt split in the Swedish Guaranteed portfolios,
as well as a good return in company portfolios. Tax is estimated at 19% in the quarter.
Please turn to page 12. The lower table shows the same results as we saw on the previous
page. Savings non-guaranteed shows declining results. The revenue is ﬂat, but allocated
costs are up as a result of the strategic shift in the Group. The development is positive in
all four underlying business areas or business lines within non-guaranteed Savings and we
do expect improved results going forward. The Insurance results are satisfactory, despite
low growth. Guaranteed shows a signiﬁcant improvement from last year due to proﬁt
splits in Sweden and lower allocated costs. Over time, this result will be declining.
Please turn to page 20. Storebrand has for the last 15 to 20 years published economic
capital ﬁgures. Previously this was done according to the embedded value method. Last
year, we changed to the Solvency II method, but with a few speciﬁc amendments. The
amendments look at the speciﬁc situation for the Group, realistic market expectations,
and a method closely linked to the previous Market Consistent Embedded Value
methodology.
Please note that the numbers are as of year-end 2016. According Solvency II, we have
NOK 42.1 billion in capital. However, Solvency II does not include the value the life
company generates in the rest of the Group. Under embedded value, we can include the
net present value of the value generated in Storebrand Asset Management from
managing the Storebrand life assets. This is called look through value and adds NOK 2.7
billion to the capital.
Under Solvency II, we can only include the value of existing business. Under embedded
value, we can include future premiums on existing contracts. As corporate pensions is a
legal requirement in Norway, we have included future premiums on existing contracts,
and the proﬁt they will generate, and the cost of collecting these premiums. And thirdly,
Solvency II requires a harsh stress from customer lapse. 70% lapse in corporate market
and 40% lapse in the retail market is not realistic in small markets like Norway and

FINAL

Sweden. We have adjusted these stresses to 20%. This gives us an economic capital of
NOK 46.8 billion by the end of 2016.
If we move over to page 21, we can see the movement in reconciliation reserve from 2015
to 2016. First, we have made adjustment to assumptions and model changes. Improving
modeling and updated operational assumptions reduced capital by approximately NOK
600 million. Secondly, we have the proﬁtable growth in the business combined with the
reduced costs, good returns, and reserve strengthening minus margin pressure and an
increased number of paid-up policies makes operational changes which positively
impacts the capital of NOK 3.5 billion. Thirdly, changes in the interest rate level, volatility
and volatility adjustment, reduces capital by NOK 200 million. In addition a new – we
subordinated loan as well as retained earnings increased the economic capital to NOK
46.8 billion by the end of last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

With this we have a total economic capital of NOK 46.8 billion. By deducting what is
related to subordinated loans, we get an economic capital which belongs to the
shareholders of NOK 39.6 billion or NOK 88.4 per share. And I take the liberty of
mentioning that before 2008 and the ﬁnancial crisis, group like ours were typically valued
at embedded value times a multiple. In addition, value of new business was often added
to that by a factor of 10 or so. And the value of new business written last year was
approximately NOK 0.5 billion.
That's all I was going to go through now, but I would also like to mention to you that there
is a lot of good Solvency II capital information in the appendix this time, and I'm sure
some of you have a particular interest in looking into that and we'd be happy to take
questions on that topic as well.
And with that, I leave the word back to Kjetil.

Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje
Thank you, Lars. The operator will now open up for questions, please.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. The ﬁrst question is from Paul De'Ath from RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yeah. Hi there. And thanks for taking my questions and a couple please. Firstly, just
looking at margin pressure and it seems to be coming through in the non-guaranteed
Savings business, and also to some extent in the banking business line, just – and I'd
interesting to hear kind of where you think that's going? Are we at a point where it's not
going to go – margin is not going to go down any further or essentially what direction is
(16:54) that?

FINAL

And then the second question is on the capital run-oﬀ. And so, you've very helpfully given
the chart on slide 6, which gives an illustration of the assets under management, which
looks to me at least that the high capital consumptive guarantees are running oﬀ pretty
slowly over that period. And would it possible to have any kind of indication of what is the
lifetime of those capital consumptive guarantees, because those are presumably the ones
that will be releasing the most capital over the future period, that would be great. Thanks.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Okay. If we start with the margin pressure, on Unit Link, if you go into the supplementary,
there seems to be margin pressure on the Swedish business, that's more of a technical
issue, that's quite stable. In Norway, there is some margin pressure on deﬁned
contribution contracts. However, there is also a shift in the balance sheet from deﬁned
contribution contracts to – or the growth in paid-up policies is much higher – sorry,
pension certiﬁcates is much higher than in the deﬁned contribution contract, which is a
positive shift in the total developmental margins in the Unit Link business. So, overall, the
Unit Link business has a fairly stable margin development, and also what we see in the
market now is fairly stable.
On the Bank side, I would like to refer you to page 14 in the booklet, where we have a
picture showing that the margin during the last ﬁve quarters went down from 120 basis
points to 103 basis points, and up again in the last quarter at 109 basis points. We were
extremely competitively priced and has a low margin in the end of last year. We re-priced
the contract in December last year, with an eﬀect from February and we haven't seen the
full impact of that during the ﬁrst quarter. During March, the margin was 117 basis points,
which should combined with the additional funds under mange – or additional lending
should improve margins and revenues in the next quarter. (19:38)

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yes. And quickly on the capital run-oﬀ on slide 6 in the presentation, you are right that the
guaranteed liabilities runs oﬀ quite slowly. But fortunately as we've also discussed before,
what also happens is that the capital requirements runs oﬀ faster than the actual reserves,
and there is a couple of reasons for that. One is that the duration gap, which exists in this
book of business gets lower every year since this is a closed book. Second, as the old
policies gets paid out to customers as pensions, the average interest rate guarantee goes
down in the book, also releasing capital from the book. So, what we have said is that
(20:30) on capital requirements from the guaranteed back book. It will start to rundown
slowly in the ﬁrst couple of years, and then it will accelerate in run oﬀ after the ﬁrst two to
three years.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Okay. Thanks.

FINAL

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just two quick ones. So ﬁrstly, now the
longevity reserves strengthening has ﬁnished, does that change anything for you in terms
of what you can remit (21:12) i.e., does that open up any entities that perhaps you haven't
been able to remit cash from before?
And secondly, the customer buﬀers in Norway fell, was that because of the – like ﬁnishing
oﬀ the longevity reserves or anything – or is there another reason for that? Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yeah. Just to start oﬀ with the – on the longevity reserves, it's – wherein most of you say
here, during the period, we have been doing longevity reservation strengthening. We
have not been able to take up a dividend from the life insurance company to the holding
company. Now, in our opinion that during this year, of course, the life insurance company
will also be able – possible to give dividend to the holding company.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl

Bloomberg Transcript

When it comes to the buﬀer capital situation, we've released some market value
adjustment reserve during the ﬁrst quarter. That's also very much due to asset allocation
changes based on, early in the quarter, due to segmentation of the portfolios. So, we
changed the segmentation and changed the asset allocation somewhat under lease.
Some of the markets have adjustment reserve attached to them and that was used for
longevity reserves, I think.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And you also saw that this change in allocation on segmentation also gave a very good
impact on the solvency capital.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Yeah. So, on the – just to follow-up quickly on the cash remittances, can you give us an
idea of the quantum, is it going to be a material number?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

You mean the result in relation to our life insurance company?

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Of course, the life insurance company is also the owner of SPP. And so, it's the main
contributor of results, and therefore for cash ﬂows in the Group. Last year, it had a proﬁt
after-tax of NOK 1.5 billion.

FINAL

The next question is from Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Ashik.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you and good afternoon. Just couple of questions. First of all, you have given
the capital that has been generated in the quarter, 3 points operating earnings. Does that
include any sort of capital release from your guaranteed book or not yet? And once it
starts releasing some capital, I mean, how should we think about the projection of this
number 3%, once capital is getting released from the guaranteed book? That's number
one.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, in terms of cost, can you just give a bit more color about what happened to the
cost? You mentioned that there were some one-oﬀ, and then there were some strategic
allocation changes in the Savings business which led to be increase in cost. Can you give
us some color what those are and where do you actually think that the cost will be going
towards in the future, i.e., is it – are you looking for a ﬂat cost base in the Savings nonguaranteed business or are you looking for declining or increasing? So, any thoughts on
that cost would be great.
And thirdly, can you just remind us about what is the duration mismatch in the Norwegian
life book and the Swedish book? Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Let me start with your ﬁrst question regarding the operating earnings and the solvency
movement from Q4 to Q1. Actually, we have an increase in the paid-up policies, which was
somewhat above from what we expected. So actually, this quarter, we had a launcher
(25:00) or we had the balance sheet working somewhat against the numbers. Lot of
(25:07) them was helpful on the numbers, so of course the longevity reserve
strengthening and the good returns that allowed for more buﬀer capital, which actually
took down the net capital requirements on the Guaranteed products in total.
On capital generation, we have said that we expect to create up towards 10 percentage
points of capital each year, now for the ﬁrst years. And then, as we talked about earlier in
the call, we do expect capital requirements from the back-book to run-oﬀ after that period
and that should increase capital generation from that level.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
And on the cost in the ﬁrst quarter, there were certain items relating to bills that were
simply should have been paid in 2016, but were paid in 2015. That accounts for
approximately NOK 10 million. Then we had some people working on a technical change
in Norwegian disability law, and could be changes (26:19) taking place in our product and

Page 8 of 15

FINAL

how we manage our customers in that transfer. That led to an additional cost for the
quarter of approximately NOK 10 million as well, and those costs are now behind us, so
they won't be repeated. And there were certain other elements, which were the nonrecurring item or non-recurring nature, which means that you can deduct about NOK 30
million if you want to look at the underlying cost.
Then in addition to that, we still have double cost from the transfer, or lot of things to
Cognizant, where we have people employed in Storebrand to teach people in Cognizant
to do a number of manual tasks that will be done out of India in due course. Those
double costs will gradually go away during this year. And by the end of the year, we
should see that a lot of these tasks are only done in India, with no additional cost in
Norway. And that's part of the cost program that we have communicated earlier and will
bring down cost during the year and into next year. And as I said previously, we'll get the
full eﬀect of these current – the current things taking place by the end of this year.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yes. On the duration, it's much in the Norwegian portfolio on the paid-up policies. It's
roughly around four years. It's lesser than that when you include the other products. In
Sweden, we are more or less duration matched.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

The next question is from Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. It's Matti Ahokas from Danske. A couple of questions please. Firstly,
just to conﬁrm that, is it possible to upstream all of 100% to the proﬁts from the Life
Company in 2017 in theory?
The second question is more of a detailed one. Thanks for a lot of interesting slides in the
back of the slide package. I'm just looking at the Insurance capital allocation. And,
obviously, the return on equity in the Insurance division which is extremely high, this is the
same slide you had at the Capital Market Day in May, but I'm just looking here at the
capital allocation for the Insurance business looks fairly low. What's the basis of this NOK
1.3 billion, I know it's a bit of detailed questions? Sorry for that.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Could I start with the last question, Matti. Actually, what you are asking for is a number on
cash ﬂow on the slide 30. And actually what you need to take into consideration is, what
you see on slide 27, where you see that on the Group level, there is a tremendous risk
diversiﬁcation from the P&C into other risk elements, bringing down the SCR from
Insurance on the Group level.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

How much is the ﬁgure on slide 27, I'm looking here. Where can I see the diverse...

FINAL

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
You see therefore the risk diversiﬁcation factor from P&C is 76% and from health, 67%. So
all other equal 100% increase of capital charge from those products on a standalone basis
on there, then 30% goes through to the Group level.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

So without the diversiﬁcation, this should be roughly double?

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
At least a lot higher. Yes.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
When it comes to up-streaming capacity from the Life Insurance Company, in theory, of
course, you can be able to upstream. We have to look at the local elements to do so. We
have to look at the solvency situation and everything. But, so it will be very much based
on solvency position and how we are able to upstream to the holding company at yearend.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

But looking at the solvency position now, do you think that's a too aggressive thinking or
isn't the solvency position good enough already in the Life Company to upstream the
proﬁts of the year?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I think, we've to look into that in more detail by year end. I think it will be aggressive to say
that we upstream everything from the Life Insurance Company. But there will be, of
course, a new source of up streaming from Life Insurance to the holding company by
year-end this year.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. Just a quick follow-up on the paid-up policies, the operating costs were down quite
a lot. Is this a function of the new cost allocation system or was there something special in
the ﬁrst quarter on the operating cost in the paid-ups?

Yeah. That's correct, Matti. That's part of the cost allocation. We're also doing a lot of
measures across the group, obviously, including in the paid-up policies space to
automate as much as possible and bring down cost and Cognizant is the source to cost
savings as well, but cost allocation is a main factor.

The next question is from Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. First question just on economic capital as you
deﬁne it. Does that include the USR (32:19)? Do you assume that, that's part – is that part
of your economic capital deﬁnition?

Bloomberg Transcript

And as a follow-up to that, or as a the second part to that question, what do you think the
return on economic capital is for the business, given that you're talking already a lot
(32:35) about how we should be valuing the business – be certain of what the return is?
Second question, looking at the slide that you've produced and it was slide 30, where you
give the solvency capital allocation per segment. Just looking at it very quickly, I noticed
Guaranteed book has an SCR of around 6% of the technical provisions or the guaranteed
reserves. And the savings book is broadly the same. I know that includes some of the
banking reserves as well, but it struck me as strange that the two are broadly the same in
terms of capital intensity. I wondered if you could comment further on that please.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
First of all to the UFR, SCR using the same UFR for economic capital calculations that has
to do (33:35) for Solvency II i.e. we are using the ultimate forward rate of 4.2% currently.
Then on slide 30.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Should I just comment on return on economic capital? I was not telling you how to value
the stock there. You know that very well. I was just reminding you that this used to be an
important measure for the analysts market. So that's all I want to do.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah. Yeah, of course but I know you accept that, but the point about the multiples
embedded value would be the – we trade on a multiples embedded value depending on
the return on embedded value. So, if you're putting forward an NOK 88 per share
economic capital, equity capital value, what's the return on that NOK 88, because that will
determine what the multiple is, sort of that that multiple is 0.5% or 1.5%?

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

FINAL

That's correct. I don't want to go into a discussion on that. I think you can do that
calculation yourself. We are measuring this on return on equity and the objective of the
group is the return on equity of the IFRS equity on 10%, and we're about at 9.5% currently,
and we're working hard to get that up to 10%.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Just on sorry to (34:52) follow-up again. But, if you're suggesting that you can generate 10
points of economic capital a year that would be about NOK 2.7 billion based on today's
SCR, so which should suggest a return on that economic equity of about 7%?

A - Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje
That's fair, but we can look into that a little bit more later. Let's go to the capital allocation
front.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Yeah, it's a good observation there, as you said you need to subtract the bank from the
Savings account (35:28) and then, I think you are on the 5% SCR on the (35:34) product.
Remember, although that these proﬁts are also generating capital, so in total, these proﬁts
are actually contribute with capital to the group.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
As far as the Guaranteed business, you have the SCR of 6%, all these products have very
small capital contribution. So in fact, they are a negative capital contribution to the group
asset total.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Looking at the net SCR and then I deﬁne another net SCR, as the SCR less the own funds
contribution. The capital requirements from the Guaranteed business is between 4% and
15%, so quite substantial still on some of the paid-up policies. Also do remember that the
SCR are very diﬀerent in characteristics, while the SCR attached to the Savings business is
ﬁrst of all not a capital requirement for future earnings to disappear. The capital
requirements on the Guaranteed business is linked to the risks of a losing buﬀer capital
and shareholder equity. So, it's quite diﬀerent, the kind of SCR, as such.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Good. Thank you.

I have a question from Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi, there. Thanks for the quick follow-up. I just had a query on the level of operating
earnings in the quarter because It feels like this quarter is relatively normal sort of
environment for you guys. So do you think the operating earnings for NOK 630 million is
sort of normalish run rate? I know it's diﬃcult to answer, but any color would be
appreciated. Thanks.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Okay. What I think I mentioned a little bit earlier, within the savings non-guaranteed, we
see a very positive development, maybe we could look at page, if you look at page 13,
you have the proﬁt per product line within savings (non-guaranteed). You see Unit Linked
Norway, that's where we had 23% (37:53) AUM growth from last year, we expect that AUM
growth to generate a stronger earnings going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

Unit Linked Sweden 20% AUM growth, also should generate increased earnings going
forward. The Asset Management segment, we said that NOK 98 million, did not include
any transaction fees or other fees that usually would come through. Also with a strong
development in assets under management in this unit, we should expect to see increased
earnings from this area as well.
And in the banking part, retail banking, we mentioned that there was a one-oﬀ cost in the
ﬁrst quarter which was incorrectly allocated to this quarter instead of paid last year. And
we also talked about the margins and the volume growth within the bank. So, in all four of
these areas, I foresee a stronger or a positive development in fee and administration
income which should positively impact the operating earnings going forward.
In the other areas, in Insurance, we did have a good result, so that's a fair result this
quarter. In Guaranteed, we had a very good result this quarter but primarily due to
ﬁnancial eﬀects which comes under the line. And the transfers between deﬁned beneﬁt
and deﬁned contribution, typically happens more in the ﬁrst quarter than it happens in
the following quarters. So that shift in earnings from the deﬁned beneﬁt business has
happened, will happen to a lesser degree in the rest of the quarter this year.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Great. Thank you.

Hi. Thanks for taking guys. Just one follow-up, on slide 27 where you gave a breakdown of
the SCR, the risk absorbing capacity of tax is about NOK 5.1 billion, could you just give me
a bit of color as to how that is calculated?
I think it's at least 10 years worth of tax that goes through the P&, and you told me you
actually paying any tax at the moment given you've got into fair tax assets. So, just trying
to get all those moving parts, I'm trying to understand how that NOK 5.1 billion is arrived
at, please?

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
When it comes to the tax, what we do is ﬁrst and foremost we look at diﬀerence on the
values of assets and liabilities in the IFRS account and then in the solvency account and
that creates actually NOK 2.4 billion of deferred tax in the solvency calculations.

Bloomberg Transcript

The next thing we do is, of course, to see what happens to the cash ﬂows in the diﬀerent
stresses and what happens then is of course that we are increasing the liabilities quite
signiﬁcantly in some of the stresses and we are actually then see if you have other sources
of income that come against these losses from all the parts of the business.
And then, we are moving in terms of our economic capital level where we are measuring
both new premiums and risk premiums on the assets, et cetera. That creates alternative
sources of the income which we can use them to both deferred tax from the opening
balance and/or assets – useful assets and we can also utilize what we create of tax credits.
So, all-in-all, we are generating enough income to reduce the SCR with the tax rate.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And I would also like to add as a comment that this level of deferred risk or absorbing
capacity of tax as a percentage of gross SCR is in line with other European life insurers.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah. It's just about 14%. But just given the company's tax situation, I just wondered how
that ﬁtted together. Thank you.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Thanks.
