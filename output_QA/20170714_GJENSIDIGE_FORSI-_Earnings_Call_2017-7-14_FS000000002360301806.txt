Operator
Good day and welcome to the Gjensidige Second Quarter 2017 Results Conference Call.
Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janne Flessum, Head of IR. Please
go ahead.

Janne Merethe Flessum

{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

Good morning and welcome to this second quarter presentation for Gjensidige. My name
is Janne Flessum and I'm the Head of Investor Relations, M&A and Capital Management.
As always, we'll start by our CEO, Helge Leiro Baastad, running through the highlights for
the quarter before our CFO, Jostein Amdal, runs you through the numbers in more detail.
And of course, we will have plenty of time for Q&A at the end.
So, Helge, please.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Good morning and welcome from me as well. Once again, we delivered solid results. We
are very satisﬁed with our overall competitiveness and proﬁtability level in Norway. While
we still have some way to go in other markets, we are conﬁdent that we have the right
measures in place to generate gradual improvement according to plan.

FINAL

The proﬁt before tax expense in the second quarter amounted to NOK 1.5 billion and the
underwriting result was NOK 972 million, corresponding to a combined ratio of 83.3%.
Premium growth was 5.2%. The loss ratio was 68%, positively aﬀected by lower large
losses than normally expected, and run-oﬀ gains in line with expectations.
The underlying frequency claims level was still very good in Norway, while the proﬁtability
level outside Norway continues to be subdued. Overall, the claims level was satisfactory in
the quarter. We had continued good cost control, which is reﬂected in the cost ratio of
15.3%. The ﬁnancial result was NOK 470 million, corresponding to a satisfactory return on
ﬁnancial assets of 0.9%. The annualized return on equity was 21.1%. Jostein will come back
with more details on the ﬁgures afterwards.

Then turning to page 3 in the presentation. Operational excellence is key priority, and we
prioritize proﬁtability ahead of growth. In Norway, we continued to enjoy a combination of
strong competitiveness and strong proﬁtability. The Private segment saw premium growth
of 3.7% in the quarter combined with continued strong proﬁtability. As we have
communicated before, we are increasing prices in motor insurance to compensate a
higher expected claims inﬂation. So far, the development has been as expected but we
monitor this on a daily basis.
On the right-hand side, you can see a few facts about the Norwegian private motor
market. The share of privately-owned electric and hybrid cars is growing rapidly. At the
end of 2016, 7% of cars in Norway were electric or hybrid. And so far this year, more than
50% of new registered cars are hybrid or electric. There was a shift in the claims pattern
last year related to severe accidents and personal injuries which, in combination with
increased inﬂation in material damages, reaﬃrms our belief in claims inﬂation of 3% to 4%
in the short term. In the longer term, we still believe that inﬂation will decrease as cars and
roads become safer.
Some interesting observation in our claims data are that we see up to 20% higher claims
frequency for electric cars probably due to the fact that these cars are typically used to
commute to and from cities during rush hours. We also see up to 20% higher average
claims for such cars and hybrid cars.
Then moving to the Commercial segment. Premium development was ﬂat in the
Commercial segment in second quarter. Proﬁtability was very good. This is very
satisfactory given that the competition in the Commercial segment is still challenging.
Together with the Pension company, the Bank continues to serve its strategic purpose and
support the Norwegian general insurance customers.
The Bank delivered record strong growth in car ﬁnancing this quarter, and is now the ﬁfth
largest player only four years after its launch. Car ﬁnance lending now represents NOK 4.9
billion of the lending book and has passed the consumer ﬁnance book as the second
largest gross collect (05:27) by wide margin.
Growth in the Nordic segment was 19.5%. Underlying growth adjusted for currency and
acquisitions was 4.6%, mainly driven by the Swedish portfolio. The underlying premium

FINAL

development in Denmark was slightly positive. In Denmark, insurance players have
experienced the negative frequency claims development in the last quarters.
We have pricing measures in place to compensate for this, which we gradually feed into
the P&L. We also see positive eﬀects from new initiatives and partner agreements both in
motor and property, but we experienced record high sales in the second quarter. Sweden
and the Baltic both showed good premium growth and are on track to reach proﬁtability
according to plan.
We believe that ongoing digital development, we see around us will require changes in
insurance companies IT system over time. It's our belief that insurance industry will
operate on diﬀerent platforms 5 years to 10 years from now and we want to be ahead of
that development. We are currently evaluating our IT core system in order to be prepared.
We need to ensure that we are positioned to maintain our competitiveness and improve
internal eﬃciency in the long run. We are aiming for HR (07:11) system that will enable us
to quickly adapt to new technology and changes in products, markets and completely
new ecosystems. We will conclude during ﬁrst half-year in 2018 as regards both when and
how we will invest, but we are conﬁdent that any investment will be within the limits of the
ﬁnancial targets.

Retain customers; it is important for us to focus on and further improve customer
experiences. So if you move to page 4, we will provide important examples of initiatives
that are driving customer loyalty in Gjensidige.
Retention level overall continued to be high. In the Private segment in Norway, 86% of the
premiums come from loyalty or aﬃnity customers and the retention is high. 92% in this
group. Long-term partnership agreements are valuable for us as the individual members
of the organizations normally have more products with us on average and stay for longer
due to attractive customer oﬀerings.
We have recently renewed our agreement with the Norwegian Hunting and Fishing
Association which have 113,000 members. We have also signed a new agreement with the
Norwegian Sea Rescue Society representing 120,000 members. These agreements
enable us to contribute to damage and accident prevention, and ensure that our
consumers are safe at sea. As such, it ﬁts well with our corporate social responsibility
eﬀorts. Altogether, our partners in Norway represent as much as 1.4 million members.
Then moving to claims handling. Our travel claims handling process is now the fastest in
the world. We are currently applying for the world record in Guinness World Records for
handling a claim in only 1.6 seconds via our app. This is measured as the time from the
claim is sent to us via our app until the consumer has been informed that the claim is
settled and the compensation has been sent for payment.
In the background, several algorithms and modes (09:51) are run in milliseconds, for
example, to check that the customer is covered by insurance, the probability of fraud,
calculation of the amount, et cetera. In some, hundreds of parameters check and perform
Page 3 of 15

FINAL

the claims handling both quickly and correctly. We know that the time it takes to settle a
claim is the main driver of customer satisfaction when ﬁling a claim and we are working to
continuously improve all claims handling processes.
And ﬁnally, this year again, our general insurance customers in Norway received a
customer dividend from the Gjensidige Foundation. The Foundation has distributed its
part of the dividend to its members, our customers, for eight years in a row. NOK 2.1
billion has been distributed this year, corresponding to 14% of premiums paid in 2016. We
know that 9 out of 10 customers are aware of this unique model and that 7 out of 10
customers say that (11:03) part of the reason for staying with us, which illustrates power it
has as a retention tool. 40% of non-customers say that they are considering becoming
customers because of this model.
And with that, I give the word to Jostein for more granular information on the ﬁgures.

Overall, we delivered strong results in our Norwegian operations, while our international
operations as a whole are loss-making. Measures are in place to gradually improve this
and we are on track and in line with previous communication. We report a good
underwriting result of NOK 972 million, a reduction of NOK 100 million from the second
quarter last year.
The Retail Bank shows continued good development. Together with the Pension
company, they contributed a total of NOK 145 million in the quarter. The investment
portfolio contributed NOK 470 million compared to NOK 570 million in the second
quarter 2016. The proﬁt before tax thereby amounted to NOK 1.5 billion, down from NOK
1.7 billion last year. In the ﬁrst half-year, the proﬁt before tax was NOK 2.9 billion, down
from NOK 3.3 billion. However, remember that there was a one-oﬀ of NOK 477 million in
the ﬁrst half of last year. Adjusted for this, the result for the year to date is on par with the
result for the corresponding period last year.
Looking more closely at the development of the underwriting result on page 7. The lefthand chart illustrates the development of the underwriting result from the second quarter
last year, which was very strong. Large losses were lower than in the second quarter of
2016 and below what is normally expected. However, due to one large ﬁre aﬀecting the
Commercial segment, a reinstatement premium of NOK 55 million was recognized in the
Corporate Center. This is included in the underwriting claims of NOK 173 million and not
in large losses. Adjusted for the reinstatement, the underwriting claims was NOK 118
million.
The right-hand chart shows a positive development in Private Norway and in the Baltics,
while the Commercial and Nordic segments contributed negatively to the development
when they compare to the same quarter last year. Overall, the underwriting result in the
quarter was solid.

FINAL

Turn to page 8. We had premium growth of 5.2% in the quarter. Helge has already
commented on the growth in a diﬀerent segment. The negative development in the
Corporate Center line is mainly due to the reinstatement premium and the Vardia
reinsurance program, which has gradually been phased out over 12 months since
takeover.
Turning to page 9. The loss ratio was 68%. The reported level is 3 percentage points
higher than the corresponding quarter last year. Adjusted for changes in run-oﬀ, large
losses and the reinstatement premium, the underlying loss ratio was 3.5 percentage
points higher.
In Private Norway, motor and property insurance showed an increase in loss ratios, but the
rest stayed at attractive levels. Leisure and accident and health showed a positive
development in loss ratios. In the Commercial segment, accident and health insurance,
marine/cargo insurance and motor insurance, in particular, show an increase in underlying
loss ratios. That said, the proﬁtability in the Commercial segment is still good for most
products. And overall, proﬁtability is very strong for our Norwegian general insurance
operations.

Bloomberg Transcript

The high loss ratio in the Nordic segment was mainly due to our continued less favorable
underlying frequency claims development in the Commercial portfolio in Denmark. As
previously commented, measures are in place to compensate for higher expected claims
inﬂation in Denmark, given that better tariﬀs are in place and will continue to be
implemented step by step. We are already seeing an improvement compared to Q1.
Sweden is on track to reach proﬁtability according to plan, meaning that they expect to
break even at the end of 2017 and be proﬁtable for the full-year 2018. In the Baltics, the
underlying frequency claims development improved, and the segment is on track to
break even in 2017 and be proﬁtable in 2018 as well.
On page 10, you can see that large losses amounted to NOK 143 million, which
corresponds to 2.5 percentage points on the combined ratio. The level was lower than
expected and in line with the corresponding quarter in 2016 when including the
reinstatement premium. There were no weather-related large losses or events in the
quarter.
Page 11 shows the run-oﬀ gains of NOK 246 million in the quarter, resulting in a positive
eﬀect of 4.2 percentage points on the combined ratio. This is about the same level as in
the corresponding quarter last year and close to the communicated expected level. It's as
before mainly related to motor TPL and workers' comp in Norway.
Looking at page 12. The cost ratio of 15.3% reﬂecting continued good cost control. The
cost ratio excluding the Baltics was 14.4% in the quarter. The increase in nominal cost in
Nordic segment is driven by acquired businesses. We are working on reducing the
underlying costs to create room for strategic investments and keep overall costs at a low
level. As Helge said earlier, we are evaluating our core IT system. Any investments in this

Page 5 of 15

FINAL

are expected to be within the limits of our current cost ratio target. We'll come back with
more information during the ﬁrst half of 2018 when they have concluded our evaluation.
Turning to page 13. The investment portfolio of NOK 53 billion yielded a satisfactory
return of 0.9% in the quarter. The match portfolio continues to make a stable contribution
to the ﬁnancial results with a return of 0.8%, which is slightly above the last few quarters.
The portfolio amounted to NOK 35 billion. A large part of the match portfolio is the
portfolio at amortized costs, which yielded a return of 1%. The running yield in this
portfolio was 4.2% at the end of the quarter, and the average reinvestment rate so far this
year has been 2.8%. Unrealized excess value amounted to approximately NOK 1.3 billion.
The free portfolio, which amounts to NOK 18 billion, yielded a return of 1% in the quarter.
The positive result was mainly driven by good returns on convertible bonds, equities and
property. This was partly oﬀset by negative returns some tactical allocations. There has
been some focus from the market on potential eﬀects if we should see a jump (17:48) in
the interest rates. In the appendix, we show (17:51) the sensitivities on the solvency
margins which are limited.

Bloomberg Transcript

Immediate eﬀects on the P&L will be close to zero, at least to the current asset portfolio.
There will be a negative eﬀect from the reduced rally (18:03) of ﬁxed-income instruments
mark-to-market. This will be more or less balanced out by the positive eﬀect from the net
pension liability for own employees.
The longer-term eﬀect on the investment returns and results in the Pension company are,
of course, positive. And then competitive dynamics will determine how an interest rate
increase really inﬂuence combined ratios going forward.
Page 14 shows some highlights from the Bank and Pension operations which are
important retention tools in relation to our Norwegian general insurance customers. Gross
lending in the Bank increased by 13.6% to NOK 44.3 billion. For the quarter, seasonal
isolation, the increase was 3.2% or NOK 1.4 billion.
76% of the Bank's customers are shared customers with insurance measured by the
lending volume. The lending volumes very strategically important to mortgage and car
ﬁnance products are now close to NOK 36 billion and NOK 5 billion, respectively. While
the lending volume in the non-strategic consumer ﬁnance portfolio is NOK 3.7 billion.
In car ﬁnance, the Bank has reported record strong growth in the quarter, as Helge has
already mentioned. The Bank reported a pre-tax proﬁt of NOK 122 million in the second
quarter. Increase was driven by business growth and the increased net interest margin,
which was partly oﬀset by higher write-downs and losses, and lower gains on ﬁnancial
instruments. The annualized return on equity was 11.1%
The Pension company recorded a proﬁt before tax expense of NOK 23 million, which is in
line with the corresponding quarter last year. Assets under management in the Pension
operations amounted to NOK 26.2 billion, reﬂecting growth of NOK 1.3 billion in the
second quarter. And the annualized return on equity was 12%.

FINAL

Last but not the least, looking at our capital position on page 15. The rating model is still
the most binding perspective, with a capital surplus of NOK 1.4 billion at the end of the
quarter, down from NOK 1.6 billion last quarter. Eligible capital changes as a result of
several eﬀects this quarter. Most importantly, retained earnings increased eligible capital,
whereas, the purchase of Mølholm and growth in the Bank decreased it in the S&P
perspective.
In the internal model and standard formula perspective, in addition, capital increases as a
result of updated premium provisions. The capital requirement increases somewhat as a
result of increased credit risk in the portfolio. It increases more in the internal model and
standard formula perspective, due to the increased capital requirements of the Bank. And
the capital requirements of the Bank increases due to growth and an increased Pillar 2
requirement, up from 1.0% to 1.5% of the risk-weighted assets.
The rating perspective, results in a solvency margin of 110%, and as mentioned, a strategic
buﬀer of NOK 1.4 billion. This is a comfortable level for the strategy buﬀer given the
purpose it is intended to serve. The solvency margin is 144% based on the standard
formula and 171% based on the internal model. Both perspectives are adjusted for a
formulaic dividend payout ratio of 70% of net proﬁt.

Bloomberg Transcript

To sum up, we have a solid capital position in all perspectives. We will continue to balance
our capital structure in a disciplined way in order to support the target to return on equity
while at the same time allowing us some leeway for further bolt-on acquisitions and
stabilization of dividend.
And with that, I give the word back to Helge for some concluding remarks.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Okay. Then to sum up. Once again, we delivered a solid result, and our competitive
position remains strong. We continue to prioritize proﬁtability before growth. Solid
measures are in place to improve proﬁtability in Denmark, and in Nordic motor markets
are monitored (22:06) particularly closely on a daily basis.
Sweden and the Baltics are on track to reach proﬁtability according to the plan. We
continue to invest in the future both regards to better customer oﬀerings and eﬃciency in
operations. We have a strong capital position, and we are committed to our ﬁnancial
targets going forward.
And with that, we open for the Q&A session. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. And now, we'll take our ﬁrst question from Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank.
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

FINAL

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. One quick question. Can you conﬁrm that you've increased motor
prices in Denmark starting July? And how much would you say is the average increase
that you have made?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah. Regarding the prices, just to give you the comment on the proﬁtability situation in
the Nordic segment, so it's mainly driven by weaker development in Denmark. We have
seen less favorable frequency claims development. And this is especially related to
commercial property in Denmark. So, we have – just to take that ﬁrst, we have pricing
measures introduced regarding property, and we have also introduced more advanced
tariﬀs.

Bloomberg Transcript

When it comes to motor, we have also increased prices during second quarter. And we
have also more sophisticated tariﬀs coming into the market during 2017. It's new tariﬀs on
motor in – it's index-related increases with individual adjustments, and the index in 2017
was 1.8%, and we had increased prices more than that. And we have new renewal
processes with intelligent price adjustments for customers as in Norway, and that's
coming from 1st of May, so it's in the mid of second quarter.
The average price increases, I don't think we should give that number, but as you hear, it's
indexed and additional price increases and more advanced tariﬀs from 1st of May 2017.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Very clear. Thanks a lot.

Operator
Thank you. And now, we'll take our next question from Paul De'Ath from RBC. Please go
ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yeah, hi. And thanks for this. And not very many questions from me. Firstly, just looking at
the premium growth, I know your focus is on proﬁtability rather than growth but the
underlying premium growth is still quite strong in the quarter and pretty interested in
what your thoughts would be on how that develops going forward?
And also related to that, I don't know if there's any sort of link to the last question actually.
How much of the premium growth that you're seeing is increased due to pricing versus
actually volume growth? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Paul. Our underlying claims in premium, if we were to take away currency
eﬀects and acquisitions, this is 1.4%. And I think that is not very high growth. What we see
is very diﬀerentiated between the diﬀerent segments and markets, and where we see that
we have had actually a positive premium development mainly related to prices in Sweden
especially on the Private side. We have also a very small underlying premium growth in
Denmark. And then the Baltics we have a 4% underlying premium growth mainly also
related to prices.
So, to sum up, I think 1.4% is not an untypical level and in the Scandinavian markets, the
growth is mainly related to prices.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Okay. Thanks.

A - Operator
Just to add, going forward, I think the growth you will see from Gjensidige, besides
maybe Sweden and the Baltics, will be related to price increases. And we had signiﬁcant
price increases in force in the other markets.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. And now, we'll take our next question from Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go
ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hello. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple. So, ﬁrstly, I mean, on
the claims inﬂation, pricing dynamic and I guess also the planned improvement and
proﬁtability in the international regions; I mean, when would you expect all of this to sort
of combine and for us to see underlying loss ratio improvement? That would be my ﬁrst
question.
And secondly, could you update us on the competitive environment in Norway? We heard
some interesting comments from Tryg earlier this week, suggesting churn in the market
was about 19%. Do you agree with that and where would you put Gjensidige's churn? I
guess, it's much lower than the market given you've got the customer dividends. I'll leave
it there. Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yeah, I'll start with the question about the improved loss ratios. As we stated, the loss
ratios are at very good levels for the Norwegian than the insurance operations and the –
whereas it's much less than what we want – the loss ratio is much higher than we want to
be outside of Norway. We do expect improvements in the loss ratios going forward
outside of Norway and really continuously going forward, but we do not expect to reach
breakeven until the end of 2017 for Sweden and the Baltics. But I see mean, positive
underwriting result or a combined ratio below 100%. And then for the whole of 2018, both

Page 9 of 15



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2017-07-14

those markets will have a combined ratio of under 100% through a combination of loss
ratio and cost ratio improvements.

FINAL

Where as in Norway, we are pricing now in line with the expected claims inﬂation for the
big product, which means that we don't guide for any speciﬁc improvement in the loss
ratio in the Norwegian market.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Maybe some word regarding competition in Norway and as I understood, you also asked
some questions about churn in the market. Just to give you a comment on the Private
segment in general ﬁrst from Norway, the main competitors is actually the old one, is Tryg,
(30:40) and it's also (30:40) . We do actually do – we do not see the small ones as that
aggressive as we have communicated over some years, especially not DNB (30:54).

Bloomberg Transcript

On the Commercial side, it's also the same; (31:01) again. On the municipality side, of
course, it's KP (31:05) and Protector, and also regarding to life risk product, it's DNB and
Protector.
It's generally ﬁerce competition. As I commented, we have strong competitiveness and
we have seen over time, an increased competition, especially within the Commercial
segment in Norway. I think also that was commented by our competitor last week. The
churn in the Norwegian market is stated to be 19% in – I think this source is from Tryg was
(31:44) up from 14% over time. But I think – we are listening to that, and new questions are
asked in this survey, and we do not think it's comparable. Our churn is 11%, and it's 8% for
loyalty aﬃnity customers, as I commented during my presentation, and it's stable. And
you have to also take into consideration that we have 25% of the market. So, we have
good statistics.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Yeah. That's great. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. We will take our next question in the queue from Vinit Malhotra from
Mediobanca. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. So, just two very quick ones, hopefully. The ﬁrst one is on the motor
inﬂation and the whole dynamic of electric cars. First of all, is it – I mean, this comment is
new on this slide which usually has that explanation for frequency. Is it that you have a
greater proportion of electric cars than other players in Norway? Would you think that is
the case? And do you expect this to revert in the second half of the year because – I'm
asking because by maintaining the guidance, there is sort of an implicit understanding
that it was rather a very temporary quarterly blip, but I'm not very sure whether that is your
expectation as well.

Page 10 of 15



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2017-07-14

To that, a quick one on motor. On – I'm sorry – and a very quick one on the private equity;
I thought this was linked to oil, and oil's had a disastrous run last few months. You've still
made a gain. Could you comment a bit on that? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I would take the ﬁrst and maybe Jostein can comment the second one. No, in Norway, we
have a special situation. It's packed incentives related to hybrid cars and electric cars. So,
that's a special situation for Norway. So, we have relatively high penetration and that's
total market ﬁgures. As I said, at the end of 2016, it was 7% hybrid and electrical cars and
so far this year, as much as 50% of all new cars sold in the market is electric and hybrid.
We have our proportion of it, maybe less because we didn't price that aggressively; Tesla
when it came into the market. Therefore we see, as we have commented, we see
dynamics from 1% up to 3% to 4% claims inﬂation based on the fact that the last year saw
severe motor TPL claims have slowed down in the positive development in combination
with higher frequent related claims for small tickets. So that's the reason for our
expectation of 3% to 4% claims inﬂation going forward. It's also based on 25% of the
market.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay, can I just ask, if there is – more than half of market new cars are electric or hybrid as
per your slide.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Then is it fair that your proportion of the new cars of electric hybrid is similar to your
market share or is it greater? That's my question really of your insurance...

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Okay.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

...not the market.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

My best guess is that our market share.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Is the market share?

And remember that the lifetime of a car in Norway is as much as 12 years I think and – 11
years. So, this takes time, but we actually see a combination, as I said, of a slowdown in
TPL claims as from last year in combination with this upward trend. So, we think you
should actually all the competitors also should see the same ﬁgures afterwards – after
some time.

Okay. Well, the second part of the question about our private equity investments. Just
remember that the accounting principles there is that they use the net asset value as
reported by the private equity funds, and there you see a lag in quarter and then they test
the values in the balance sheet against kind of known mark-to-market events like the Oslo
Stock Exchange and the MSCI World and so on. And – so that's the basis.
There were no such indicators that there were any troubles with the private equity
portfolio in the second quarter. And also, remember, that our private equity's portion is
kind of – is roughly it's half is the exports directly to (36:47) the oil sector and the other
half is other, more non-oil sector related private equity investments. And these, the private
equity funds that invest in the oil sector are, of course, not usually nothing oil, but the end
(37:02) oil services and technology companies that are suppliers to the oil sector. So there
is possible lag eﬀect from oil price reaction to their results.

Thank you. And now, we'll take a follow-up question from Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please
go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi, sir. Thanks. Just a quick one on the IT systems. So, thanks for those comments. I know
that you can't obviously give us too much in terms of the ﬁnancials at this stage. It's too
early. But I just wondered if you could explain a bit about your current IT spend and how –
if you could quantify that?

And also if you could split out between how much of that is sort of maintenance i.e.,
keeping the lights on and how much is R&D? Thank you.

The run rate...

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Can I give investments on the – (38:04) IT investments but it's the current IT spend that's
actually we don't have here, but I'll – we can provide that later, I think...

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

... but we don't have the IT spend total. The current IT investments run at approximately
NOK 200 million a year, approximately. This varies, of course, from year-to-year. And
distributed between the – the improvements within claims management distribution and
the internal processes, which we have shown the examples of today in various occasions
over the last few quarters. That's the spend, Helge, would you like to...

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah. As I said, I think it's too early to be very concrete, but it's a combination of reasons
for us looking into this. One is, of course, that we see lots of changes and more rapid
changes. We expect maybe also related to both motor insurance and other policies that
you will see more ecosystems and partnerships going forward. So, to actually secure that,
we can be competitive on the Nordic basis with agile and very dynamic system. That's
one reason. But of course, when we have looked into this, we see also after the
investment period that we didn't have the ability to reduce the run rate of the IT costs as
such going forward. So, but we are in the middle of the process now. So, and it's too early
to be very concrete. We are expected to be done with – and it's important to once again
say that we expect to be done within the ﬁnancial target. So, this had no impact on the
cost ratios and the ﬁnancial targets if we go into investment periods.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

But I guess you will capitalize a lot of it potentially on the balance sheet instead of charge
it to the P&L?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah.

Thank you. And now, we'll take our next question from Iain Pierce from Berenberg. Please
go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Iain Pearce

{BIO 19522835 <GO>}

Hi, morning, everyone. Just a couple of quick questions on the Nordic segment. On the
negative run-oﬀ gains that you've seen there, can you talk to us a bit where you've seen
that negative development and if any of that related to some strengthening of the
reserves in relation to the acquired body of portfolio? And also the body of portfolio
contributing to the work loss ratio in that segment. Can you maybe give a bit detail on
what the loss ratio was in that acquired segment so we can sort of have an idea of how
much that's worsened and what the plans are in terms of any re-underwriting that's going
on in that acquisition? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah. It is correct that the losses in the Nordic segment have been related to – at least
partly or more than half to the acquired portfolio of Vardia. And we don't provide any
speciﬁc numbers on the loss ratios of that portfolio or the Sweden as such. But on the
commercial property side in Sweden, substantial re-underwriting has been going on and
will continue to take place during 2017. And also pricing measures including
improvements in tariﬀs and general price level have also been increased in Sweden. So,
yeah, proﬁtability is better in – much better in Denmark than in Sweden in that way.

Q - Iain Pearce

{BIO 19522835 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. And we have no further questions over the telephone at this time.

A - Janne Merethe Flessum

Okay. Then we round it all up. Just reminding you of the road shows we are doing after
summer. We're going to Stockholm, Amsterdam, Milan, Paris, Zurich, Geneva, Stavanger,
and Bergen. And with that, have a real great summer. Thank you for participating.

Operator
Thank you. So, ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the Gjensidige's second quarter
2017 results conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
