Thank you Daniel, and good afternoon everyone. 2018 has been a strong year for
Storebrand with a group result of NOK3.2 billion and a result of NOK3.7 billion after taxes
due to the positive tax eﬀect (inaudible) risk in a separate Stock Exchange of the
(inaudible) this is all-time high results for Storebrand. Our Solvency II ratio is also time
high with 173%to 172% without an interrupt session rules, and we increase our dividend to
NOK3 per share. The underlying growth in the business is strong, with reduced in the
fourth quarter by the weak ﬁnancial markets.
Weak markets also negatively aﬀect our proﬁts. In addition to substantially reducing the
performance fees compared to 2017. On the positive note, the development in the
ﬁnancial markets so far 2019 has been strong and to a large extent reversed the eﬀects
from Q4. If we then move to the next slide.

Bloomberg Transcript

This picture was introduced in our Capital Markets day in May, it is a picture of our twofold strategy, with active management of the guaranteed business in run-oﬀ for capital
release and proﬁtable growth in our capitalized savings business. Through our positions
in Occupational Pensions in Norway and Sweden a growing resales savings market and
asset management business with over NOK 700 billion assets under management.
Looking at the active management of our balance sheet we continue to our strong cost
control with costs for the full year just below NOK 3.8 billion. Also, Solvency II came in
strong as 172% for the year. At our capital markets day, we guided on reaching a solvency
on 180% in 2021 or else equal. With a strong solidity development in 2018, we will again
all else equal, start to capital release our back book expected one year earlier. The growth
in our front book has also continued through 2018. Though somewhat reduced by
ﬁnancial markets in Q4. We also continue our strategy with bolt-on M&As.
An that leads me to next slide, slide number 4. Lately, we have landed two transactions
with a comparable size. We have sold Nordben, our currency base run-oﬀ portfolio of
international pension schemes of SEK6 billion. The sales, will give a positive eﬀect on
solvency of just under 1% point. So we also sell a portfolio that is not statistically important
to us. Meanwhile, we also buy a Nordic leading private equity company, Cubera. Cubera
will strengthen our asset management oﬀering in general and especially beneﬁt our focus
on private markets going forward. The acquisition price was initially NOK300 million for
yearly earnings before tax on NOK68 [ph] million. The buying price can increase with
another up to NOK325 million depending on successful capital raise going forward. If we
then move to slide number 5, the acquisition of Cubera, as I said, add a depth to our
asset management. In addition to listed stocks, interest-bearing papers on real estate, we
see that assets equivalent to private debt, private equity, and infrastructure are becoming

increasingly important. Both to our life insurance business and in regard to oﬀering
competitive asset management solutions for our institutional clients.
Let's move to slide number 6 and growth. We have gotten used to see double-digit
growth both when it comes to savings and asset management. And, underlying growth is
still strong in 2018. With our growth in premiums with Unit Linked business all 7%.
Normally, a positive return on equity we had to this growth, securing on growth in assets
under management well above 10%. We didn't see this positive market eﬀects this year.
On the contrary we had a falls global equities, we have element processed year-by-year
and that make up for the ﬁnal growth number of 7% when it comes Unit Linked. Asset
management (inaudible) eﬀect in addition to currency eﬀect between Norway and
Sweden and negative net ﬂows in SKAGEN. Our bank is maintaining a steady growth of
10% in 2018 and then they now also see growth within our insurance business.

Bloomberg Transcript

The proﬁt development have been strong both when it comes to our banking and
insurance operations. Then I move to the solvency movement, in slide number 7. Our
solvency has really strengthened this quarter despite developing markets. If you break
this down, the movement from 166% to 172% we see that the market development in the
quarter has put a strain on our solvency through 14% fall in the world index and 20 basis
points reduction in the 10 year interest slope rates in Norway ,and in addition, our
widening spreads.
We have executed active risk management measurements, and have maintained buﬀers
in a very good way in the life insurance company. All this together though, has reduced
the solvency ratio with 6 percent points.Then we will know that the UFR has due to market
conditions on a quarterly basis is -- adds up premium news excess equity and for the
volatility adjustments, and this new element from UFR this quarter has given a positive
development on the 6 percent points a quarter, and there you will see that the all of the
volatility adjustments have reduced stress for equities, has really done and taken out the
negative market conditions altogether.
On top of these, we have strong result of the tax in the fourth quarter, and this is mainly
due to the tax in the common of NOK1.6 that we noted the market with in a separate in
press release. And these added up 6% points to the solvency for the quarter. And all
together then, our solvency ratio 172 and a minor adjustment for transitionals, these to 273
[ph] given that, a look a bit closer into the solvency sensitivities on slide number 8, we see
that the solvency sensitivities is very much on the same levels as this was in Q3, we can
notice that a fall in the interest rate of 50 basis points from today's level, will entail that we
-- that the transitionals once again take eﬀect for interest rates, and in fact these rates
increase over total reported (inaudible). And then at last, before I give the word to Lars, if
you look at the solvency movement for 2018, on slide number 9, we see that there has
been a very strong development for the year on 22% point increase for the full year
before dividends substantially more than our guiding on 10% point on the annual increase
before dividends. So, by that, I give the word to Lars, over to you [ph].

Thank you there, Odd. And let me brieﬂy go through some of the pages for you. The
proﬁt before amortized, this on key ﬁgures page 10. As the proﬁt before amortization at
NOK563 million is rather weak. The ordinary operating proﬁt at NOK654 million is okay,
but would usually be higher in the fourth quarter, for used book performances. Adjusted
for performance fees, the operating proﬁt is NOK565 million, so much weaker than our
guiding. If you look at the earnings for the full year, we've had three quarters delivering
better than guidance and one weaker. Looking forward, the full-year operating proﬁt
divided by four due to reasonable guiding on their earnings power going forward. The
main reason behind the weak quarter numbers are solid ﬁnancial markets and four one
oﬀs. In Norway, we have a regulatory retained equity savings scheme called ASK.
Storebrand and SKAGEN had each developed its own platform for ASK. As part of the
integration of SKAGEN, we have established that the SKAGEN platform will be rolled out
for the whole group and we take a one oﬀ charge for the closing down of our own
development work. Second, in the fourth quarter, we have booked approximately 20
million in advisory fees primarily related to the Nordben sale announced in December
and the Cubera acquisition. announced Monday.

Bloomberg Transcript

Three, furthermore, we've taken a charge for a renegotiated remuneration in for our sales
force. This will not lead to higher costs going forward. It is a one-oﬀ compensation. And
ﬁnally, we have booked too much regulation fees and the paid up policy book during the
year. This income had to be reversed by NOK38 million in the fourth quarter and reduces
the income line. The full year number is correct and we are reviewing our processes to
avoid a similar adjustment in the future.
And ﬁnally, ﬁnancial results. Sorry, the ﬁnancial result was weak in the quarter, very much
in line with ﬁnancial markets and with normal ﬁnancial market volatility. Worth to note is
that increased credit spreads gives a short-term negative mark-to-market on our company
portfolios, with a long term pickup in returns. As long as there are no defaults, there is no
long-term eﬀect. Furthermore the positive ﬁnancial market since year-end as more or less
neutralized the fall in assets under management that we saw in the fourth quarter.
Clipping over to the next page 11. This is a more traditional presentation of the results and
we see that fee and administration income is down in the quarter, primarily as a
consequence of lower performance fees in 2018, compared to 2017. For the year as a
whole and income is up 5%. The Insurance result is up by 13% during 2018. The cost level
is up due to the inclusion of SKAGEN but is below the target of NOK3.8 billion for the year
as a whole. This means that adjusted for SKAGEN, the growth level has been nominally
ﬂat for 6 years in a row since 2012. We aim to maintain the same nominal level least until
2020. The operating result for the year is up 4%. Adjusted for currency ﬂuctuation in
SKAGEN, underlying Storebrand operating result is up by 14% and conﬁrms the strong
underlying growth. Under tax, we have a positive contribution of NOK900 million
following the tax gain of NOK1.6 billion announced in January. This is a consequence of
the new tax rules for life and pension businesses separating the tax accounting for
customers and pension providers. With this change, we will have a more predictable tax
charge of 21% to 23% per annum going forward and large tax diﬀerences, both assets and
liabilities have been removed from our balance sheet. Net-net, we still have
approximately NOK8 billion in tax losses carry forward. Although the fourth quarter results
were weak 2018 comes out as one of the best years we've ever had.

Questions And Answers

(Operator Instructions) And we have a couple of questions coming through. And the ﬁrst
question is from -- I'm so sorry. Ladies and gentlemen, it seems to that I've been thrown
out from my system. I will try to get another operator to you as soon as possible, please
hold the line please.
(Technical diﬃculty) Ladies and gentlemen, we are sorry for this. Another operator
coming in to help you with the Q&A, we have a couple of people in the queue, I could

Yes.

Operator
(Operator Instruction) The next question comes from the line of Peter Eliot from Kepler
Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay, so -- three questions if I may -- the ﬁrst one was I just wondering about how you
now think about the sort of the balance between growing volumes and margin. I mean in
the report, you make a few comments about margin pressure and unit linked asset
management and in insurance I am -- I think I'm right but DNB has been cutting unit
linked fees quite heavily. I mean -- I guess in insurance few years ago, you were sort of
forecasting double-digit growth rates there -- you've had some distribution issues but
those should now be over. Going forward in those three areas. How should we think or -are you thinking you need to take the foot oﬀ the accelerator a little bit to protect margin?
Do you think those risks to margins?Can we margins be maintained at this -- so just
wondering if you could talk about that a little bit. Sorry that's a long one.
The second - do it very short -- the second one is the SKAGEN net ﬂows would you be
able to give us the number for Q4 and maybe any comments on the outlook? And the
third ﬁnal one was -- I was surprised with the dividend, that it was all normal with that --

Page 5 of 15



Company Name: Storebrand ASA

Date: 2019-02-13

very welcome. I'm guessing that I kind to says to me that you think you currently have a
sustainable EPS of NOK6 -- I'm not I mean, which seems quite punchy that's probably the
wrong way to think about it, but I was just wondering if you could explain your thinking
behind setting it all as normal. Thank you very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Okay, so then start is talk about margins, I think ﬁrst of all you need to recognize that our
business environment corporate pension [ph] is already on quite low margins in the
Norwegian market and then the bulk of the business is really with deﬁned contributions. I
think DNB has done something on their direct (inaudible) for a retail market, but is also a
mixed bag because it's somewhat reduced ordinary fees, but is also introducing
performance fees for us as I understand almost all of their usual (inaudible) we have of
course an ongoing process looking into our fees for the retail markets, when it comes to
mutual funds. That was on active terms and for more deeper type of funds [ph] and within
that we have well pricing that is giving the right value for the customers as we speak that
is of course an ongoing process, are they going to look at the more pension market its of
course, more like high competition in the market and also process that in 2021 we will
have our own pension accounts that are coming into the market, where the active
management of the deﬁned contribution will be combined with the payment policies
without investment choice that it would be combined in account for the customers. And
that is a very attractive market of course that we feel that we are very well positioned for,
with our 31% market share, but that is also a attractive market for everyone else around us.
So that is (Technical Diﬃculty) and that we like it to deﬁne going forward. And so there is
no -- I feel that we are in a market that is really growing very fast, and the growth within
our pension market will continue to go forward in the Norwegian market and in the
Swedish market, and we will take our share in that growth. And the margins we are seeing
in the pensions area is quite sustainable outside going forward in the short time and in
the future.
When it comes to SKAGEN, the net ﬂow for the year was minus NOK14 million, or
(Technical Diﬃculty) NOK14 billion when it comes to the net ﬂow, most of that was earlier
in the year, where we had some changes in the portfolio managers. At the end of the year,
we saw that for performance, and that is seen in the transports, [ph] not much higher, and
I take this as -- earlier today, that in December and February, we have the outﬂows -inﬂow in our ﬂagship fund Kon-Tiki, and they were developed not so far in 2019 it has
been very good both when it comes to absolute return and relative return in the funds in
SKAGEN altogether.

A - Lars Aa Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

We really had a very strong year when it comes to capital upstreaming to the holding
company, we have a very solid position, I think we have also quite a solid result
generation going forward. We feel comfortable about meeting our target of having a
nominal growth in the dividend or at least the same level as we had last year, and based
on our expectation of the results from the company, that should be a sustainable position
going forward.

The next question comes from the line of Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon. i would like to continue on the same topic as Peter earlier on, the
dividends you obviously have the strongest solvency margin you basically ever had and a
lot of positive one-oﬀs. and if I understood you correctly, you had already mentioned that
the capital release from the guaranteed back book, had already started the year earlier
than you originally forecasted. So, I'm still a bit puzzled on why -- the dividend isn't higher
than that it is taking into account of these factor that has been mentioned.
Second question is regarding the performance fees in the savings business obviously
down by around NOK200 million, is the underlying level -- I know it's probably diﬃcult to
say -- but is it closer to 200 million or the 300 million, it was in 2017 going forward, in your
opinion. Thanks.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Can you repeat that question, which segment or which slide are were referring to?

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So the savings business you write in the report that the performance fees altogether were
-- was 90 million versus 300 million in 2017 for the full year 2018. So is the underlying level
closer to 200 million or the 300 million we saw, I guess what the 90 million in 2018 is
probably not what we should be looking for in the future.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
I thought with the dividend, we have been very clear that we see that the levels of a 180%
in solvency, the level that we feel we would have -- a level where we can start to give -extraordinary dividend based on the capital release from the back book and everything
equal, based on having a underlying solvency ratio of 172% as we speak. We expect that
by mathematics more to say, to come one year closer based on the guidance we gave on
our Capital Markets Day. And I have to say that the result we gave out -- the dividend we
gave up now is actually 8% of the result, before we take into account that extraordinary
element from tax values, I think special. So, Lars will answer on the -- more asset
management and performance fees.

A - Lars Aa Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Matt, just like Odd comment, you mentioned that there were both looks positive one --oﬀs and the fourth quarter was basically a number of negative one-oﬀs not positive in the
one-oﬀs. So in the beginning of the year, we had a positive one-oﬀ from longevity results
strengthening NOK 149 million but there has been more balanced -- and a number of
one-oﬀs, positive and negative one-oﬀs after that. And I would also say that the tax eﬀect
and the positive contribution from the tax eﬀect has given an opportunity to take out an
additional dividend from the life company to the holding company, which strengthened
(inaudible) the holding company going forward. So, although that's the positive
Page 7 of 15



FINAL

Date: 2019-02-13

consequence of that. When it comes to performance fees, performance fees are the fees
are not certain before their booked at the end of the year and if you look at SKAGEN in
isolation. They have been between close to zero and above NOK1 billion for last 5 or 6
years. So there is some wide diﬀerence between the upside and the downside to this limit
is at 0. And (inaudible) has been between about NOK50 million and NOK150 million on
an annual basis for the last several years. So that's really the outcome is a broad range
here. What we have said that is -- and (inaudible) delivers approximately benchmark
performance. They will deliver an excess of NOK200 million on an annual basis. But
obviously, over time, we do expect performance over and above the benchmark that's
why we take risk and therefore we do expect, more over time. But that will be - this will be
a volatile element and there is nothing called normalized in that space.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Very clear. Thank you. If I may follow-up on -- dividend, sir. The extreme 2017 was based, I
guess then on the old dividend policy. So we should be kind of looking at the 180-level as
to kind of hard threshold for anything extra in the future?

A - Odd Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, the dividend policy now is paying oﬀ more than 50% of the result of the tax and
having increased dividend on an annual basis -- a nominal increase in the number. And
the threshold that's it forward is that normal dividends will be paid between 130% and
188% in solvency. And when we move above 188% of solvency, we start to releasing
capital from the back-book, and as we said in our Capital Markets Day. Within those 10
years -- we expect to release around $10 billion from our back-books.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Got it. Thank you very much.

Operator
Next question comes from the line of Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon. I just have few questions on, so ﬁrst of all, on Solvency II capital
generation, which is on slide number 9. Can you help us like this 10 percentage point
capital generation is like Group result excluding the tax impact. I mean, what does it
include? Does it include the tax beneﬁt, sorry does it include the UFR? Does it include any
release of capital? Can you give a bit more clarity on that, because this number was a bit
higher last year I think 11% or 12% and now it went down with your SCR coming down as
well. So can you just give us a bit of composition of this number, 10%? That's number one.
Secondly, I'm sorry to go back to the asset management. Can you just remind us as to
what your normalized earnings for asset management excluding the performance fees of
SKAGEN and Delphi? So what would be the normalized asset management earnings
excluding those two items?

Page 8 of 15



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2019-02-13

And thirdly is, I mean if you think about the combined ratio, I mean, clearly your guidance
is around 90% to 92%, but you have been doing below that for quite some time. So how
should we think about combined ratio in the P&C business going forward? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Okay, thank you. Let me start with the ﬁrst question about the capital generation. The way
we have choose to show the capital generation in this picture, is merely thinking, the
group results as it comes from the equity generation in the line or in the group balance
sheet. I.e. if you take this year's results, on amortization of intangibles and divide on the
SCR, then you will get to see 16% which we have done -- again can be divided in those
10% and 6% coming from the tax element.
So that's how we have shown to -- or as usual to show it, you could also show it in a
diﬀerent manner, a very seperate -- what this is expected as a result in the Solvency
models, about this capital generation, above the level of the (inaudible) of investments.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

So just a follow-up on that. So what are you saying is this Group results still don't include
any release of capital. And if I remember correctly, your release of capital was earlier
planned for 2021 and now it is bringing forward to 2020. Is that correct? And that would
be around NOK1.3 billion, NOK1.4 billion?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
That's correct. When it comes to the dates, you were mentioning, I don't want to comment
on your capital release (inaudible).

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. Then on the asset management earnings?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Yes, the normalized earnings in the asset management business you can derive from the
numbers we present, which is roughly NOK500 million based on today's AUM and with
no performance fees whatsoever, and then there will be performance fees on top of that
and the AUM has been growing over time. And we are doing a lot of measures to
improve but probably and grow that business. Those are a target that was announced on
the Capital Markets Day, which was-(Multiple Speakers) Well, we -- I think most close to billion in result of incentive that drive
and say something about the growth -- and the NOK1 billion does include the
performance fees. But nevertheless, we have a strong growth agenda within asset
management, and the last one on (Technical Diﬃculty) couple of years now or couple of
years (inaudible) with combined ratio numbers and that we are long term aiming for 90 to
92 which means that when we've had the combined ratio below that we've been able to
adjust prices on certain products and to invest somewhat more in growth and what we
have done one of the things we've done in terms of growth in the fourth quarter last year
Page 9 of 15



Company Name: Storebrand ASA

is to cooperate with a sales partner as an agent that is sending more insurance for us and
that's negatively contributed earnings but positively thing contributed to the growth that
is starting to pick up in the fourth quarter.

Okay Thank you.

And the next question comes from Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Please go head
your line is now open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon. I've got three questions I think. The ﬁrst one just drilling
down into movements in capital requirements. I think it's on page 35 of the interim report,
the capital requirements reduced in the year, but that was mainly due to the market
elements, just wonder if strong [ph] perhaps you can go into the little bit more detail
there and given equity markets have recovered. Does that capital requirement go back
up? And I guess aligned to that and talking now about the possibility of additional capital
release, the the 2021 guidance that I took to be twofold ﬁrstly, the 2021 was the date when
you expect it to reach 180, but also that 2021 was a time where you expect it to be
physically seeing the back-book rolling over and starting to release capital that way. So
my question is when we get through to 2020 which is a year earlier. We may well be at
the 180 threshold for solvency but will we really be seeing capital falling oﬀ the back-book
at that time. Sorry, I hope that's clear.
And my ﬁnal question was really just on the hold call liquidity and ss that something -- I
think you've said in the past that you wanted to run that with around zero net debt. I just
wonder if that's still still the target or what, how we should be thinking about additional
liquidity that's been pumped into the hold call from the Life company and the dividend.
Thank you.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Thank you Blair. On your ﬁrst question regarding reduced stress levels from on the market
amount. Yes, your correct right -- but even now strong equity markets -- so what will
happen is that they will increase their holdings and unit linked business, that will generate
more proﬁtable business, and will increase the SCR stemming from that business.
So (Technical Diﬃculty ) increased equity markets, we would both have more proﬁtable
business of that increase on EBITDA. And it will probably also have a negative eﬀect on -so this number from increased at the distressed levels, which is on all time low [ph]
volume at this quarter in the 32.9%. I mean, know [ph] capital base (inaudible) 39%.
So there it is -- yes the other element is credit and you little bit have -- also positive
contribution this quarter from increased the volatility adjustment that goes into that plan

Page 10 of 15



Company Name: Storebrand ASA

as well so you're perfectly correct up certain strong international markets we has increase
the FTR from the markets stress.

FINAL

Saying that, you should always bear in mind that in strong and equity market and strong
credit markets that give more for -- capital, which is really positive to the result of the risk
mitigation of the Storebrand Group, and that's partly here into the -- and I think, I mean I
leave it there.

Yeah. when it comes to the next question Lara, which was of the release of the back book.
There will be a release of the guaranteed back book. I think (Technical Diﬃculty) and the
estimate (Technical Diﬃculty) of reserves. It either comes from that we are expected to the
infrastructure to increase the forward rate which will then decrease a (Technical Diﬃculty)
FTR and also now with strong equity market in the ﬁrst month of 2019. I have also
developed a new (inaudible) which also release the new system, the capital requirements
from the (inaudible) backlog. So there will be a through reduction in (Technical Diﬃculty)
the SCR coming from back-book.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
But as we demonstrated, it's not a binary thing, it's the (inaudible) it gradually happens
over time and we start releasing capital on the Swedish book this year. We start producing
more capital from other places gradually next year and into the (Technical Diﬃculty).
Yeah. And when it comes to the (Technical Diﬃculty) it's through there we have (Technical
Diﬃculty) roll up the aim for the life for a holding company. We use this opportunity now
with the extraordinary results in the life insurance company, also due to the tax results to
put some more cash in holding company. That is helpful when it to ensure that we are
able to meet our obligation also going forward to have a normal growth in (inaudible)
even it have a more weak year, and also it survive its position to be into to be able to also
release capital above the normal results when it comes to taking up results from life
insurance company based on over capitalization above 180%.

I do think it was to Blair Steward from Bank of America you line is open if you want to
continue ask your question.

FINAL

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. Maybe I can just come back on the point of excess capital return. So just to
be clear, so you think if all going well, you should be reaching 180 sometime next year.
And there will be scope for some capital to be released from the back-book, although I
think the point Lars, is that it is likely to be small and then that you've talked about that
NOK10 billion, but that's going to ramp up over time, but presumably, you can also think
about just paying a higher proportion of your earnings as a dividend, which we'd be just - not adding the retained earnings to your to your solvency?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker

Bloomberg Transcript

To answer on that, ﬁrst of all of course -- anything equal -- this has been very strong year
end comes to (inaudible) 22% points. We have guided on long term 10% to 12% growth in
the solvency ratio annual. And with 50% payout dividend that is reduce 75% to 60%. And
as you said the more you pay in out in the normal dividend of course the less, you will
have to increase this solvency position to above 180%. So this is of course, how it works
and based on these numbers our estimate is that we will need to post 2019 and 2020 to
know in a normal situation reach above 180%. And there is a lot of impact -- that estimate
of course. That is just being equal to what we discussed on Capital Markets Day with now
172% in solvency that is much better than we have when we have Capital Markets Day
back in May. This seems everything equal to have become one year earlier compared to
our guidance on Capital Markets Day.

Okay, thank you very much.

Thank you. Next question please.

And the next question comes from Kevin Ryan from Bloomberg Intelligence. Please get
your line is open.

Q - Kevin Ryan

{BIO 1814771 <GO>}

Thank you. I just had a question about the retail funds platform, please. Could you give us
some guidance on whether the costs of that have now being fully expensed or whether
we can expect some additional cost this year. And also can you oﬀer some guidance as to
how we should think about the volume from that platform? Thanks.

The regulatory framework in Norway change to (inaudible) in 2017. And we bid two
platforms through to 2017 and 2018 one for Storebrand and one for SKAGEN, now that we
have merged the two, we are writing oﬀ the investments in the Storebrand platform. The
SKAGEN platform do have some costs that is on the balance sheet, and that will be
written oﬀ over time and we'll continue to develop the joint platform together. So there is
nothing extraordinary related to that. That's a normal development and adjustment to the
market.
And in terms of volumes, this is a way to place your equity investments, whether it's equity
investments directly or through mutual funds and it's a way to help individuals without
large fortunes to be able to have the same beneﬁts as if you were a wealthy individual and
you had your own investment company where you could trade-in and out of equities
without releasing tax. So this is the way to allow normal people to invest in equity based
savings instruments without releasing tax when they switch in between the two. So the
overall market for equity related investments should go up as a consequence and our aim
together with the investment in SKAGEN is to have a number one position in that market
over time. We currently have around 28% market share which we actually increased from
about 25% market share in a growing market.

Thank you. Next question please.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no question at the moment. (Operator Instructions) We do
have a quick response from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go head. Your line
is now open.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thanks very much. Just wondering if I could just clarify the timing, I mean I know it's very - lots of uncertainties here --but I mean if you allow the recovery of markets at the start of
this year and you are sort of 5 percentage points net of dividend guidance and everything
seems I thought was sort of pointing towards the start of 2020, when you are in that
position of 180% in a position start returning. What you said in answer to Blair question,
you said you needed 2019 and 2020 to get there so that implies the end of 2020. So I'm
just, just wanted to check whether this, we're talking about something diﬀerent there or
what that was. And then if I could ask another question, you reported a negative ﬁnancial
result in both unit linked pots and in retail banking. I'm just a bit surprised actually. I mean
I didn't really expect to see ﬁnancial results going through those. I just wonder if you
could just explain what caused that. Thank you.

Despite with the guiding, I must apologize, with my English also with computing error
[ph] And also I didn't mean to say it was in end of 2020 or in the middle 200. I think it's
very diﬃcult to be as precise as that when it comes to really the solvency. But it's more like
saying that adding, while 5 percentage points solvency in 2019, will move us up to around
170 and 778 and then you will also need to have some time in 2020 to reach up to 180%
solvency. So that is again (inaudible) a lot of moving parts into that at least. But that is the
thinking anyway, when it comes to price to expect. [ph] With respect to the negative
ﬁnancial return and you think and banking, there is one product with -- a small product
with a limited interest rates guarantee was ﬂoat [ph] in the unit-linked platform. For
technical reasons, which has the negative contribution in the fourth quarter usually not
expect that going forward, but that was what was booked in the fourth quarter.
With respect to the bank in the negative ﬁnancial return there, it's related to a way to
account for the -- you know IFRS 9 and the way you account for losses in the book, where
we made a model change, which increases the reserves for the -- in the bank. So it's not
related to any change in the expected losses, but an adjustment to the IFRS 9 regulations,
as to how you model or how you reserved for losses and read that portfolio.

81 and subordinated debt issue, is it just normal reﬁnancing or are you planning on
changing the capital structure in the bank and maybe upstreaming more dividends out of
there? Thanks.
