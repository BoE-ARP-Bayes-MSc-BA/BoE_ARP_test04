{BIO 20060140 <GO>}

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. welcome to Storebrand's First Quarter 2019
Conference Call. My name is Kjetil Krokje, and I am Head of Finance Strategy at
Storebrand. Together with me, I have group CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad; and CFO, Lars
Loddesol. In the presentation today, Odd Arild will give you an update on the
developments in the ﬁrst quarter, Lars will give an overall view of the natural development
and speaking to some of the more technical elements. The slides will be similar to the
analyst presentation released this morning and are available on our web page. After the
presentation, the operator will open up for questions. To be able to ask questions, you will
need to dial into the conference call.
I now give the word to Storebrand's CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad, who will start the
presentation on Slide 2.

Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Thank you, Kjetil. Storebrand presented group results of NOK733 million today and
operating proﬁt of NOK531 million. On top of this, we have earned, but not booked
performance fees in our asset management funds of NOK66 million. The amortized costs
related to performance, however, amounts to NOK18 million and are included in our
operating results. The all-time markets in the last quarter of 2018 resulted in lower interest
level for our assets under management. Consequently adding pressure to our fee income
in ﬁrst quarter 2019.

FINAL

Good returns through the ﬁrst quarter has contributed to uplift the AUM -- the assets
under management levels, and fee income is subsequently expected to grow going
forward. Good market conditions in the quarter has provided a solid ﬁnancial results. In
addition, the buﬀer capital saw growth of more than NOK2 billion in the quarter, resulting
in a continued strong solvency position of 173%. Volumes in Unit Linked increased by 11%
compared to the corresponding period last year. And it is especially worth noting the
strong premium income growth of 23% in our Swedish arm SPP.
Moving to Slide number 3, we have a two-fold strategy in Storebrand. We actively
manage the guaranteed products ini long-term run-oﬀs and have strengthened our
solvency to 173%, approaching the level of three years capital release and extraordinary
dividends set to 180%. We are well positioned for capital light growth within savings
through our leading position in occupational pension in Norway and Sweden as well as
the retail [ph] savings market in Norway and our asset management business.

Moving to Slide number 4, speaking about asset management. During the quarter, we
have taken important steps in the international venture, our asset management business.
We have introduced ﬁve funds in NASDAQ in Denmark. These are index funds with
sustainability proﬁles, and we see potential for these to take market share in the Danish
market characterized by actively managed funds with high margins. As part of our
international venue, we have also launched a new international website for Storebrand
funds and are about to list three funds in the Luxembourg for the European markets. I
should also mention the formalized transaction in Cubera April 1. The result of Cubera will
consequently be included in Storebrand's numbers from the second quarter of 2019.
Moving to Slide 5, the growth in savings continues. Growth in Unit Linked reserves are 11%
compared to corresponding period last years, in particular strong sales in SPP. Asset
under management has grown 3% since last -- since year-end. On a quarterly basis,
growth is down due to weaker Swedish Krona, to worse Norwegian Krona, reducing the
asset under management with NOK13 billion. In the banking segment, weaker lending has
grown with 8%, while growth in insurance overall, is weak. However, we see positive
development in the P&C area.
Moving to Slide 6, our Swedish arm on occupational pension SPP has seen solid growth in
premiums since 2017. We have a continuing positive trend in the ﬁrst quarter of 2019 with
a 23% increase in premium income compared to ﬁrst quarter '18 in addition to solid sales
with the positive net transfers, continuing the utilization and new distribution partnerships,
strengthening the competitiveness and increasing SPP market share in the Swedish
markets.
And by that, I give the word to our CFO, Lars Loddesol.

Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Thank you, Odd. Let's start on Page number 7, with the key ﬁgures, and let me brieﬂy go
through some of the key ﬁgures with you. The ordinary operating proﬁt of NOK549
million is weak [ph]. The proﬁt before amortization of NOK733 million is okay and is lifted

FINAL

by good ﬁnancial returns. It is, however, a signiﬁcant fall from the ﬁrst quarter of 2018,
which was impacted by an unusually good insurance results and a one-oﬀ gain of NOK149
million. As Odd has already mentioned, the year started with lower assets under
management due to market turbulence at the end of last year.
Turning to the ﬁrst quarter, the ﬁnancial markets have recovered, and the assets under
management have gone onto an all-time high of NOK729 million. It would've been even
higher had it not been for the weaker Swedish Krona in the quarter. We maintained strong
cost control, and the favorable ﬁnancial markets has been used to strengthen buﬀers. This
has contributed to strong solvency. Also, in the Company portfolios, higher short-term
rates and lower credit spreads have led to good returns. In the ﬁrst quarter, we have
booked NOK18 million in performance-related bonuses. We are not allowed to book the
corresponding NOK66 million in performance-related earnings. In this illustration, we
have chosen to specify the cost -- the bonus-related cost together with the special items in
order to avoid the accompanying cumulative eﬀect of lower operating results due to
good performance and vice versa. The graphs illustrate stronger customer buﬀers in both
Norway and Sweden.
Turning to Page 8, on to solvency movement. The solvency position is unchanged at 173%.
On a general note, we see that the volatility-reducing mechanisms in the Solvency II
standard model works as intended. The reduced equity stress and higher volatility
adjustment contributed positively in the third -- fourth quarter, the eﬀect -- sorry -- while
the reduced equity stress and higher volatility adjustment contributed positively in the
fourth quarter, the eﬀect was the opposite in the ﬁrst quarter. This is illustrated in the ﬁrst
step of movement. Behind the negative 3 percentage points lies lower volatility
adjustment by 12 basis points in Norway and 4 basis points in Sweden and a higher equity
stress.
This quarter, we also implemented the lower UFR of 3.9%, which contributed -contributes negatively to the solvency. Certain model improvements contribute positively.
The next element is market changes. Lower long-term interest rates by 30 basis points in
Sweden and 14 basis points in Norway as well as a ﬂattening of the interest rate curve
contributes negatively. On the positive side, good returns from equities and credit spread
compression contributes through positive returns and buﬀer building. Market value
adjustment reserves are up by NOK2.1 billion. The last element in the movement is
operating earnings. This reﬂects the capital generation in excess of what is set aside for
dividends. With this, we have a solvency margin of 171% before transitionals and 173% after
transitionals. Please notice that we are no longer getting any transitional capital from
interest rates, only from a lower equity stress on equity investments owned since
implementation of Solvency II. These will be all but phased out during this year.
Turning the page to the solvency position of the Storebrand group, Page 9. The Solvency
position is pretty much unchanged from the beginning of the quarter. However, the buﬀer
capital and the underlying proﬁtability from the growth in Unit Linked products have
improved. The sensitivity for a fall in the equity markets has been reduced primarily due
to the better buﬀers. Furthermore, the sensitivity to higher interest rates increased, and
there's more symmetry between interest rates up and interest rates down. The sensitivity
show an increased resilience to volatility in ﬁnancial markets.

Turning the page to Storebrand group, Page 10. In this more traditional presentation of
the results, we see that the fee and admin income is slightly down in the quarter. Adjusted
for currency movements, the fee and admin income is up 0.5%. The growth in the actively
sold products make up for the long-term write-oﬀ of the guaranteed business. The
insurance results are signiﬁcantly lower than last year. The ﬁrst quarter of 2018 was
characterized by reserve releases and run-oﬀ gains not repeated this year. The combined
ratio for insurance as a whole was 90%, within the targeted proﬁtability band. We saw
somewhat weaker seasonal results from P&C and some large claims within group life. We
have continued to show strict cost control in the quarter. The objective of a ﬂat, nominal
cost is conﬁrmed. The ﬁnancial result beneﬁts from strong ﬁnancial markets. We've set
aside NOK139 million or 19% in an estimated tax charge, in line with previously
communicated levels. The tax is non-payable due to large tax losses on the balance sheet.
Turning over to Page 11, here we have the same set-up as on the previous page broken
into the three business areas, savings and insurance and guarantee. We see a signiﬁcant
fall in results from last year, largely explained by the exceptional strong insurance results
last year as well as a one-oﬀ gain within guarantees recorded in the ﬁrst quarter 2019. In
summary, the ﬁrst quarter of 2019 is on the weak side, but we entered the second quarter
with a market-leading position in our key business areas, with strong solvency,
strengthened buﬀers, and good absolute and relative returns in our savings products.
The operator will now open up for questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We have questions coming to already and the ﬁrst
question is from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, your line is open.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thanks very much. I'd like to start with 3 questions, please. The ﬁrst one, you mentioned
about -- on the asset management side slightly weaker margins, less actively managed, et
cetera. Just wondering if you could give us an outlook? Do you see -- is this is a trend? Do
you see it sort of continuing? Yes, perhaps, if you could just give us a couple of words on
how you see that developing? The second one is on the group life. You talked about the
large claims. Could you give us a little bit more color about what happened there? Was it
one or two particularly large claims? Yes, maybe just a little bit more color as to what
happened there.
And ﬁnally, on the solvency, I mean I can certainly follow up with IR if my numbers are
wrong, but just using the sensitivities that you reported for the full year, I was expecting
something a little bit higher. And I was just wondering if you could sort of perhaps talk
maybe about why those sensitives haven't played out? And if -- I mean, if we do -- if
interest rates were now to raise -- to rise 50 basis points, implying 185% solvency, would
that put you in a position where you would now be able to return capital? Or are there
other factors that perhaps still need to play out a little bit? I'm thinking, in particular, about
Page 4 of 13



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2019-05-08

whether you're at the stage of capital release from the books but also take a step up?
Thank you very much.

FINAL

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Okay. I'll start with the asset management business and margins. What we have seen in
the quarter was, ﬁrst and foremost, we went -- enter into the quarter with lower AUM.
Secondly, we see that we've had a outﬂow of AUM from the SKAGEN and Benco
portfolios during 2018. That has been replaced in volume terms by fund investments in
the S50 [ph] and Storebrand funds, however, at a lower margin. And the whole asset
management business, like many other businesses, are a little bit like an escalator moving
against you, i.e., there is margin pressure coming down the escalator and then you have
to move upwards on the escalator into -- in order to maintain your position. This is what
we're doing by introducing a lot of sustainable funds, factor funds. We have bought
Cubera, and we are oﬀering more alternative asset classes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Unfortunately, now, the SKAGEN funds are -- as of right now, all of the equity funds in
SKAGEN are ahead of their benchmark; and we are providing good value for their
customers and likewise generating performance fees towards the end of the year. So
there is margin pressure in any business, also in the asset management business. We see
this showing through in the numbers in the ﬁrst quarter of this sort of asset management
business, and we are actively pursuing measures to oﬀset that.
On the second question, group life and claims, there were less than 10 large claims, but a
few more claims than we would normally expect in workers comp and group life, and the
payouts were slightly bigger than anticipated. So this was within the normal volatility we
see in a single quarter, however, on the outside of the normal in a negative sense. So this
has not led us to change our release for the future, but it does provide for a weak quarter.
Also within group life, we have one contract with -- or one business line within the group
life, which is underpriced, and we are -- we have implemented measures to reprice that,
but we'll not get the full eﬀect of the repricing before the end of the year, which means
that we do expect to have weaker results within group life for 2019 than what we had in
2018. However, we don't believe that it will -- we do expect improvements in the three
coming quarters compared to what it was as of the -- in the quarter.

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

I'm -- try to answer your question on Solvency. I think the sensitivities should be quite in
line here, and I think you have to take into account that both the increase in the stress of
shares, the reduction in the volatility adjustment in combination with the reduction in the
main forward rate has quite signiﬁcant impact on the solvency, so the more business-like
impact has been very positive in this quarter. But the input from EIOPA, of course, has
been a cyclic adjustment to the -- in the solvency calculation.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Just one quick comment on this as well, Peter. Again, we don't give an equity sensitivity,
and that makes also the solvency a little bit hard to predict when equity moves up like this
and also the associated equity stress. So that makes it harder to estimate on the out life.

Absolutely. When it comes to the guiding around 180%, it's now a new element in that.
We believe that is the level where we are overcapitalized and, of course, has the view that
we will either start extraordinary dividends or share buybacks or a combination of that at
that point.

Q - Peter Eliot

Okay. Great thank you very much.

The next question comes from Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please go ahead your line
is now open.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, good afternoon. Two questions, please. Firstly, if I look at the Unit Linked Norway,
you've had a very strong inﬂow here, but also the -- looks like -- has there been some
transfers from asset management into Unit Linked Norway? Or how come there was such
a big jump in that side at the same time when you're talking about margin pressure
altogether? Then also, if you could elaborate a bit more on the kind of margin pressure
statement that you pointed out even in the report in the outlook statement that you're
seeing -- or the Board is seeing margin pressure. Is this mainly referring to the asset
management business? And how do you plan to tackle this? And if possible, could you
quantify the impact of this margin pressure at all in Q1? Thanks.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Okay. So on the ﬁrst question, I think it also goes a little back to Peter's question because
there has been a change in the fee arrangements between the -- by the companies and
the asset manager in Storebrand, meaning that there is somewhat more -- or lower cost
for asset management in the Unit Linked business and, thus, lower top line in the asset
manager, leading to some higher proﬁtability in the Unit Linked Norway line.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

And how much was the impact, if I may ask?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Somewhere near NOK20 million for -- not only Unit Linked Norway, but for all the internal
lines of business lead by asset management services from Storebrand's management.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Okay.

On the margin pressure, I guess this is something you see in all active margins that there
is margin pressure. And where you can -- I think Unit Linked Norway is an example where
margins, supplementary, have come in the right direction for us this quarter. However, we
see an ongoing margin pressure. We already talked about the asset management
business. In the banking, you see that the ending margins has come down. That's partly
explained by higher interbank rates during the ﬁrst quarter, and we have implemented
price -- or we have raised prices for mortgages towards the end of the ﬁrst quarter with
eﬀect in the second quarter when the rates from the Central Bank was increased. So it was
more of a general statement. You see it a little bit in all the kinds of business that we have.
I guess we also talked a little bit about the -- in using -- no -- sorry, in diﬀerent contribution
contracts, there is typically pressure on the visibility element in those kind of contracts.
And when I mentioned that one of the group life association or contract that we had was
weak proﬁtability, it's also a result of margin pressure in that business. So we are
managing this in a growth sense. And I think the most important takeaway from the
comment in the report is the fact that having cost leadership is always a very robust
strategy in a market which is competitive, and that is one of the reasons why we keep on
pushing for lower cost and higher eﬃciency in the business. That's the only the way to
maintain proﬁtability in a competitive market.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Did this margin pressure come as a surprise? I know you've talked about this before, but
was it somehow accelerated in the ﬁrst quarter? And if possible, what was the reason for
this? Who was more competitive? Or in which segment was this?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

There's no speciﬁc change in the ﬁrst quarter. So this is more of a general comment over
time.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Got it. Thanks.

Operator
The next question comes from Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan. Plead go ahead, your line
is now open.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yes hi, thank you. I have a couple of questions. I mean, sorry, I'm going back to margin
pressure comment again. I mean how do we think about margin pressure? Is it just
because of the mix shift that you ﬂagged like outﬂow from SKAGEN and Delphi and
inﬂows into SPP and Storebrand? Or you are seeing some reduction in the fees that you
collect on other asset classes as well? So that's one thing I would be interested in getting
some thoughts.

Page 7 of 13



FINAL

Company Name: Storebrand ASA

Secondly, one of your competitor who reported numbers today is ﬂagging that they are
pushing something around 10% price increase in TMC in Norway. I mean whereas if I look
at your numbers your combined ratio deteriorated quite a lot year-on-year, maybe
because one-oﬀs, et cetera, that was there last year. But are you trying to do any sort of
price increases as well? Or you think that 90% is a good run rate that we should follow?
And lastly, just, again, going back to asset management revenue margin. If I look at your
ﬁrst quarter number, it's around 19 basis point annualized. So is that the right number we
should keep for next four quarters and adding the performance fee on top of that in the
fourth quarter? Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Let me just start. I think when we talk about margin pressure, it's absolutely what you see
is the shift in this quarter from high-margin funds into more low-margin funds, but then,
again, we've also seen an extremely good performance in -- especially in SKAGEN during
the quarter. So we believe this will be more evened out going forward, but, of course, that
is a trend in the market and also something that we see. When it comes to the margins, in
the ﬁrst quarter, or asset management fees, then you should also take into account what
the (inaudible) just said. We have reduced somewhat margins -- the pricing from our asset
management to also our life insurance companies. And that causes though some ﬂagging
[ph] in the group altogether, but it has an impact on the margins in the asset management
stand-alone.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

And just a quick comment on asset management. We now go into the second quarter
with higher assets under management and also growth in the active part of assets under
management. So the run rate could be materially higher than the NOK73 million we
reported at Q1. So you should not use that as the new normal for asset management.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

On TMC insurance prices, we're not doing anything in particular on a general basis for
TMC insurance prices. However, as I mentioned, within group life, we have initiated a
price increase on certain contracts, and we are constantly monitoring the diﬀerent
business lines in order to see that there are correctly priced, and we are doing minor
adjustment basically all the time. But we're not having a general price increase of 10% as
such.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. That's very clear. Yes.

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

I think also just to reiterate that on the combined ratio because the target is 90% to 92%,
that's relative hard. And on the 19 basis points in Storebrand asset management, the
higher value -- we -- you should -- we're constantly trying to increase that. And as I -- one
of the things I mentioned was that transaction fees were much lower in the ﬁrst quarter
and will pick up in the coming quarters and there are also other fee elements that we
expect to be able to receive in the coming quarters to improve the margin somewhat in
Page 8 of 13

Date: 2019-05-08

addition to the volumes growing as such. And a shift towards more alternative asset
classes, like the acquisition of Cubera, which comes in with NOK9 billion in assets under
management in -- from -- time frame, of course, helps both the returns and margins in our
asset management business.

FINAL

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. And then, sorry, just one more small follow-up. Is there any chance you can get
them to ﬂoat the number on asset management? That would be helpful to model the
asset management unit a bit better, I mean, maybe today, maybe later on, whenever you
think it's right.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yes. We are working on that disclosure I think. We don't have it now at the ﬁrst quarter,
but I think we want to have it -- work a little bit more on the 10% on the second quarter on
a running basis.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

That would be really helpful. Thank you.

(Operator Instructions) Next question comes from Blair Stewart from Bank of America.
Please go ahead, your line is now open.

Q - Blair Thomson Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you, good afternoon. A couple of questions just to pick up on most of the ones
have been addressed. But the new funds that you're introducing in the asset management
segment, are those -- what would you expect the margin to be on those funds, are those
high or low-margin funds? And you mentioned the lack of transaction fees in the quarter.
What would a typical quarter be for transaction fees, please? Moving on to the group life
segment. There's been a lot of volatility over the last few years in the proﬁt from that
segment, from the low 100s into the mid-200s looking at over the last few years. Is there
any way to give any indication of a good run rate for that part of the business?
And ﬁnally, you've given some guidance on when excess capital might be released. You
talked about NOK10 billion being released over 2021 to 2027. And then you talked about,
I think, from 2021 you'd expect the solvency ratio to be above 180%, and that would
trigger some additional payments as well. So I just wonder, is there any change or
upgrade to your guidance on any of the timing of these things given where we are today?
Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I can start with the new funds of Storebrand asset management. They're are the funds we
already have, but we are now launching them internationally. So SKAGEN, they had an
international distribution set up. We are now putting Storebrand funds and SPP funds into
Page 9 of 13

FINAL

the sales distribution networks, so it's existing funds within -- with a special focus on
sustainable investments as well as index funds. So index funds, in particular, in the Danish
market, which is -- which has much lower index funds as a proportion of total funds in
other markets, so we see an opportunity there. And in the other markets primarily a
diﬀerent kind of sustainability funds, either index funds with a sustainability enhancement
or factored funds with a sustainability kit [ph]. They are usually priced between 25 and 75
basis points.
In terms of transaction fees in the Storebrand Asset Management business, I believe they
booked around NOK40 million last year. So about NOK10 million a quarter would be a
normal run rate, but that will, obviously, go up and down somewhat. On group life, if
group life exceeds the combined ratio target of 90% to 92% and with normalized ﬁnancial
return, it would be somewhere in the area of NOK150 million. But again, as Lars said, we
expect 2019 to be less proﬁtable than what you have seen last year and look better than
Q1.

Q - Blair Thomson Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

I hope so.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think when it comes to entering to 180% solvency of the quarter, we guided on our
Capital Market Day starting point of 2020 or 2021, everything equal. Maybe it comes
somewhat earlier and with a small likelihood 2020. We expect not to be at the level of
180% in stocks doing higher extraordinary dividend for share buybacks.

Q - Blair Thomson Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yes. Absolutely, everything equal, I would say, being able to build NOK3 billion in buﬀer
capital and especially NOK2 billion in market value adjustment reserve this quarter. Of
course, those are huge step forward when it comes to the -- that quality of our back book,
and it only strengthens our message I think around how the development and the capital
release from the back book have all going forward.

Thank you. I was going to follow up, actually, on the insurance segment. Just had a couple
of questions. I guess on the top line you're commenting that the P&C sales are starting to
pick up. I'm just wondering if you can comment on the outlook for the other lines.
Because I mean you sort of deliberately positioned this segment, I guess, in some markets
that you saw as growth markets. And I'm just wondering whether -- what your -- sort of at
this stage what your longer term outlook is for the top line growth?
And then secondly, in terms of the results, where we talked about the underwriting
results, I struggled a little bit with the ﬁnancial results sometimes as well. I mean -- and I'm
just wondering how you would guide us to think about or forecast it? You've had some

On the insurance growth, if you look at the diﬀerent lines, it's on Page 14 for those of you
who follow the presentation. It's proﬁt per product line. And in actual fact, there are three
lines here, but it actually consists of seven diﬀerent products. So ﬁrst we have P&C, and as
we talked about, P&C is increasing. Second is individual life. That has been stable over
sometime. It's a very proﬁtable line. We also see some growth in that business.
On health insurance, we have a number one quality position in the Norwegian market,
and that is developing with high single-digit growth. Group life is a market where we have
a pretty stable market share and fairly stable market. But there is also some worker's comp
in that line, and that worker's comp, we have a very small market share, and we are not -that is also quite a stable market. Then the last bit is pension-related disability insurance in
the Nordic. That's what the disability insurance is related to. The fund contribution keeps
in Norway, and so typically together with, but on a separate basis with pension schemes in
Sweden. Both of those markets are in the order of 5% to 5%-plus increase.

And that is still in line with what we said at our Capital Markets Day that the goal for
around 5% growth in the insurance we booked.

On the ﬁnancial results, Peter, just quickly. It's understandable. I guess one of the main
reason here is that the health and group life subsegment is coinvested with the guarantee
life portfolios in the sense that this is product that legally exists on life insurance
company's balance sheet. So it means that the results -- or sorry, the return this quarter is
stronger than what it's been -- than what shows in the results because it means that it has
a part of all the market value adjustment reserves or in the case of unrealized gains as
they are billed for the quarter. On a normalized basis, you could expect somewhere in the
area of 20 to 30 a quarter from insurance segment as such. So this is just a timing issue
actually. This is result that, well, normally could have been booked this quarter. But once

we then add everything into market value adjustment results, that postponement caused
that income into the ﬁnancials results, but it will come booked.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Yes. Just one follow-up on the new Cubera, probably take it to your margins. What kind of
level should we think about having on those NOK9 billion adding from the 1st of April, if
you could shed some light on that? Thank you.

We said in the stock exchange release that the -- for 2018, they have a proﬁt before tax of
NOK50 million. So I think that contributes to our newer funds in relations to the
(inaudible) in capital. They're also raising new funds these days, which will increase the
AUM during the year and expected higher results of the Nordic 2019 correspond with
that.
