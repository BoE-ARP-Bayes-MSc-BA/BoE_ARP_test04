Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Topdanmark's
Results for the First Three Quarters of 2015. I must advise you the webcast is being
recorded today on Monday, November 16, 2015.
I'd now like to hand the webcast over to your presenter today, Christian Sagild. Please go
ahead.

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody, and good morning to the USA, and thank you for joining us
in this conference call. With me are, as usual, our CFO, Lars Thykier; and Steﬀen
Heegaard, who is Head of Investor Relations and Group Communications. We are holding
this conference because earlier today we published our results for the ﬁrst three quarters
of 2015. We are now ready to answer your questions. Please ask them one at a time.
Operator, could we have the ﬁrst question, please?

Q&A

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Thank you. I have some questions regarding the capital and the transfer to Solvency II. I
think it was in the Q1 report you mentioned that there would be potential for expected
future proﬁts to be calculated as a percentage of Group premiums instead of the
premium reserves. I was just wondering – we have heard some slightly diﬀerent
comments from some of your competitors. So I was just hoping if you can give us some
more details on that and maybe if DFSA have guided you in connection with also the
model improvement a few weeks ago on that speciﬁc topic.
And also on Solvency II, I was wondering about the discounting curve. It looks like the
AOPA end of October curve is basically in line with the end of October FSA curve, is that
correctly understood; i.e., that we should expect only a marginal change to the impact of
discounting when going over to Solvency II?
And then, ﬁnally, on a diﬀerent topic; on price changes. You mentioned earlier in the year
that you would lower prices with around 5% on motor. How – what is the progress on this?
Do you still need to do some of those changes or is it all basically factored in by now?
Thank you.

I can recall this from the ﬁrst quarter's accounts, but the basic thing when we are talking
insurance contract is, that insurance contracts are regarded as an investment in Solvency II
and in the future Danish accounting rules. That is that when you expense (02:40) the
acquisition cost and the insurance contract is concluded, the insurance contract represent
some kind of value.
The expected net cash ﬂow of the insurance contract is discounted through the day where
the accounts are made up to calculate the present value. That is that if an insurance
contract is to yield a positive net cash ﬂow of DKK 100 million over next year, we'll (03:10)
in the balance sheet.
In the Solvency II balance sheet, the value of insurance contracts is booked as expected
future proﬁt and reﬂected in shareholders' funds. In the future Danish GAAP balance
sheet, it would probably be named service margins.
Concerning the curve, you are right that the diﬀerence between the current curve and the
curve we will have after January 1 is, the diﬀerence is very small, given that the company
that uses the curve has asked for and got the permission to volatility adjustments. But this
is – you have to apply it and we have applied but we have not got the permission yet.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Jakob, you asked about the price development in motor. What happened in Q2 was that
we introduced a new motor tariﬀ. And if you took the old motor tariﬀ and change that into
the new motor tariﬀ, that meant a discount – a lowering average of 5%. Those 5% does
not materialize at once, but it represents a competitiveness in the market to have the
lower prices on the new motor insurances.

FINAL

We have seen through 2015 that we have lost more customers than we have gained; and
therefore, we have a slight drop in our market share in motor. And this is due to a very – a
quite ﬁerce competition. I think that we have now seen that most of the companies have
introduced their motor tariﬀs, and I think that we are probably moving towards a more
normalized competitive situation. But the eﬀect of new customers having lower prices on
average than customers leaving us will still have an eﬀect in 2016. And I think that we, also
in 2016, will see an average drop in the motor premiums.
So that is one of the reasons why we guide minus 1% in 2016 and the other reason is that
we still expect some larger accounts in the commercial line business to accept oﬀers that
we will not compete with from some of our competitors.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks for that. Just one follow-up on the capital. So those new items of Solvency II,
they will most likely then boost your solvency position. I guess you could argue that you
already – today you basically have those capital elements available. It's just not included in
reported capital. How does – or how are you looking at that? I mean, will you actually treat
this as extra capital or is it just extra reported capital?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

You are completely right. The individual solvency regime we have now included the same
items as Solvency II (06:31). So there will not be more capital cover when we change to
Solvency II. We regard these extra elements as, what we call, an accounting illusion,
because it doesn't change the fundamental value of the company. And that means that
this extra capital will not be – will not trigger any more share buybacks.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot.

In-Yong Hwang of Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Hello. Good afternoon. This is In-Yong Hwang from Goldman Sachs. Two questions for
me. Just one on run-oﬀs, it's not as high as last quarter, but still quite high and higher than
your kind of 1.5% to 2% guidance. Is it still the same third-party liability and kind of change
of ownership insurance that you were talking about in the last quarter and where that's
coming from?
And just a bit of detail on how often you kind of look at reserves to determine whether
you've got too much, I mean, just especially in the context of your Nordic peer in Norway
got into (08:02) much higher bonus levels going forward in the next couple of years.

And my second question is on your buybacks. You converted to the safe harbor method
going forward. I wonder – does that aﬀect anything in terms of whether you get closer to
your guided level of buyback? In the last few years we've seen Topdanmark for – quite a
few hundred million short of the kind of the announced number in terms of the buyback
achieved during the year. So I wonder whether that actually makes it more likely that you
would get closer to the DKK 1.95 billion that you've announced for this year at all. Thank
you.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

If I can answer the last question for you regarding the buyback. The fact that we use safe
harbor method enlarge the window that we can have buybacks performed, since they can
start tomorrow but continue up until February 10; whereas we would be in a silent period.
The report states that we will – that we have asked Danske Bank to perform a buyback of
DKK 564 million from now and up until February and that is the remainder of the buyback
of DKK 1.95 billion, which is still the potential buyback or stated buyback for 2015.
So apart from this small time lag, the buybacks will be performed to DKK 1.95 billion. And
going forward, we will probably not use – I mean, we will, of course, state how much
buyback has been performed by January 1 also, but we will use these windows between
reporting dates to announce buybacks for the future quarter.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Concerning run-oﬀ. The major part of the run-oﬀ this quarter has been in illness and
accident and in liability. We look at the reserves every quarter, but we do not have runoﬀ
for every business line every quarter. We just have to – we look at it from time to time we
close (10:25) and this means that (10:29) in the runoﬀ stream.
I don't know. Did that answer your question?

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Yup, yup. But I guess you probably keep the same comment you just made in the last
quarter that I think you mentioned something like the 1.5% to 2% is a bit too conservative
in the near term. Is that correct?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

It probably is. The 1.5% to 2%, that is looking forward. When we make up our reservations
for claims this year, we look at kind of conservatism in the reservations, which should be
1.5 percentage points to 2 percentage points.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

Thank you. Your next question comes from Per Grønborg of Danske. Please ask your
question.

FINAL

Q - Per Grønborg
Yes. Good afternoon. It's Per from Danske. A couple of questions from my side as well.
First going back to the issues that Jakob asked about on capital. You now got your
Solvency II models approved. I would assume that this implies that you know how much
capital you will need going forward. But what you don't need – what you don't know is
how much of the existing balance sheet you're able to include in your capital available
going into 2016. Is that correctly understood? That was the ﬁrst question.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

I don't think so. We need to know whether our volatility adjustment is approved or is not
approved. That is an outstanding point, Per. But I think we have a pretty clear picture of
our base capital in 2016.

Q - Per Grønborg
And (12:26) what your capital need will be in 2016 will be approved you have now and
assuming you will get the volatility approved?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

There are still a few small items that we'll have to adjust, but it'll be close to the individual
solvencies that you see now, or the base capital we show in the sheets.

Q - Per Grønborg
So to the individual solvency need, you show somewhere in the report?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Yeah, in the presentation.

Q - Per Grønborg
In the presentation. Okay. I'll try and look in the presentation. My ﬁnal question, where
was conversation, that discussions now are – it has basically decided that retirement age
will be increased by one year. There's two more years to come down the road. How do we
see the 2015, 2016 proﬁt impact from those changes?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

In ﬁrst place, we make reservations until 70 years, so this will not impact the reserves. But I
mean, the industry will have to cope with this change in retirement date and that might
mean that some of our colleagues will increase the premiums, but I don't see any impact
on our combined ratio.

Q - Per Grønborg

Q - Per Grønborg
Retirement age. Okay. Perfect. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Christian Hede of Nordea. Please ask your
question.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. It's Christian from Nordea. I just have a few follow-up questions.
One is on the shadow account and life insurance business. Do you know what the
treatment will be going forward, and do you have any news to share with us?

Bloomberg Transcript

Another part would be if you could talk a bit more about what you call the loss of
unproﬁtable industrial customers. I understand there is workers compensation. And how
you see the competition going forward as well? And then just to clarify because I wasn't
paying enough attention, did you say that you would issue buyback sizes, buyback
programs every quarter? Thank you.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

(14:49) shadow account. We have not received the guidelines for new – for contribution in
the future yet. But it is our expectation that the shadow account one that is the shadow
account concerning the return on investment there. That it will disappear and we'll have
to run oﬀ the existing shadow accounts within ﬁve years. And if we are not able to make
up the missing income within these ﬁve years, we'll have to write it oﬀ.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

With regards to the workers comp, you're absolutely right. The competition in workers
comp is quite ﬁerce. And for some reason, we feel that some of our competitors are using
other methods of tariﬃng than we do. We see quite a severe loss of portfolio. We have
lost, for instance, to protect the small Norwegian company we lost more than DKK 50
million in portfolio in workers comp on a net basis. And what we see is a price policy that
we cannot recognize in the claims patterns (16:11) that these customers have produced in
the past.
So we are looking at competition that we will simply not participate in. We are being
(16:22) some 30% on price levels that would cover the average claim cost, marginal costs
and this of course is something that we'll not accept. So this is to some extent, of course,
aﬀecting the competition in workers comp right now.

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Thank you. And the buybacks every quarter?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

FINAL

I don't think we said anything about this.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

But, well, did you ask the question, Christian, about that?

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Yeah. Yeah. Because I wasn't paying enough attention, so I heard that you would say how
much you would buy back each quarter, but maybe I was wrong. So I was just asking
whether that's correct or not.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

We will report through the Safe Harbor method how much we authorize Danske bank to
buy back in the next open window.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Niccolo Dalla Palma of Exane BNP
Paribas. Please ask your question.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Hi. One more question please on Solvency II. Could you – were the DKK 4.7 billion of
estimated (17:31) capital remain completely unchanged even after the ﬁnal adjustments
and is that the number we should compare to the DKK 6.7 billion on slide 20 of available
capital going forward?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

What we need to have is a reasonable surplus of base capital above the solvency capital
required. But the Solvency II elements, they are quite volatile and for this reason, we will
probably continue stating that the DKK 4.7 billion of (18:14) funds, hybrid capital and Tier 2
capital is the number that we are aiming at.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Okay, very clear. Thanks.
