{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Thank you, Ian. Good morning. We are satisfied with the outcome of the 1/1 renewals for
us. Our reinsurance business grows by 9.7%, while its expected profitability remains
globally stable in terms of both return on risk-adjusted capital and technical ratio, which is
loss ratio plus commission ratio, benefits from the effect of one large deal, without which
the growth rate would have been plus 8%. So, it's no surprise to us in the spread of gross
rates that are shown in slides 11 and 12 by geography and by line of business respectively.
Looking specifically at slide 12, the 15% gross rate in the Property Cat segments results
from beyond the U.S. from a successful attempt to further broaden the relationships we
have with a number of selected European clients, which included increasing our shares in
the nat cat programs.

Bloomberg Transcript

This led to a capital efficient rebalancing of our nat cat P&L commitments, in big (00:02:21)
perils and region with the same risk appetite net of retrocession. Of course, we would
have expected (00:02:29) reinsurance market in general, and in particular, vis-à-vis the
markets and line of business that have been the most affected by the heavy nat cat and
man-made loss activities in 2017, and in the second half of 2018.
As you can see in slide 6, our good performance has been made possible by our ability to
pursue a very active and dynamic portfolio management that is illustrated by the volume
of business cancelled, as well as to some extent by the positive and negative variation of
volumes of the business affected by share variations and the restructuration of programs.
Cancelled business is spread equally among APAC, Americas and EMEA, while most of
the new business originates in Americas and EMEA, and mostly with existing clients.
For us, the relative disappointment mainly comes three areas: U.S. nat cat to-date,
considering that most of the loss-affected programs renew later in the year; Marine and
Energy, which had started well-off, but finished as one of the latest and slowest ever.
China, for the property books where we kept our strategic positions and succeeded to
tactically manage the portfolios.
Nevertheless, the overall result is positive for us with risk adjusted prices globally up by a
bit more than 1% across the renewed reinsurance portfolio, close to 2% in nonproportional and above 1% in proportion. It is worth mentioning though that the riskadjusted price increase in proportional is largely due to the summing up of the primary
insurance prices in reaction to losses sustained and claims inflation. This positive
momentum in the primary insurance pricing is also beneficial to us in our Specialty
Insurance activities.
The growth in reinsurance at 11%, combined with a positive perspective in Specialty
Insurance and for the rest of the year in reinsurance is well in line with indication given at
the September 2018 IR Day of growth in the upper part of the Vision in Action plan
assumption for 2019 and is to stay in the 5% to 8% range.

FINAL

As anticipated, the growth at 1/1 has been fuelled by the U.S. which stands at plus 24%,
well supported by the deployment of our key client management initiative, which
encompasses 45% of the total gross return premium in the U.S. In the U.S., we have
continued to be mindful of maintaining the 65%-35% balance of our book between short
and longer dates.
Property Non-Cat grows by 26%; Property Cat rose by 24%; Casualty including (00:05:15)
by 18% with price changes that are more in line with the improvements that we were
already looking for last year and that did not materialize then.
However, we continue to be cautious in U.S. Casualty as (00:05:31), we still see the
projected loss ratios increasing despites rates improving to cover the assumed inflation. In
addition to the U.S., the growth is also marked for the portfolio of global client with a plus
23% progression, demonstrating the relevance and the efficiency of the initiative on that
segment.
In conclusion, we believe that combined with the early and good renewals of our capital
shield protection last fall, these renewals should contribute to enhance the overall net
profitability and we are looking forward to the spring and summer next renewal with a
reasonable optimism.
Thank you for your attention and I think we now move onto the Q&A.

Q&A

We will now take our first question from Kamran Hossain from RBC Capital Markets.
Please go ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. It's Kamran Hossain from RBC. Two questions. The first one is just
coming back to the nat cat ratio point that we've talked about in the recent past I guess,
(00:06:51) came up. Any indication on whether that's moving up from 6% to 7%, or
whether ends up? So, that's kind of question one.
And then, I guess, slightly relating to that. Could you give some comments about, I guess,
your ability to access retrocession and whether you've made any material changes to your
own cover for the coming year? Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Okay. So, on the first point, I do confirm that we intend to move our cat budget from 6%
to 7% in our operating plan for 2019. So, that's done basically. On the second point, the
retrocession, while you know we've been largely in the media about our retro program.
So, our retro program every year goes to the market very early. We are ready with the

information for renewal in June, we start negotiation in September with the pure objective
to be completed early November.
This year was no difference. This year meaning 2018 was no difference from any previous
year. We went exactly as per the previous years in terms of schedule and we completed
early November with basically the same structure, well with of course, the addition of the
cat bond that we had placed earlier in the year. So, structurally, we've not changed the
structure and we've continued with basically the same providers of capacity on kind of a
50-50 basis between traditional and alternative.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks very much, Victor.

We will now take our next question from Vikram – my apologies. His line seems
disconnected. We will now take our next question from Thomas Fossard from HSBC.
Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone. I just had a question first on – at the gross reported in
the Credit & Surety lines, plus 16%. Could you split that up between gross in volumes and
pricing and what has been the drivers behind this gross?
And the second question would be related to your appetite for Property Cat, especially
plus 15% when renewed (00:09:04). When you put that in the context of overall appetite
from nat cat, how much can you – or are you willing to take on top and how much of the
capacity (00:09:19) are you utilizing at present time? Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Credit & Surety, first of all, I mean, the plus-16s comes from a combination of two things. A
few new clients to us, companies that we knew in the past, had discontinued business
with, have resumed business. So, we have three or four new clients. And we have
increased our share on one of our large customer. So, that completes the plus 16%. We
are pretty satisfied with the behavior of the Credit & Surety book. And so, even though, I
mean if you look at the slide that shows the prices movement by line of business, while
Credit & Surety shows as the line, which has seen a reduction, we are still very satisfied
with the expected profitability from there. So, we had an opportunity to re-enter some
clients, we had an opportunity to increase our line, we had been looking for that increase
for quite a number of years and we had the opportunity, we took it.
On Property Cat, well, over the past three, four years, we have considerably increased
our Property Cat book in the U.S., as you know, which was just in line with the overall
redevelopment of our business in the U.S. And well, we used to have in the past an
unbalanced portfolio with Europe sticking up and U.S., Japan below, while we ended up

Page 4 of 12



Company N ame: SCOR SE

Date: 2019-02-07

over the last two years with the best result (00:10:48) of the reverse position, while peak
PMLs in the U.S. and Europe below.

FINAL

While we had opportunities this year and in our relationship with a number of large
customers in Europe, whether they'd be global or very large national, our relationship with
them are such that, well, we could basically redeploy cat capacity. And at the same time,
increase our line on the rest of their programs. That's what we did.
And as I commented, well, this is having two effects. One, our weight in the wallet of
those clients has materially increased and this is totally in line with what we wanted to
achieve. And secondly, we have rebalanced our book, which from a diversification
perspective and a capital usage is very useful. At the same token, you'll remember that
we placed the €300 million cat bond earlier in 2018. That was exactly the purpose of that
cat bond in which Europe was included.
So, we have a retro program today that is well covering us for 2019 and even a bit further
in terms of continued development of the business in Europe, without modifying our risk
appetite (00:11:59) retro.

We will now take our next question from Frank Kopfinger from Deutsche Bank. Please go
ahead.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. I have two questions. So, my first question is on you pointed –
looking forward, you pointed already to expectations for higher and better pricing coming
through, also being pushed by the losses that you had or which occurred in 2018. Could
you give some flavor on your expectations for April and July renewals outlook in terms of
pricing?
And then secondly, you sounded still quite conscious in respect to U.S. Casualty business.
Can you share some more thoughts on what would make you more optimistic on this?
And what are the key concerns here?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Okay. I will take the U.S. Casualty and Jean Paul Conoscente will take the April and July
renewals. On the U.S. Casualty, we were very clear last year in the sense that we were
commenting about some of the large deals and Casualty market in general. And we were
saying that on the proportional side, we thought commissions should go down by at least
a few points, 2 to 3 points at least.
And on the non-proportional, we were looking for increases of about 10% more than the
increases we were seeing last year, which means that last year, we passed certain
number of those deals. Interestingly enough, what – if we look at our price movements on

Page 5 of 12



Company N ame: SCOR SE

Date: 2019-02-07

FINAL

the U.S. Casualty this year, this is about where we are, I mean we have compensated
commissions by about 3% and we have price increases about 11% to 12%.
So, it has opened up – to some extent, it has opened up to further development, but
we've remained cautious, because as I said, well, we see in certain areas where we don't
do commercial auto (00:14:10), so that's not an area for us. But we see in other areas,
whether it is Med Mal, and in particular for hospitals, whether it is D&O, there are certain –
a number of areas where we see a frequency of large losses and the severity of the
losses that is increasing.
While there are a lot of uncertainties, still we are doing a lot of studies on that. There are
uncertainties regarding the reasons for that, and hence, while there is certain uncertainty
on the pricing. So, we remain cautious about that and we do our best to take that into
account. And we, in certain cases, we feel that the risk is not yet well being taken. That's
where we are in U.S. Casualty.
Jean Paul on the renewals.

A - Jean Paul Conoscente

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Regarding the renewals, in April, loss affected programs, we'll be renewing in Japan
and the United States. In Japan, we've engaged already in discussions with our clients on
the renewals. Expectations is for price increases. The extent is still being discussed, in our
view, probably double-digit, but to be confirmed over the next few weeks.
In the U.S., there's a number of large cat programs that have loss affected that we'll be
renewing as well. The expectation is similar, double-digit rate increases, on the extent of
which remains to be confirmed. For loss free programs, we see countries like India, which
is a big market renewing in April. That would likely not be affected by the losses in the U.S.
and Japan and that market has its own dynamics and expectations there is for an
improvement of terms, because of the deterioration of the results for both the insurers
and reinsurers in India.
And in the U.S., for loss free programs, we expect there to be also a timing of capacity. If
we look at what happened at 1/1 in the U.S., where there was a lot of loss free programs
renewing. In 1/1/2018, as we got closer to the end of the year, the market tended to be
softer. This year, as we get closer to the end of the year, the market tend to be harder.
A lot of programs struggle to be finished to be placed and the placement went into
January. There was a lot of trading going on with brokers and clients to complete the
placements. And we think that that will carry through at the April and June, July renewals.
So, we remain cautiously optimistic for those renewals.

We will now take our next question from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca. Please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Thank you, everybody. So, just one question on the technical
profitability and the pricing. So, I remember, Victor, discussing with you last year as well
this topic. And probably, it's the same that when you have 1% price increase, 1.3%, the fact
that it is 0% for technical profitability, is due to various other factor, which are probably
similar. But just if indeed the comment that were just made on double-digit price increase
for April, but if it's only in Japan and loss affected if you could clarify. But if that doubledigit comes in, then would you expect slightly bit more group point (00:17:55) technical
profitability as well? And that's the first question.
And second question is just on the slide 7 today, where the proportional volume of
premiums are up 8.7% and you have mentioned they are large whole-account program.
Could you just comment a bit about that, because I think that's bit of a shift here? Could
you just comment on that? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, the increases in proportional and non-proportional, they are not very different. I
mean, we are nearly 9% on the proportional, 11% something on non-prop. So, it's not
fundamentally different. What you have to take into account that overall, we are a 70%
proportional, 30% non-proportional. And this is very stable. I mean, it takes a lot of nonproportional to move this balance. So, it can be 69.5%, it can be 70%, it can be 70.5%. But
we are around 70% proportional and 30% non-prop. I think that is the sort of ratio we
have been carrying on with that for a number of years.
We tend to continue with the same balance. I think the dynamic of proportional and the
dynamic of non-proportional are different, a bit like Life and Non-Life. We like to have a
combination of prop, non-prop. So, we have – prop is increasing. We try to increase our
non-prop, so that we keep the balance. So, that's basically what we do.
Regarding the first, yes, I mean, every time we have a disconnect between the price
increase and the movement of the underwriting ratio, which is the loss ratio plus
commission ratio, someone like you comes up with that question. And the answer will
always be the same. And we'll take a very simple example, wildfire in the California. If last
year, we had a loss model for wildfire in California, and this year we have a different loss
model, because we take into account the experience, we progress in our analysis and our
loss model is stronger this year than it was last year. Then because of the change in the
loss model basically, while the improvement in prices does not translate entirely in an
improvement or expected profitability.
So this is exactly what's the situation and we had that in the past. I remember a few years
ago, because you asked already a question. We had produced a slide, where we were

Page 7 of 12



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2019-02-07

showing all the renewals, all the renewal seasons historically and we were showing the
price increase and the expected profitability improvement.

FINAL

And there are years where, because you changed your loss model, whether it is cat loss
model or casualty loss model, because you change your loss model while the increase in
prices do not translate entirely in improvements in the expected profitability. That's what
we have this year.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

So, relatively simple, it's not simple, but it's very consistent, I should say...

Yes.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

...in our presentations. Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

If I may follow up quickly, please. So the question was also that if this double-digit in Japan
might happen, then in – could you guide us that will that also ultimately end up being
flattish for technical, as in will it be just matching the loss model or can you get a bit
more...

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

(00:21:22). No, I know, but we are not intending to change our loss model for U.S. nat cat, I
don't think so. I think that we have already learned a lot on the California wildfire. So I think
we are there. On Japan, well, we are looking at it. I mean, the experiments we currently
(00:21:44), we need to look into that and to see whether it serves or not a revision of the
model.
If the model are revised, well, again, we would be in the situation, where part of the
increase would be eaten up by the change in loss model, but we are not ready to really
have an opinion there yet on that. We are – I think there is a very good dialogue with our
Japanese client and I think we are trying with them to understand the dynamic of those
two losses and in particular of (00:22:14).

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And, so just to follow-up, the large whole-account programs are
proportional, is there any comment on that you could offer? Was it not casualty, not...

Great, brilliant. Thank you. Sorry. I don't know what's going on. Some technical issues, so
just two from me, please. So, firstly, on the nat cat, just checking on the (00:23:46)
obviously a bit higher than perhaps we were expecting. On those losses, where there any
areas that you had above average market share or anything that's unusual?
And then, secondly, on the price increases. I mean last year was good as well and you
took more rate than your peers on average. This year it looks to be the same and the
delta looks to have grown a little bit. I mean how much of that is because you're still sort
of regaining the Tier 1 status or is it just because you're being a bit more selective in
navigating the cycle more? Just any color there would be great. Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

I think we've invested a lot in portfolio management, both from a cultural standpoint and
tuning in the division. So, I think I would attribute that to the management of the renewals,
where I believe we are really I think very, very precise management of the landing of the
renewals. And this management is really shared worldwide and I think all the teams are
contributing and we have the tools so that we foresee basically where we are going to
land. So, I think that to me, that's management. That's also position in the market, but I
don't think we are regaining anymore. I think (00:25:08) in the eyes of the clients.
And the question for us now is, at which speed the increasing lines come and what sort of
terms and condition we can negotiate, but I think we are there. So, we are very, very
pleased with the response from U.S. client to our client relationship management. I think
this has really promoted the company and given us a lot of renewals and (00:25:36) and
this renewal is also very rewarding. It's really the results of six, seven years of hard work
with those clients. So, that's for your – what was your first – oh the losses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, I don't think we have any particular market share issues or whatever. I think we have
a good book of business. That book of business reacts to the losses. We look at the
figures, they are heavy, for sure, while they show that those losses are extremely serious,
the ones in Japan in particular. I don't see myself, an issue in terms of risk appetite, that's
– we buy rate position (00:26:22) for capital. To me, that remains an earning event. And
the fact that we will end up the year with a combined ratio (00:26:30) makes me feel
that, yeah, we are managing the situation, this situation is quite manageable.
But those are heavy losses. And then the market – well, we are not going to be the only
ones to be affected. And we are hopeful that this will be another wakeup call, so I mean,
we had 2017, we now have 2018, and well hopefully we won't have 2019, but even though
I think we need to wake up and to really react to that and realize that in number of areas
that is not only nat cat, in a number of areas, we are not where we need to be. And then
we are working on that.
We want to discuss with client with the spirit of continuity. Get their understanding, but I
think that there is no relationship that is viable over the long-term, if there is not balance,
and if there is no profitability expectation. So, we want that to be a fact in our pricing and
our negotiation.

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

I think Laurent will address the movements on the Specialty Insurance.

A - Laurent Rousseau

{BIO 19524847 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So in Specialty Insurance, my comments will focus on SBS, the loss commercial line
(00:28:57) insurance business. I mean the U.S. MGA that really follow the trends that
we've talked about on the U.S. Property Cat market. So for SBS and the loss commercial
lines (00:29:07) business, the renewals trend was quite interesting. It really hardened
actually as (00:29:14), as we progressed with the renewals, the market was hardening. So
the dynamic – (00:29:20) dynamics in November and December were much, much tighter
than what they were in October.
So, that was a quite interesting trend. And even though it's still very early to say, in
January, we'll still see a rather tight market dynamics. So, that's my first comment.
In terms of rate increases, what we saw in the overall SBS book for the last three months
is a rate increase of about 6% on average. But yeah, I think it's similar to what Victor was
saying on the Casualty side. In some number of lines of business, this is not enough to
compensate for the underlying loss experience. So, I think on the Casualty side here and
in particular in the U.S., we see inflation cost coming up the function of course, being
already (00:30:10) with the 2017 event. And so, it takes longer to get to (00:30:16) and
increase use of experts in all those litigation. So, the claim inflation is coming up.
Another segment which was hit by cat activities, the energy sector, so mining and
onshore, (00:30:33) and here rate increases are coming through. But, again, we don't
think that's enough to (00:30:39) compensate for those activities.
So, all-in-all, we came up with a rate increase that was pretty significant for (00:30:50) top
line wise. There was a major contract in construction that influenced the (00:30:56) top
line. But even when you stripped out that major construction contracts, the top line growth
is pretty healthy. And hardening is on the way whether it is stable (00:31:07) enough, it's
too early to say.

On the management of the Europe (00:31:15), well, we will apply exactly the same
projects (00:31:18) we have applied every year where we had large nat cat, well
(00:31:23) that is the case. So, there won't be any surprise in the way we manage the
outcome of the year.
My comment would be that, we continue to be extremely satisfied with the behavior of
the underlying book. And the fact that we have been basically very stable, below 95% on
a normalized basis. Well, to me, it shows that, yes, and we have continued to be
extremely prudent in our reserving.
We have positive developments in the book, which I think is very comforting for us. I think
it's very good to have that sort of behavior of the underlying portfolio. It helps to stabilize
on the longer (00:32:00). So, there won't be any surprise in the management of the year
(00:32:04).
