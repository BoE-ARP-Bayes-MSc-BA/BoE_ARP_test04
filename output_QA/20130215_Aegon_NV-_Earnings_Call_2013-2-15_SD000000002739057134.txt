Presentation
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for holding. Welcome to the Aegon Fourth Quarter 2012
results conference call for analysts and investors. (Operator Instructions) I will now hand
the conference over to Mr. Alex Wynaendts. Please go ahead, sir.

Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for this review of Aegon's Fourth
Quarter and full-year 2012 results, and today also with me are Jan Nooitgedagt, the CFO,
Darryl Button, the Head of our Corporate Financial Center, and of course Willem van den
Berg, Head of Investor Relations. Before turning to the presentation, let me remind you to
take a moment to review our disclaimer on forward-looking statements, which is at the
end of this presentation. We look forward to your questions after the presentation.
As you have seen, we have issued two announcements today. The first of course is our
Fourth Quarter results. Again our businesses generated strong growth in sales and

earnings. At the same time we have maintained a strong capital position and our
businesses continue to generate healthy cash flows. This has allowed us to propose an
increased final 2012 dividend of EUR0.11 per share. The second announcement is the
agreement we have reached with the Vereniging Aegon, also known as the Association,
to cancel all of Aegon's preferred shares of which the Association is the sole owner. I
would like to first highlight the details of this agreement, before turning to our Fourth
Quarter results.
I'm now turning to slide three. We believe that we have reached a balanced agreement
with the Association to cancel all of Aegon's preferred shares, and in a manner that
minimizes the impact on existing common shareholders. This transaction will result in a
simplified capital structure for Aegon while enabling the Company to maintain a highquality capital base on the new European solvency requirements, and at the same time it
will allow the Association to substantially reduce its debt. All of the preferred shares will
be exchanged for cash and common shares. The value of all preferred shares, which have
a book value of EUR2.1b, has been determined at EUR1.1b. The Association has also
agreed to give up its preferential status.

Bloomberg Transcript

The result of the transaction, the number of common shares outstanding will increase by
approximately 7%. However, the dilutive effect on earnings per share is limited to 3%, as
there will be no preferred dividend payments following the transaction. We recognize the
importance of limiting dilution for existing shareholders, and we will take that into account
in management actions going forward.
Turning to slide four. And this agreement has clear benefits for Aegon and its
stakeholders, as highlighted on this slide. Just to name a few, over the years voting rights
of the Association and economic ownership in Aegon have grown apart and these are
being brought back in line again. Also no single shareholder will have an economic
preferential status, and the ending of the payment of preferred dividend will improve the
interest coverage ratio of Aegon. The new capital structure will enable the Company to
maintain a high-quality capital base under the new European solvency rules by allowing
our hybrid capital to be classified as tier one.
From the perspective of the Association, the agreement allows for substantial reduction
of its debt, and although the Association will relinquish its preferred economic status, it
maintains a sizable holding of common shareholders in the Company. To maintain its
special cause voting rights, a new class of common shares will be created, common
shares B. Effectively these shares will replace the existing preferred shares B, which we
cancel too. And all in all we therefore believe that this is a balanced outcome for all
stakeholders.
Now turning to slide five, here I'd like to give you a bit more detail on the transaction. The
preferred shares have a book value of EUR2.1b. This is the amount that the Association
paid back to Aegon in 2002. We have agreed on a fair value of the preferred shares of
EUR1.1b, which is based on the discounted value of future cash flows. This fair value will be
paid in EUR400 million of cash, EUR83 million of preferred dividends and the remaining
EUR655 million is converted into common shares and a new class of shares, common
shares B.

FINAL

The transaction is slightly EPS dilutive at the current low level of the ECB financing rate,
which determines the level of the preferred dividend. However, if the ECB financing rate
would only be 2% to 3% higher, the effect of the transaction will become EPS neutral, as
the preferred dividend would then approximately double from its current level.
Currently our shareholders' equity consists of two elements, common shareholders'
equity and equity related to the preferred shares. As shown on the slide, equity related to
the preferred shares is effectively transferred to common shareholders' equity. The
resulting increase in common shareholders' equity is partly offset by the cash payment by
Aegon to the Association of EUR400m. This is important to note, as common
shareholders' equity is the basis of the calculation of our return on common shareholders'
equity.
Here on slide six you can clearly see the impact of the transaction on our capital position.
As I have mentioned earlier, the agreement will result in a simplified capital structure for
Aegon while enabling the Company to maintain a high-quality capital base under new
European solvency requirements, known as Solvency II.

Bloomberg Transcript

Before the exchange and under the new Solvency II legislation, the preferred shares
would not qualify as Core Tier 1 capital. In addition the existence of these preferred
shares effectively pushes our junior perpetual capital securities down to Tier 2. After the
exchange preferred shares no longer exist. Consequently our junior perpetual capital
securities in this situation remain classified as Tier 1 securities, which improves the overall
quality of our capital position under proposed Solvency II legislation.
And here on slide seven we provide you with an overview of the impact of the transaction
on various financial metrics. The key factors which cause the change in our ratios after the
transaction are of course the use of EUR400 million of our excess capital, the fact that
there will no longer be preferred shares on which we are required to pay preferred
dividends, and the higher level of common shareholders' equity. The transaction is done
in such a way that we are able to maintain sufficient buffers in the holding company while
maintaining a capital base ratio above 75%. As you can see, the impact on most metrics is
limited. Moreover, I would like to reiterate that management is evaluating options to
further mitigate the effect of dilution.
I'm turning to slide eight, and as I shared in my introduction, the substantial debt reduction
is a key benefit of this transaction for the Association. Aegon will pay EUR400 million to
the Association and EUR83 million in preferred dividends, which will enable the
Association to reduce its debt by approximately EUR500 million from its current level of
approximately EUR1b. The remaining debt has been refinanced with a new three-year
refinancing facility with a one-year extension option. Should emphasize that there are no
covenants in this facility linked to the Aegon share price. The Association was, is and will
continue to remain a long-term shareholder committed to acting in the interest of all of
Aegon's stakeholders.
As part of the agreement, the Association has agreed to give up its preferential status.
I'm now on slide nine. And this means that it will relinquish its preferential rights with

Page 3 of 23

FINAL

regard to dividends and liquidation proceeds. In addition the voting rights of the
Association in ordinary course will be reduced from the current 22.1% to approximately
14.9% in line with economic ownership, as shown in the table. However, we have agreed
with the Association that they will always maintain their current 32.6% voting rights in case
of special cause through the creation of a new class of common shares, common shares
B.
So what is the process from here? And we can see that on slide 10. So today a 10-day
period of determining the average price on which the preferred shares will be converted
into common shares will commence. The precise increase in the number of common
shares will depend on the volume-weighted average price of Aegon common shares on
Euronext Amsterdam from February 15 up to and including February 28, 2013. And at our
annual general meeting of shareholders on May 15 Aegon's Supervisory Board will
propose to approve the new capital structure.

Bloomberg Transcript

So let me now turn to our Fourth Quarter results and I'm turning to slide 12. The Fourth
Quarter closes a year during which we have made considerable progress and, as you can
see on this slide 12, during 2012 all metrics show a clear improvement compared to 2011.
After a year of rebasing and taking a number of steps to realign our businesses we
entered a new phase in 2012, one focused on generating strong business performance
and growth.
We achieved a high level of sales, demonstrating the strength of our franchise. The higher
underlying earnings are the result of business growth, a strong delivery on cost-reduction
programs and favorable equity market and currency movements. Our fee-based earnings
for the full year now represent 33% of underlying earnings and at the same time our
return on equity increased to 7.1% and 8% when excluding the run-off businesses. So
rather than going into further detail on our strategic highlights for this year, I would like to
focus on our Fourth Quarter results in the remainder of this call.
I am now on slide 13. The 29% increase in underlying earnings was a result of solid growth
of our business, the turnaround in our UK business, successful delivery on cost-reduction
programs, as well as favorable currency and equity market movements. In the Americas
higher earnings were driven by growth of the business, partly offset by higher employee
incentives and benefit plan expenses.
In the Netherlands higher earnings in life and savings more than offset lower earnings in
pensions and non-life. During the quarter, we adjusted reserves to reflect observed
mortality, and this resulted in a one-time benefit, offset by an exceptional charge related
to administrative backlogs in non-life.
The strong improvement of our UK earnings was mainly driven by our focus to achieve
further cost savings, in addition to the non-recurrence of exceptional charges taken in the
previous year. The negative effect of adverse persistency in our pension business
prolonged the implementation of the retail distribution review provisions and is likely to
continue in the first half of 2013.

FINAL

Earnings from new markets were lower. The continued strong results from Aegon Asset
Management were offset by divestment of our joint ventures in Spain and one-offs in Asia.
And the holding results improved as a result of the fact that part of holding expenses are
now charged to the operating units and cost savings in the holding.
So here on slide 14, you can see that in the Fourth Quarter, net income was positively
impacted by gains on investments. These are mostly the results of asset liability
management-driven trading in our portfolio, as well as the book gains on the share of our
minority stake in Prisma and the divestment in our joint venture with Banca Civica in Spain.
We were pleased to see that impairments remained at a low level, amounting to only
EUR58m, which translates into just four basis points for the quarter. Run-off businesses
were impacted by the accelerated amortization of intangibles in the life reinsurance line,
and this is following increased transfers of clients directly to SCOR, and we do expect to
see this acceleration in the first half of 2013 as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you are well aware, and I'm on slide 15, in recent years, we have been pursuing a
broad restructuring program in order to sharpen our focus on our core lines of business,
significantly reduce our cost base and to create greater efficiency across the organization.
Reducing expenses will continue to be a primary focus going forward, and during 2012 we
have made good progress to capture costs and operational efficiencies.
As you can see on slide 15, we have achieved EUR188 million in cost reductions. These
cost reductions, along with the non-recurrence of restructuring charges, led to the 6%
lower year-on-year cost base. And I want to make clear here that although reducing costs
and pursuing operational efficiencies are an integral part of how we manage our day-today business, we're also committed to making the necessary investments to drive
business growth going forward, as shown by our investments in the platform that we have
launched in the UK and the Netherlands.
Let me now give you some detail, and this is on slide 16, on sales and value of new
business generated during the Fourth Quarter. We are very pleased with the strong level
of total sales, which amounted to EUR1.8b. We achieved strong growth of new life sales in
many of our markets, most notably in the Netherlands and the UK as a result of strong
pension sales. In the Americas, the main drivers of our 29% increase in sales were higher
amounts for indexed universal life products, as well as higher sale volumes related to the
anticipated discontinuance of certain unprofitable universal life secondary guarantee
products.
Gross deposits were 30% higher than last year at EUR9.2b. The main contributors were
US retail mutual funds and pension, as well as asset management.
And in general, we continued to experience strong customer demands for our core
products and services in each of our markets, a clear reflection of the strength of our
franchise. Moreover, our disciplined approach to pricing demonstrates our commitment to
selling the right products to the right customers and at the right price, ensuring that it
provides value for both our customers and Aegon in the current challenging economic

Page 5 of 23

environment and low level of interest rates. The success of this approach is seen in the
significant improvement to our value of new business to EUR204 million for the quarter.

FINAL

The strong sales momentum that we have been able to achieve is in large part due to our
broad distribution network, and I'm now on slide 17. Expanding into new channels while
strengthening existing relationships continues to be a priority and it's clearly showing
results.
In the Americas, for example, we have added partners for the distribution of our variable
annuity products, broadening the scale and diversity of our distribution network. And as
we've previously highlighted, over 20% of our new life sales in the US is a result of
distribution added since 2008.
As you know, during 2012, we launched our Workplace Savings and our At Retirement
platform in the UK. These platforms have been well received by the market, and now we
have strategic agreements in place with most of the leading adviser networks, and we are
convinced that this will be beneficial in developing our platform business and expect to
further add distribution in the coming months.

Bloomberg Transcript

In our new markets we've been able to complete two acquisitions, which further
increased our footprint in Central and Eastern Europe. In Romania we've taken over a
sizable life insurance portfolio and pension fund business and also have entered Ukraine
with our acquisition of the currency's fifth-largest life insurance company.
Another area where we are successfully leveraging our skills and capability is in Spain. You
can see that on slide 18. Despite the current difficulties, we continue to see strong longterm growth prospects for our core business, and, as such, we are very pleased to have
entered into a long-term exclusive partnership with Banco Santander last December.
We will distribute life and general insurance products through Banco Santander's
extensive nationwide network of over 4,600 bank branches, and providing us access to a
potential client base of 20 million (sic-see press release "12m") individuals across the
country. Under the terms of the agreement Aegon will acquire a 51% stake in both the life
insurance company as well as a non-life insurance company for a consideration of
EUR220m. Furthermore, Aegon Spain will provide the back offices to the joint venture
companies.
In the context of the consolidation underway among the cajas, we have also successfully
divested our share in the partnerships with Banca Civica and Unnim, while making good
returns on these investments. And, as you know, we are in the process of exiting our joint
venture with CAM as well. We are confident that with these transactions, Aegon is
repositioned to make the most of the longer-term opportunities in Spain, a country where
the need for protection and savings products will increase in the coming years.
I'm now turning to slide 19, where you can see Aegon's capital position at the end of the
Fourth Quarter. As you are aware, we've been working toward achieving a capital base
ratio of at least 75% by the end of 2012 and we are pleased to report a capital ratio of
Page 6 of 23

Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2013-02-15

FINAL

76.7% in the Fourth Quarter, which allows us to conclude our commitments to the
European Commission. Our Group IGD ratio increased to 230% from the level of 222% at
the end of the previous quarter, with the main drivers being the strong earnings
generated during the quarter. The RBC ratio in the US increased to approximately 495%,
and this as a result of strong statutory earnings and one-time releases that were partly
offset by dividends upstream to the holding.
Not surprisingly we continue to believe that maintaining a strong capital position is not
only prudent but a necessity in the current environment.

Bloomberg Transcript

During the Fourth Quarter operational cash flows, excluding the impact of markets,
totaled EUR619m, and I'm now on slide 20. Operational free cash flows, excluding market
impacts, were particularly strong during the quarter, primarily the effect of reserve
releases and proceeds from divestments. One-time items amounted to approximately
EUR300m, which puts the normalized free cash flow number at around EUR320 million for
the quarter, in line with our expectations, and the higher new business strain reflects the
strong new life sales, most notably in the Netherlands.
So let me now summarize, on slide 21. We have made clear progress positioning our
businesses to compete successfully in the new environment. 2012 was a year in which we
entered a new phase focused on generating strong business performance and growth,
as evidenced by our results. We have taken the necessary steps to sharpen our focus, to
improve the efficiency of our operations and to reposition our businesses for the growth
prospects we continue to see going forward. The cancellation of all preferred shares is
also a part of this transformation, as it simplifies the capital structure and further improves
the quality of our capital base in the new European regulatory environment.
Our decision to propose an increase in our final dividend is not only a reflection of the
strength of our financial position, but also of our confidence that we are well positioned
for the future.
As always, we appreciate your continued interest in Aegon and we'll be happy to take
your questions. Thank you.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question is from Farooq Hanif of Citigroup.
Please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. First question is could you just
quickly run us through the movement in the holding excess capital from Q3 to Q4, just the
main items? Is it mainly just the cash flow that's been generated and how much of that
cash have you actually been able to pay up to the holding? That's question one.
Page 7 of 23



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2013-02-15

And question two is, I know that VAs are obviously very volatile and the markets are very
strong in Q4 for you, but could you just talk us through the high VA margin that was
achieved in the Fourth Quarter and the drivers behind that? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Farooq. Good morning. Thanks for your questions. So in terms of excess capital in the
holding, what we said is that the excess capital in the holding increased to EUR2 billion at
the end of the Fourth Quarter and that's up from EUR1.6b. And this is the result of
dividends paid by the operating companies and the largest part obviously is from the US.
And then we have to deduct the cost of the holding, so that's how you get to the EUR2b.
In terms of the VA, yes, we have a high margin. There is a one-off, which is related to a
product change and a DAC unlocking. It's not a recurring element. But what's important
here is that we are continuing to run our business achieving a target of at least the 80
basis points of our assets, and that's what you see coming through the numbers here. On
the specific item, Darryl, maybe you would like to give Farooq a little color to explain the
one-off EUR20m, which obviously brings our margin for this quarter above our target of
80 basis points.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Hi, Farooq. It's Darryl. We did have a one-off in the VA this quarter. We had been
introducing volatility-controlled funds across our whole VA platform, and we got approval
in the Fourth Quarter to push those funds into a large part of the mandates of the asset
mandates behind a part of our VA business. That's going to lead to lower hedge costs
going forward and when we run those lower hedge costs through the future gross profits
we end up with a DAC unlocking. That was about EUR20 million to the favorable this
quarter in the VA line.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Sorry, just to understand, that's a new fund for existing customers?

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes. It's really we have to go through -- as you know, we do a lot of our DAC unlocking
work in the Third Quarter. This was a case where we had a little bit delayed on that. We
had to actually get the fund boards to approve the new fund mandates and the new vol
controlled funds, and that approval didn't happen until the Fourth Quarter so we couldn't
take the benefit until the Fourth Quarter.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. I'll probably come back on that later, but just on the cash flow, you were at EUR1.6
billion and you go to EUR2b, does the EUR2 billion holding also allow for the dividend that
you've declared?

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Page 8 of 23



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2013-02-15

Yes. Very clearly. We have declared a dividend increase, which will be paid in May after the
AGM. So we've taken into account the strength of our capital position. We've taken into
account also the fact that we have been able to upstream cash flows to the holding and
that was the basis for us to increase our final dividend from EUR0.10 to EUR0.11 a share.

FINAL

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. I'll probably come back later on that with IR, but thank you very much.

Thank you, Farooq.

Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Ashik Musaddi from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, hi. Thanks a lot and good morning everyone. A couple of questions. First is on
dividend. I know we have discussed this a lot earlier as well but can you give us some
clarity about how should we think about the dividend going forward? The reason being
now your earnings are looking very stable if you look at it on a quarter-on-quarter basis for
the last five or six quarters. Your capital has improved a lot. Your cash generation has
improved a lot. So how should we think about dividend because right now the payout ratio
on an earnings basis is just like 30%, 35%? So is that kind of number reasonable to think
about, if you can give some color on that?
And second is can you give us an exact number as in how much of your perpetual
securities will be counted as Tier 1 capital under the Solvency II rules, which was earlier not
allowed to be calculated because of the preference share structure? Some color on this
will be good. Thank you.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Yes, on the dividend, I think we've been very consistent with sharing with you what our
policy is. And our policy is to have an attractive dividend, a dividend that grows with the
business and that is based on the capital position of the Company. So that's the first
check, we need to have a strong capital position if we want to pay a dividend. But
secondly on the cash flows which are being generated by the business and, as you know,
we have given you an indication of what we expect from our cash flows. We said they
should be growing and as such you can expect a dividend that goes in line, in sync, with
the cash flow growth.
I want to make the point here is that there shouldn't be -- there is no relationship
between the dividends and the earnings. We are putting a link between the dividends and
the cash flows, and checking if indeed the capital position is strong enough. So we should
not relate it to earnings. As you know, they can be more volatile.

In terms of the perpetual securities, these junior perpetual securities, they will now be
remaining as qualifying as Tier 1 under Solvency II. And the exact amount is?

FINAL

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes, Ashik, it's Darryl. It's a little hard to answer the exact amount. The Solvency II rules are
still moving, as you know. The real issue here is that perhaps push and demote the junior
perpetuals down into a Tier-2-class security. Our working assumption is that with the prefs
gone that they would qualify under Tier 1. There are limitations under the Solvency II rules
in terms of whether you're looking at the SCR or the MCR in terms of the total amount
that would be accounted as Tier 1. Our working assumption is that the majority, the vast
majority of the perpetuals would in fact be Tier 1.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Be grandfathered, yes.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Thanks. Just a follow up on that. So if I look at your financial statement, it states that EUR5
billion is something for perpetual and hybrid, so is it reasonable to say that a vast majority
of this number would be allowed as Tier 1 capital?

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. I think we're thinking, at this point, at least 80% of them would be grandfathered and
that's roughly in line with our working assumption.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay, fantastic. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Farquhar Murray from Autonomous. Please go
ahead.

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Good morning, gentlemen. Just one very quick question, and apologies if it got covered
earlier, but does the capital restructuring at all affect the way that S&P will look at you?
And I don't know whether you've had any preliminary discussions around that at all.
Thanks. That's just the question.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Yes, Farquhar, thanks for your question. I'll pass it on to Darryl, who has had very recently
discussions with the rating agencies, in particular also covering this item.

Yes. Hi Farquhar. They're looking at it very favorably. They like the simplification of the
capital structure, certainly. From their perspective actually our fixed charge cover does go
up with the elimination of the pref dividend. From their perspective it's a mild credit
positive.

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Okay. Brilliant. Thanks very much.

Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Jan Willem Weidema from ABN Amro. Please go
ahead.

Q - Jan Willem Weidema

{BIO 15133400 <GO>}

Good morning. Few questions. If I look at your core capital ratio it's now 75%, but
presumably it will drop to around 74% if IAS 19 is imposed. Can you elaborate on where
you want to your ratio to be now that, A, the EC requirement has gone but, B, your
Solvency II ratios have improved?
And how will this impact your target for underlying earnings growth? In other words, what
should we expect in short term capital redeployment?

Bloomberg Transcript

And secondly, looking at the covenants of the foundation, is there any covenants there
which relates to your dividend?
Final question, can you comment on whether you had a benefit from your innovative life
bonds that you issued one or two years ago? Thank you.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Willem, maybe Jan will answer the first question on the impact of IAS 19 on the CBR ratio.

A - Jan Nooitgedagt

{BIO 16335191 <GO>}

Yes, it's a clear answer. It has no impact on our capital base ratio. Also our revaluation
reserves have no impact. And it is the same way we treat the IAS 19, so no impact on
capital base ratio.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

In terms of I think you were asking about the European Commission, as I said in my
introduction, with the end of 2012 at a CBR ratio as defined with European Commission
above 75%, we have met all our targets and as such we have now concluded our
agreements.

Q - Jan Willem Weidema

{BIO 15133400 <GO>}

Page 11 of 23



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2013-02-15

Maybe I should have explained it a bit better. What I meant to say is that in the past you
said you also yourself would like to be around at 75% in the long run. So after the deal
you're at 75%. That might restrict your capital redeployment and how does that impact
the targets for earnings growth that you set two years ago?

FINAL

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Jan Willem, there are many different factors affecting that 75%. That is one measure.
What you also have to look at is the amount of excess capital freely deployable at the
holding, which I think is giving you a better indication as to how much capacity we have to
redeploy capital in one form or another. And I think I've been very clear is that in our plan
going forward, we do expect to generate additional excess and we will be looking at
ways of redeploying it. And it's not really linked to your CBR ratio. And, by the way, we
have had a hard target of above 75%. What we've said about that ratio is that we feel
comfortable with the level, but that means that we clearly have a bit more flexibility right
now.

In terms of the question relating to the dividends, if there is any covenants with the
Association, I can assure you that there is zero covenant with the banks providing the
facility in relation to dividend or share price. And I think it's an important point you
mentioned because that clearly it very much improves the situation for the Association in
relation to its bank.
I believe that the last question on the life bond you were referring to the longevity swap
we did in the Netherlands whereby we were able to take some of our longevity risk off
our balance sheet. At this point in time we have said it has very marginal impact on
earnings.

Q - Jan Willem Weidema

Alright. Thank you.

Thank you. The next question is from Hans Pluijgers from Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Coming back on the ROE target going forward because in principle
you could argue that a big part of your other targets, like the fee part of the business,
your growth quarter last year on the underlying level was very strong. But how you look at
your ROE targets going forward? ROE has not really grown over the last few years. Yes,
how do you see that going forward? Are you going much more -- somewhat more
aggressive on that or can you give some feeling on how do you see really that, reaching
that target in 2015?
With respect to the sales, second question, in the UK and the Netherlands, if you would
maybe elaborate on the development in the Netherlands. What do you currently have in
the pipeline with respect to the pension contracts? Have you become somewhat more
Page 12 of 23

active in that market over recent months? Does that explain the good development in
Q4?

FINAL

And also on the UK you argue that a marketing spend has helped or marketing action has
helped in Q4. Any plans for that going forward in 2013? So how should we look at sales
development in the UK?

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Hans, on the ROE target we remain committed on delivering on our targets. Please also
keep in mind that we have given the targets in conjunction with a set of financial markets
assumptions and in particular, as you know, the level of interest rate development. We
provided you the sensitivities. We are committed to delivering on these targets.

Bloomberg Transcript

We do obviously recognize that this transaction at this point in time has a dilutive effect,
but I'd also like to remind you that we are not paying any more preferred dividends and,
as I said, in my introduction the preferred dividend is now at a, I would say, historic low
level because it's based on the ECB refinancing rate, which I think is 0.75%. And as such if
the ECB financing rate would be a bit higher, as I said, 2% or 3% higher, effectively that
would take away the biggest part of the dilution effect from doing this transaction. And I
think it's reasonable to assume that over a number of years that that number, that that
percentage of ECB of the refinancing rate would go up.
What we are seeing is a business that is growing. We are seeing that we are growing
results, that clearly also is increasing our equity for common shareholders. Our equity for
common shareholders has also been increased by the fact that we've done this
transaction. We effectively, as I shared in my presentation, transferred -- so the EUR2.1
billion minus the EUR400 million which we bought back effectively -- to common equity. So
you have a higher common book value, as we commonly call that for shareholders. So
there's a number of various elements in here which I think you have to take into account
when you look at it. But we remain committed on delivering on what we have promised to
do.
In terms of sales, yes, we're clearly happy with the development where we see sales in all
of our markets growing. You asked me specifically about the Netherlands. It is true that
the Fourth Quarter in the Netherlands for pension business is traditionally a strong quarter.
And I think we are benefiting also from the fact that there seems to be a little bit more
movement now from pension schemes to move towards an insured solution and I think
Aegon is extremely well positioned there to take advantage of that. And you see that
movement is driven by the fact that interest rates have gone up a little bit and that means
that the coverage ratios are getting closer to 100%, which means it's therefore
economically possible to move these contracts to insured solutions.
We have a strong balance sheet. We have capacity. As I referred to the previous question
of Jan Willem Weidema, we have laid off longevity in the market at an attractive price. So
we have capacity to be an important player in this market.

Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2013-02-15

On the UK I think it's a little bit too early for me to be very clear on how we see sales in
this year because we have to take into account the whole effect and impact of RDR. So in
the run up of RDR you've seen a lot of activity and we clearly benefited from that too. So
it's not so much us specifically doing marketing campaigns or this kind of thing. It's more
the fact that a lot of activity takes place before the -- took place before December 31
because at that point in time we are entering into a new world. What we will see is the
pipeline of activity still flowing over in the First Quarter and potentially in the Second
Quarter. And really we will only have a clear picture of how the market will develop in the
third and Fourth Quarter, not before that.
But what's important is that I'm positive about our positioning. We've invested heavily in
these platform propositions. I'm pleased to see that we seem to be recognized now as a
leader in the market. We have platform propositions which cover B2C, which cover also
direct to employees --- employers, and we have now developed a platform proposition
that supports the intermediaries. So we have a very broad now capability and that should
really I think bode well for the future, but I will be able to be more clear with you on that in
the Third Quarter.

Thank you. The next question is from Paul Diaz from RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Paul Diaz

{BIO 4658200 <GO>}

Yes, hi there. Good morning. Couple of questions please. Just building on the question
there on the UK business, just wondering if you could give me a bit more detail around
the persistency charge in the UK as to exactly what that's in relation to and how you see
that developing over the first half of 2013.
And the second point was just on the cash generation. The release of required surplus
seems to be a much larger proportion of the cash generation in this quarter. How
sustainable is that or should we be treating some of that as a one off ? Thanks.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Yes, we've said we had this charge in the UK on persistency. It's not a big number, but still
on the quarterly earnings it does have an impact. And this obviously is related to what we
just discussed, the whole RDR activity. What's important here for me to say is that this is a
one off. Effectively it's a DAC unlocking. So you have persistency issue and you have to
write off the corresponding DAC. So it's not an ongoing effect.
But as I said also in the previous question is we expect that the effect of the activity in the
Fourth Quarter will actually flow over in the first and Second Quarter so we therefore do
expect to see some of this repeating and continuing in the first two quarters of the year.
We said it was an amount of EUR6 million or EUR7 million so it's not a big amount, but
Page 14 of 23



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2013-02-15

obviously it has an impact and I would expect this to continue in the first/Second Quarters
as a result of business which was agreed on in the Fourth Quarter.

FINAL

You were asking about our cash flows. Yes, we had in this quarter a number of one-off
items that relate to AG38 and they also related to our disposals and the proceeds of
Prisma and Banco Civica. So these are clearly not recurring. But on AG38 maybe, Darryl,
do you want to add something?

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes, on the operational cash flows there were some one timers in there so the
operational cash flow was stronger than we would normally expect. It really related to we
got to the end of the year and did our capital testing and AG38 testing in the US and it
did not turn out to be as severe as we were previously projecting and so we had some
release there. We also released some of the discretionary default reserve in the UK as
well. Thirdly, we put some additional hedging on in the US, which also freed up some
required surplus. So those three really contributed to the operational free cash flows.
In terms of the holding company cash flows, and this does go back to Farooq's question a
little bit earlier, yes, there were some extraordinaries there, as Alex just mentioned, in
terms of the Civica and the Prisma sales contributed some additional holding company
cash flow.

Q - Paul Diaz

{BIO 4658200 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thanks.

Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Robin Buckley from Deutsche Bank. Please go
ahead.

Q - Robin Buckley

{BIO 3596512 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Just a couple of questions please. Firstly just following on I guess
from our operational cash flow question, could you just give an indication I guess of what
the underlying run rate is that we could expect on a quarterly basis just stripping out the
various one-offs that you mentioned?
And then the second question is just picking up on a few comments that you made earlier,
Alex, where you were talking about some server management actions to try and minimize
the impact of dilution. I was just wondering if you could expand on that at all please. Thank
you.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Then on the operational cash flows I indicated in my introduction that if you would take off
the one-time items -- which were just discussed; I won't repeat them -- if you also would
correct for market impacts, change in shape of the yield curve, then the number would

FINAL

be, the outcome would be around EUR320m. Keep in mind that we had a very strong
quarter in sales so our new business strain was a bit higher than usually. I think it gives you
a reasonably good indication as to what we believe the run rate going forward is.
And second question on management actions, the point I was trying to make, Robin, is
that we are clearly aware of the fact that this has -- is leading to some form of dilution.
The dilution is minimized I think to an extent that's very acceptable in light of the entire
transaction. It is an attractive transaction for all stakeholders. It is dependent on the level,
as you see, of the preferred dividends. The preferred dividend's based on the ECB
financing rate so it's extremely low and if the rate would have been some higher
effectively dilution would be more limited.
And I think the point I was trying to make is that we are aware that we will take this into
account in actions we'll be taking going forward to minimize or even neutralize entirely the
effect.

Q - Robin Buckley

{BIO 3596512 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. The next question is from William Elderkin from Goldman Sachs. Please go
ahead.

Q - William Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. William Elderkin from Goldman Sachs. Couple of questions
please. Following on from your last comment, A, are you thinking about taking some
measures to eliminate the dilution from your stock dividend?
Secondly, given the timing of this transaction you've announced today, the level of your
excess capital at the holding company I guess EUR1.6 billion or EUR1.5 billion after the
completion, does that level provide a good indication of your real-world level of target
buffer you want in place before you will consider major capital actions?
And then just a final numbers question. Within the Asset Management earnings, can you
give us a guide to how much of those revenues are coming from performance fees?

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

As I just said, I don't think there's much, William, I can add to what I just said in answer to
Robin, saying that obviously we want to minimize the dilution. We want to make sure that
we do that in a balanced way, taking into account all the interests of all the stakeholders. I
think I've been saying enough here.
In terms of the buffer on our capital, which is a related question, we have now significant
amount with EUR2b. We've always been saying that we are focusing on being capital
Page 16 of 23



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2013-02-15

FINAL

efficient. That means that we need to have a capital that is not necessary in the business
unit needs to be upstreamed to the holding so that we can do something with it.
Today I still feel, and I've said it earlier, that we are still in an uncertain environment, an
environment where we see a lot of things happening. Just need to remind you just 10
days ago we had a significant event here in the Netherlands with the nationalization of our
fourth largest bank. So all of that means that this environment is an environment where
holding a strong capital position again is not a luxury. We've been clear that we have as a
minimum buffer at least 1.5 times the expenses of the holding and that is around 1.5 times
EUR500 million to EUR750m. And that hasn't really changed so going forward we will be
seeing what environment we are working.
But I think it's important that you can see here that we are deploying that excess capital in
a way. We are taking EUR400 million of it and taking that into account in the transaction,
which is minimizing, as you can imagine, the effect on dilution of shareholders.
In terms of Asset Management, I think it's very difficult. Looking here around the table to
my colleagues, yes, we have -- there is some performance fees, but I can tell you one
thing, that in many cases at least a part of these performance fees get offset by an
increase in incentives. So the biggest impact of performance in the portfolio is seen in the
investment returns of the operating companies because that's where the performance of
the investment goes to. So there's a little impact on performance fees in asset
management, but it's not a very big one.

Thank you. The next question is from David Andrich from Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead.

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of questions. First of all, in the Americas you mentioned
that you've added some alternative channels in terms of the VA distribution. I was just
wondering if you could maybe give a bit more detail on that.
Second of all, I was just wondering, over the past year equity markets in the US have been
at least positive or reasonably stable and I was just wondering if that had -- have you seen
any trends emerging in terms of impact on policyholder behavior because of market
performance? Just wondering if anything has started to emerge there.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then finally in terms of the SNS nationalization, just wondering if you could comment on
maybe is it having any regulatory impact in terms of the regulator's attitude towards
insurers and if they're looking at tightening things up more or the impact you see coming
from that. Thanks.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Yes, on distribution we actually have been working very much on expanding our
distribution. And I know we've had a number of new distribution channels. Some of them
have been announced others not. I'm looking at Darryl who is just, as you know, coming
from the US. So which one can you mention explicitly, Darryl? Some exciting ones actually.

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

There are and I'm probably more comfortable answering the trend than I am the names. I
don't feel very comfortable putting actual names out so I'm going to withhold from that.
We have been on both the VA and the life side lining up some very good names in terms
of adding new distribution. Some IMOs on the life side and on the VA side as well we're
also doing some white labeling on the VA side for some new distribution channels. And
there is more in the pipeline as well. We're in the process of signing up two very
interesting names right now and I just don't want to put those out there right now for
obvious reasons. But I would say that there is still momentum coming and more to come.
I think the other question was on equity markets and the impact on policyholder behavior.
Really the policyholder behavior, it is dynamic and as our assumptions. So we're really not
seeing anything deviating any different than what our underlying assumptions are, which
are when the policy guarantees are in the money the lapse rates are quite low, and when
they're out of the money they follow a more normal lapsation function if you will, which
itself is also a function of interest rates. So as long as interest rates remain low and those

Page 18 of 23



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2013-02-15

products that are in the money their lapse rates are extremely low, as interest rates go up
or the policies go out of the money you get into more normalization lapsation. We're not
seeing anything different than that basic function.

FINAL

Last question?

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

And on SNS maybe I should give the answer. Yes, on SNS obviously this has been I think
quite a shock actually for people here in the Netherlands. A nationalization has never
happened before, so there's a lot of questions around about the legal environment, to
what extent is whole regulation and legislation in place to do a nationalization.
I personally think that clearly the positive of this whole thing is that there is clarity and that
now we know that this institution is in safe hands in the State. It's obviously never a good
thing that you have now a number of financial institutions in the hands of the State and I
also believe that the State will be looking for options to bring it back into the private
sector. But it probably helps us in a sense that it reiterates in the Dutch market that Aegon
is really in a very strong position. The fact that we are showing consecutive improvement
in our results, effectively increasing our dividends, is clearly in sharp contrast to what you
see around SNS. And that should from that point of view be beneficial to Aegon going
forward.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Good morning, gentlemen. Just a few questions please on my side. The first one on the
core capital ratio. Can you give the number basically at the end of the year after dividend
payment?
And am I right in understanding that you could consider actually dropping below the 75%
you previously announced? That's the first question.
The second question is can you give us a sense of sensitivity for the underlying earnings
before tax in the Americas that we can see for 2013 versus 2012 if we assume that rates
and FX rate remain stable?
Lastly just more questions on SNS. Did you have -- are you going to have to pay a tax in
2014 following the nationalization? Thank you.

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, on the core capital ratio, IR will come back to you to give you an exact number. This is
always in different moving parts and we need to do that very thoroughly. So I want to
make sure we get the right number and IR will come back.
What I said, yes, we have a target of at least 75%. I have said that we are comfortable
with this target for the time being certainly, but at least we have more flexibility. So that's
the best I can say to you right now.
I'm not sure I understood your question on the US but, Darryl, you would like to --

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

I think it was a basic earnings sensitivity question. The interest rate I assume was the
question.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Yes that's right. What's -- again taking the full year 2012 reported base, what happens to
that base if rates remain at the current level, FX rates euro/dollar at this level?

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, I think if you use 2012 as the base I think we're looking at about EUR10 million a
quarter headwind from low interest rates if they remain low into '13.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

If they remain at the same level that they have been in 2012.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Overall on average, I would say, is that your point?

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes, that's in line with our DAC assumptions. It gets a little bigger as we grow out because
we do have an assumption that rates will rise over time. So it's $10 million a quarter in '13.
That probably grows to closer to $30 million a quarter in '14 and '15 range. So it depends
on how long rates stay out there. When you get out there, you get past our assumption of
where, our DAC assumption where we are assuming that rates will rise further.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Yes, I understand that. You're in dollars or in euros in terms of 10 and 30 a quarter?

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes, on SNS we believe that we will probably have between EUR10 million and EUR15
million contribution to the EUR1 billion which, as you know, the financial markets. But the
biggest part obviously is with the banks and we have a small bank and therefore it's a very
small amount.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, morning. Just on this pick up in the Dutch pension funds which are looking for an
insured solution, do you think and to what extent will the Dutch pension funds cut benefits
such as future pension increases? And what do you think the DNB's attitude will be to that
and will it result in an acceleration of buyers?
The second question is really a comment on competition. There seems to be a real lack
of supply in this pension buyout market and do you think you will be able to take some
more margin as a result of that?

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Yes, on your first question it's obviously politically a very sensitive question. So will pension
plans require to make cuts, yes, they do that and they are making announcements on an
ongoing basis of reducing pension payments going forward. So that is taking place.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now if your question is, if that is going to allow more transfers, I would say that's up to the
pension funds and their boards to decide on it. Clearly I believe that there is a trend
towards consolidation. There's still around 500 individual pensions. That means 500
boards, 500 institutions that need to be regulated. So I think it's clear to see that the
regulator here would effectively look positively at a consolidation because it would make
the environment more easy to regulate, but also more secure for the pensioners.
I'm talking, when I'm talking about 500, I'm talking about company schemes and sector
schemes, and, as you know, we have a lot of them here in the Netherlands. But it's also
clear boards of companies are looking for the solutions because it has an impact on their
own balance sheet and therefore I can see this trend continuing. But we've seen that for
some time.
So in terms of capacity and supply, the one thing which is clear is that we have a very
strong balance sheet, another one with capacity, but also clear that's able to deliver the
right products. And we have with now around 25% market share, we already have a very
strong position. We have been frontrunners in bringing new concepts, new solutions, PPIs
they call themselves. So there's a lot of changes taking place in this market and we are a
frontrunner with a strong balance sheet.
And that should, rightly as you said, ensure that slowly margins should be improving. And
as you look at our Fourth Quarter you see that we have been able to sell a couple of
attractive contracts and these contracts all were attractive in the sense that they are
contributing positively to our MCVNB.
