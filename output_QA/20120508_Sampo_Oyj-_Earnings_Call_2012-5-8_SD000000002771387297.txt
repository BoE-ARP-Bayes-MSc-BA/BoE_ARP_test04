{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this conference call on Sampo Group's January-March
2012 results. I'm Jarmo Salonen, Head of Investor Relations at Sampo and with me at this
call I have Group CEO and President, Kari Stadigh, Head of P&C Insurance, Torbjorn
Magnusson. And Group CFO, Peter Johansson.
We'll start with a short introduction by Kari into the Q1 developments and after that we will
answer whatever questions you may have on those numbers. Before I handed over to Kari
let me just remind you that you can follow this transmission on our website
www.sampo.com/result and a recorded version of the call will a later be available at the
same address.
I think that's all from me and I'll hand over to Kari. Kari, please.

Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thank you. Welcome to the conference call on my behalf as well. When looking at our
operations in general and especially our First Quarter numbers, I must say I like what I
see; a very strong operational performance.

FINAL

We report an excellent result for the quarter. And EPS of EUR0.57 well in line with the
corresponding quarter in the previous year; however, the mark to market EPS of EUR1.17
was a very good number indeed and signiﬁcantly higher than the previous year.
Our non-life operations performed really well and the First Quarter combine ratio 92.4%
was the best ever First Quarter results. The proﬁt for the period was EUR191 million down
30% from Q1 in 2011. However the previous year ﬁgure includes sales gain of EUR75
million which at least the major part should be considered a one-oﬀ.
In the First Quarter, Nordea strong business momentum continued. Total income for the
quarter was highest ever comparing First Quarter of the year. Net interest income
increased by 7% and at EUR1.420 billion was a very good achievement. The core tier 1
capital ratio also increased during the quarter by a healthy 0.4% to 11.6%. We booked a
dividend of EUR224 million from Nordea. And now have a book value of EUR7.21.
Also life insurance performed well and according to plan. Gross written premiums grew
by 20% and the proﬁt was EUR33 million, this after EUR70 million was used to lower the
discount rate to 2.5% for this year and to 3.25% for 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

The solvency ratio of Mandatum Life Group increased to 24.8%; a very good number as
well. So all in all a very strong quarter for the Group. And as I stated oﬀ in the beginning, I
like what I see. Looking at the outside world and especially Europe, I don't like what I see.
The environment is not favorable for banking in general. Low interest rates, sluggish, or
no growth in general economy and lots of regulatory changes in process or pending.
Still Sampo Group that performs well and stays ahead of the pack. In many areas, the
market-leading position was further strengthened, especially smaller players seem to
struggle in our home targets.
What to invest in this type of environment -- or what to invest in this type of environment?
It's easier to say what not to invest in. We avoid all type of sovereign risk and long
duration in general. We continue to invest selectively in corporate bonds and see value in
equities, even if our patience is tested every day.
On risk in general, we stay on hold and do not add risk. We focus on reinvesting the ﬁxed
income portfolio as papers mature. Our outlook is as always in the beginning of the year
cautious, even if operationally we are better positioned than ever.
Sampo Group is today a proxy to the ﬁnancial market in a geographical area which will
perform signiﬁcantly better than Europe on average.

Questions And Answers
Operator

FINAL

(Operator Instructions).
Our ﬁrst question is coming from the line of Hakon Reistad Fure from DNB in Oslo. Please
go ahead.

Q - Hakon Reistad Fure

{BIO 16623060 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions, if I may. Firstly, on the optimum research
strengthening, it appears that when you realize pace strong return in investment you
cease opportunity to strengthen the reserves and lower the discount rates. Given the
substantial spread between the current running yield and guaranteed rates, should we
expect that you will continue to strengthen your reserves going forward or are you
comfortable with the current levels?
Secondly, on European see premiums. You've seen a very strong development in the
premium growth lately. I'm looking at it from a countrywide country basis in the growth
rate in premiums are up by 5% both in Norway and Sweden year on year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking at your peers it appears to be substantially stronger than most of them. And I was
wondering if this reﬂects purely price increases, or are you seeing positive volume
development as well. Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

(inaudible). I think that our attitude is of course very dependent on what kind of interest
rate we see going forward but we had discounted our or we had lowered our discount
rate also last year so at levels between 2.5% to 3% I think we feel comfortable each year
going forward.
So if interest rates stay at these exceptionally low levels I would like us to aﬀord to lower
the interest rates for next year at some suitable moment as well.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

On P&C growth a few factors at the same time work in the same direction. First of all I
think the major achievement this quarter has been that we have been able to increase
segmentally premium levels more than claims inﬂation which is a positive and contributes
to growth.
On top of that, we are very strong in the car dealer segment and in spite of the general
economy, Scandinavia has over the Nordic region has seen record car sales this quarter.
On top of that had good renewals basically a good retention in all countries this quarter.

Thanks. That's very clear.

Operator

FINAL

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of (inaudible). Please go ahead.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Yes. Good afternoon. A couple of questions on the non-life side as well. Firstly, regarding
the discount rate change in the annuity reserves in Sweden. I guess that was mainly due to
the rising rates in the First Quarter but actually if I look at it quite the opposite has
happened in the Fourth Quarter so the yields are down quite a lot. Should we expect that
you will reverse this discount rate change going forward and also if you could give us a
breakdown of the run-oﬀ gains per geographic region if possible?
And, thirdly, from a -- on the economic capital (inaudible) is actually up quite a lot, what is
due to and that was basically it. Thank you.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker

Bloomberg Transcript

The discount rate is based on the real rates in Sweden and we have had uniquely low
such that increased slightly in this quarter. We of course took out the small gains from that
and you will see that that is actually most of the run-oﬀ gains that we have so most of the
run-oﬀ gains come from Sweden this time.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

It's Peter, I'm checking the economic capital. The main item, I think, is increasing market
that but I can't ﬁnd the right slide for the time being.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Okay. If I may continue just on the discount rate topic. I can't remember which quarter
when you did this and how much was the total amount. Could you remind me of that?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
We did that continuously actually from 2010 sometime mid-2010 or late 2010 over ﬁve or
six quarters. And the total amount was to the tune of EUR60 million to EUR70 million. I
cannot give you the (inaudible) oﬀ the top of my head.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Okay, fair enough.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

(inaudible) -- bring this slide with me on the economical capital increase. But I can come
back to you with that.

FINAL

Many market risks, I remember that.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Blair Stewart, Bank of
America. Please go ahead.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Hi, there. Good afternoon, everyone. Blair Stewart here. Thanks very much for a
straightforward set of numbers. Two questions though both on P&C. Given the result in
Denmark, you taking any raking action or is the pickup in large claims purely bad luck?
And secondly, also on (inaudible), just looking at the cost increase you're saying that the
nominal cost increase by 5.6%. I just wonder if you see some scope to get the cost ratio
down in the year or two ahead given that you are growing the top line quite nicely. Thank
you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Blair, I tried at all costs to avoid saying bad luck. I don't like that and we don't do as ifs and
things. But if you have to ask a question on Denmark, I have to say bad luck.
We've had two simple, usual kind, run-of-the-mill ﬁres between EUR5 million and EUR10
million in Denmark. There's nothing special about them. They are risks that are typical to
our portfolio so unfortunately I can't say bad luck and the underlying development for us
in Denmark has been good but it comes to risk (inaudible) and result this quarter. I'm
satisﬁed with our Danish development.
Secondly, cost increase, the cost ratio which is what is important is unchanged. Actually if
you look at the development last year we had a relatively fast development in the First
Quarter. The spread of the year varies a bit depending on exactly when we invested
systems, to marketing campaigns, et cetera. So I stick to my usual statement that every
year we should reduce the cost ratio by a few decimal points.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, very much.

Operator
Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Gianandrea Roberti from Carnegie
Bank. Please go ahead.

Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2012-05-08

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Good afternoon, from me as well. I have actually just one simple question. My fellow
(inaudible) of If [ph] at the end of the quarter is more than EUR2.8 billion. Would it be fair
to assume that a good working assumption for a Single A Rating is that you should have
around EUR2.1 billion, EUR2.2 billion?
I guess what I'm trying to say is that I see at least EUR600 million of excess in top of the
single a rating at the moment. Is this something you can probably conﬁrm?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Gianandrea, it depends also on how much you have investment risks and of course in the
past we have probably sometimes operating with EUR2.21 billion, EUR2.2 billion but for
example we have now the top Denmark state and overall equity exposure is higher. So I
would say that your number is at EUR2.1 billion, EUR2.2 billion is a bit low.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Okay. 100? 200 million more than that. Is that a fall target?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker

Bloomberg Transcript

You start the bargain here. I think that the proﬁtability of If is such that there is no need to
worry about internal dividends. We can quite well handle the needs of the parent to
continue to be in dividend stock.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Super. Thanks a lot.

Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Giulia Raﬀo from Autonomous.
Please go ahead.

Q - Giulia Raﬀo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. I have a few very quick questions and apologies if some of them have
already been asked. But I had problems getting into the conference call. Quick one on If,
the combined ratio was very, very strong particularly for winter quarter. If you compare Q1
2012 with Q1 2011, can you tell us how much the Delta is due to better weather as
opposed to underlying improvement?
The second question is on the life [ph] side. I have seen in the supplement a footnote that
suggest that you took some costs for some pension initiative. I just wanted to check
whether you can tell us how much were those costs and if we should expect them to
continue the rest of 2012?

Page 6 of 12



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2012-05-08

The third question is whether you can give us some indication about what your
expectation of running yields involve life and P&C for the rest of 2012. Thank you, very
much.

FINAL

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

I'll give you some very round numbers that might be useful. The winter this year is roughly
1.5% on the combined ratio better than what we expected on average or budgeted or
planned.
The large losses as a round number, 1% worse. And we have roughly 1% in the discount
rate runoﬀ gains that I answered in the previous question. So that's the more substantial
deviations from the plan.

Q - Giulia Raﬀo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Thank you, very much.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
On the pension side it's actually a new business imitative we bought a small operation
called INOVA Pension [ph]. If I remember right the cost was something around EUR1
million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, that is a (inaudible) pension that the company because it's not a pension company.
It's not a pension company, yes.
Maybe I clarify this a little bit --

Q - Giulia Raﬀo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Should we expect that to carry on or not, the EUR1 million? Or, was it just a Q1 hit?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
It's a one-oﬀ.

Q - Giulia Raﬀo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Yes, we bought the consulting business and this is related to that. The consulting business
should be proﬁtable in the future and it has to do with personal funds, which is a growing
market.

Page 7 of 12



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2012-05-08

The importance of this acquisition will come later on because as it's a personal fund it
takes time to ﬁll in the products, the companies, because also the union members are
allowed to be involved in decision-making.

FINAL

You also asked on the ﬁxed income portfolio running years. We have as you have seen in
the material a 3.9% running yields in the ﬁxed income portfolio and If -- and a 5.3%
running yield in Mandatum Life.
I can't give you any answer what will happen during the year. We are of course in a very
defensive mode. We try to maintain these in an environment where they are gradually
going down. How this curve looks like, that depends on what kind of reinvestments we
ﬁnd.
We actually at this moment we are mainly participating only new issues and unless there
are enough attractive new issues on the market that will ﬁll our criteria if that is not the
case then we will allocate more money to cash and that will drive our running rate lower.
But how this will develop, it will be very dependent on the market and how well the
market receives and what kind of margin the market is willing to pay for the new issues.

Q - Giulia Raﬀo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Excuse me, can you give us a sense of what was your average new money reinvestment
yield in Q1 2012?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
The new corporate bonds that we participate in the fair, yield has been 4% to 5% however
we have not been able to ﬁnd enough materials so our cash has lately in the last months
been increasing.

Q - Giulia Raﬀo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hans Pluijgers from Cheuvreux.
Please go ahead.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. If you questions from my side. First of all, on the
industrial side, you show an increase in the combined ratio can you relate what was
happening there? Was it one speciﬁc or a few speciﬁc issues or general trends?
Secondly, a follow up on that because I see the premium income rise in the additional
(inaudible) 5.7%. Can you maybe give a breakdown of volume of price there?

Page 8 of 12



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2012-05-08

And then coming to the capital, economic capital increased and was correctly the main
issue was that a market risk discretional [ph]. Is that mainly driven by an increase in equity
prices could you give some reason for the slow increase in the market risk?

FINAL

And, thirdly, on the life side, you saw a quite strong increase the market share in
Mandatum in Finland. Could you give maybe some background to that?
And lastly, with respect to P&C, last year you turned quite signiﬁcant investment gain
which you said partly was a one-oﬀ. But I assumed also looking at let's say your change in
your breakdown of your investment portfolio, you have taken some (inaudible) gains on
your portfolio -- material gains in the P&C investment portfolio or can you give some
feeling of what was the normalized level there?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
I didn't catch the ﬁrst question. You saw combined ratio increase where speciﬁcally?

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

In industrial segments. You discussed in Denmark it was commercial with also an
industrial segment you saw an increase on year-on-year. What's happening there?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Okay. In industrial the combined ratio increase is driven by the change in large losses. The
development in general for our book is good. The rate to development is good for our
book. I have no -- I have good expectations for the rest of the year.
The income increase I gave some factors to that earlier. The record car sales, the high rate
increases and some segments notably property in Sweden and Finland. Some degree
also in Denmark, property, private lines, we are able to get through the premium
increases that we want then they are in excess of claims inﬂation and good retention
levels in all markets not least in Norway where we have had strong competition from bank
insurers previously but that seems to have abated and we have a good exchange rate to
the bank insurers of Norway at the moment.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
The economic capital so it's mainly driven by the increase in markets recently and that's
partly because equity prices have gone up and partly because of the spread risk.
It looks like in Mandatum Life that the market risk has not increased that much but it's
partly due to the fact that again, the concentration risk is down in Mandatum Life. But
that's the main driver in the increase in economic capital.
You also asked about Mandatum Life's market share. I also saw that our market share
increased but as you are well aware, it's not a target or KPI for us in any way.

FINAL

We don't live on market share so really we should ask what our colleagues did. The
market in Finland is such that it's divided almost exactly into four parts. It's us, OP Povula
[ph] Life or OP Life Company and Nordea and the market segment Other. They are
roughly the same size and so it's more question of how the other bank distributors how
they allocated their distribution resources and I don't really follow that much.
Mandatum's progress was very positive at 20% increase in gross written premiums and of
course Sampo Bank which is now owned by Danske. And is our exclusive distribution
channel, they performed really well in this quarter. That is noteworthy.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

But there was no let's say marketing (inaudible) in Q1?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
No, we live our own life and we try to earn as much as possible and we don't really follow
the market share. It was just the result of good work in Sampo Bank and in our own sales
organization.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

And on investment gains in P&C, what do you see as normalized level and what are let's
say was Q1 in line with normalized levels in P&C?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Real life gains were fairly small in Q1 both in Mandatum Life if the exceptional item last
year was the one-oﬀ EUR75 million sales gain that we had from one individual stock.
I think you could interpret this as a pretty normal uneventful quarter in a way.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.

Operator
Thank you. We currently have no questions coming through.

Q - Per Gronberg
Yes, it's Per of Danske. Single question. You reported quite good ﬁgures also from your
Norwegian operation. But we saw one of your peers on Friday last week report
outstanding ﬁgures. Don't know how willing you are to comment on peer performance

verses your own. But can you give us some insight into what's driving your Norway
business at that homeland? Are there any special items we should be aware of looking at
your Norway country [ph] result for this quarter?

FINAL

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Not really. I'm not -- I have no insight into what (inaudible) numbers mean so I can't
compare us to them. We are happy with the development. The winter in Norway was mild,
I would say better than plan or budget, if you can have a plan for winter.
We were able to have good retention numbers, increase prices as we wanted to and that
will beneﬁt our numbers going forward also. I can't really say anything compared to
(inaudible).

Q - Per Gronberg
No special items in your ﬁgures? No past claims or --?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
No. No.

(Operator Instructions).
And we've got a follow up question from the line of Hans Pluijgers from Cheuvreux.
Please go ahead.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Yes, one small follow up question with respect to tax rates. They were relatively low in Q1,
if you could maybe could give some reason why it was low. It was about 13% or at least are
you going forward with respect to tax rate?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
The reason why the tax rate looks low is simply because we take the net proﬁt from our
data and that of course is not taxed twice so its reported as pre-tax proﬁt. But then when
you calculate the tax on the reported proﬁt both from Mandatum Life and If you can apply
roughly 25%.
