MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. We have various members of the group
executives here as well to take any questions that you may have. I'm pleased to report a
strong set of results for our second quarter, a return on equity of 3.2% and our combined
ratio of 80.6% demonstrates that our underwriting investment strategy is continuing to
fare well against a backdrop of increased loss activity and investment market volatility.
Our year-to-date return on equity is 7.1% and our combined ratio of 76.2% is equally as
pleasing against a backdrop of a near zero yield environment. We've maintained our
premium levels around the same level versus the second quarter of 2015, as we said we
would do, and our premium levels for the year are broadly flat.
At the same time, we've reduced our net PMLs for Gulf of Mexico hurricane risk by 25%
and our California earthquake risk by nearly 40% compared to this time last year. We have
suffered loss activity in our energy product line and losses from our property treaty
product line from the Fort McMurray wildfire loss and some small loss activity from our
property D&F product line, but these are all losses we would expect to have bearing in
mind the client base we have.

FINAL

As mentioned in the first quarter, we have purchased better reinsurance over time and
taken a long-term view on our relationships with our reinsurers. We are benefited from
this strategy in the quarter with savings on these claims, but we are also happy when our
reinsurers make a return, as they are our partners and we value their support.
We continue to be relevant in all the product lines which we underwrite and receive
excellent support from our brokers and clients. We have said many times that we are not
interested in writing trackers of (01:50) the market and will only participate in product lines
where we feel we can add genuine value for our clients and brokers and make an
underwriting profit.
At this stage of the cycle, we believe vigorous risk selection, maintaining your book of
core clients and rightsizing the underwriting risk to the opportunity is how prudent insurers
will manage the cycle. We do not believe you can grow your way out of a soft market.

Bloomberg Transcript

We continue to invest in our Lloyd's business Cathedral. I'm delighted with the progress
we have made in a short period of time and the talented individuals we've been able to
attract to the group. We said last quarter that Cathedral was going to evolve and change
over time and it will, but nothing changes our approach to underwriting and we continue
to get excellent support from our brokers and clients whilst leveraging the broader
relationships with the group.
So our story doesn't change, nor should it, as we see no immediate change in the
underwriting environment, but what is undeniable is the margins are tight across most
product lines, and as we have seen in this quarter, losses which may also have troubled
(02:55) profitability a few years ago now appear to challenge even some of the larger
carriers.
So it feels like the industry is bumping around the bottom of the pricing cycle, but I'm sure
this will change until capital is impaired, but with combined ratios being squeezed every
quarter, it won't take much before results run red instead of black.
And I'll now hand over to Elaine.

Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Thanks, Alex. Hi, everyone. Our results are on our website as usual. While there have
been some significant losses for the industry this quarter, we avoided most of those. We
picked up losses from the Canadian wildfires and a significant energy market loss. The
group's net loss impact in the quarter from those was a manageable $31.3 million which is
net of $57.9 million of recoveries from our reinsurance program.
With some further favorable development on prior accident year versus this (03:49)
quarter, plus strong investment performance, our overall performance for the quarter was
very good with an ROE of 3.2% as against a 7.1% for the year-to-date. The Canadian
wildfires are responsible for Cathedral's small comprehensive loss for the quarter. So our

Page 2 of 17



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2016-07-27

ROE of 3.2% for the quarter comes mostly from the Lancashire platform, although
Cathedral has contributed 1.2% to our year-to-date ROE of 7.1%.

FINAL

There's a small increase in our gross premiums written this quarter compared to last year.
Cathedral again maintains our core book, but had some further price reductions across
most lines of business as rate pressure continues.
In the Lancashire book, we saw more strong deal flow in the political risk book and new
business offset price reductions in the property cat book. Energy Gulf of Mexico premiums
increased due to new business and also as a result of the impact of multi-year contract
renewal timing and contracts that canceled and replaced as clients roll (04:44) multi-year
covers. You recall we commented this time last year on the impact of multi-year deals on
our top-line versus our earnings.
Our top-line in 2015 was impacted significantly by multiyear deals not up for renewal yet
but there's less impact than earned premium. On an earned basis, the 2016 energy Gulf
of Mexico book is relatively stable compared to 2015. While the top line for the quarter is
slightly higher than last year, net earned premium is lower. That's primarily due to the
increased political risk longer tenure business relative to other lines of business; the multiyear impact plus increased reinsurance spend.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our premium ceded is higher than last year as we've entered into several outwards
facilities, bought more fac cover and spend savings in our main program renewal and
additional broader cover generally touching lower.
We've seen the benefits of our enhanced reinsurance program this quarter with some
successful recoveries on the quarter's lost events. We also recorded some reinstatement
premiums on those recoveries.
With the additional cover purchase, I would now expect our full year reinsurance spend to
be a bit higher than last year. Our acquisition cost ratio is higher this quarter driven by
reinstatement premiums and the Canadian wildfires and our energy loss plus the
increased reinsurance spend. The ratio for the year-to-date is still in line with our
expectations and I would expect the ratio for the full year to be around the 25%, 26%
mark.
On losses, as I mentioned, it's been a busy quarter for the industry with the Fort McMurray
wildfires, U.S. weather losses, some significant energy losses plus an earthquake and
terror attacks.
As I noted, we recorded a net loss of $31.3 million in the quarter from the Fort McMurray
under energy loss and that has pushed our accident year loss ratio to 62.7%. While neither
the Fort McMurray loss nor our energy loss were significant enough in dollar terms to
disclose them separately, together they contributed about 27% to our second-quarter
loss ratio. On a year-to-date basis, they contribute about 15 points to our loss ratio. Our
pure attrition, therefore, continues to run around the mid-30%s.

FINAL

Our favorable reserve development of $39.3 million in the quarter benefited the loss ratio
by about 35%. No real specifics driving the releases, again, just a lack of reported claims
coming through primarily in the 2014 and 2015 accident years.
Investments, including currency headwinds, returned 0.9% for the quarter with most of
that coming from our fixed maturity portfolio given the drop in yields in the quarter. We
also had positive returns across our bank loan, equity and hedge fund portfolios. Our
portfolio positioning, diversification and hedging continue to protect our portfolio while
generating reasonable returns.
As volatility in the market continues and Fed interest rate hikes are inevitable, we'll
continue with our current strategy (07:39) short duration that are in the same level of risk
assets. As we've noted previously, other income captures are third-party capital income.
The slight increase this quarter is largely due to a lag in receipt of the profit commission in
Kinesis this year. We received all the profit commission on the 1/1/14 underwriting cycle in
the first quarter of 2015. This year we received some profit commission on the 1/1/15
underwriting cycle in the first quarter and we received a further $1.4 million this quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

We anticipate receiving about another $2.5 million or so on that cycle over the rest of the
year as collateral is released. If there are no losses on the 1/1/16 underwriting cycle, profit
commissions could be just under $6 million but the earliest we would receive that would
be Q1 2017.
Our G&A includes KCM's expenses. The ratio may look a little higher this quarter but
that's mostly driven by lower earned premiums. The dollar amount is in line with
expectations on previous quarters. Stock comp costs are higher this quarter purely due to
changes in performance assumptions.
Our financing expenses were again negatively impacted by the mark-to-market on our
interest-rate swap. Ignoring the swap mark-to-market and any one-off cost, our financing
cost still tend to be around $4 million a quarter.
Lastly, on capital with no change in the market, we're still comfortable at the $1.35 billion
to $1.4 billion level of capital. We'll obviously continue to monitor that as we go through the
U.S. wind season and into renewal (09:06) season. If there are no indications we'll need
the extra capital we've generated this year, we're likely to return earnings in a special
dividend later this year.
With that, I'll now hand over to the operator for questions.

Q&A

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi, there. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two questions from me and perhaps a
quick comment firstly. It's really interesting to hear you strip out the large and larger losses
from the attritional just to get a more underlying picture. It would be good to get
something like that in the release in the morning just so we can dig that out early.
On my questions, so in earned premium, it continues to shrink as we expect. There's
more and more reinsurance buying. I guess it will be the same next year. I'm just
wondering what's your outlook for the net earned just so we don't put something funny in
our numbers?
And secondly, on energy pricing I mean is the Jubilee loss, and the Pemex reserve
strengthening in places is that enough to turn this market now? Is it enough to remove
some competition or is it just going to sort of bump along the bottom a bit more? Thank
you very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay. Jonny, I'll do the energy one and then Elaine can talk about the premiums. I think the
only thing that changes any market is a withdrawal in capacity so it doesn't matter what
market you're in, you can have losses day-by-day but if no one leaves the party, nothing
changes. But you have to believe with the losses that the energy market or the marine
and energy market has sustained in the last five years you would think that people must
be looking at the numbers very closely and the reinsurers must be questioning some of
the pricing there which actually that would affect us, our reinsurance bill would go up but
that would actually be a good thing because I think it would question some people's
strategy in the market.
Energy is one of the things where Lloyd's â€“ I'm not sure (11:48) Lloyd's got a focus on
certain classes of the business and energy is one of those and rightly so. So yes, you
would think so but nothing will change until people cut back or the reinsurers don't
provide as much capacity. So it feels like it should change at 1/1. It feels like there have
been a number of very large losses which actually shouldn't surprise anyone who writes
an energy account because that's what happens in energy but until people leave, not
much will change sadly.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Hi, Jonny. In terms of the net earned premium outlook, we were about 118% last year. I
think we'll be lower than that this year, but not below 100%. I think, what you're seeing this
quarter is a Q2 specific thing and I think will normalize as the rest of the year goes on
once that reinsurance spend settles down a little bit.
In terms of where we are with loss disclosure, we've been talking about that kind of mid30%s attritional point for awhile. We do disclose anything that we see as being an event
loss or anything that's significant and big enough magnitude that we think that we should
talk about it.

FINAL

The larger losses or the midsize losses that kind of fall in between attrition and those
events and losses which we haven't had for a while are a bit tougher. There are
sensitivities around the claims and the contracts, the clients involved there so we have to
be kind of alert to that.
And also just in terms of how we look at the numbers, they're not really material enough
on their own for disclosure. But, if you do want to stick something extra in your budget for
a little bit of kind of mid- to mid-size losses, then I would go ahead and do that.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

Thank you. We can now take our next question from Kamran Hossain from RBC. Please go
ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. Afternoon, everyone. It's Kamran Hossain from RBC. I've got two questions and one
clarification. The first question is on capital so it sounds like I guess like this quarter where
your reinsurance purchasing is really (13:56), you've got good protection for the
remainder of the year. If 2016 ends up being a decent year for earnings but prices look
like they're going to be down again in January, will you look to hold capital I guess at the
high-end of where you want to be or will you be a little bit more aggressive on returning
capital? So that's question one.
Question two, really fantastic to see a little bit of growth in I guess in property and I guess
political risk. Can you just talk me through how that came about? Was this business in new,
was this from a new hire and are there any other areas that you might look to expand
selectively?
And the clarification, just coming back to Elaine's 27% came from Fort McMurray and
another large loss, is that 27 points on the loss ratio or is that 27% of loss? I think I missed
that completely so apologies for that.

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay, Kamran. We'll go to Elaine for the capital one and the clarification and Hayley
Johnston, our LUK CUO, will take the political risk one.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Yeah. So, hi Kamran. That's a 27% contribution to loss ratio and as we said about 15 points
for year-to-date. And we do think we have more capital protection. I'd say, obviously, a lot
depends on what happens over the rest of the year, how our outlook is for 1/1 and what
our placing of our reinsurance program looks like, all of which are uncertain just now.

Page 6 of 17

Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2016-07-27

FINAL

And what we have kind of said is if the current conditions continue then we will probably
return earnings because we're happy with the capital levels we've got. We're at a point
where we've got a good solid core book and we're happy with that. And if pricing does
continue to come down, arguably we could do with a bit more capital but then there's
always new business opportunities even if they're small that come in. And we'll have more
color on that as we go through the rest of the wind season and as we go through
September and October (15:59) outlook.

Q - Kamran Hossain

Thanks, Elaine.

Q - Kamran Hossain

Hi, Hayley.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Hayley Johnston

{BIO 18728392 <GO>}

On the political risk side, I think it's fair to say we all know this is quite a lumpy book. The
majority of the book isn't renewable. It's one-off bespoke deal. Also I'd say that some of
the deals that we work on have a lead-in time of 12 to 18 months so what we've seen a bit
this quarter of some deals that are bound, that have come to fruition that we've worked
on in the last 12 months. But there's no real trend or change in appetite. It's more about
timing, when the deal would have presented and eventually get bound.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Okay, fantastic. Thanks very much.

Operator
Thank you. We can now take our next question from Andreas van Embden from Peel Hunt.
Please go ahead.

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. I just want to turn my attention to Cathedral. The
combined ratio was 112% in the second quarter and just wanted to ask whether you could
isolate the net cat and large losses for the quarter and whether these losses were higher
than normal within Cathedral?
And also sticking to with Cathedral is the attritional loss ratio, once we back out the nat cat
and large losses and the reserve releases, what was the level of the attritional loss ratio
and what's the outlook for that in the second half of the year and into 2017? I noticed that
rate pressure accelerated in Q2. Just wondered whether you were comfortable with the
rate levels within the Cathedral portfolio?
Page 7 of 17



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2016-07-27

Finally, on Cathedral, it's more about the protection of the capital going into the hurricane
season. How well is Cathedral protected and have you done more in the second quarter
to preserve the capital base of Cathedral if the hurricane season turns out to be active?
Thank you very much.

FINAL

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Andreas, obviously, Elaine will take all the numbers bit. On the general comment about
Cathedral reinsurance, our overall strategy as a group has been to buy more cover as the
year has progressed. We have actually purchased a cat umbrella cover this year which is
new which covers the whole group so we do have more cat cover than we've ever had
going into wind season. So we're sure we're in a pretty good place. And as I said, that
covers Cathedral as well and that's been part of our strategy this year. It applies to the
whole group and we believe it makes sense bearing in mind where we are in the market.

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

All right.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Hey, hi Andreas. On the cat in Cathedral, we don't want to get into the habit of splitting
losses between the Cathedral platform and the Lancashire platform but I think if you look
at the Q2 results this year versus last year, I think it's fairly clear you can see (19:02) size of
events and drove them into that comprehensive loss for the quarter. The two events that
we talked about in terms of the impact on our loss ratio are fairly kind of evenly split in
terms of size. Cathedral does have a little bit more on the community wildfire on the
Lancashire side, as you'd expect given where they write their book. It is a bit more
attritional in nature but we do write higher up. And your attritional loss ratio question was
that about Cathedral or about the group as a whole?

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

Yeah. Just Cathedral.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

We're not giving guidance on specific attritional losses for Cathedral. On an overall basis,
we're still in that kind of mid-30%s and I think if you get that kind of point for the whole
group then you should be modeling fine.

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

Would you say that Cathedral on an attritional basis is underwriting below 100% in Q2?

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Yeah, I mean that's kind of in the top end, so that's made a difference. I mean, if you'd
recall the from me especially through the acquisition we were talking about Lancashire
attritional loss ratios being in the kind of 25-ish range and obviously we'd price adjust that
and so the uplifts gets to kind of the mid-30%s where we are now, given the Cathedral
Page 8 of 17



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2016-07-27

book which is more attritional in nature but when you put kind of Lancashire and Cathedral
together you get the more capital efficiency there going into that, that makes the
difference.

Q - Nick Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Afternoon, all. It's a question on investments. It's another quarter of quite large unrealized
gains. Just wondering if you can give us thoughts on how you might pace in the second
half of the year? Obviously with yields being so low, are you considering realizing some of
those gains into the income statement which obviously would be good for profits or are
you more likely to hold things to maturity? Thanks.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Hi, Nick. It's Elaine. We kind of lost the first half of your question which given that we've got
Denise on for any investment questions. It would unfortunate because she's normally on
the call and doesn't get any questions.

A - Denise Oâ€™Donoghue

{BIO 15315126 <GO>}

So I think your question was about second-half performance expectations I think?

Q - Nick Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Well, just about what might you might do with the unrealized gains, whether or not you're
considering perhaps crystallizing some of those gains in which case I guess there'd be a
plus to the income statement.

A - Denise Oâ€™Donoghue

{BIO 15315126 <GO>}

Yeah, that is not typically how we look at our investment portfolio. We don't look here
within the income statement or if it's in OCI. We just run our portfolio to get the results
that we want from it so there's no strategy to realize any of those gains.

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

Oh, hi. Thanks very much. I had two questions. The first was just on Cathedral. I think since
we last spoke there's been more management changes and Alex referred to the fact that
the business is evolving. I just wonder if you could update in terms of how you see the
portfolio shifting going forward with the new teams that you're bringing on board, if
there's anything material that we need to be aware of ?
And the second question was just on the expense side, do you expect any kind of
material benefit from the weakening in sterling in terms of your dollar expense ratio?
Thanks.

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Ben, so we've done a lot of hiring in this quarter. We have a new Finance Director, we
have a new Managing Director who will be here for 12 months as we get a permanent
replacement. We have a new Head of our Treaty (22:43) team. We've employed probably
three or four underwriters. And there's quite a long list, five underwriters, Rich Williams
tells me. There's quite a lot of people come into Cathedral and I think that's quite a good
blend with the people that we have here under Rich's leadership.
The book itself, there's no real plans to change it. As you've seen, we've maintained all
the income. We're very confident we can do that. All the people that we've picked come
into the syndicate have the relationships and the experience of the books of business to
match the guys that left.
And we've just put our first blush of our business plan into Lloyd's which is very similar to
this year because the market hasn't changed. Clearly, if there was something quite
interesting happening, we along with a lot of others would be going to Lloyd's and
changing our business plan to adapt to the new market.
But we haven't because nothing appears to have changed which we would obviously like
that to happen and that won't change until it does. So I think it's pretty much business as
usual. As I said, we haven't lost any business. The 1st of July went well. We've done the
majority of income for the syndicate for the year. There's probably a few more hires to
come, but I think we've pretty much done most of those now. So, I think we're very much
back to normal.

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

Thanks.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Hi, Ben. In terms of the expenses, we will get some benefits. We do have a fair bit of our
expense base in sterling. I think we said last year if you looked at the G&A for 2015, there
Page 10 of 17



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2016-07-27

is a little bit of one-off expense in there, but if you back that out, that was a reasonable
run rate.

FINAL

So, if you take about 60% or so of our cost base being in sterling, you'll be able to work
out from there. It's not going to have a significant impact. And it will have some and
obviously, every little bit helps.

Q - Ben Cohen

Thank you. We can now take our next question from Xinmei Wang from Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.

Q - Xinmei Wang

{BIO 17860767 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon. I have three questions. The first is, so I think last quarter, Alex, you
said you'd be really pleased with a 9% to 12% ROE. Just wondering has your view â€“ is that
still the view given the solid ROE reported in the first half ?

Bloomberg Transcript

Second question is you're talking about buying more reinsurance under the cat umbrella
this year. Is there any more appetite to further increase your reinsurance spend or are you
happy with where you are?
And then the last question sort of is on the disclosure. I'm quite curious because I guess
your book of business might not necessarily lend itself to quarterly reporting given the
volatility that could happen from quarter-to-quarter. Is reporting on a half-year basis
something you have considered or would consider given that?

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Questions, I'll take the first two. I think I'm going to stick with my 9% to
12%, which means hopefully we haven't got very far to go. I think our general view of the
environment is if we could churn out anything double-digit, I would still be happy. I think
our shareholders would be very happy with that. I think it would be completely wrong to
reach for too much yield in this underwriting environment, because I think you just take on
too much risk.
So I think if we can do double-digits, I'll be very, very happy, and we've got a great start to
the year so far. Obviously, a lot can happen. We're in hurricane season now. We do have a
lot of reinsurance. We have brought a lot of the volatility down, some of the reinsurance
programs we have do drop down for the second loss, so our energy account would drop
down for any further losses for the rest of the year.
So we think we're in good shape. We've bought a lot of reinsurance, probably more than
some of my colleagues would like, but that's the environment we're in and it is one of the
Page 11 of 17

Date: 2016-07-27

FINAL

few things that you can do to manage this stage of the cycle. I think people have got
different strategies. Ours is quite old-fashioned, I suppose, so we have bought more
reinsurance.
But equally, as I said earlier, if we don't claim on our reinsurance, we don't see that is a
bad thing. That just builds up our bank (27:24) with our partners. So yeah, but obviously,
that strategy, it seems like the right one is paid off this quarter, but equally, as we said in
the past, we've bought reinsurance and we haven't claimed on it, but we are also fond of
that (27:38) as well.

Hi, Xinmei. On the quarterly versus half year reporting, there seems to have been (27:45)
an ongoing debate on that since the first discussion about the change in requirements.
And I think if you look at us versus a lot of our UK peers, we've obviously, a lot more
information in terms of our U.S. peers. We're probably about the same. And so, I think
(28:01) at the moment in terms of covering our shareholder base. There are some that
say there's too much information and there are some that will say â€“ (28:11) we're always
getting asked for more than we have out, so we have to try and balance that as well.

Okay, great. Thanks very much.

Thank you. We can now take our next question from Philip Kett from Macquarie. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Philip Kett

{BIO 19507232 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Thanks very much. Two questions if I may. Firstly, on reserve release. I
see that the marine reserve releases have nearly doubled. I was wondering if there was
anything in particular this year or last year that was driving the increase.
Secondly, in the Gulf of Mexico offshore energy, I see there has been an additional $16.5
million due to a multi-year contract (28:52) the multi-year contract was canceled and then
replaced. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that. My understanding
was that multi-year contracts were locking in a higher premium rate.

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay. I think both of those are for Elaine. What I would just say about the multi-year
energy contract is that when we started writing multi-year, we were very much on the top
of that market and then we are still one of the few people that do have a small group of
clients that continue to hedge some of their purchases on a multi-year basis. We would
not be interested in lessening (29:40) multi-year pricing at the bottom of the market. If
you look at the Gulf of Mexico rating, that's actually not at the bottom of the market
anyway and our book is quite nichey.

FINAL

So I think your overall thought process is right in that why would you want to lock in now if
we all believe, as we do, you're kind of at the bottom of the pricing cycle. We don't
believe we are in the Gulf of Mexico and our book is very niche and very small and they're
core customers that we've had for probably a decade now. So I just want to make that
point.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

And I guess just picking up, there's two different things probably happening in our book,
and we should try to avoid mixing them up. There's multi-year deals and in 2014, as I said,
we did a lot of them then, and we had about $64 million, $65 million worth of multi-year
deals there. The two-year, 2.5-year senior (30:34) deals, so that had a big impact on our
top-line last year. And we also get cancels and replaces and contracts do often cancel
from time to time.

Bloomberg Transcript

As people do buy longer-term cover and we negotiate it or change the terms over or we
will look forward, some people like the certainty (30:53) of cover. So there's a multi-year
impact which was 2014 forward and there are still some multi-years in the book, but they
kind of tend to even out over time now. And then, there's the C&Rs which for the most
part, all you're going to see up for them is the pricing impact of them, but it does make
that top-line just a little bit lumpy and I appreciate that can be a bit hard to forecast. But
on an earnings basis, for that book, it makes it more consistent, because we're still
getting the earnings of those multi-year policies and the replacements for the
cancellations coming through.
And on the marine releases, we did have some general releases in there. There was one
specific claim in 2011. You should see it in the press release. That year should pop out a
little bit and that we released some reserves on that one as well so that made up some
of that release for that cost of (31:42) business.

Thank you very much.

Thank you. We can now take our next question from Thomas Fossard from HSBC. Please
go ahead, sir.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions on my side. The first one would be for Elaine
regarding the reserve release. Can we get some guidance regarding what to expect in
H2 for the current year?
And the second question would be for Alex. Alex, did you receive the PRA letter to CEO
questioning the reserve sustainability (32:27) commercial lines? What is your reaction and
perception to this regulatory letter? Thank you.

FINAL

Okay, Thomas. Thanks. I think if you think about the PRA letter and if you think about how
Lloyd's has written to all the managing agents about probably about more than half of the
income in Lloyd's, I think you've got two regulators who have an awful lot of data appear
to be increasingly more concerned about the health of the market which I think we would
subscribe to.
And I think particularly if you think about Lloyd's, you've got a huge database and people
have been making reserve releases and, obviously, it very much depends on the book
you have. Some people have got large casualty books and I would imagine the concern
from the regulator there is going to be our people releasing too much money bearing in
mind when some of that business was written, you're in a very different investment
environment.
So I'm sure some of that business was priced when it was quite easy to get a 5%
investment return and you can no longer do that that easily. So are people just releasing
money to prop up their results? Obviously, with someone like us, our reserves are always
much more (33:54). And we write a short-tailed book and if there are good years when
not much happens, we tend to have good reserve releases. So it's different for us.

Bloomberg Transcript

But I think the general tone from the PRA and from Lloyd's is that you don't need to sort
of be â€“ you don't need to work in finance to work out that when the combined ratios are
as close as they are to 100% and not that much is happening, there really is little margin
left in this business.
If you just look at this quarter, if you look at the Canada wildfire loss, that sub $5 billion, I
don't personally think that's a big loss, I don't think the energy loss is something that
should surprise people. I think this is just run of the mill losses and some people are not
even making an underwriting profit anymore.
So I think all the indicators are there that you are at the bottom of the market, that you are
â€“ there's very little margin left in this business. And clearly, the regulator and, clearly,
Lloyd's with their issues about the central funding will be worried that people are going to
lose money and are people fully aware of how close they are to the edge.
So I just think it's another indicator of for me everything is pointing to you are very, very
close to losing money and obviously that's why we have booked more reinsurance and try
to do the right thing and we're fully aware of how difficult this stage of the cycle is. And
look, when the market is losing the money, eventually, things will change, so we kind of
see it as a good thing, but for me, it's a good indication of where we're at in the cycle.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Would you specifically expect this to ease the competitive pressure on the business
written at Lloyd's next year or it's more or less a neutral thing?

FINAL

I mean I think Lloyd's have been very explicit about what they accept. It's going to be very
hard for anyone to grow in Lloyd's. So yes, I think if there is enough of those actions from
the regulators, you would think it would slow people down. Obviously, Lloyd's is only one
section of the market. But yeah, I mean from what we're seeing at the moment,
particularly on the reinsurance lines, things have slowed down. I think there is some sanity
coming back to the market.
I think on some of the specialty lines, there are glimmers of hope, but as we spoke earlier
about marine and energy reinsurance, again, you would think that people are going to hit
the brakes, but until you see capacity leave the market or until people can't access the
reinsurance as they did before, it's hard to say how things materially change, but are they
slowing up? Yes, I think they are.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Hi Thomas. Just on your releases question, probably not the answer that you want to
hear, but we don't give any guidance in terms of reserve releases.

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

(37:05)

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

I don't know if you can still hear, but as I said, we don't give any guidance on reserve
releases. Our book of business is quite lumpy and the timing and the magnitude of claims
is unfair and probably due to its reserve for attrition and for attritional claims and then we
reserve best estimate for the kind of mid-sized larger stuff.
In any event, they're out there, so it really depends on what's reported. Our payment
patterns on releases are actually fairly consistent quarter-on-quarter. So it does depend
on what comes through and our short-tail is a bit lumpy, so if we're going to have releases
(37:55).

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Sorry, Thomas, did you hear that?

Okay. We'll take our further question just now, that's okay, from Andreas van Embden, a
follow-up question from Peel Hunt. Please go ahead.

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

Yeah. Maybe before you walk out the building, just going back to the Syndicate 2010. Can
you hear me?

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

(38:51) Can you just hold on for...

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Can you just â€“ okay, go now.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

Yeah. Syndicate 2010, just looking half year on half year, there is not much growth. It's
actually quite in terms of premiums, there's a bit of a reduction. My impression was that
you were going to put more capital behind Syndicate 2010, and then, grow that business
further. Is there just a blip because of all the changes within Cathedral that you haven't
really pushed that business harder this year and are planning to do that next year, or has
anything changed with your strategy there? Thanks.

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

One second, Andreas, I'll answer in one second. Yeah, so Andreas, on that one, I'm not
really sure where you're going on that one, because for us, putting more capital into 2010
or 3010 or Lancashire would only be about underwriting opportunity and nothing has
changed.
So if anything, as you know, for a number of years now, we've been giving back capital,
because we can't see the underwriting opportunities. So I'm pretty sure we haven't said
that publicly. We would love to put more capital in the business when the market changes,
but we haven't seen any opportunities to do that.

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Yeah, Andreas. If anything, we might have been looking to put a bit more money into is
3010 and grow that, but the lines that we were growing in there were energy tender I
mean (40:43), we have had some success there, but obviously, any kind of growth in this
market needs to be done very carefully.
