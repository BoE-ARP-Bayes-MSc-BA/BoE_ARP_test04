{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thanks, Dennis. This morning we announced the Fourth Quarter net operating income of
CAD194 million, or CAD1.42 per share, 25% higher than last year reﬂecting our strong
underwriting results. Overall, the exceptional performance in personal property oﬀset
actions taken in our personal auto business.
I believe our combined ratio of 92.1% is indicative of the true underwriting performance in
the quarter, despite the large year-over-year movements within our personal lines
businesses.
From a top-line perspective, premium growth of 7% was in line with our expectations for
the quarter. You may recall from our investor day in November that I indicated that the
JEVCO portfolio would require more re-underwriting than did the AXA book. So it is
important to bear in mind that this re-underwriting did not impact Q4 growth as we
remain in the early stages of the integration.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our strong underwriting performance as well as CAD102 million of net investment income
resulted in an operating ROE of 16.8% while book value per share increased 11% from a
year earlier. The conﬁdence in our earnings outlook, as well as solid ﬁnancial position,
enabled us to increase our quarterly dividend by 10% to CAD0.44 per share. This marks
the eighth consecutive year of dividend increase for IFC's shareholders.
Before taking a look at our outlook for the industry in 2013 I want to make a few
comments on the performance of our personal lines businesses in the quarter. The 103%
combined ratio in personal auto is sure to raise some questions. So let me give you our
view of the quarter by describing some of the larger moving parts, starting in Ontario.
First, it is important to stress that there is no change to our view of the eﬀectiveness of the
Ontario reforms. For a number of quarters now we have indicated that although we saw
strong ﬁeld results in Ontario we maintain our prudent reserving approach given the level
of uncertainty in the environment. This was again the situation in Q4.
However, given the increased uncertainty regarding bodily injury claims, we increased our
provisions. Second, a court decision from this past fall further expanded the deﬁnition of
catastrophic impairment in accident beneﬁt. So reﬂecting this expanded deﬁnition
impacted current year results and led to a portion of the unfavorable development
recorded in the quarter. Despite this adjustment our Q4 accident beneﬁt loss ratio in
Ontario was slightly improved versus Q4 of 2011.
Turning to Alberta, a system that has been quite stable since its own reforms in 2004, we
have seen an increased level of activity on bodily injury ﬁles in litigation in recent months
while certain types of injuries became excluded from the minor injury cap. So given these
observations for Alberta, we prudently moved to stay ahead of this potential trend by

FINAL

increasing reserves for all accident years since the 2004 reforms, further contributing to
the unfavorable development experienced in the quarter.
Having recently held a number of discussions with our chief actuary and numerous claims
adjusters, I feel comfortable stating that we believe this quarter results are more the result
of a number of adjustments than a turning point in the recent solid performance of our
personal auto line of business. Despite the results in Q4, this business generated a fullyear combined ratio of 95.7% versus 90.9% in 2011. Importantly, excluding the impact of
cats as well as prior year development, the underlying loss ratio was unchanged from year
over year.
Moving to personal property, clearly a 67% combined ratio is not something that anyone
would expect. Looking at the 22 points loss ratio improvement versus the Fourth Quarter
last year illustrates that 11 points of the 22 points relate to higher favorable prior year
development, of which, in my view, a meaningful portion is one time in nature. The lower
level of cat losses represents a further 5 points, while the remaining 6 points relates to our
current accident year performance.

Bloomberg Transcript

For the full year of 2012 we reported a combined ratio of 93.5% despite more than 10
points of losses from cats. So adjusting for some nonrecurring favorable prior-year
development our results would have come in just above 95%, the minimum acceptable
for this line of business as I have mentioned numerous times before. So to me, clearly, our
actions are paying oﬀ but it is important to maintain our focus, in particular in the Alberta
market, given the continued challenging environment caused by severe weather events.
When it comes to our overall outlook for the industry, growth last year appears to have
played out largely as we anticipated. As the drivers behind this growth will likely continue
to impact 2013, we foresee similar growth in the coming 12 months. We expect low singledigit growth in personal auto as well as in commercial and upper single-digit growth in
personal property.
Risk to the upside exists in commercial P&C as broader signs of hardening are emerging
for an expanding portion of the market. The low interest rate environment should support
our outlook and will actually lead to ﬁrmer conditions over time.
From an underwriting perspective, the industry is tracking to about 97% combined ratio
after the ﬁrst nine months of 2012. So for 2013 we anticipate some improvement in
personal property, largely driven from the continued hard market conditions in that line of
business as well as potential loss mitigation actions. We do not foresee signiﬁcant change
in the loss ratio of personal auto while commercial lines should also remain relatively
stable.
Turning to the industry's ROE, we do not expect material improvement in the near term
from the 9% level at which it stood after three quarters. Although underwriting might
improve slightly, we anticipate this would be oﬀset by the negative impact on investment
income from the low yield environment.

FINAL

Looking speciﬁcally at Intact Financial, we believe we will continue to outperform the
industry's ROE by at least 500 basis points, our stated objective.
So Mark will provide updates on our two integrations in a moment. But overall I would say
that both are progressing quite well and, on many fronts, we would say better than we
expected. I am impressed with what has been achieved to date and I want to thank all our
employees from coast to coast for their hard work in ensuring that our customers and
brokers continue to receive what is, in my view, world class service.
In conclusion, I believe the importance we place on underwriting results will continue to
serve us well as the environment of low interest rates persists. Given the quality of our
operations, the ﬂexibility provided by our ﬁnancial position. And the additions of AXA and
JEVCO, we ﬁrmly believe that we will continue to outperform the industry and strengthen
our leadership position.
With that I will turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Tullis.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Charles. Today we announced strong operating income driven by underwriting
results. Earnings per share of CAD1.32 were more than double a year ago, reﬂecting
improved operating results, higher investment gains. And reduced acquisition-related
expenses.
On an adjusted basis, excluding the acquisition-related items, we recorded EPS of
CAD1.51, 32% higher than Q4 of 2011. Q4 marked the First Quarter with AXA in the prior
year comparable and was also the ﬁrst full year with contributions from JEVCO. Premium
growth of 7% was largely driven by the addition of JEVCO. But we also generated organic
growth at a low single-digit level.
Slides 10 and 11 show results by line of business. In personal auto the 9% growth in
premiums reﬂects the addition of JEVCO as well as organic growth. From an underwriting
perspective, the 10-point combined ratio deterioration is largely attributable to the
unfavorable prior-year development that Charles discussed.
The change in our underlying loss ratio, excluding cats and prior-year development, was 3
points, reﬂecting reserve actions as well as higher claims frequency in Alberta. Growth in
personal property of 3% was driven by higher rates. It is worth highlighting that the
JEVCO book included only a small amount of personal property business.
Underwriting results were exceptionally strong with several moving parts as Charles
described. Looking speciﬁcally at the current year loss ratio, excluding cats, we reported
results that were almost 6 points better than last year's very strong performance. This is
attributable to the relatively benign weather from a property perspective as well as
continuing eﬀorts to improve results in this line of business.

FINAL

The combined ratio in commercial P&C was relatively unchanged from the prior year and
commercial auto reported another very strong quarter with a combined ratio of 84.2%.
For the full year the commercial auto combined ratio was 81.5%, the ﬁfth consecutive year
with a combined ratio below 90%.
The expense ratio in total was 1 point higher in 2012 versus 2011. This change was the
combined eﬀect of an improvement in general expenses reﬂecting AXA-related expense
synergies oﬀset by an increase in commissions. This commission increase is due to mix
diﬀerences with a full year of AXA business as well as increased proﬁt commissions.
Keep in mind that a portion of commissions are variable in nature and are tied to
underwriting performance so that improvements in the claims ratio are partially oﬀset by
higher commissions.
On the investment side, net investment income of CAD102 million in the Fourth Quarter
was ﬂat versus a year ago as additional investments, primarily related to JEVCO, were
oﬀset by a decline in yields. Our market-based yield of 3.6% was down from 3.9% in Q4
2011. We expect the prevailing interest rate environment to essentially oﬀset the growth in
our investments in the coming quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our ﬁnancial position remained solid at the end of 2012 with an MCT of 205%, nearly
CAD600 million in excess capital. And book value per share of CAD33.03, 11% higher
than a year ago. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-total capital ratio of 18.9%, below
the target of 20%.
We have made good progress on both of our integrations. For AXA Canada, system
shutdown projects are well under way and we should be complete by the ﬁrst part of
2014. We maintain our CAD100 million after-tax synergy target and expect to largely reach
this run rate by the end of 2013 and the remainder when system shutdown is complete.
We estimate the run rate at CAD52 million at the end of 2012.
We continue to expect the JEVCO acquisition to be accretive to net operating income per
share in 2013. Annual synergies amounting to CAD15 million after-tax are expected from a
combination of external loss adjustment expense reductions, shared services savings,
reinsurance. And system-related cost savings. And we expect the run rate to be at this
level by the end of 2014.
In summary, we are pleased with the signiﬁcant progress made to date on both
integrations. We begin 2013 with a solid ﬁnancial position and excellent long-term
earnings power. These, combined with our disciplined approach to the business, provide
a strong foundation for continued growth.
With that I will turn the call back to Dennis.

Questions And Answers

FINAL

(Operator Instructions) Tom MacKinnon, BMO Capital.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good morning. Just a question with respect to the cat deﬁnition in
Ontario.
As I recall, the Fourth Quarter of last year you did a one-time kind of reserve increase in
light of a recent court decision then on an expanded cat deﬁnition. What's diﬀerent this
time that maybe has expanded a little bit further? And can you tell us about the process of
what you went through in terms of doing the reserve build?
Then can you talk about the outlook with respect to this cat deﬁnition? Any actions with
respect to FSCO in that regard and how long before we might see any kind of legislative
change in that regard? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

Good morning. So the process we have gone through is to look at our existing ﬁles and
see how many of these ﬁles would now qualify for the now weaker deﬁnition of the cat
impairment. The decision that had been taken was one where it now says that the spheres
of life that you have to be impacted on -- in the past you had to have two of these spheres
impacted; now it is only one. We could go through our ﬁles and see how much that would
impact our current portfolio of claims.
So we have made an adjustment of roughly CAD11 million in 2012 on this. The adjustment
that we have made in 2013 are to continue to reﬂect that weakened environment and also
what is happening in BI uncertainty that we see in BI.
Where we have -- what we see as an outlook is that FSCO, the committee that was
working on the proposed new deﬁnition of cat impairment, which would bring more
clarity, less disputes. And it would address this situation of the spheres of life that are
impacted. But also the case that was also made during the year which was around the
stacking of physical and mental disability.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Which is the case I think that Tom refers to in his question, the December 23 case decision
last year.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

Okay. So continue here. It sounds like the Ontario adjustment in the quarter then was
CAD11 million. So presumably the larger reserve adjustment must have been done in the
Alberta case. If you can just expand a little bit on that and what the outlook could be; how
you went through your book and what the outlook could be from a regulatory perspective
there.

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

What we see there in Alberta is that the level of activity in ﬁles and litigation is increasing.
The system is asking us now to negotiate more of these ﬁles and also some of the ﬁles
that have been -- up until now that have not come with reports in our ﬁles of a diagnosis
are now getting to that point.
It that has taken a long time for these ﬁles to get there so now we are seeing more activity.
And that is what we are reﬂecting in these past three months of the year. We have been
reﬂecting that increased activity. Now we are looking into how this will become a trend
and we'll certainly react if we -- in terms of our pricing conditions if this is warranted.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

And just to follow-up with respect to FSCO --?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Tom, I think in your question you asked about cats and accident beneﬁt in Ontario. Martin,
gave you the answer on cat. You concluded that the bulk was then coming from Alberta
and Martin gave you the answer in Alberta. But I think that in Ontario bodily injury ﬁles on
the tort side of the product has also been an area where we have made adjustments.
And I would say in the context of Ontario that is probably a larger adjustment than what
we have done on accident beneﬁt in Ontario to reﬂect this recent decision, which is, given
the sort of new deﬁnitions that are being considered, not a concern at this point in time.
In the context of Alberta, unlike Ontario there is, in the past two, three months so it is very
recent, hot oﬀ the press observations, there has been change in the ﬁeld. In the case of BI
Ontario we haven't seen much change in terms of what is being reported to us.
But in Alberta, as Martin mentioned, a number of court decisions have weakened the cap
on pain and suﬀering awards. This has driven a number of ﬁles that were outstanding
from the past to accelerate in the system and, as a result, we have taken a cautious stance
on all accident years in Alberta since 2004 to make sure that we were in good shape
there.
It is new information, to Martin's earlier point. And so when I think about Alberta clearly
pricing is on the table right now. In Ontario, there is no change in my view that warrants
pricing action in the short term. But in Alberta we are looking at our price adequacy and
we will decide in the coming weeks and months whether what we have observed is a
trend. And if it is, what the pricing actions will be.

So I think it is important to see these changes in the quarter or adjustments in the quarter
in three categories -- AB Ontario, BI Ontario. And BI Alberta. The one that looks more like
a trend, though it is very recent, is BI Alberta.

FINAL

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

And in terms of the size of the reserve builds, how would you categorize -- which one
would be the largest of those three that you took in the quarter?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think that the businesses don't have the same size, Tom. So I think in relative terms the
bigger adjustment was in relationship with Alberta BI where signs were here in the quarter
that change was taking place.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Then ﬁnally, what is happening with FSCO has got a new deﬁnition here in terms of the
cats. When does that actually become law, if you will, or when does that get passed
through the legislature?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

My take on this. And I forget if we talked about it in November or not. But we have seen
earlier this week that FSCO announced new anti-fraud measures, four of them. All steps in
the right direction. I think the cat deﬁnition is a bigger change and I believe that the
leadership change taking place will slow down the speed at which the cat deﬁnition might
be changed.
So in our view the cat deﬁnition can be an important lever to improve the cost of the
product in the system at this stage. Because there is leadership change, there is
uncertainty associated with that.

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

But when government was prorogued FSCO had already tabled that recommendation
with government and this was in the process of making some changes. So just to say the
process had already started there and it is a matter of this becoming again a priority in the
new government.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. Which at this stage is unclear, because we will have to see the priorities of the new
government.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Andre Hardy, RBC Capital Markets.

FINAL

Q - Andre Hardy
Thanks. Sticking to Ontario -- to automobile insurance in general. And you can choose to
answer it generally or isolate Alberta. But if you look at your current rates and assume that
the issues that led to the reserve increases continue, what is the magnitude of the impact
on ongoing proﬁtability?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So as I have mentioned, Andre, in Ontario -- when we talked about these change court
decisions last year we had talked about a range of 0.5% to 1% for the Ontario book of
business, which is about half of the Ontario auto. This most recent decision leaves us, I
think, in that range. In other words, doesn't really change our view materially of the
Ontario automobile market.
In Alberta, bear with me here because it is recent, it is very recent stuﬀ. But let's assume
that what we have seen in the quarter becomes a trend and let's assume that we don't
price for the trend, because in theory if we price for the trend, Andre, then nothing
changes.

Bloomberg Transcript

But let's assume we were not to price for the trend. I think that this could have on the
automobile portfolio between 1 and 1.5 points of impact on loss ratio. Now, clearly, if we
realize that this is a trend, then we will price for it to mitigate that impact.

Q - Andre Hardy
You are talking about 1, 1.5 impact on the Alberta loss ratio or the aggregate auto business
loss ratio?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Aggregate auto business loss ratio.

Q - Andre Hardy
Okay. Then my follow-on question is obviously you won't sit still if this becomes a trend.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Exactly.

Q - Andre Hardy
With the current structure of Alberta insurance do you believe you would be able to price
within the regulatory constraints to appropriately price for the new trend? Now I
understand there is a lag between writing and earning. But would you be able to do it?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}
Page 9 of 18



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

I think it is an important question. We will Martin tackle this one.

FINAL

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

And there is a portion of it; the latest change that was granted by the Alberta Insurance
Rate Board was 5% on mandatory coverages. So that piece we have not taken fully. So we
could take the remaining part relatively easily. There is a mechanism where we can ask for
an individual ﬁling if we think that this warrants more. But it is still early to determine how
much of that mechanism we would need.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So I think what is clear to us is that a portion of it we could take without approval,
basically. And if we felt we needed more than the room that exists today we would ﬁle
and try to get approval from the government to get to it.
So let's see if this becomes a trend. But we have observed that in the past few months.
When we see changes in the environment we are sort of on high alert and we will keep
you guys posted in the coming months.

Q - Andre Hardy

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks. I had another question on personal property. As you said, in spite of everything,
you actually had a pretty good year in personal property. Do those results change your
appetite to make the various rate and product changes that you talked about at your
investor day, particularly in Alberta?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No, not at all. I think that Alberta's performance in this case doesn't look like the average
performance of the book from coast to coast. So there is a lot of work to be done there.
I think, as I have mentioned before, for me home insurance, what we are looking for is a
sustainable bold below 95% performance. And while I am pleased with where we ﬁnished
the year, we have issues to ﬁx, in Alberta in particular. And we have to make sure the
product is sustainable, which calls for changes as well in how we price the product, how
we manage the claims operations, as well as prevention.
So our outlook, Andre, has not changed on what we think the industry will look like in the
coming 12 months.

Q - Andre Hardy
Thank you very much.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you. Good morning. So Charles, just in trying to quantify all the changes on the
(inaudible) book I think you mentioned there is three diﬀerent buckets that went through;
CAD11 million was broken out. And I calculate the total impact from the reserve
adjustments around CAD50 million. You've have broken out the CAD11 million.
Can you break out the diﬀerence between the other two buckets? And is my CAD50
million in the ballpark?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think that you have reserve movements in general, Doug, that would take place
regardless of those three buckets. While I don't think they are necessarily far, I mean these
are the three most important buckets. Martin highlighted the AB portion of it.
Then, between Ontario and Alberta, I would say Ontario of what was left was a little
higher. But then, as I have mentioned in the previous question, in relative terms the
bigger impact was on the BI Alberta portfolio in relative terms and compared to the
premium base of the Alberta market.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Well that gives me enough color.
The second question, you talked on the Alberta side just about your ﬂexibility potentially
to get rates if need be, if you do consider that recent developments as a trend. We know
Alberta is considering -- the Alberta Insurance Rate Board is considering regulating rates
across the entire product, not just the mandatory product.
So I am wondering what is your view if that were to be the case on your ability to get rates
and your outlook for just the Alberta market given some of the early trends that you are
seeing.

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

This is not going to happen in the short, short run so the changes that are being
contemplated in the system in Alberta are not going to be at least until the fall. The
industry-wide adjustment is going to take place this summer so we are not expecting that
there would be constraints on the optional side of the shop.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And I think that the upside I see with the change that has been contemplated, Doug, is
there will not be an industry-wide adjustment anymore. So there would be a regulation
across the product while right now it is largely on liability and accident beneﬁt. But then
you will be able to ﬁle individually as a company for what you are looking for. But as
Martin is saying, this is coming later.

FINAL

With regards to the outlook in Alberta, I must admit that when I talk about Alberta BI in
general terms like people have not seen this yet. So the impact on the outlook at this
stage is really diﬃcult to tell, because we seem to be the ﬁrst ones to have noticed that
there was a change there and we have taken action as a result.
But if people see what we have seen and if it repeats itself for another period, given how
tough home insurance is in Alberta, I expect the market to react to these sorts of
observations at the level that will be required to restore rate adequacy in that line of
business.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay. Then just lastly, I noticed just on the commercial side there was an uptick I guess in
large losses. Just wanted to see if you can provide some color. We have seen that happen
in past quarters; just wanted to see what occurred this quarter.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

We'll ask Alain.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

If you recall throughout the year, throughout the quarter, we had a surge of large losses
starting in the First Quarter which was slightly above average. Our Second Quarter fairly
stable average. Our Third Quarter was exceptionally low on large losses.
The Fourth Quarter we came back to be slightly above our average, maybe about 3, 4
points above our average large losses in the quarter, which brings our year pretty much in
line with what we have observed historically in the past. So it is more like random
ﬂuctuation from quarter to quarter that happened. It is not so much on the number of
losses. But we had one or two very large losses that had an impact on the dollar amount
in the quarter.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay. So more quarterly noise than anything. Thank you very much.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Good morning. Charles, just on the reserve development in personal auto you have done
real good job describing why it was unfavorable this quarter.
Assuming you have done the math correctly and you have been suﬃciently conservative
in setting up that additional reserve, would it be fair to assume that the model of positive
reserve development we have seen in prior quarters prior to this quarter we should just

return to the previous levels? Understanding there is a lot of volatility. But is that a fair
statement?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think that the fair statement in my mind is to say that the long term average is 3% to 4%.
We have seen a little more than that in the past. Depending on the evolution of the
Ontario product, we might see a little more than the long-term average because, as I have
mentioned in previous quarters, we have taken a cautious stance there.
So other than keeping that in mind, I would keep the long term 3% to 4% as what to
expect.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

And to be clear, you are talking about that on a total company basis, or were you
speciﬁcally referring to personal auto?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No. I was talking about total company basis.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So rather than give us some comfort on where the personal auto, you would rather
just keep it at that aggregate level then?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, I would rather keep it at the aggregate level. And I will say, Mario, that when you take
the picture at the end of the year we are wanting to make sure that we position ourselves
going forward to generate favorable development levels in line with the historical
average. And that is true by line of business as well.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

One sort of -- maybe this is just a technical thing. But your disclosure on the number of
written insured risks -- you don't include JEVCO in the number of written insured risks but
it is included in the direct written premium. The only line where that kind of has an -where that matters I think is in personal auto.
First, was there some technical reason why it was appropriate to include it in direct written
premium but not in the written insured, the number of written risks?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

So let me handle that. So a couple things. First of all -- so I think there is several things.
First of all, it will be included beginning the First Quarter. It was included in direct written
premium because it's a key metric and we can calculate it correctly.

Their basis for risks is diﬀerent than ours and, as of Q4, we were still on their system so it
would not have been an easy conversion to switch from their basis to our basis. So we
thought it was just cleaner to leave it out for now, reset it in Q1, report it going forward.

FINAL

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

That makes perfect sense to me. Then the question is maybe fairly straightforward then.
The change in the direct written premium per written insured risk, it looks like it is higher
than it probably should be because of this sort of temporary technicality. Could you help
me think through then what would have happened?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

I think one thing. And I think I had mentioned this in my comments, in personal auto a
good chunk of the 9% growth -- so if you look at JEVCO, of the 9% about 7% -- well, 5% in
total of the 7% was due to JEVCO. But if you look at personal auto alone more like
probably 7% of the 9% growth in premiums is due to JEVCO, because JEVCO was
overrepresented in the auto versus some of the other lines of business.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

So then if I pull that then would it would be fair to say that the change in direct written
premium per written insured risk would actually have been down? Essentially the pricing,
it would have been down year over year?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

The thing you need to be careful about, Mario, here is that there are important
distributional shifts by province taking place as a result of the AXA acquisition. Where
AXA had a huge Quebec automobile portfolio and as a result as you integrate the
business the average premium, because the weight of Quebec becomes bigger, is down
a bit. As we look through 2012 as we have integrated the business this had a big impact
on the mix.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

That makes sense.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Your analysis, are you doing it for the full year or just for Q4?

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Just for Q4.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Okay. Because the full year it would be extremely diﬃcult because of the mix changes.

Bryan Brown, Macquarie.

Q - Bryan Brown

{BIO 16358540 <GO>}

Thanks. With the Ontario auto the anti-fraud task force recommendations, once those are
implemented is that something that might make you less conservative in your reserve
positioning?

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

The measures are there to generate further savings. So that is something that we will
consider when they are implemented to reﬂect that in the way we transact our business.
But I would not say that these measures are creating uncertainty per se at the moment. I
think there is uncertainty if they are going to be implemented. But once they are -- I don't
think it creates uncertainty in the cost of the product at the moment that they are not.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

But I think the question comes from the fact that we have said before we are taking a
cautious stance, because in part there is an important mediation and arbitration backlog.
And so will this measure change our view? I think this largely will impact newly reported
claims or new claims.
These measures, there is four of them in particular. One of them would be requiring
insurers to provide -- or giving claimants the right to receive a bimonthly statement of
beneﬁts paid on their behalf; increasing the role of claimants in fraud prevention, that is
having them conﬁrm their attendance. Those sorts of things really will have an impact on
upcoming claims as opposed to what is in the backlog right now for mediation. So the
answer to your question I think is, no.

Q - Bryan Brown

{BIO 16358540 <GO>}

Got you.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

These are good steps, by the way. Steps in the right direction, which shows that the
government, even as the leadership is changing, is intending to curb fraud. I think these
guys really understand that the issue in Ontario is one of fraud. And I do believe that the
upcoming leader will be focused on that as well.

Q - Bryan Brown

{BIO 16358540 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. Just one last one. With JEVCO I noticed that rates in the quarter declined
quite a bit and I just wondered if that was necessary to maintain customers.

FINAL

The reason why the rates reported are changing is because a part of the portfolio will now
be considered as standard. So a portion of the JEVCO book is moving to the Intact
insurance manufacturing capability. So this is what is reﬂected there. But our nonstandard
JEVCO rates have not gone down.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Absolutely not.

Mario Mendonca, Canaccord Genuity.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

I will be fairly quick. Just is there -- we haven't talked about buybacks in sometime. And
previously when the conversations come up or the question has come up you said you
wanted to be a little more comfortable with the environment before you would
contemplate buybacks. Charles, is there any update to your thinking on that?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I will let Mark take a crack at it and I will comment afterwards.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Sure. Our capital plan remains the same, which is to maintain a strong capital base,
maintain and increase dividends every year, pursue growth opportunities internal and
external. And return capital to shareholders.
We just announced a 10% dividend increase. We are settling down from the acquisitions. I
think we will continue to evaluate, as we have in the past. But this quarter I think the focus
was on the 10% dividend increase.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think, Mario, you are absolutely right. When we talk about capital priority before getting
to making a decision on buyback you start with are you comfortable with your dividend
level? I think we have done that this quarter.

FINAL

Then the question is how do we feel about the uncertainty in the environment. And the
third question is do we see opportunities for us to use the excess capital. Right now we
have got close to CAD600 million capital.
I think that the uncertainty is there. There is a sense globally of greater comfort, though it
is not clear it is necessarily warranted. But the factor that would hold us from buying back
shares at this stage is that I do think that this is an environment that will present
opportunities within a reasonable period of time. And on that basis there is no buyback
activity at this stage.
But rest assured that this is a question that is debated every quarter depending on how
we feel about A) the environment and B) the opportunities to deploy the excess capital.
And I feel pretty good about the latter at the moment.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

That is helpful, thank you.
