Good day, and welcome to the Munich RE Q1 Results Conference. Today's conference will
be recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr.Becker Hussong.
Please go ahead.

Christian Becker Hussong
Thank you, Daniel. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our call on the Q1
earnings. I have the pleasure to be here with our CFO, Christoph Jurecka; and in just a
few seconds after my short introduction, I will hand it over to him. And he will give you just
a short overview and a few messages on our Q1 result, before we will then go right into
Q&A Christoph, please go ahead.

Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Well, thank you, Christian. It's a pleasure for me to present our Q1 results today. And as
Christian has said, I will start with some introductory remarks. With EUR 633 million in net
earnings in Q1, Munich Re had a good start to the year. This good result is based on a
solid underlying business performance and an investment result which is largely in line with
our expectations, also helped by some positive FX effects of EUR 58 million and a low tax
ratio of 16.2%.

We had a RoRaC of 9.9%, and the RoE totaled 9.1%. In Reinsurance, we are well underway,
executing our growth strategy. And the outcome of new April renewals showed some
positive momentum there. In primary, we continue to be on track with respect to our
strategy program. So overall we are fully in line with our financial targets 2019. As there
were some debates this morning about the operating income versus the net income,
please allow me some comments on the difference between the two because net
income wise, we are above the consensus, whereas operating there were some
differences.
If you look at the drivers, we see that many of the drivers have been capital market driven.
So, if you look in the operating, we are somewhat below, than the investment results so
capital market driven result is. This is one of the drivers here. The second one is in life
reinsurance that we had a technical effect based on interest rates in Australia to increase
our liabilities there.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the other hand in the nonoperating result, we had market driven effects, like FX, which
were also capital market driven which then increased the nonoperating and overall lead to
the achievement of the net income consensus result again.
And then on top we had, as I said positive FX developments but they are also not
independent from capital market developments, because the mix of our earnings,
depending on how we are performing on capital markets also is influencing the tax ratio
quite heavily. Having said that, my message would be, please don't overemphasize the
differentiation between net income and operating income, as many of the differences are
often capital market driven, and not all of them are consistently being accounted for in
operating or nonoperating.
And therefore, I'd like to somewhat maybe highlight the point that in our view, we are fully
in line with our target and also, fully in line with the guidance.
Having said that, I'd like to give some more flavor on some of the details of our result. I
quickly mentioned the investment result already. We had the decline in interest rates in
Q1, stock market increased and the spreads tightened. So overall from an asset valuation
perspective, a very positive quarter at the same time, US dollar and some emerging
market currencies depreciated, which was beneficial for us.
Thereby we were able to deliver an RoI of 2.9%, over the slightly reduced running yield
compared to 2018 as a whole. Our disposal gains are mainly on the fixed income side and
more than offset the write-downs and the losses in derivatives with both have been
largely related to equities.
Our drop in -- the drop in the interest rates is reflected in the reinvestment yields of 2.1%.
And this makes our outlook for the return on investment clearly more ambitious going
forward.
Coming to Life and Health reinsurance, our biometric experience is overall in line with our
expectations. We had some offsetting effect favorable development in Continental

FINAL

Europe, offsetting adverse development in Australia. So this is compensating each other.
All other regions have been performing very close to our expectations. Then in the
technical result, life and health, we see that the technical result including fee income is
somewhat light compared to 25% of the plan. This was driven by two other technical
effects, and I've been mentioning one of them already.
The first one is the shortening of the duration for our Canadian asset portfolio, which was
more than compensated for by positive impact on the investment result, which due to all
simplistic allocation method is mostly being seen in the P&C reinsurance segment. So this
is a kind of technical effect you have to keep in mind.
We'll continue with the shortening of the duration in the second quarter, so we will
probably talk about it again next time. The second effect on the technical income is the
drop the yield curve in Australia as mentioned before, which led to some strengthening of
the claims reserve but only interest related here.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then coming to P&C, Q1 combined ratio in P&C was 97.9%. So fully in line with our yearend outlook of 98%, no deviation here. We had a below-average major loss burn of 9.7%
this time, including negative one offs for large losses in the 5.1% percentage points in
total. This was the major loss effect. There's of course, a basic loss effect as well, basic
losses were higher than anticipated, and resulted in a normalized combined ratio of
around 100% according again to our very schematic calculation, which comes with, and we
discussed that last time already which comes with a very simplistic view on things. Driver
here is again large claims in our North American risk solutions business, and which fell
short the EUR 10 million major loss threshold. And therefore have not been normalized for.
And then on top of that commissions in Q1 have been higher than what we would expect
for the full year. And then going forward of course, we also expect some tailwind from
renewals in April and then also July, which then be earned in the following quarters.
Therefore for the time being an underlying combined ratio of much closer than 98 -- to
98% is remaining to be our aspiration for 2019 as a whole.
Then I mentioned, renewals already, April renewals have been pleasing. So the trends we
saw in January, continued. Prices were up for especially the markets where we saw risks
affected by the natural catastrophes. But also in the TPL markets, we saw some positive
stabilization.
Our price increases for the overall portfolio amounted to 1.4%. And the premium volume
rose by more than 10%, so we were able to seize opportunities in the two markets
especially in India and also in Japan of course. Primary insurance. We have the strong
earnings in life and health which offset the large losses on the P&C Germany side. Overall
ERGO is contributing EUR 85 million to our result and this is in line with our ambition of
EUR 400 million for the full year. If you take into account that Q1 includes disposal losses
of EUR 22 million, as a consequence of our portfolio optimization in the international
business.

FINAL

In Germany, the net result of life and health Germany of EUR 63 million, reflects a very
good performance, ongoing good performance in health. And a high level of gains to
finance the funding which we did to a large extent already in the first quarter. On the P&C
side in Germany, we saw a combined ratio of 98.1%. If we adjust that for above budget nat
cat and Man-made claims, it would be around 95%. And then looking at the regional
fluctuations, we generally always have in Q1, so there are supposed seasonality on claims
as well as on some premiums.
Then we see that the underlying combined ratio still supports the 2019 full year guidance
of 93%. Then Overall, I could say we see that Germany that the positive impact on life and
health Germany is offsetting the negative one in German P&C. So overall, it's nothing
really -- really help them a lot. In International business combined ratio is continuing to be
95.4% in a very attractive level, which is fully in line with our ambition of 95% for the whole
year.
We communicated last week that we're going to sell our Turkish entity which will lead to a
mid-double-digit million euro burden in Q2. This is of course not included yet in the Q1
account, just to be clear. However, this effect will neither affect our earnings outlook for
2019 and nor the ERGO targets for the strategy program 2020.'21. So this will be
compensated.

Bloomberg Transcript

Capitalization remains to be sound in addition to the solid Q1 net earnings. The capital
market developments led to significant increase in IFRS equity of more than EUR 2 billion.
And the ongoing share buyback had, of course an offsetting impact of very slightly
offsetting impact only, so IFRS capital increased substantially.
Solvency II ratio is around 250 percentage points now and also therefore higher than
where we were at year end. So also from debt side capitalization improved. And local cap,
we continued to have substantial headroom for further distributions so it is unchanged as
you noted already. We're going to start, for the next share buyback in a couple of weeks.
And as you know this should be completed then by the AGM 2020.
Finally outlook, the outlook is unchanged for the year. So, we are still aiming for the net
profit of EUR 2.5 billion and we are very confident of achieving that after the first quarter
fully supporting the outlook. Of course, as always provided that, there are no material
adverse developments on the large losses or capital markets front.
With that, I'd like to conclude my opening remarks. And of course, we'll be very happy to
take your questions now.

A - Christian Becker Hussong
Yeah. Thank you, Christoph for your opening remarks. We will now then start with the Q&A
and as usual, I would like to ask you to restrict yourself to a maximum of two questions
per person, and please go ahead.

FINAL

Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We can now take our first question, it comes from
Edward Morris of JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir. Please go ahead.

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. First, just a point of
clarification. I wonder if you could just help a little bit on the net cash disclosure that you've
given. So I think, you've mentioned that there's a negative impact on prior year of around
5.1%, and yes, the overall contribution from nat cat, so I'm just trying to understand it
would appear that there's a small positive contribution, current year contribution from nat
cat. So can you just explain that?

Bloomberg Transcript

And the second question just coming to renewals. I mean thinking about the experience
with jebi and the quite good price increases that you've seen as a response to that. Do
you feel now that the market overall is compensating you for risks taken and the losses
that you've incurred? And is there a way to think about the sort of return period for Jebi in
particular do you feel that the market is responding as it should? Thank you.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Well, thank you. On nat cat or general, let's talk generally about large losses. When we
disclose one-off, clearly this is always a mix of positive and negative effect. So there's
offsetting effects there and therefore Jebi is a large contributor. But that's of course not
all. And there if we might in any way, there are offsetting effects. So you're right. So the
explanation is the right one here.
On the renewals, price increases are pleasing indeed. So, I can confirm that. With return
periods, I would be cautious. Because if diversification is really part of our core business.
Although the way we calculate is not, we don't look at a single event and then wait for a
couple of years to earn it back, but it's -- more and that's how we do our underwriting as
well. It's look at the overall portfolio, and there are offsetting effects of course, between
different geographies otherwise, the business would be more one dimensional than it
actually is.
So therefore, it's -- I think, it's not the right way to on one single claim and then wait for a
couple of years to earn it back. On the other hand, we have to say that in the past, Japan
has not been performing so bad. So this was a part of the story here.

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Thank you.

FINAL

Operator
Thank you. We can now move along to our next question. It comes from Andrew Ritchie of
Autonomous. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi, there. I wonder Christoph, could you just clarify, how come the reinvestment rate
stayed stable Q1 versus Q4? Is that a reflection of -- I think you start to change the
reinvestment policy slightly more infrastructure and more long dated? Just clarify kind of
how it was achieved given the decline in benchmark, yields and spreads.
And secondly on life and health re, sorry, I'm a bit confused as to why -- what is the
reasoning behind the asset duration shortening for Canada? And I think the implication is
that this is an ongoing thing. Does that mean there's another earnings effect in Q2 or over
the rest of the year? Thanks.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Andrew, yeah. First of all reinvestment rate. You're right the interest rate environment has
become more difficult in Q1 than it was in Q4. So clearly, if you look only at the external
environment, the expectation, I agree to that, should have been that it should have been
smaller than what we saw actually saw because the actual development was stable.
If you then compare in detail what the investment activities have been, then you'll see that
of course, the specific assets we are investing into, they differ a lot between Q4 and Q1.
And this has to do with the books we are investing into. So it depends on where do, -- you
have reinvestment needs in a specific point in time.
Then of course, also the cash positions we're holding are different. You know that Q4 was
very much driven by derisking activities and Q1 is still at a considerable cash position for
preparing to pay the dividend, but so this also plays a role here. And then of course, as
that the investment universe depends on in which book for which liabilities you invest and
in Q1, we did invest in longer duration bonds, compared to what we did in Q4. So that's
part of the different asset selection if you want in Q1.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

The expectation, still that you can keep the running yield flattish for the year as a whole. I
think that's what the kind of expectation was at least for the reinsurance business.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Well, I think that's too early to say. I mean, we have three quarters of capital markets
development ahead of us. So I'd say, too early to say. What I mentioned before is that we
at this stage stick to our guidance of 3% ROI overall. But this has become more ambitious

FINAL

than it initially was, given the low interest rate -- or the lower interest rate environment we
are currently in.
Coming to life and health, re in Canada. So what we are doing here is basically improving
our ALM position, which has been substantial in the past. And that's that we are able to do
that it's a changed regulation, which regulation changed a year ago or so. And now, we
are in a position that we can reduce the asset duration to bring it closer to what we think
the right liability duration is, so reduce the mismatch here. And yes we started that in Q1.
but it will continue in Q2, but it's important to notice this, I think, you just saw that in the
documents. Anyway is that the overall earnings impact of that exercise is positive. So we
have a negative impact on the technical result and a positive impact on the investment
result, which is a couple of times higher than the negative impact on the technical side.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

But just so as to be clear though, the impact on the investment result is because you're
realizing positions. The actual ongoings earnings are lower?

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yes. Yeah. I think, yes, you're right. And at the same time if they are lower, we increase on
the liability side. So that's all related to each other, yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. So shouldn't affect the run rate technical and fee income in time, obeyed in May will
do again in Q2?

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

While in Q2, that might be another effect, which will then again be over-compensated by
the investment result. But on the long run, it shouldn't influence it.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Q - Analyst
Two questions. First just on the North America risk solutions. I think we -- when we heard
about they're kind of smaller large losses but I believe at threshold last year, They were
Page 7 of 16

FINAL

kind of accepted as being noise to some extent. Could you maybe talk about whether
we're still thinking about these as being noise or whether there's something else going
on and the actions you are taking on those?
And then in your statement, I think it was in the press release, you talked about growing
for the last six renewals in some areas. When do you think the kind of expansion and I
guess improving operational leverage story comes to an end for Munich Re? And any
thoughts around that would be really helpful. Thank you.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

All right, I did not really understand the second question, there was some noise. Could
you maybe please repeat that?

Q - Analyst
Yeah, sure in your media statement you talked about areas that you've grown in the last
six renewals. And it feels like there's been a little bit of a change in -- I guess
management stance on growth since the beginning of last year. Could you maybe talk
about when you think that appetite comes to an end, the appetite to grow premiums and
find new areas comes to an end?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Okay, now I got it. Thank you. I'll start with the first question on the risk solution business
and maybe I'll start with giving you some more flavor on what's really going on there,
because maybe this will also help in your assessment, if this is really noise or anything
else. We again and as I mentioned before saw some higher claims still below our outlier
threshold. What we did see with -- the accumulated midsized man-made losses there, we
did see weather related losses from the record cold winter especially, in the U.S. Midwest.
So the European measure of minus 40 degrees centigrade. I cannot spontaneously
translate it now in the U.S. Measure, but it was really cold, which led to the fact that the
homeowners had losses on frozen pipes and so on. But this was really extreme.
And then we had some tornadoes in March, that also remained below the outlier
threshold and so impacted the large loss performance, but was not normalized. So those
are the claims effects we're talking about here. Where -- adequate underwriting and
pricing actions are already underway to address the performance in certain sub segments
where they're necessary. But technical measures, it takes some time until they fully earn
into the portfolio. So things are being addressed or have been addressed already.
But some of -- and then you can understand that the very, very cold winter also some of
tornadoes that it's clearly something which has to do with noise with volatility. So that's not
really a structural topic. Where are -- where -- in cases where we have some structural
issues, they have been addressed and over time, we expect improvement to eat into the
portfolio. That's the risk solutions. The growth appetite -- I mean as long as we can write
profitable business, our appetite continues to be high. So, I don't see why we should stop
that, given that we still find pieces of really attractive and profitable business out there.

FINAL

And as you can see also with the price development, we have been showing now for the
1st of April renewal.
I think, this is a good signal and a good proof of -- that there is profitable business out
there. So at this stage and this is part of the strategy, also for our 2020 results. The
growth strategy is continuing and will continue. Finally, coming maybe back once to the risk
solutions, what I would like to add outside of the specific issue, I'd like to maybe draw
your attention a little bit on the order of magnitude we are talking about here. This is a
very small subsegment in our overall book and any large loss we could have from cat or
from man-made would quickly be bigger the issue we are talking about here.
So I understand, it's something where there has been a lot of debate around. But the
issue itself is important as it is. So, I don't say it's not important. But the size is still limited.
That's something I wanted to add. Yeah, that's it.

Q - Analyst
Thank you.

A - Christian Becker Hussong
Thank you. Daniel, next question please.

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
Thank you. We can now move along to our next question, is comes from (inaudible). Your
line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Analyst
Yes. Good morning, everybody. Thank you very much. Just quickly, so Christoph, I know
you said risk solutions is small, but seems to be the biggest explanation between the 98
and the 100 of being sort of -- I know, you don't like normalized calculation being too
simple, but just the way it is. It seems to be important up to two points. Could you just in
that background comment on the new initiative which was announced recently of the
Munich Re specialty insurance company.
So with -- I remember in the full year results, there was this push to get a bit more growth
there or a bit more emphasis was placed and are these loss effects that we are talking
about today are these in similar areas or in completely different, as you said
homeowners? Or -- if you could just comment in that context it would be very helpful for
me. Thank you. That's my only question. Thank you.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yeah, just I'm very happy to do. So the area of losses is a different one. As I said, the very
cold winter affected our homeowners business for example, which we write with
American modern. So that put some of the areas, we are looking here in this risk solution
part now.

Company Ticker: M UV2 GR Equity
Date: 2019-05-08

The idea with our new entity in New York was to generate more growth out of the
commercial -- in the commercial area. But that's a really a different story. Coming back to
your question 98 versus 100. And sorry, I have to say again, that I don't like this very
simple normalization. I think part of the story also, is that, I mean, we normalized against
the 12% average nat cat charge, which is a full year average figure. So there's on top of
that also, seasonality in that normalization approach. And that also might play a role. So
you will probably remember that generally Q1 is the quarter where we at least in recent
years did have less cat activity than in other quarters. And maybe that's the missing link
you are looking for in your equation. So generally it just we can only reemphasize that this
very simplistic calculation, is just giving hints on where to look into in the portfolio. That's
how we use that. But it shouldn't be over interpreted.

Q - Analyst
Sure. And any of your sense at the risk solutions problem or losses are they different from
the ones that were seen in 3Q '18 or is it similar again? Would you be able to
contextualize that for us?

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Well, tornadoes are kind of similar, both storm, we have the very cold winter is something
we of course did not see last year wildfire is also different. So in the sense that some
similarities that's all kind of cut related, but below the threshold. So that's the similarity
here but the driver behind, it has been different every quarter.

Thank you. We can now move along to our next question. It comes from Sami Taipalus of
Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Yeah. Perfect. So I've just had some issues with my phone today. So, first question is
actually coming back to your growth ambitions. Could you just give us an -- I guess at one
part of them at least has been to expand the business in the U.S. and I suppose property
and nat cat exposure for example. So it'd be great to just give an update on your
expectations ahead of June and July renewals. How confident are you on the market

Page 10 of 16



Company N ame: M uenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG in M uenchen

environment? And what sort of thing could we expect from you here on the growth front?
So that's number one.

FINAL

Number two is coming back to risk solutions. Obviously there is quite a lot of loss
experienced there. Could you comment on the pricing side. What you're seeing in terms
of pricing momentum in that business? It's quite a heterogeneous exposure. So if you
could maybe break it down a little bit by the segments that would be great. Thank you.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Well. Thank you. On the renewal, I mean generally of course, it's extremely early now to
talk about that. You know that U.S. business has been loss affected last two years. So
there should be some momentum. And generally, I'm an optimist, so from that
perspective, I'm looking with kind of optimism towards July. But having said that, it's really
too early to really tell.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Sorry, just can I just follow-up very briefly on that? Have you -- so I think, you were
somewhat confident on the right momentum earlier in the year. Have you changed your
mind at all recently? Or does it remain sort of unchanged versus earlier in the year?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

No. We remain to be confident. That's also what I meant when I said I'm an optimist here.
Maybe also looking at it, I mean, we of course -- If you're talking about cat growth, of
course, we are also balancing that in the course of our overall risk strategy and the overall
risk capital review we are deploying. So that was something Joachim talked about in our
analyst conference that the overall risk, it's not over proportionately increased, but
increased in line with premiums.
And so, we are really careful in looking also into diversification and the mix overall. But
other than that from an environment perspective, I just can confirm that we are confident.
Coming back to your question on risk solutions. Yes, measures have been initiated. Also
on the pricing side, also on the portfolio level, where necessarily we have increased. We
have filed price increases in various states some of them high double-digit amounts on
for specific, or some specific risks. Therefore those measures have been as I said,
implemented. It always takes some time, if they -- until they fully eat into the portfolio and
come to their full effect. But yes that's something we have been doing already.

Q - Analyst

FINAL

I think, I have just one question regarding the German P&C business. I mean, you've again
grown quite strongly in Q1 mainly in industrial lines. So overall what does it mean for your
mid-term combined ratio targets? And more importantly do you expect also higher
volatility in the future?

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean to start with the end of your question, so the mid-term target is completely
unchanged. So we said 92% for 2020, 93% for this year. We had a first quarter which was
affected by large losses, but mostly on the cat side, so this was mostly the Storm
Eberhard in Germany, which led to the large outlier behavior we saw here for ERGO.
We also were a little bit above budget for the man-made -- on the man-made side but to
a much lower extent on the cat side. So therefore, the Q1 shouldn't be interpreted in a
way that some changed business mix did somehow change also the combined ratio we
are seeing right now. Also the growth, it needs some time, until it eat the portfolio.
And therefore, I mean, we saw that now in Q1 that the profitability of the P&C Germany
segment was positively influenced by the growth and the lines we are writing and the
business we are writing, we are very confident that this is profitable business. So it will
further support achieving our combined ratio target. But as I said at the beginning, we
confirm the 93% for this year, and the 92% for next year.

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We can now move along to our next question. It comes
from Jonny Urwin of UBS Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Alright. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one from me. So today please.
So just going back to the normalized combined ratio in the context of recent growth
initiatives. And I appreciate your comments that we shouldn't overinterpret the normalized
combined ratio and I appreciate, the flows in doing that.
But just stepping back from the detail. Since you've started to focus more on growth, the
normalized combined ratio has consistently missed guidance. And I know, you might say
this is an overly simplified view. But if that trend continues, at which point do you start to
worry? Thanks.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

I personally wouldn't see a relationship between in timing, between one and the other. So
this is obviously something which happened, but there's no connection between the two.

FINAL

Thank you. And so I guess it's difficult, isn't it? Because that's the way the market typically
assesses your underlying levels of profitability. We don't really have a better way of doing
that. But I guess how else can you give us confidence that the underlying profitability of
that growth is developing in line with your estimates, which I guess is implicitly what you're
saying?

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, that's always difficult to differentiate. I mean, what we then would need to
give you is really on a portfolio level, kind of a normalized combined ratio, differentiating
in the growth initiatives versus the force. I mean, that starts to be then really messy. If we
would go into more detail there therefore, generally we continue to have this concept of
a normalized combined ratio, because I think, everybody is used to it, and so it's at least
one way to address topics, and have the right topics also now for the call, for example, to
talk about. So from that perspective, I think the concept is not that bad, but it can be
misleading sometimes. And maybe one thing is the underlying view, but the other is, of
course, you should also look at our large loss development. And that also I mean, the
level we are affected is varying from one quarter. In one Quarter there's some volatility in
it clearly, but overall our budgets generally are high enough also this quarter again, we are
below, what we would say is our large loss budgets.

Bloomberg Transcript

So therefore, I think looking on the performance of P&C only on a normalized basis is
clearly cutting out the underwriting efforts, which were especially relevant in the area of
large losses. And so that's also part of the equation.
On top of that also business mix questions play a role and growth, in areas where we still
make some money, but the combined ratio is comparatively high. We would continue to
do that. Even if our 98% or 97% for next year would be at risk then, because we will still
make money with it. Therefore, we always said that the combined ratio per se is an
aspiration that we would like to achieve. But the target is the net income target and that's
continuing to be the main target for us.
So therefore, I think there's not one single answer to your question, but I'd like to invite
you to not only look at to the normalized view, but in a broader context on our P&C
business, because there's much more to recognize and much more also to evaluate when
assessing the quality of our business.

Q - Analyst

FINAL

Yes. Good morning. I've got two remaining questions. One will be on the ERGO
international accumulation portfolio process. So following turkey, could you remind us,
what remains to be optimized at this point in time?
And the second question would be really 3Q life and health re in Australia. You're to
reserve strengthening linked to lower interest rates, but seems to be that trends in the GI
market remains pretty adverse and you had some negative development in the past. So
could you update us on what the situation as far as your business is concerned in Australia
at this point in time? Thank you.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, very happy to do so, I'll start with ERGO international, yeah, we Turkey last week. And
basically from a signing perspective that very much marks the end of our portfolio
optimization activities. Closing of the transactions -- of some of the transactions is still to
be expected in the remainder of the year, and therefore also P&L effects for example
from Turkey we expect for Q2. So there will be some discussion around that, also in the
upcoming quarters.
But from a signing perspective, so signing the SPAs, we have pretty well advanced, and
nothing really on top of that to be expected. Life and health re, indeed there are risks in
Australia, which we have to mention. So this time the increase of the claims provisions was
interest rate driven and of course further decreasing interest rates would put again a
pressure on these reserves. But this is not the only risk we are seeing in Australia, there
are of course clearly also risks on the biometric side. The protecting Your Super regulation
now has been finalized. We did write out -- write off a huge portion of debt in 2018 due to
that regulation. But now it has to be seen if the assumptions we took end of 2018, if they
will be realized now after this regulation has been finalized. There is clearly risk, but this is
not. So we will have to carefully observe that. We do an view of the biometric side on a
yearly basis. There are also potential which we then would need to recognize.
So I could continue. So there clearly are risks. And so going forward, what can we do we
work a lot on claims management, and all together with our clients there, this is actually
difficult and really time-consuming work, but we invest a lot there. We practically do not
write any new business anymore. And at this stage also we do not see any additional
regulatory issues or anything of that kind. So that's what we do right now.
Finally, I cannot rule out that further risks will be realized at this stage. We try to be on top
of things as much as we can. But Australia keeps -- continues to be an area of focus for us
clearly.

Q - Analyst
Okay. Thank you.

Thank you, sir. We can now move along to our next question. It comes from Michael Hieke
of Commerzbank. Your line is open, sir. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Michael Hieke
Thank you very much. Good morning to everyone. Two questions. I have to come back on
the -- to the basic losses which you said were very high, it includes many small claims
across many lines of business I understand that. And aside of what you said about risk
solutions, can you identify any other trend or anomalies, anything special which drives this
high basic loss ratio? You mentioned that risk solutions overall plays only a minor role in
terms of size.
Second, April renewals. Can you talk a little bit more about the dynamics of the April 1
renewals, what lines of business you moved in and what business you may have stopped
writing or retreated from?

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, basic losses, the major driver for the deviation are also not huge, not big that's what
I've said before, it's still risk solution business, so other than that, we do not see any
deviation, we would need to comment on today. The renewal -- yes first of all, of course,
cat business in Japan was something which came in with higher prices specifically on the
wind side. So there, we see the reaction on the typhoons, other than that we see -generally, we see growth in India.
We see some growth also in aviation. We see some growth also in the U.S. So that's
where we see growth. And but then on top of that, we also reduced our stake, wherever
we thought conditions are not sufficient or prices are not sufficient. So there are selective
conflicts more or less everywhere, where we discontinued our business, because we
were no longer happy with the price or the terms. I think that people that like to comment
here. Mainly casualty which improved, but we also saw some tendency on the liability side
for stabilization or slight improvement, but that's the general picture.

Q - Michael Hieke
Okay. Thank you very much.

{BIO 17918548 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you very much. Hi, Christoph. Back on Australian disability, thanks for the
qualitative comments you just gave. Can you just maybe clear up how we should scale this
exposure? I mean are you leaving us with the message that, yes, it's an issue, but there is
no chance that it can affect your EUR 500 million technical result guidance? Or could it

Page 15 of 16

actually be more material than that? So how to just think about the exposure, you've got
to that problem. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

I can only say, we are very confident of achieving the EUR 500 million this year, outside of
any exceptional effects and we do currently not foresee anything exceptional in Australia,
nor in other places. But if I remind you, that's a general remark, really nothing concrete in
the pipeline. But a general remark would be of course, if we capture something like that,
clearly would have an impact on IFRS, and this would then potentially change the picture.
But at this stage nothing concrete in the pipeline, and so nothing to announce and we
completely confirm our EUR 500 million target.
