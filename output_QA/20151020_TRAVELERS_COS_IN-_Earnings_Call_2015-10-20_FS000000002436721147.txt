Business Highlights
YTD Performance
• By now, you’ve seen our third quarter results and, as you can see from the release, it was a terrific quarter that
adds meaningfully to our very strong 2015 YTD performance
• We reported operating income of $918mm and an impressive operating return on equity of 16.2%, bringing our
YTD results to more than $2.5B in operating income and a nearly 15% operating return on equity

• We achieved these results through very strong underwriting performances across all of our business segments,
and solid investment performance consistent with our expectations

Cost of Capital
• Our long-term average annual operating return on equity stands at 13.4%, well in excess of our cost of capital and
since 2006 we have returned a total of more than $33.5B in capital to our shareholders
• Remarkable numbers, and we couldn’t be more pleased
• We have shared with many of you that one of our missions over the last couple of years has been to identify that
which we do right, and institutionalize those behaviors to make sure that they have continuity and will continue
to contribute to our absolute as well as our relative superior performance

Workers Comp Claim
• Some of those behaviors are obvious and they include things like our remarkable expertise in workers comp
claim handling, which certainly provides Travelers with a relative competitive advantage
• But as I reflected on this quarter’s earnings, as well as the string of quarters that we’ve put together over the
recent past, my hypothesis is that the competitive advantage of analytics, risk selection and pricing
management have had a meaningful effect, particularly cumulatively
• I can’t prove it to you because I don’t know what our results would have been if we weren’t as good as we are,
but I do believe that one of the important factors that has led us to produce industry-leading returns is the fact
that we have managed the changing rate environment over the last five years as effectively as we have

Capital Management Policy
• Everybody understands that our capital management policies have added to those returns and that analysis is
easy to do
• But I am a believer that the numerator in that calculation has been positively impacted, and will continue to be
so by the way we have managed renewal rate, retention, and capital allocation across our accounts

DNA
• I am certain that it has mattered, and you should know that the commitment to analytical insight that produces
these advantages is very much a part of the DNA of this place
• In short, the place is in great shape
• It was another impressive quarter
• It’s business as usual and it feels like the perfect time to be conveying the leadership to the next generation

• It was a great quarter and, speaking for the next generation, we’re very grateful to be stepping in when things are
in such great shape
• Thanks for that, Jay, and congratulations
• I’ll share just a few thoughts this morning before Brian and Doreen take you through the segment results, and let
me start with Personal Insurance
• We’re about two years into Quantum Auto 2.0 and the results have been excellent
• Our initial loss experience is in line with our original estimates while the take-up of the product has been better
and faster than we had anticipated
• It’s nice to see the Agency Auto policy count in premium growing
• Very well done and congratulations to the team

Segment Results
• In Business and International Insurance and Bond & Specialty, we posted excellent results
• We’re pleased to see production in the quarter that reflects a continuation of the trends we’ve been seeing all year
• Very high and consistent retentions reflective of a stable marketplace and steady renewal premium increases at
levels that are reflective of healthy returns
• These results are consistent with the messaging we’re giving to our field organization, which is to retain those
accounts that are meeting our return expectations and to try and improve the profitability on those accounts that
don’t

Middle Market Business
• In that regard, in our Middle Market business, we continue to be successful in improving the written margins on
our quintile four and five business
• As you’ve heard us say many times, including in Jay’s commentary this morning, we manage on a very granular
account by account or class by class basis, and given current returns, that blends to very high retentions and
stable renewal premium increases

Summary
To sum it up, the operating and production results over the past nine months are very encouraging and, taken together
with our relentless focus on execution and deep and talented management team, give us great confidence in our ability
to continue to – to deliver superior returns

Jay S. Benet
Financial Highlights
Performance
• As you heard from Jay and Alan, we’re very pleased with our third quarter results; operating income of $918mm,
up from $893mm in the prior year quarter and operating return on equity of 16.2%, up 100BPS from last year’s

third quarter
• Current operating income was driven by a very strong consolidated combined ratio of 86.9%, which was 3.1
points better than the prior year quarter
• This improvement resulted from the continuation of very strong current accident year underwriting
performance along with higher net favorable reserve development

Operating Income
• Operating income was also driven by solid net investment income, which was consistent with our expectations,
although lower than the very strong prior year quarter
• Fixed income NII of $422mm after-tax was down $32mm from the prior year quarter, principally due to what
we’ve been saying for many years now
• Securities that had higher book yields have run off during the past 12 months and have been replaced with
securities having lower yields due to the current interest rate environment

Asbestos Direct Action Litigation
• Another contributing factor to lower fixed income NII was the modest reduction in average investments that
resulted in part from the company’s $579mm first quarter 2015 payment to settle the Asbestos Direct Action
Litigation
• Non-fixed income NII of $68mm after-tax was down $53mm from a very strong prior year quarter, primarily due
to lower private equity and hedge fund returns
• Private equities and hedge funds produced NII of $35mm after-tax this quarter as compared to $79mm after-tax
in the prior year quarter

Business and International Insurance
• As I mentioned, earnings continue to benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development, which amounted
to $199mm pre-tax this quarter, $86mm higher than the prior year quarter
• In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $49mm pre-tax resulted from better than
expected cat and non-cat weather related losses in our Property business for recent accident years, better than
expected loss experience in GL for 2005 through 2013, and workers comp for 2005 and prior and in our
Canadian operations, partially offset by $224mm pre-tax increase to our asbestos reserves

Costs
• The asbestos reserve increase related to a broad number of policyholders and was driven by higher estimates for
projected settlement and defense costs for mesothelioma claims than we had previously assumed
• Notwithstanding these higher cost estimates, our overall view of the underlying asbestos environment is
essentially unchanged from recent periods

Bond & Specialty Insurance
• In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $103mm pre-tax was concentrated in Contract
Surety and Fidelity for 2008 through 2013

• Partially driving this favorable development was a reduction in outstanding exposures related to the financial
crisis of 2007 and beyond

Personal Insurance
• And in Personal Insurance, net favorable development of $47mm pre-tax resulted from Homeowners & Other
liability for 2013 and 2014, and Auto liability for 2012 through 2014
• On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs and excluding A&E, there were no accident years or product
lines that had any meaningful unfavorable development this quarter or YTD

Operating Cash Flow
• Third quarter operating cash flows were very strong at $1.8B, while holding company liquidity, which included
the proceeds from our August 25 issuance of $400mm of 4.3%, 30-year senior debt, ended the quarter at over
$2B, well above our target level
• The proceeds from this debt issuance will be used towards retiring $400mm of debt that is maturing on December
1 of this year

Capital Ratios
• Our debt-to-total capital ratio of 23%, or 21.9% adjusted for the retirement of the December 1 maturity, was well
within its target range, and all of our other capital ratios were at or better than their target levels
• Net unrealized gains were approximately $2.2B pre-tax, or $1.4B after-tax, down from $3B and $2B,
respectively, at the beginning of the year due to higher rates that were driven by spread widening

Ongoing Capital Management Strategy
• Nonetheless, book value per share of $79 grew 2% from the beginning of the year and, importantly, adjusted
book value per share of $74.35, which eliminates the impact of unrealized investment gains, grew by 5% during
this time period
• We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses and, consistent with our
ongoing capital management strategy, we returned $939mm of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter
through dividends of $189mm and common share repurchases of $750mm, bringing total capital return to
shareholders to almost $2.8B YTD

• Although, as we have discussed previously, new business flow was somewhat lower than we would like as a
result of strong retentions across the industry

Q3 Results
Net Written Premium
• Turning to the financial results, operating income for the quarter was strong at $546mm, while the combined ratio
was 92.2%
• The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior-year reserve development, was
92.5% for the quarter, an improvement of about 2.5 points y-over-y, driven primarily by favorable
non-catastrophe weather losses
• Looking at the top line, net written premiums for the segment were up a point y-over-y
• Domestic Business Insurance premiums were up 4%, driven by changes in the timing and structure of some of
our reinsurance treaties in prior quarters, which primarily impacted our first-party businesses and property lines

Domestic BI Production Trends
• Turning to Domestic BI production trends, we remain pleased with the continued execution of our very granular
pricing strategy
• As we’ve been saying for some time, given the attractive returns that we are generating in this business, our focus
continues to be on retention
• And accordingly, we are very pleased that retention remained at 84% for Q3 in a row
• In addition, as Alan mentioned, we continue to seek and are able to get price increases where needed
• Overall renewal premium change came in at 3%, with renewal rate change consistent with Q2
• New business of $444mm was down somewhat compared to both the prior year and recent quarters, reflecting the
market dynamics I mentioned earlier

Other Business Insurance
• Looking at each of our individual Domestic businesses, the production story is generally consistent with what I
just described
• I would, however, bring your attention to Other Business Insurance
• As we mentioned last quarter, renewal rate change for this business has turned negative, driven by the National
Property business
• But even here, it’s a very positive overall story, with strong returns, retentions in the low 90s%, and pricing that
is slightly negative but stable
• Excluding National Property, renewal rate change for Other Business Insurance remains positive and down only
slightly from Q2

• Turning to International, net written premiums were down 19% primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign
exchange
• Excluding this impact, International net written premiums were down 6%, driven by highly competitive market
conditions at Lloyd’s, reflective of global economic pressure on the marine and energy lines

Lloyd’s Business
• In terms of production, retention remained strong
• Renewal premium change turned slightly negative due to about a point and a half of negative exposure change
resulting from the lower line sizes that we have taken in the Lloyd’s business
• The rate change component of renewal premium change was a little more than a point positive

Canada
• In Canada, renewal premium change continued to be positive
• New business was down somewhat q-over-q, with half of the decline driven by the impact of foreign exchange
and the remainder driven by Lloyd’s
• So all in, we continue to feel great about the performance across the segment
• Returns continue to be attractive and stable, and we remain pleased with the granular execution of our strategy

Doreen Spadorcia
Q3 Highlights
Performance
• Please forgive me for having a scratchy voice
• I apologize to all of you
• Bond & Specialty Insurance had another quarter with exceptional financial results
• We feel terrific about the fundamentals that drive these results:
• Disciplined underwriting execution, aggressive management of risk and limits, the continued enhancement of
underwriting analytics, strong account and agency relationships, and superior claims management

Operating Income
• Operating income for the quarter was $196mm, an increase of almost 20% from Q3 2014, driven by better
underlying underwriting results and higher net favorable prior-year reserve development
• Third quarter underlying combined ratio of 76.1% for the segment improved by 5.6 points from the prior year
• About half of this improvement was due to favorable re-estimation of losses in Management Liability
• Underlying underwriting results remain very strong and well within our target

Net Written Premiums
• As for top line, net written premiums in the aggregate were up slightly from 2014
• Surety was 3% higher, primarily attributable to Middle Market construction accounts
• And across our Management Liability businesses, we drove to a higher retention of 87% and improved new
business from the prior-year quarter
• So all in all, another great quarter for Bond & Specialty

Personal Insurance
• I’ll turn now to Personal Insurance, where we once again produced strong underwriting results in both Agency
Auto and Agency Homeowners & Other
• We continue to be exceptionally pleased with the growth in our Auto book and are very encouraged with the
continued momentum we’re seeing in Homeowners
• For the segment, operating income for the quarter was $241mm, a slight increase from Q3 2014
• The underlying combined ratio was strong at 85.2% and benefited from generally benign losses in Homeowners
• On a run rate basis, the segment continues to perform in line with our long-term return goal

Agency Auto
• Looking specifically at Agency Auto, we continue to be very pleased with the profitable growth we are
generating
• Top line results remain strong, driven by both new business and retention, and underlying margins continue to
run in line with expectation, and in a range we’re comfortable with
• The combined ratio for the quarter was 93.9% and included almost 2.5 points of favorable prior year reserve
development
• Similar to the last couple of quarters, the favorable prior year reserve development was driven by better than
expected severity in bodily injury
• The underlying combined ratio of 96.2% was essentially flat to the prior year results

Loss Trends
• As for loss trend, our view of frequency in severity remains consistent with recent quarters
• We are certainly aware that there’s a lot of discussion in the industry about trend, particularly increasing
frequency
• While we may observe normal fluctuations in any particular period, due to things like weather, we
currently are not seeing any meaningful change in our overall frequency trend
• As always, we continue to monitor external data and our own results very closely, but as I said, our view of
overall loss trend remains consistent with recent quarters, at around 3%

• As for Agency Auto production, retention of 83% has trended up meaningfully from the beginning of 2014,
and remains consistent with recent periods
• New business premium of $218mm was more than 30% higher than Q3 2014
• We continue to grow policies in force, which increased by almost 50,000 during the quarter
• Net written premiums increased 10% from the prior year quarter
• So again, by all measures, great results for Auto for the quarter

Agency Homeowners & Other
• Turning to Agency Homeowners & Other, we once again had strong financial results with an underlying
combined ratio of 71.5%, driven by benign loss experience, both in weather and non-weather
• This result is somewhat higher than the prior year quarter due to last year’s losses being even more favorable than
this year
• Run rate margins in this business remain well within our expectations

New Business Premium
• As for Agency Homeowners production, we are very pleased with the progress we’re making
• New business premiums were up 28% from the prior year quarter and continue to trend favorably, while
retention remained strong at 84%
• Policies in force have leveled off sequentially for the last two quarters, and net written premiums, when
adjusted for the timing and structure of certain reinsurance treaties in prior period, were essentially flat from
the prior year quarter
• As we said in previous calls, this is an area of high focus for us, and we’re encouraged with the positive results
we’re seeing to date
• So, to sum up Personal Insurance, another great quarter

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Yes. Just a numbers question; I think you said on the call and I missed, there was some current
year development I think in the Management Liability side. Could you just give me that number again? I’m sorry I
missed that.
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: The number is about $10mm and that’s generally due to Fidelity and Crime and I’ll just tell
you we had favorable reserve development in prior accident years and that indicated to us that 2015 will perform better
than we originally projected.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: That’s helpful. And then I guess bigger picture on the development, which just continues to be
such an incredible source of earnings and so resilient, can you talk maybe broadly, Doreen, about the claims
environment, what you’re seeing and what you’re not seeing, certainly on the liability side?
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: So you’re moving out of Surety then at this point.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Correct.
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: Okay. I think we tend to see a pretty stable environment in general liability. And there were
things that we were thinking might impact that, whether it was people, higher unemployment rate and we might see

more liability claims. And we thought maybe if people also were in the financial crisis that we thought jury awards
might go up, we didn’t see any of that.
The litigation rates are pretty consistent. We don’t have less or more of that and it’s performed pretty much, I would
say, better than we thought it would have during the really tough years. For us, in certain lines it’s due to particular
things. We had some areas where we had fewer large losses; others, we might see the opposite of that, but to us, the
legal environment has performed pretty well. It’s not what we would have expected politically, either.
<Q - Larry Greenberg>: And I guess before a question, given that Alan is stepping in very shortly, Jay, I just want to
congratulate you on an incredible career and legacy, and certainly wish you the best of luck in the future. You’ve really
been a leader for Travelers, but also the industry and have created some phenomenal value for your shareholders and
taught a lot of people about the value of prudent capital management. And you’ve been generous and patient in
answering our sometimes inane questions and certainly sharing your industry insights, and I just want to thank you
personally for that. And I’m sure many others on the call feel the same way.
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: Well, Larry, thank you. As I say over and over, I’ve been so fortunate to be surrounded,
I’m sitting at a table here, with what I think is the most thoughtful, smartest, most committed management team I’ve
ever been around. It’s really quite remarkable, and when you’re surrounded by people like this, it just isn’t nearly as
hard as it may seem, and so thank you.
I’d also tell you that one of the great things that’s been fun for this is there’s a handful of you on the call, and there’s a
couple in the room here, but there’s a few people that we’ve been speaking to right from the very beginning. I was
doing the arithmetic this morning. I think this is my 56th earnings call, and there’s a few of you who have been there
right from the beginning and it’s been great fun to work with people over that period of time; just a real great joy,
actually, and watching how people can change their view of the business and how the business has changed.
So thank you for the comment. I’m most appreciative. Nobody else follow up, please, with that. That’s the last thank
you you’ll get, but, Larry, thanks. Go ahead with your question.
<Q - Larry Greenberg>: I know you talked a bit about Quantum and maybe it’s nothing more than it just continues to
develop traction in the marketplace, but it seems like the traction is more than certainly I would have expected at this
point. And I’m just wondering if you could give some more color on what’s really happening, where the rubber meets
the road. What’s the feedback from the agents? Is it simply that in more time, you’re getting more traction? Or anything
you could share on that would be helpful for me.
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: Sure. This is Doreen and good morning. I think that it’s fair to say that it’s gotten more
traction quicker than even we thought, and Alan commented on that. We did a lot of work before we designed the
product, looking at what we thought it needed to be from a pricing standpoint before we started modeling it and looking
at what expenses we needed to take out.
Along with that, we have a really, I would say, gifted sales force that is out with agents every day talking about the
product. We’ve also introduced some sales marketing tool kits that allow agents to regularly reach out to prospective
customers. I think the agents, you know, I’m a little biased in this, I think the agents really want to do business with us
and we gave them a competitive product and a quality product that allowed them to do that.
And I think the other really exciting thing about it is that the agents are also seeing that they’re picking up a bigger
share from the captives and the direct market, which is what we hoped, would happen for them, so that they just didn’t
see that they were getting a lower commission. So they see that, net-net, they’re getting into markets that they might
not have been as successful at and they’re producing more volume, and the feedback has been very good. We meet with
them very, very often, and I think that’s probably – it just worked as we hoped it would.
<Q - Larry Greenberg>: Do you think that the issues that some in the industry are having with frequency might be
additionally creating some opportunities for you?
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: Larry, it’s Jay. I can’t think of a topic that we’ve spent more time trying to understand
ourselves because obviously we’re anticipating someone asking, gee, why don’t you think you’re experiencing some of

the frequency trends that others are? And the truth is that we don’t know. But I’d make the following observations; one
is that where you start from is an important assumption. We’re talking about changes in frequency from period to
period. And so, one of the interesting questions is always how good are those original estimates from which you’re
adjusting? Was there a pattern or trend that evidenced itself later, sooner? So, the starting point matters, and it can’t be
dismissed.
The other, which I find more than intriguing; there’s a tendency to assume, analysts in particular, that the Auto
Insurance customer is the equivalent of a monolith. They’re all the same. And we know definitively in the data that’s
just not the case. And we know that, for example, from our experience of being a GEICO partner for as many years as
we’ve been, the customers that buy directly are, on average – now it doesn’t mean there aren’t a lot of exceptions, but
on average, they are younger, more single, more single cars, more minimum limits. They’re a different driver than a
higher-end, older, importantly older, a driver, the sort of type that has typically been a Travelers customer.
So, you could speculate, and that’s all it is. Is it possible that distracted driving is impacting that younger group
disproportionately relative to the older drivers? Is it possible that as employment has improved and miles driven
increased, that the unemployment improved amongst the younger drivers at a faster rate than older, because they had
not come down as much? And as a consequence, you’re seeing – and, again, this is hypothesis, not a fact, that you’re
seeing an increase in miles in the group that tends to have a higher rate of frequency.
So, that’s the best we can offer at the moment, those two dynamics of who’s the driver and what’s changed in their
world. And they are quite different. And then what’s the starting point from which they’re coming. I think Doreen had
it exactly right. I had a conversation a couple of years ago with an agent, and it’s just one. He was using Quantum 2 to
do outbound calling to those customers that Travelers had the Homeowners on but someone else had the Auto.
And so he was out there reaching out and saying, look, we’ve got a product that’s lower rate than the old Travelers was,
and you put the two products together and you’ve got the combined product discount. And suddenly that quote for the
Auto became remarkably compelling for a meaningful number of customers out there.
So, sort of one of the surprises was the account rounding that took place around Quantum, and that certainly added to
the volume. So, it started off with really hard management work of reducing costs, tough stuff, tough to execute locally,
hard human things, and then having a product that could compete with the marketplace that exists today. The core
reality of making sure you’re not irrelevant in a changing marketplace.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: So, I was hoping to talk just a little bit about pricing, and you guys have done a good job
of laying out a really interesting phenomenon in the Other Business Insurance line, which is there’s a huge difference
between property and your overall renewal rate changes. And if you sort of observe from 50,000 feet, it looks like most
of your renewal rate changes across a lot of your lines are kind of like ending up in this 1% to 2% sort of positive but
not as much as it was a couple of years ago phenomenon.
In Other Business Insurance, which I think you’ll correct me, but I think this is national account and more specialty and
wholesale stuff. Obviously, it’s declining now for the past couple of quarters, and I’m, one, wondering if you can sort
of talk a little bit about what’s structurally different about this business relative to some of the other sort of more small
Mid Market Commercial personalized things, and if we can sort of understand that and sort of as we get better in
forecasting it.
But then also, perhaps just more technically, is this something that’s really just a phenomenon of the property pressures
that are coming from sort of changes in the reinsurance markets? And, ultimately, almost if you re-frame this not as a
question of pricing but as a question of margins, would you guys think of yourselves as writing Property business today
at a stable margin but perhaps with less total price?
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: Josh, Alan and I are going to tag team this.
First, I’d make the observation that to the extent that capital, new capital, comes into our industry, it comes into those
areas that are easiest to put capital to work quickly. So, you will often find it in large account business, where
frequency, claim frequency, is not an issue. You’ll find it in unregulated, the non-admitted market, ENS. So, capital

goes where it can be most easily deployed, and the large account Property business is a really good example of an area
where capital can be committed pretty easily without much infrastructure or regulatory hoops to go through.
Now, there’s something in particular about the National Property business, and Alan’s talked about that. But, first, we
start off with an industry phenomena of to the extent new capital is coming in, that’s an area.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: Josh, it’s Alan. Let me start with just getting a little bit of perspective on your commentary.
You said that National Property, everything was sort of 0% to 1%, and I would say that’s not exactly true. There’s a
range from a little bit negative on National Property to, say, the Auto lines, where it’s a challenge from a return
perspective, and we’re getting rate in excess of loss trend there. So, I would just encourage you not to think about the
whole book being at 0% or 1% but there being a range that really corresponds to profitability. Also, in terms of what’s
in that business, it’s certainly our National Property, but there’s really no casualty in that business at all. It’s National
Property, it’s Boiler, Inland/Ocean; so, just to be clear about what’s in it.
You made the comment about returns. The returns in that National Property business are very, very attractive. And so I
would say that the pressure that we’re seeing from price really is coming from two places. There probably is a
component of that’s an easy place for the incremental capital coming into the business to find a home, but also the
returns are very, very good. And so we continue to have very high retentions and to grow that business.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: That’s great. Thank you. So, if I can ask a final question. And, obviously, the past
decade or so of Travelers has been one of capital returns and discipline. And that’s been fantastic for shareholders, to
the credit of everybody on the call.
But the trade-off from that, obviously, naturally is that there are some other companies that have chosen different
approaches where they basically retain earnings and they grow through acquisition or other sources. And I’m
wondering as you guys look sort of from where you are today, as you look forward, think about the next five years or
10 years and think about other companies getting bigger and the importance, I presume, of Travelers maintaining its
market share as sort of a number one or number two player with all of your agencies. I’m wondering how your, sort of,
strategic calculus might change and sort of more of a focus on growth to keep up with the Joneses might be something
we should anticipate from Travelers.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: Josh, let me take that, too. And let me start by saying, and I’ve said these words before, Jay
has really managed this through an ensemble cast. So, everyone around this table, I think, feels like we’re contributing
authors to the strategy that we put in place and that we’ve implemented and executed over the years. And we all feel
very, very comfortable that what we’ve done has created enormous shareholder value. And so we will continue to be
return-focused, and I would encourage you to all look at the first slide that we put in the webcast every single quarter,
quarter in, quarter out, and we spend a lot of time looking at that internally.
I would – if you go back 10 years, and you look at, and Jay’s actually put up this slide before, you look at the way
we’ve deployed capital. We have grown, and we would certainly rather grow than not grow, and we’ve deployed
capital where we think we can and grow at attractive returns. So, if you look at Commercial Accounts over the years, or
you look at the Surety business when the credit environment allowed us to do it; there’s all sorts of examples in all
different time periods across all of our businesses when we’ve grown. And we’ll continue to make every effort to do
that when we can.
We understand that there’s a relevance to market share and scale, so we’re not indifferent to it. And we will hopefully
make the right judgments in balancing the way we manage the business for returns, and thinking about the relevance of
growth and scale over time.
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: And I would just add that, in the context of acquisitions, we’ve been actively engaged.
Anything that’s transpired, we’ve looked at, we’ve established views of value and where value can be created, and
points at which it can’t be. And if we were to find a transaction that would fit strategically, that would enable us to
either reduce the volatility of our own returns, or potentially even improve them, and, of course, that’s hard, being the
highest return competitor in the industry. But if we can find that, we’re not uncomfortable moving ahead. We’ve done a

few transactions in our lives, and feel that we’ve got the skill base to execute, and so we’ll always keep looking.
<Q - Kai Pan>: I have to say, Jay, congratulations. A great career ending on such a high note.
And then for Alan, I think the same announcement, I’m wondering you must have given some thoughts on your
priorities or where you see area you can fully improve the organization.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: Yeah, thanks for the question, Kai. I’ve certainly been thinking a lot about it and I guess I
would go back to where I started with the last question, which is: We’ve all been managing this and we’ve all been on
this trajectory and path together and we’ll continue to do that. I’m in this really fortunate position at the moment, as I
said at the opening of the call, not just that I’m stepping into terrific results, but I’m stepping into a very familiar
situation. So the management team, the strategy, the board, all of that’s really familiar and that gives me a great
opportunity to be very thoughtful and very deliberate and to take my time together with the rest of the team as we think
about what’s next.
So we will do that in due course, and this has really given me an opportunity over the last couple of months to spend
time with the leadership team, to be on the road with our field organizations, to spend time with distribution, so it’s
been really a luxury and a privilege, and we’ll take the time to be very thoughtful and deliberate about it.
<Q - Kai Pan>: Okay, thank you. And a follow-up question on your y-over-y improvement on the underlying margin.
You said the lower non-cat loss has contributed to that. My understanding it’s a lot here third quarter you have sort of
above normal and I don’t know if this year is like below normal of non-cat activities and could you quantify that? Just
wonder, like, going forward, we see this year’s level would be more normalized non-cat weather events.
<A - Jay S. Benet>: This is Jay Benet. As you’ve heard us say on the call before, I mean we’ve always struggled with
the concept of what actually is normal, and what we do in our Qs and Ks is give and indicate for weather…
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: For weather.
<A - Jay S. Benet>: For weather. I’m sorry, for weather. For other things we do know what is normal. But when it
comes to weather, what we’re doing in our Qs and Ks is really making comparisons of actual costs in one quarter to
actual costs in another quarter. So you do hear us talk about, this was more favorable than last year, or this was less
favorable than last year, but to try to quantify in any meaningful way how that then compares to what’s normal is
difficult.
What we do try to provide is some color to say that the weather seemed to be fairly benign this quarter so I think we
would say that whatever normal is, it’s probably a little more expensive than what we saw this quarter, but we leave it
to you to actually try to dollarize that, if you will.
<Q - Kai Pan>: Well, just y-over-y comparison, if you look at relative basis, how much that contributed to the
240BPS?
<A - Jay S. Benet>: Well, just looking at it year-to-year basis, it was primarily a change due to the level of non-cat
weather in BI.
<Q - Kai Pan>: Okay. But, thank you so much.
<A - Jay S. Benet>: And that’s what we try to communicate, hopefully clearly, in the Q and the press release.
<Q - Ryan J. Tunis>: My first question I guess is just given the 10-year back at 2%, how should we think about the
NII run rate on the fixed income portfolio headed into next year as it compares to this year? And also, how should we
be thinking about alternative returns headed into Q4 with I guess probably some lagged alts on PE, especially given
energy?
<A - Jay S. Benet>: Yes, we try to be very clear in our Q in the outlook as to what’s taking place in the fixed income
environment and we don’t try to make predictions of the future interest rates. We more or less look at it on the basis of
if today’s rates were to maintain themselves over the next 12 months or so, what’s the likely impact of that on the

reinvestment capabilities for assets that are turning over in that timeframe? And based upon that, we’ve made a
disclosure in the Q saying that on a quarterly basis, we would expect the fixed income NII, all things being equal, to go
down about $25mm to $30mm from where it would have been in the prior year quarter on a comparative basis.
And that would be an after-tax number. And that’s frankly consistent with not only what we’ve been saying, but more
or less what we’ve been seeing over the last several years, if you follow what’s taken place in our fixed income
portfolio.
As it relates to the non-fixed income portfolio, we do report private equities on a three-month lag basis. We report
hedge funds on a one-month lag basis, so it’s not quite the same in terms of the time differential. And, from our own
forecasting standpoint, we do our best to look forward and try to determine, based on equity markets and not just
private equities and hedge funds, but what the real estate markets are doing, because that’s a substantial portion of the
non-fixed income portfolio and we try to internally estimate what we think fourth quarter and into next year returns are
going to be, but we don’t have a crystal ball, so when people ask me what we think, I try to guide them to look at the
past several quarters and draw some conclusions from that as to what kind of trajectory we might be on.
If you look last year vs. this year, we did disclose that the re-pricing of oil worldwide had an impact on our valuations
and that’s worked its way through the valuations at this point in time. So other than that, there’s really nothing more I
can think of adding to that.
<Q - Ryan J. Tunis>: Okay, understood. And then I just had two quick number questions on FPI. And my first one I
think is a follow-up on Jay Cohen’s question on the current accident year favorable development. And I think Doreen
mentioned it was in Fidelity and Crime. And I’m wondering should we think about that as like a change in trend that
will, all things being equal, also be a tailwind headed into next year?
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: My answer to that is no. It’s really more of a factor of what we’ve seen in prior accident
years and that influencing what we think 2015 would be. So no, we would not view that as a trend going forward in
2016.
<Q - Ryan J. Tunis>: That’s helpful.
<A - Jay S. Benet>: This is Jay Benet. I’ll ask a question of Doreen, a follow-up, but that does set the tone for the
starting point for 2016 though, right?
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: Yes, right.
<Q - Ryan J. Tunis>: Okay, that’s helpful. And then the other one for FPI was just looking at the general admin
expenses, they were down about $6mm to $10mm this quarter from where we’ve seen the run rate. Is this a good run
rate going forward? Or is that one-time, that $93mm?
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: You’re speaking to the intangible that was fully amortized, so that’s a one-time event, yes in
Q2. Is that what we were talking about?
<A - Jay S. Benet>: Yes, if you talk about Bond & Specialty, the reduction in expenses that…
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: Yes.
<A - Jay S. Benet>: …we’re referring to, there was an intangible that became fully amortized and as a result, that
expense now goes away. So…
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: …it continues.
<A - Jay S. Benet>: …yes, it continues to go away.
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: It continues on into the future.
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: Yes.

<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: So just returning to Auto for just a second if I could, I guess not being an operator, trying to
see inside the operating lens a little bit, it looks like so you’re increasing rate and growing as a result of Quantum 2.0.
This frequency dynamic has popped up elsewhere that you guys haven’t seen, it’s still not clear what’s underneath that.
How do you sort of balance the goal of repositioning Auto via Quantum 2.0 and being top three with raters and
growing at a pace you’re comfortable with, but doing that in a changing loss environment and whether that creates the
risk of adverse selection?
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: It’s Jay Fishman. Just two or three observations and if Doreen wants to add in; one is, you
said higher rate, that’s 2.0 vs. 1.0. It’s actually a lower rate. In other words, 2.0 – again, you’ll get all sorts of sales that
are different; different underwriting elements, but the concept behind 2.0 was across the board a lower-priced product
than 1.0 was. 1.0 in a comparative rating environment was not nearly competitive enough. 2.0 was designed to be
substantially more competitive. And that actually has happened. The volume and the product is a function of how it
shows up on a technology platform in an agent’s office, and in that regard 2.0 is doing exactly what we had hoped it
would.
As to the changing loss environment, I’m not sure we could look any harder than we look. For us, it hasn’t happened.
And so we just keep going on. Whether it’s paid losses, incurred losses, early indicators of losses, early indicators of
activity, there’s just been not a meaningful change. And I don’t mean to hem and haw that because any quarter numbers
move a little up or a little down all the time, but in looking for something systemic, we just don’t see it here. I don’t
know, Doreen, if you want to…
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: I would like to add, we do expect when we add new business that that’s going to perform, at
least initially, at a higher loss ratio. And as that becomes more tenured, it begins to perform in the range of where our
tenured business is. So when we’ve said that everything is in line with our expectations, that’s exactly what we mean.
We assumed certain things about how the new business would perform and it’s within those guardrails.
We’ve just started going through our renewal cycle with the first of the Quantum book. We expect that to even perform
at lower levels of loss, but within planned expectation. So I agree with Jay, we’re not seeing anything that’s systemic in
the environment. But our view of new business is, it gets to the returns over time and we expect it’d be there.
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: And I would just add, because it’s something we take for granted here, I often find there’s
confusion. There’s no difference in the price between a new account and a renewal account. They are the same. And so,
when Doreen says that a block of new business doesn’t perform as well as once it’s seasoned, it’s not because the rate
changes. It’s because the underwriting improves with performance.
As you begin to understand the dynamics of each individual account, you can begin to make adjustments all the way
from lowering rate where someone has earned it, increasing rate where someone has earned that, or non-renewing
where the circumstances warrant it. And so the improvement with age is not about a new business penalty. It’s a phrase
that’s often used. It’s really about the unseasoned underwriting performance that occurs in any new block of business in
any business and improves with time.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Got it. I guess my question, when I mentioned rate increase, I was looking at the renewal
premium change. So I guess what you’re saying is that the cost reductions that you made including the commission
reductions are enough to even make the premium lower in 2.0 vs. what it would have been in 1.0, despite the fact that
you’ve got renewal premium change.
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: Yes, exactly right.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Okay.
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: And so the renewal premium change is positive and obviously some of that, a meaningful
amount of that, is still Quantum 1 that’s on the books.
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: Right.

<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: I mean where Quantum 2 is entirely our new business now, but there’s a not insignificant
amount of Quantum 1 that continues. It’s aging. It’s meaningfully profitable, does quite well. Now that obviously will –
the Quantum 1 percentage will go down with time, the Quantum 2 in the portfolio will go up, but you’ve got it exactly
right.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Two questions here. First one, Doreen, I noticed in the 10-Q that you’ve changed your
outlook for underlying margins in the Personal line sub-segment to go from kind of stable going to 2016 to now I guess
smaller margins. What’s behind that change?
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: Brian, that’s really as the amount of the Quantum business comes in.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: So expectations are still pretty strong growth in Quantum? So that’s why it’s just better
than expected?
<A - Gabriella Nawi>: Brian, it’s Gabby. Are you talking to all of PI or was that specifically…
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Yes, it’s all Personal lines. When you look at…
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: Oh, okay.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: …all Personal lines you make that overall kind of general comment.
<A - Gabriella Nawi>: Yes.
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: Yes.
<A - Gabriella Nawi>: So it’s more of a – sorry.
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: …weather. No, it’s more of a weather…
<A - Jay S. Benet>: It’s a combination of the new business and Quantum, as Jay and Doreen just talked about that
impact, as well as the whole concept of what the weather might be.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Got you. So it’s good, solid weather in Q3, so kind of looking forward. Okay, that makes
sense.
The second question just quickly, and maybe I’m reading too much into this, is looking at your exposure in Business
Insurance, you continue to kind of moderate here exposure increases. Anything to read into that?
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: No, Brian. It’s Alan. I would say generally reflective of economic conditions.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Okay. So you’re seeing economic conditions may be slowing a little bit?
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: No. No, we’re seeing…
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: We’re all looking at each other, trying to understand what you’re seeing and reacting to.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Just looking at Business Insurance, and if I look at – you provide the exposure, other as a
percentage, right, and it’s been moderating over the last year. Small business, you definitely saw it come down, as far
as the rate of increase.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: Pretty small numbers you’re looking at. So, if you’re looking at selected, sequentially, it’s
4.9% to 4.1%. If you’re looking at overall BI, ex-National, it’s something like 2.4% to 2.2%. So, you’re really talking
very small changes in a number that is hard to even calculate with any precision.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Got you.
<A - Brian William MacLean>: Yes, and Brian, this is Brian MacLean. Remember that in the production statistics,
those are really the underwriter and the account and the producer’s estimate of what’s going to happen with exposures
going forward. So, it’s a little bit of what gets pushed into the price. Then there’s also audit premium, which is coming

through the actual premium line, which has been a little bit higher. So, the actual exposures we’re seeing are pretty
consistent.
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: And, typically, as it ages, it goes up…
<A - Brian William MacLean>: Yes.
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: …because the audit premium gets reflected. And so, the natural trend is for a customer to
underestimate prospective exposure to save rate. And then, of course, the audit brings it back up and comes in later. So,
there’s a bit of, I wouldn’t call it seasonality time of year, but timing associated with it.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: I wanted to follow up on the M&A environment, and I know there was some previous commentary
around in what circumstances Travelers might be interested in doing a deal. I wanted to see if you could tailor those
comments a bit more towards International vs. Domestic.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: Sure, Jay. It’s Alan. I’ll take that. So, we would apply the same kind of thought process and
lens to a transaction outside the U.S. as we would to the U.S. Either it’s going to contribute to our mission of improving
returns or creating more profit dollars at the same returns or improving volatility. And so we would apply the same lens
and go through the same thought process.
A transaction outside the United States, given our footprint and our scale, may be different in that analysis than one
would be in the U.S. So, that’s why $1B transaction in Canada, for instance, was so attractive to us. A $1B transaction
in the U.S. would certainly be less strategic from that perspective.
So, we will continue to look in our existing and beyond footprint outside the U.S. and will undertake transactions when
they make sense on that basis.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Okay. Thanks for that. And then, on the premium growth for the quarter, gross written premium
was up 0.6%, net up 2.6%. So, am I right in assuming that it was purchasing less reinsurance was the main driver of the
net growth? Or was there something else there?
<A - Jay S. Benet>: Yes, this is Jay Benet. In prior quarters, we’ve made some changes to our reinsurance, so it’s not
that we’re purchasing less reinsurance. But you recall earlier in the year, we talked about changing our cat cover, which
previously had been a July 1 renewal, and we canceled it as of 12/31. This was the Gen Cat. Canceled it as of 12/31 last
year, and on January 1 of this year, bought the Gen Cat cumulative cover.
So, what you have in this particular quarter is a comparison to a quarter last year where we had a purchase of
reinsurance. This year, we didn’t have it, but the same kind of cover with a different set of limits and different types of
aggregation, was done in January 1.
All that said, if you want to get a better view of things without looking at the reinsurance, look at YTD information
because it washes itself out. There were some other similar types of changes, some in terms of timing, some going from
quota share to excess cover, but, yes, we really haven’t fundamentally changed the program.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: So the YTD net written premium growth trend would probably be a better indicator?
<A - Jay S. Benet>: Yes.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thank you.
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: And, Jay, it’s Jay Fishman. Just one additional thought again we take for granted here so
often, on your acquisition question. We are a small and middle market insurance company. We’re a very big one, but
we’re a small and middle market company. We really don’t, for substantive reasons, aspire to be a global account
casualty underwriter. It’s a different business. It’s not one that we’re particularly well suited. We really don’t do it in
the U.S. in any meaningful way.
And so all of these questions about international acquisitions, and they’re relevant, really we get very local-focused.
What can we do in the particular geography that we’re talking about as opposed to how does it allow us to write global

casualty for a Fortune 10 company. That’s just not our business. It’s not what we do. So we tend to think of it as quite
local and not global in that sense.
<Q - Amit Kumar>: Just one question, a clarification question; in response to Larry’s question, I think you mentioned
that you’re capturing more share in the captive and direct channels. And I was trying to figure out that that’s a different
shopping experience and why would a captive policyholder be willing to move their Auto policy to an independent
agent, I guess given the lack of a bundling discount? Maybe just explain that a bit more to me.
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: Yes, I mean, I don’t know exactly why they might switch from one to the other, but they
have more choice. If they’re with a captive agent, they have a product and that’s it. And if they start shopping around,
which we know many more customers are shopping, then they might choose a different distribution channel so that
they can have choice.
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: The data is, what I’m thinking about, is quite dated. But I know we have information. Of
course, it’s self-disclosed where the customer tells us their previous insurer was. And I’m going back quite a ways, but
it has longstanding been predominantly captive companies and other direct companies moving into the independent
agent channel. Disproportionate part of our new business rather than – there is obviously one agent company moving to
us, but disproportionately more captive than direct as a percentage of that volume. I haven’t looked at that in a couple
of years, but that’s at least what the standard has been.
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: And we’ve seen more of it with 282, Jay.
