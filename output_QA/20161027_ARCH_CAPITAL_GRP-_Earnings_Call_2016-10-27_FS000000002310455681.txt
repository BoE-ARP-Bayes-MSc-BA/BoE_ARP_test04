{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our
third quarter earnings call.

Bloomberg Transcript

Before I comment on the quarter's results, I wanted to note two items. First, this October
represents the 15th year anniversary and I would like to express my gratitude to our
employees, whose dedication and commitment has build this successful company over
the last 15 years.
Our employees are not just our most important asset; they are critical to producing the
market-leading performance that we have seen these past 15 years. And I would like to
say thank you to all of them.
Second item I want to comment on is about our pending acquisition of United Guaranty
Corporation, as you know Arch has agreed to purchase United Guaranty for
approximately $3.42 billion.
Early indications from the GSE's and regulators have been positive and we are hoping that
the acquisition will close late in the fourth quarter of this year, which will minimize the
disruption to our distribution partners in the mortgage lending space, as well as the
employees of United Guaranty who will benefit from this timing as they transfer to Arch
benefits and healthcare coverages as of January 1, so they don't have to deal with a split
year deductibles and all the other complications that at different date might produce.
Now turning to these quarter results, we have a good quarter. Our reported combined
ratio on a core basis, which Mark Lyons will define in a moment improved to 86.5% for the
third quarter, as catastrophe losses were light at $10.7 million. Loss reserve development
continues to remain at favorable in each of our segments, which in the aggregate reduce
our combined ratio by 8.8 points in the quarter.
There were no significant changes that we see in the property, casualty, operating
environment in the last quarter. In our insurance segment, we saw a slight deterioration in

rates across some sectors, particularly in the high access and short-tail areas. But rates
were generally stable in most of the lines, while the mortgage insurance environment
remains both stable and healthy. Marc Grandisson will give you more details on what we
see in each of the markets in a few minutes.
On an operating basis, we produce an annualized return on equity of 8.8% while on a net
income basis, we earn an annualized return of equity of 15.3% for the quarter. As we have
told you in previous quarters, net income movements can be more volatile on a quarterly
basis as these earnings are influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates and realized
gains and losses, our investment portfolio.
Net investment income per share for the quarter was $0.53 per share down $0.04
sequentially from the second quarter of 2016. Despite volatility in the investment and
foreign exchange markets this year on a local currency basis, total return on our
investment portfolio was a positive 88 basis points and 91 basis points if we include the
effects of foreign exchange in the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our operating cash flow was very strong at $421 million in the third quarter, as compared
to $359 million in the third quarter of 2015. Our book value per common share at
September 30, 2016 was $53.62 per share a 3% increase sequentially from the second
quarter of 2016 and 12.5% increase from the third quarter over a year ago. While some
segments of our business have become more competitive, we believe that group-wide
on an expected basis, the present value ROE on the business written in the 2016
underwriting year should produce ROEs in the range of 10% to 12% on allocated capital.
Before I turn the call over to Marc Grandisson, I would like to discuss our PMLs, which are
essentially unchanged from July 1. As usual, I would like to point out that our cat PML
aggregates reflect business bound through October 1st, while the premium numbers
indicated in our financial statements are through September 30th, and then the PMLs are
reflected net off of reinsurance and retrocessional covers.
As of October 1, 2016 our largest 250 PML for a single event remains in the Northeast at
$488 million, or 7.4% of common shareholder's equity. I think this is the lowest percentage
ever for us. Our Gulf of Mexico PML was at $418 million and our Florida Tri-County PML
increased slightly to $405 million.
I will now turn it over to Marc Grandisson to comment on the operating units and market
conditions and after that I think Mark Lyons will share the financial returns in detail before
we come back to take your questions. Marc?

Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Thank you, Dinos. Good morning to all.
In the third quarter, we saw a continued softening of rates in positions and E&C (07:55)
world. Particularly in the more commoditized lines and as Dinos mentioned, a stable MI
marketplace. Our P&C units both insurance and reinsurance produced acceptable

FINAL

combined ratios as our underwriters focused on specialty lines, where knowledge and
expertise differentiates this selection.
As you are all aware, we continue to build out of our MI segment in the third quarter, our
returns are attractive. Turning first to our primary P&C insurance operations, which
represents about 60% of our total premiums. Rate changes in our U.S. operations were
relatively stable in the third quarter at a negative of 110 basis points versus a negative of
120 basis points last quarter.
As in previous quarters, most of what we at Arch call, our controlling low volatility
segments which includes travel, A&H, contract binding, construction and program
business had rate changes that were in a slightly positive range 50 bps, while our cyclemanaged segments, which includes property in marine, energy and casualty experienced
single to double-digit rate decreases.

Bloomberg Transcript

Unfortunately, rate decreases are becoming widespread across more business units than
have been building over the last few quarters, increasingly our business mix is moving
towards smaller specialty risks, which had historically performed better in submarkets
given that they are less exposed to the competitive pressures of the broad commercial
liability and short-tail markets.
Globally, P&C market remained also under pressure from a rate level perspective. In the
UK, rate changes across all our product lines average negative 5% this quarter leading us
to shift further towards portfolios of smaller risks with lower volatility. Areas of opportunity
within the insurance sectors were limited with modest growth recorded in the third
quarter in our construction and national accounts, travel and alternative markets line. Most
of the growth came because we took advantage of this location in those areas, yet our
executive assurance, property and marine businesses are areas where we level rate
levels lead us to a continuing defensive strategy of reducing risks.
Market conditions in our reinsurance group, which is 30% of our premium volume remain
competitive. Our teams have to be very selective given conditions in their operating
environments, but Arch's history is that our underwriters have been able to find
opportunities that still meet our target returns.
This quarter specialty areas such as agriculture and motor grew while short-tailed
segments such as property, cat and marine experienced significant rate decreases and
we accordingly decreased our writings in those segments. Our strategy at Arch has been
to focus on niche areas of opportunities, where as I said earlier, we believe that
knowledge and experience gives us an edge, for that reason and given the tough market
conditions in any one quarter, our premium mix changes sometimes significantly.
Turning to our third leg, our MI segment, which is this quarter 9% of our premium, but a
growing percentage of our premium earned. We estimate that our market share of
primary NIW in the U.S. rose to about 10% or 11% in the third quarter from 9% market share
in Q2. In addition, we continued our market leadership in underwriting new U.S. GSE risk

Page 4 of 27

FINAL

sharing transactions, which stood at $2 billion of notional limits in force and we continue to
see good volume from our Australian primary insurance relationship.
Notably this quarter, we elected to purchase a quota share on our Australian business to
help manage the risk profile of our global MI exposure, while returns on this business
remain attractive, we believe it is prudent to manage what potential adverse results and
we assess this risk much like we do in our other lines of business in the P&C sector, where
we typically purchase protection to limit our aggregate exposures.
Our U.S. MI operation increased its NIW 36% to $8.75 billion during the third quarter of
2016, of which approximately 79% came through the bank channel. It should be noted that
there is seasonality in the level of mortgage origination. Historically, the second and third
quarter have significant higher production than the first and fourth quarters. Our return
expectation across our MI segment remains in excess of our long-term ROE targets and
we expect that for the foreseeable future.
And with that, I'll hand this over to Mark to cover the detailed financial results. Mark?

Great. Thank you, Marc and good morning, all.
As was true on previous calls, my comments to follow today are on a pure Arch basis,
which excludes the other segment that being Watford Re unless otherwise noted. I've
continued to use the term core as Dinos mentioned in his notes to denote results without
Watford Re and the term consolidated, when discussing results, including Watford Re.
As Dinos commented, we announced UGC Acquisition in August for a consideration of
approximately $3.4 billion subject to a potential dollar-for-dollar reduction from any preclosing dividend by UGC to AIG and subject to potential fluctuations due to the caller
structure around our common equivalent preferred component. Financing and integration
activities are proceeding smoothly as we push for a year-end closing.
Before I review our financial results, let me update you on our recent financing activities
during the third quarter. The first is the issuance of $18 million, 5.25% Series E noncumulative preference shares in late September, which raised net proceeds of
approximately $435 million, which will be used primarily towards funding the UGC
acquisition.
Secondly, we negotiated a syndicated bridge loan facility in support of the UGC
acquisition of $1.375 billion. The potential use of which has been commensurately reduced
for the aforementioned preferred stock issuance.
Thirdly, we began efforts to renew our existing credit facility towards increasing the
capacity to $850 million, which includes a $500 million unsecured revolving credit tranche
and a $350 million secured letter of credit tranche. The new facility has been signed this

week expires in five years and gives us access to additional capital for the UGC acquisition
and for general corporate purposes. Please refer to our publicly available SEC filings for
more detail.
Okay, with that said, the core combined ratio for this quarter was 86.5% with 1.3 points of
current accident year cat-related events net of reinstatement premiums, compared to the
2015 third quarter combined ratio of 89.7%, which reflected 2.3 points of cat-related
events.
Losses from 2016 cat events recorded in the third quarter, net of recoverables at
reinstatement premiums totaled $10.7 million versus $18.8 million in the third quarter of
2015. These third quarter cat losses stem mostly from within our reinsurance operation
and reflect a series of small events around the globe with no single event concentration.

Bloomberg Transcript

The 2016 third quarter core combined ratio reflects 8.8 points of prior year net favorable
developments compared to 7.1 points of prior period favorable development on the same
basis in the 2015 third quarter. This results in a core accident quarter combined ratio
excluding cat for the third quarter of 94% even as compared to 94.5% accident quarter
combined ratio in the third quarter of 2015.
In the insurance segment, the 2016 accident quarter combined ratio excluding cats was
97.9% compared to an accident quarter combined ratio of 95.8% a year ago and 96.3%
serially last quarter. This 210-basis point increase between the third quarter of 2016 versus
2015 was driven by a 130 basis points in the loss ratio and 80 basis points in the expense
ratio. The loss ratio increase was primarily attributable to certain large attritional losses
emanating from our U.S. operations. After adjusting for the incremental difference in large
attritional losses, the accident quarter loss ratio this quarter is virtually flat with the prior
year's quarter.
The reinsurance segment, 2016 accident quarter combined ratio exclusive of cats was
96.5% compared to 94.6% in the third quarter of last year and versus 98.4% serially last
quarter.
The combined ratio reflected the impact of several excess property facultative losses that
occurred during the quarter. The mortgage segment 2016, accident quarter combined
ratio was 60.7% compared to 82.5% for the third quarter of last year. This decrease is
predominantly driven by favorable trends related to claim rates and claim sizes and the
continued expense ratio improvement in our U.S. primary MI book due mostly to growth
along with beneficial mix changes towards GSE credit risk sharing transactions.
There was however one transaction this quarter in the mortgage segment, which distorts
the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Retrocessional coverage was purchased on certain
Australian LMI business with loan to values greater than 90% that extended back to the
inception of the underlying agreement, which was May of 2015.
As a result, ceded premiums this quarter contained an additional $34 million of catch-up
successions, which served to commensurately understate net written premiums for the

FINAL

quarter. Regarding prior period development, the insurance segment accounted for
roughly 18% of the total net favorable development in the quarter and this was primarily
driven by longer and medium-tailed lines from the 2007 through 2012 accident years
partially offset by some accident year 2015 property loss development from our UK
operations.
The reinsurance segment accounted for approximately 79% of the total favorable
development in the quarter with roughly 45% of that due to net favorable development
on short-tailed lines concentrated in 2012 through 2015 underwriting years, and the
balance due to net favorable development on longer-tailed lines emanating across most
underwriting years prior to 2013.
The mortgage segment contributed out 3% of the total net favorable development,
which translates to a 3.2 point beneficial impact to the mortgage segment loss ratio,
again resulting from continued lower than expected claim rates. The overall core expense
ratio for the quarter was 33.4% compared to the prior year's comparative quarter of
34.2%. This 80-basis point improvement is driven mostly from improved acquisition
expense in the reinsurance and mortgage segments with the latter benefit largely being
aided by a higher proportion of GSE business receiving insurance accounting treatment,
which has lower acquisition expense.

Bloomberg Transcript

Additionally, corporate expenses included approximately $6.8 million or about $5.5 a
share of nonrecurring cost associated with the UGC transaction. These costs reflect
investment banker fees, bridge loan facility fees along with related legal accounting rating
and SEC fees.
Core cash flow from operations was approximately $421 million in the quarter versus
approximately $359 million in the third quarter of 2015, this was primarily due to a lower
level of net paid losses this quarter versus last year's quarter.
Core pre-tax investment income in the 2016 as Dinos mentioned was $66.3 million or
$0.53 per share versus $67 million or $0.54 per share quarter-over-quarter and
sequentially versus $70.4 million or $0.57 per share. The decrease on the sequential basis
was primarily due to the effective low interest rates on fixed income securities available in
the market and unfavorable inflation adjustments on U.S. TIP securities.
As always, we evaluate investment performance on a total return basis and not nearly by
the geography of net investment income as exemplified by the $96 million of core
realized gains in the quarter.
That being said, total return was a positive 88 basis points this quarter, which reflects the
impact of foreign exchange and a positive 91 basis points on a local currency basis. This
return was led by strong equity, non-investment grade fixed income and alternative
investment results. Our effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income available to our
shareholders for this quarter was an expense of 6.5% compared to an expense of 5.7% in
the corresponding quarter 2015, driven by an increased proportion of U.S. based income.

FINAL

This quarter, 6.5% effective tax rate includes 50 basis points or roughly $800,000 relating
to a true-up of the prior two quarters' tax provision to the estimated annual effective tax
rate reflected here.
As always, fluctuations in the effective tax rate can resolve from variability in the relative
mix of income or loss reported by jurisdiction. Our total capital was $8.24 billion at the end
of 2016 third quarter, up 8.5% relative to last quarter, and up 2.6%, when excluding the
recent $450 million preferred stock issuance discussed earlier.
Our debt-to-capital ratio this quarter remains low at 10.8% and debt plus hybrids
represents 20.2% of our total capital, which continues to give us significant financial
flexibility. We continue to estimate having capital in excess of our targeted position. We
did not purchase any shares this quarter under our authorized share buyback program,
which has remaining authorization of $446 million at quarter's end. Dinos mentioned book
value, so I will not.
And with these introductory comments, we are now pleased to take your questions.

Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is
open.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. You have just any kind of initial insight into what your potential fourth
quarter losses would be from Hurricane Matthew?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yeah. Early estimates and is quite early – is that it would be within our cat mode and let
me remind everybody our cat mode is about $40 million a quarter. So, what we see on a
model base is, we get a number close to the cat or when we see the actual claim
reporting activity is much lower, so it's too early for us to narrow that number, but it looks
to us like it's within the cat mode.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then would that be more of a split insurance versus reinsurance or is that too
early to say?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Right now, it looks it's a 50-50 allocation between the two, by excess and then reshaping
the portfolio, we still have an average that somewhat in more stable with the PML could
change dramatically. So, the shape of our curve last change as we have gotten away from
the high-risk excess area, specifically on the cat reinsurance.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. And then one question, in terms of the UGC finances that you guys disposed with
the deal on the accretion double-digits in the first-year and then 35% about or so in 2017,
are you guys planning on taking in the intangible amortizations through earnings, so are
those accretion figures excluding intangibles?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

That reflects, yeah, that reflected an estimate of the mix between goodwill and
intangibles at the time, as we work through towards closing and getting much more clarity
on what goodwill versus amortizable intangibles that will modify it. In fact, I think, you can
see some of that in the prospectus supplement that we had for the preferred offering,
you know, some accounting rules around it, but there was more refinance on the
intangibles and whenever we go to the markets next and that will have a close up you
might see an adjustment there, what matters is what is in the closing and we're working
with our auditors to fine tune that.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then one last question, we're a couple of weeks away from the
Presidential Election, Dino I was just hoping if you could just give some high-level views on
potential impact of the election overall just on the insurance industry. Thank you very
much.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I don't know, I guess, it depends on what happens with – who the President is going to be
Congress and are they friendly to the business environment or unfriendly you know
without knowing that it's – the big issue for the insurance business is going to be on
appointment of judges, how the Supreme Court – it will be and it's a slow process, but if
we continue in the path over the last eight years, I can tell you that the future is going to
be more challenging for the business and we've got to adjust to it, because at the end of
the day that's what our words get determined, you know not only in the cases that they
get litigated, but also in the cases that they get settled, because the settlement values
go up based on the attitude of the courts. So, not knowing what's going to happen hard
to predict.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much and good luck with the getting the UGC deal closed.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Thank you and good morning.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning, Kai Pan.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

First question – good morning. First question on UGC. Now you have like (27:03) two
minds after deal announcements, speak with sort of external clients and the banks. And is
there any indication term out (27:09) of a potential market share loss, because the
concentration issue. How that compare with your initial thought? And any other – any
offsetting factor internally on the expense saving side, you can offset some of those?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, let me answer the first one. I'll get Marc Grandisson to get on the second part of
your question. But on the first one, first and foremost, you've got to understand that
we're running independent of each other. We're still two independent companies, we
want to come together after closing. So, our discussions with the market and the clients is
separate from the UGC discussions with the market and the client.

Bloomberg Transcript

No indications yet, that there is any discomfort, you know about what they do with us or
they do with that. Once we close and we become one company will revisit that issue, but
nothing so far that indicates any significant overlap that it might be problematic.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Actually, yeah this is Marc now. Actually, part of the due diligence sort of highlight to us
that, there's not as much overlap as we might think. But again, the proof is going to be in
the pudding after we close the books and we go represent to some of those that are –
that have that we may have overlap on, it's too early to tell right now.
In terms of the expense savings or working through the operations, we have teams that
are dedicating – working very, very diligently to try to assess and first and foremost try to
understand what both sides have in terms of system and operations and structure, to see
how we can make something that would be unique and cohesive as we go forward after
the closing. We're making good progress in that direction.
At that point in time, we're not so focused on to address your questions specifically on
the expense savings or whatnot, if they are there, we are as we said in August, not doing
that transaction for that reason. First and foremost, we think there will be some we don't
know how much it's going to be. Our team are also going through that process. And the
savings might come not necessarily on a linear basis and then we'll have to integrate and
get things together. So, it's very hard for us to tell you anything more than this at this point
in time.

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

FINAL

And Kai, it's Mark Lyons. Let me just add that when we are doing our economic analysis of
this deal and when and we communicated on our call in August, about this transaction. We
actually anticipate some fall off of the market share. So, to the extent that there is some
marginal fall off, it wouldn't surprise us and the facts when contemplated.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Mark any estimates, sort of like additional interest expenses for the fourth quarter?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well, I think you can, what you call interest expense on that, you can take your 5% in the
quarter times the $450 million and add that in. As far as we're really not in the position yet
to discuss the timing or extent of any additional offering. But we are striving towards
closing at year-end. So, there's two months to accomplish quite a bit.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's good. And then my second question is really on the core loss ratio, the
deterioration year-over-year. You know, expanding that with some higher level of attrition
losses in both insurance and reinsurance segments. I just wonder, did you consider this
year's large attrition losses sort of normal and or just higher than like sort of exceptionally,
sort of good results from last year?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, no. On the insurance growth, it was surety loans that we have accounted for it to its
full extent. Surety it's a line of business by nature. Occasionally, it will give you that
volatility. One quarter you have a big loss then two, three quarters no losses. So, I don't,
you know we look at the book and the composition of the book and the long-term
performance in making you know judgments as to how healthy or unhealthy that book is.
So, one quarter event doesn't really give you a trend so to speak.
On similar case with the reinsurance. This is you know, excessive loss of property backed
(31:45) – transactions and you know occasionally that's where you're in business. You will –
you take in the volatility from your clients, so when it happens you know it comes to your
books. But that particular unit has been a big, big money maker for us and it continues to
be, so I don't attribute that as a trend.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

In fact, we've looked at the last – the trailing 12 months' accident combined ratio adjusted
for all these large losses and it's actually very, very stable, which is what we care for like –
to Dinos's point one quarter does not make a trend and where we are right now, we're
very comfortable and very happy with the stability actually of the accident year combined
ratio.

Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td

Kai, just one more thing to add as to Dinos has noted about the reinsurance side that
facultative group has been enormously profitable by its nature short tailed excess
position, it's going to be volatile any given quarter could be volatile. And our view there
was roughly 2.5 a little more of long-term loss ratio points that may have been excess of
what you normally would see which translates, if you go back and do the arithmetic, it
pushes you to about a 60 basis points or a 59.9 basis points on the adjustment for the
loss ratio for the reinsurance group in totality, versus 59 the prior year, so that's 90 basis
point movement.

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much. I just wanted to touch on the UGC acquisition,
you have a footnote in here that it's dependent on closing the execution of an excess of
loss agreement between AIG and UGC. I just wanted to ask if you guys have any clarity at
this point on that reinsurance transaction, sort of maybe what it will be protecting you
guys against in the future, this is not the Bellemeade Re I or Bellemeade Re II, I'm talking
about the third excess of loss agreement what it's going to protect in the future and
maybe if you've gotten that in place at this point?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

A couple of layers there. First layer of answer is that between AIG and Arch, we have
agreed on terms and conditions of it, it is not yet signed because we need approval of
the GSE's that's a requirement and that's part of our discussion with them now. So, that's
the first point. So, I would say significant progress on that aspect.
Secondly, it's an aggregate excess of loss that there's a couple of layers involved, but it's
effectively 2009 through year end of 2016 coverages, that's an out of the money cover
that in the aggregate provides quite a bit of capital relief from the viewpoint of S&P.

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

And who is going to bear the original cost for that, is that going to be paid for by Arch, by
AIG or a combination?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}
Page 12 of 27

It's effectively paid by UGC at closing, so it's an applied book value reduction for the
ceded premium.

FINAL

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then can you help us in terms of the investment yield of the portfolio
when UGC is added in maybe what is sort of the current yield and or duration of the UGC
portfolio and how much uplift might that have on the overall Arch portfolio and will you be
using the extended duration of the UGC premiums to extend your own duration or
change anything in the overall investment portfolio going forward maybe starting in Q1
2017?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Let me start and ask Dinos to say a few words too. First off, once the closing occurs the
management of that will transfer of course to AIM which is our internal Arch Investment
Management. The coupons on that book is higher it's about 3.3%, I think maybe 3.5% is
the average coupon, it's a lot of credit book in there, which could be reshaped. So, I think
some of that is timing, I would expect it to conform more towards Arch's approach of
total return and not just getting lost on the sauce of coupon income, so that will morph
over time probably throughout the course of 2017.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yeah, it will probably take at least two or three quarters for our investment professionals
to make whatever changes we feel that are appropriate, but at the end of the day, it's
going to be – it's going to look more like the Arch duration and credit quality than what
exist today.

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

Okay. And just a quick follow-up, the coupon in the UGC book it said it's about 3.3%
average, what is the Arch current kind of average coupon?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Closer to 2%.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thanks so much. Just a couple of quick ones, Mark maybe on the investment portfolio just
the yield or the investment income sort of ticked down sequentially, looks like there was
Page 13 of 27



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2016-10-27

some seasonality last year sort of consistent with that, is there anything that we should
think about that's not sort of run rate from third quarter maybe some mortgage-backed
security payouts or something on along those lines that would cause it not to be
consistent.

FINAL

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Every quarter, there is – it's always a new story. So I wouldn't look at in a trend sense. Back
to my total return comments, I mean clearly our investment group harvested some gains
hence the approximate of $100 million of realized gains, I noted, so again based upon our
total return approach, so you get those gains and you put some of that back in to the
extent to which it's put back into fixed income, you've got to deal with new money rates
there.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. So, you've got some harvesting there. Okay, that helps. Thanks. And then,
how should we be thinking about the tax rate, it looks like, so guessing the MI impact has
caused to lift here over the last few quarters, how should we be thinking about that
longer-term once you integrate UGC?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Good question. First, a slight correction to what you said, mortgage was
contributory to that, but remember our mortgage segment is very broad and some of
that is that is out of Bermuda and other jurisdictions.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay I get that (38:34).

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

And the U.S. MI operation clearly was contributing positive underwriting gain at this point,
so they were contributory, but let's not overlook, the facultative unit we talked about on
the property side, the insurance group and the onshore reinsurance group all were
profitable and contributing income. So, it's really the composite of those, Michael, that
actually inched up the effective tax rate.
The second part of your question with UGC, we talked about it on our call about UGC, we
plan on having a subject to approval course with GSEs, a core share facility in place, so
only – roughly half of those exposures and gains will be resident in the U.S. jurisdictions, so
it's going to have an uplift, but probably not the slope of uplift that you might be
contemplating.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. How would tell what I was contemplating you – did you look inside my -

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It was the tone of your voice.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Ah, yes. Thanks. Thanks, and then last really a quick one the Australia quota share, can you
talk about, sort of just how you're thinking about like that on the forward, is that sort of
notionally the right amount, that we should be covering in, I'd just love to get a little bit
more color on the thought process there, is that possible?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. The thought process is more important than the actual specific transactions when –
with everything we do we have an overlay of the risk management. We look at our capital,
we need – how much risk is prudent for us to carry. And at the end of the day, we look for
ways to manage that and reinsurance is one way to do it. So, we'll look at it from a global
perspective, how much MI business we have, how much we will retain – net to our books
and then the rest of it we reinsure out. And that's the attitude with everything that we do,
it's not only on the MI side, it's also on the P&C side both reinsurance and insurance.
And as we said in prior calls going forward as per the acquisition is completed with United
Guaranty, we'll be looking at the MI book including the U.S. book and buying the
appropriate aggregate protection to make sure that we have from a risk management
point of view, the profit parameters.
We always think about PML, we think about PMLs also not on the PMC side only, but also
on the mortgage side and that will drive a lot of our decisions doing a Bellemeade III,
doing an aggregate excess of loss for different years.
As Mark told you the transaction we have with AIG will have in 2016 and prior 2009 to
2016. So, all those years are taken care of, so to speak. And then for us is what we do for
2017, 2018, 2019 as we go forward. But that's the philosophy and is no different than what
– how we run the group for the last 15 years. Measure approach to pricing properly and
then also making sure we don't take too much of the meal independent how profitable
that meal is.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Hi, Sarah.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

Bloomberg Transcript

Wanted to get your latest outlook for mortgage insurance market conditions. One area of
concern I hear sometimes that were late in the credit and economic cycles. So, how much
longer do you think mortgage insurance returns will be good for?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

We don't see anything that clouds the horizon. I think it's pretty clear, all the indications is
that it's a stable market, pricing has been stable, the environment is good. We're
projecting housing prices to be going up somewhere between 3% and 5% next year.
Yes, there is certain states especially the energy states that there might be some issues
but that's what risk is all about. We look at an adjusting pricing on the basis of what the risk
components are. But long-term, we view the market to be very healthy and there's no
indication for us that it's going to change in the next few years.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Okay great. And then additionally, do you expect any FHA rate cut before the election and
what would be the implications of that for you?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I have no idea what the FHA will do. And I don't like to guess. At the end of the day, a lot
will depend on the actuarial work that is going to be done to see what their capital
requirements, if they're meeting the minimum standard. That report usually comes out in
mid-November and so for so on. But we don't anticipate it before the election, but you
never know after the election.

Markets. Your line is open.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you. First is on, there's a report recently regarding the GSE and some of the
risk sharing and regarding some bondholders that are raising issue regarding credit
quality from the reinsurance and the GSEs offloading that. If any thoughts or you had any
conversations with the GSE, is there any real legitimacy to the amount of risk transfer
change going on, appreciate your thoughts.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

We don't basically the GSEs – they're interested in having two avenues, the cash market
and also the reinsurance market. Their allocation has been pretty constant so to speak
about 25% to 35% depending on the quarter to the reinsurance market. And then the rest
of it 65% to 75% in the cash market and they're being consistent with that approach.
Now, I don't believe they have any concerns about the creditworthiness of the reinsurers.
Because at the end of the day, they make the selection as to whom they're going to
allocate these transactions to. So, as a matter of fact for the GSEs is terrific by looking at
the credit quality of the reinsurance and allocate what portion of the deal they want to
allocate to any particular individual.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

All right. Then, I guess on the insurance business on the low vol, you guys had pretty nice
growth and some of the travel and accident and some of the other products and it seems
to be marketplaces that there's lots of interest in the low vol business today. Just curious
if you've seen any additional increase in competition and whether or not your growth is
coming from some new programs coming out or just kind of grind in and out, doing good
work with the existing business and any color on it?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

These are product lines and don't forget, when we build Arch we got into product lines
that nobody wanted to do back in 2002, 2003, 2004, because some of them – they can
Page 17 of 27

FINAL

be slow growth unless you make a major purchase. These things – it requires patience
and perseverance to make them meaningful over time.
Yes, depending on the cycle, there is more competition or less competition, but more
importantly with these kind of products, you have to have a long-term view and a longterm commitment, and it will take time to build volume. It doesn't fit with the thesis of
instant creditification, you know you don't get that with these kinds of product. So, we're
being very patient and we have grown some businesses from nothing to a reasonable
size, I mean our lenders business grew over the years from some $20 million to over $100
million in premium. And we try to find these little nuggets that we work all the time to give
us more control of our portfolio.
And as Marc Grandisson said, and I'll turn it over to you for his comments. That low
volatility business is what we like to build most of our insurance group, not abandoning the
other segments, because the other segments – even though they are volatile in certain
market conditions, you can make a lot of money. If the market is very hot, we'll write a lot
of the coverage that we're not willing to do today, it's not bad business, it's just bad
prices business. When the price improves, it's a good business.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

On travel side, I think I would echo what Dinos just said obviously, but in addition we have
a couple of new transactions that we've entered into programs and have been very, very
nice now going so far. But we also are investing and it's also a very intense technology
play and we are always on the look to build that aspect to the book of business, because
to your point it's low volatility, it's also – it derives sticky, a lot stickier than other business
could be. So, we are definitely focusing evermore and this I think is the reflection of the
premium and our efforts – this is sort of the reflection of our efforts in this space and I
think you should expect more in the future.

was a big transaction that was announced another MI company, what do you think the
possibilities are kind of market share shifts as a result of that, so could that be a positive
for you all?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I don't know the – you're talking about a transaction with a Chinese ownership. So, I think
that's an appropriate question to us to the distributors of the product. I mean this is for
banks to determine if they want to continue to do business or not, but not for us so I
would know, I have no, I have the faintest idea if their reaction will be positive or negative.

Q - Brian Meredith

I think that we have a certainly one individual that joined us and that was obviously publicly
discussed. We are exploring at this point we're really looking around and try to see
whether there's something to be done there, whether it's Arch or not I mean we have all
the things on the table. We're exploring what is out there, but certainly we did an LPT last
quarter as you remember. We do think that space has that lends itself to a level of
heightened interest at this point in time.
I think we're certainly in the place where rates have been going down in certain sectors
and some clients may have, may be running out of patience and tolerance for some
books of business and certainly we are always, Dinos and I always looking forward to
provide services and products to the marketplace that would help the industry and that's
certainly one area. But we're still working through it and when we have something we'll
obviously let you know.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

We'll announce the details – but listen the theme here is every time you come out of a
soft market I know surely we'll come out of a soft market there is repair work that needs
to be done and we want to participate in the repair.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Makes sense. And then just lastly I know you talked a fair amount about the retro you
bought on the Australian book. I know you guys have great analytics stuff was there
anything behind it that you looked at the housing prices in Australia and there's a lot of
talk about people think they're kind of really peaking out here. Any concerns there?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

No concern whatsoever. This is more from an aggregation point of view how much you
want to have from an overall MI book of business because there are the reinsurance that
they participate on the deal they've got pretty good return characteristics, we're going to
make some good money on it. At the end of the day either you'll add a lot of capital to
new balance sheet and you may have maybe a little over commitment to one line of
business versus others or you try to keep the balance and this was more balancing from
our perspective.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

You mentioned that UK pricing down 5%. I assume those (54:41) those, UK lot of specialty
markets is that experience leading the market down or is that lagging the market? And do
we need to be worried about another sort of step downward in pricing for the market in
general, most of your competitors have not been so grim about pricing conditions?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

The UK market is extremely competitive and has been for a long time especially the
traditional Lloyds placement and international business and open brokerage. So that's
going on, that's been going on for a little while so it's not new Josh, but in terms of
leading where it's going to go unfortunately we, I'm afraid that we'll have to experience
further rate decreases going forward. I think there's a lot of competition ahead in the
London market and the UK market more broadly. So, but again things may change and
some of that happen, it may change things overnight. But there's certainly is a lot of
competition out there, we don't see anything ebbing at this point of time.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

we rather say what we see and you guys make the judgments if others are not willing to
talk about it.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

Josh, I would add and it's probably valuable information. By their own accounts Lloyds has
about a 3% on the current underwriting here about a 3% to 4% return expectation return
on capacity, so that tells you something about the absolute rate level.

I think the shifting in our book of business I mean people are working extremely hard to
transform or to just gradually over the cycle as we try to do, as we've been working on for
the last 10 years to shift towards low volume – controllable business, it takes a lot of work
and lot of effort. So, I would just say that it's just a shifting and realigning our expertise and
assets for our people towards different lines of business. Things are transportable across
lines of business not like an excess D&O, you can only do excess D&O and there's a lot of
stuff that that person can – enhance the culture and the understanding as to how we

know over their career with us. They're going to have good years and they're going to
have some not so good years. But overall, if they produce for our shareholders, they're
going to make very good money. And for those who have been and we have a pretty

That the limit is still 25% for everything.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

FINAL

Well, no. The 25%, is what our board allows us to risk, assuming we like the pricing and the
risk reward relationships, right. The fact that we're at 7.4% today is an underwriting
judgment the management team is making, it's not a restriction by book. But if -

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Sure.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

But if rates quadruple tomorrow, I can go to 50% of capital exposure on PML without
going back to my board and saying, hey that 25 is too low and you've got to change it,
and if we change it, we're going to come and tell you, because I think shareholders need
to know what kind of exposure you take.

Bloomberg Transcript

You know, don't forget, and I don't know what other MI companies do, but we do PML
calculations on the MI business also. You know, and it's a requirement, by our risk
committee of the board, you know that every quarter we'll talk about you know how much
is our PML you know, on our MI business, and that's the reason we had all these
discussions about, you know how much reinsurance both you know quota share or
aggregate excess of loss or transactions like Bellemeade I, Bellemeade II, or similar type
of transactions we might do in the future.
You know so all of that is around understanding that we have one simple principle that
drives our risk management philosophy, that independent of what event happens. We
have to not injure the balance sheet to the point that we not in a very strong competitive
position the day after.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Exactly, that's what I was trying to get at. Because I guess when I heard 25% of everything
as a limit I guess I thought that that's essentially the P&C capital will be – whatever that
would be 35% or 40% or something like that. So, see what I was getting at?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Not quite.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I mean it's – 25%

Go ahead – I can.

FINAL

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

If 25% of equity capital is a limit, it's a pretty safe limit. You know for adverse conditions.
You're talking about in one in a 250 type of events. So, the PML calculations that we do for
our MI business, it's somewhat even worse than the recent financial crisis we have passed.
We have gone back all the way to the depression era. And factor in a lot of available – and
skimpy available statistical information to come up with some reasonable assumptions as
to what how things might look like if we have events of that nature and we still want this
company not only to survive but to be in a strong competitive position the day after.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Fair enough. So, the other thing I was going to ask you I think you mentioned some surety
losses are party attritional, can you just remind me sort of how you approach that
business is it sort of a vanilla construction bonds or is it tend to be some commercial
surety or?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

It was a construction bond, it was a construction – it's a surety. One of our contractors
messed up and we have to step in and you saw a lot of prices, some steady and level
(01:03:02) in Connecticut, you know.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Got it, got it and is it residential or commercial?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It's commercial, commercial surety.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay so.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It's building of the baseball stadium.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

It's contract surety but a commercial surety.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Commercial is good.

Surety and MI, there's no clash there, because these are all...

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

What about a bad credit cycle right?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

Yeah.

If you had a bad credit cycle construction.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou
