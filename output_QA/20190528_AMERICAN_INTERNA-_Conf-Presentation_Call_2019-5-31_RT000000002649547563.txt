Bloomberg Transcript

Well, thank you for joining us. We're pleased that we have Mark Lyons here from AIG Mark
is the CFO and I guess that we're just talking still technically the Chief Actuary, but that will
probably end pretty soon, hopefully. I assume, most people in room know Mark, before
this Mark was working at ArchCapital, both as the CFO, and for time via had been
insurance practice there. And I guess almost about a one-year anniversary move to AIG,
maybe 11 months.

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

July 1, so yeah.

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

July 1, so that's been very fruitful, and so feel free, I mean open it up to the audience for
questions. I'll try and get the ball rolling a little bit and I'm sure that I won't be alone.
Something on everyone's mind, obviously which I think people know, but we can reiterate
a little bit on where the guidance is for 2019, maybe what's going to be the thought about
the practice of guidance after 2019, and has anything changed since December, when
that guidance is put in place.

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well, thanks, Josh. Thanks for inviting me here today. Yeah, a few things I could reiterate.
Josh, I remember from all my days I hate guidance.
But I love giving insight, so I'll reaffirm some things. So Brian had talked about the 2019
year coming in, there was a lot of unclear definitions, I think of what it is. But for the full
year and the accident quarter and the accident year is sub 100, even with AAL, which after

Page 1 of 17



Company N ame: American I nternational Group I nc
Company Ticker: AI G US Equity
Date: 2019-05-28

we'll get into. So one that was accomplished in the first quarter, and we continue to feel
that will be accomplished throughout the year, on the general chart side.

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

FINAL

And so that's in terms of premium volume and investment income, I guess?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yeah, premium volume. We said be roughly flat and we continue to say that, there are
premium last year 2018 was $27 billion in change and continue this, I think it's the same
thing.

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And with the premium volume, I mean you bought a lot of reinsurance this year to change
the earnings profile at least the volatility and hopefully increase the earnings. Does that
mean that on a growth return basis? There's AIG is now growing its business and able to
offset the higher reinsurance purchases?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, you saw a quarter-over-quarter that GWP[ph] basis about 10% to 11% up quarterover-quarter, a lot of that was due to Validus coming in as well as more in Glatfelter.
But there were other areas as well. But there were I think to your point, you had that
directional growth in gross, but in that it actually follow-up a couple percentage points.
And some of that was due to direct underwriting actions, some of that was due to an
increase in seated -- definitely increase in seated. So -- but you got to also think about
how does that stuff work to get booked, and when you have quarter shares of course, it
kind of maybe lagged 45 days, but it gets pretty much follows the growth.
But on XLOs, CATs, per risks, the booking, different companies do it different ways, the
way AIG does it you get an annualized 411 contract which is what most of them were. You
get an annualized estimate upfront you book it is written and then it's earned over a full
year term, as supposed to having four written estimates that are earned over a quarterly
term. So the earnings are seated earnings are unaffected, but the written recognition is
different, more front ended.

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And so the reinsurance program will certainly having a bring down catastrophe volatility.
It should be -- the hope is it's going to help contribute as well as underwriting of course to
improve profitability. Is there a trade-off between the loss profile of the reinsurance
transactions, in the expense profile? And how they affect AIG?

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

FINAL

well, normally we revive for a couple of reasons and in any market, in any company I think
AIG is skewed more towards volatility containment. If I the racket first, secondly was the
change the net mix of business towards your better business. And third, is generally
capital benefits or something, this was not done for capital purposes.
And I think what we'll see over time as the front end gross underwriting which any good
company has to do is fix and have strong growth front and underwriting changes in our
views, of it changes and as to what we're changing internally, the pricing we're pushing it
certainly selected markets, I think gets outside of collaboration, that will affect our view of
what we do with reinsurance. So, I would expect some of what we put in place would
probably going to renew and some of it may be lessened a bit, so -- and there probably
would start to be outside of CAT, a more quota share usage than XLO[ph] usage.

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And so, I guess on the topic of being done for capital reasons, which you're not doing it
for so much. Where do you stand right now with the rating agencies? And what their
demands are? And how that's directing your strategies for underwriting at this point?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, we've gone through all of our meetings with all the four majors.
And I think fits already came out and reaffirmed S&P, took off still A+, but took off the
negative watch which may have been a drag on the company, that's been restated
sustainable for we're very happy about that. Moody's review, we haven't seen anything in
writing, I expect that to be pretty much the same, but I can't really speak for any agency.
And I think invest is still going through its analysis and deliberations, but we expect to hear
from them in late June.

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And in terms of Capital Management, I think that look if we go back in time 6 months ago,
the stock was below 40, now the stock's price 52 share today, 36 but its counting.

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yeah. If we think about that sort of -- six months ago it was gone how we got to buy back
so many shares we can, given the price, but price is different now. What sort of the
calculation Brian wasn't really willing to give anything away in the conference call about his
buyback intentions, although you have almost $2 billion authorization sitting out there if
you want to act.

Josh Shanker

I guess between debt retirement, share repurchase, M&A buffer capital, like how do we
should think about what AIG's going to do with the cash that it's generating right now.

FINAL

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

You're sure they laid out the landscape. That's you're competing alternatives, as to what
to do? The answer will likely change every quarter. Well, let me ask after it, first indirectly
by saying, well looking at our debt to capital, it's too high for me. So, I think some funds
need to be diverted to reduce it, not a penny, not a crazy fix it in one year, two year type
area, but when you're pushing 30 points, no matter what rating agency, they have a little
different definitional metrics.

Bloomberg Transcript

That to me is on the high end, I want to make some progress on that, and you can do that
overtly in the numerator or you can print the black ink like we did last quarter, and help it
through retained earnings. So I think in '19, it will be denominator help and I think forward,
except maybe some minor things. And on a forward basis like I'd like to be more overt
about it. With regard to -- so I view that as a higher priority that may have been viewed in
past years.
Share repurchases, as you've said, it's attractive will show on an absolute basis, on a
relative basis not so much so because we're at 50 duration in plan. So that's always on
the -- it's always discussed every quarter, all this stuff is it's not inadvertent. There might
be some aspects of buffer maintenance and so forth, and there's no shortage of
investment bank glossy books coming in but, I view that more that we still have Validus
that we're integrating and there's some aspects of it that I think we've integrated with
people and talent and giving broader definitions to some people, and some in CAT
modeling and other strengths that they clearly had, we're using that, but that really needs
to be what's the deal shut, the real work begins is not like the deals over. So, I want to
make sure that is tight as well.

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And when you said the Deutsche capital is too high now, my memory on there's a lot of
very long data debt with 8% coupons out there. I think since you've been at AIG and
probably been planning these sort of things, the 10 year has fallen probably by about 75
bps I guess over that period of time. The best laid plans of might one, how easy it is to
tender for and retire 20, 30, 40 year debt with an 8% coupon in a 3% US tenure treasury
environment versus 2.3% tenure treasury environment.

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yeah.
It does take a little bit of the year coming. But AIG has roughly billion -- $3.5[ph] billion of
debt over the next few calendar years coming in June. And I think when I look backwards,
AIG has done a good job of refinancing, take advantage of interest rates and cycles, but

Page 4 of 17

FINAL

doesn't help that ratios, so the leverage helps the income statement aspect of it. So
there's opportunities to come up from time-to-time in blocks.
There's opportunities to come up in one, I can just be overworked and simply not issue
new debt to replace expiring debt. And you might have noticed we get a small amount of
NC preferred, professional preferred. We're very light on that the capital stack and you do
get permanent capital and certainly from Moody's you get 50% stakes in equity credit for
it. So, I think there's more place for that in the capital stack as well.
So by shrinking classic that overtime, pretty more profits and expanding the debt to
include more preferred, I think it's directionally where we're going to go.

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Alright. And I think the warrants are now in the money?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

That's right.

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The ability to retire warrants and this is too illiquid versus retiring shares or is there any
sort of thoughts on that part of the capital structure?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Haven't given a ton of attention at this time.
But you're right. You got to be careful with it, whether you're in or out, but I'm more
focused on what I just mentioned.

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Alright. And I want to open up the floor to questions, I mean I have plenty of questions,
but if people want to ask them, will allow them to or I can just keep going.
See no one no questions, doing a great job. I think John has a question over here.

Analyst
Hi. Can you just remind us, that reserve difference between the block of business your
insurer of Berkshire and what you can say about that?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Page 5 of 17



Company N ame: American I nternational Group I nc
Company Ticker: AI G US Equity
Date: 2019-05-28

The question is what can I do to --

Analyst

FINAL

The reserve differences between the business during the Berkshire apparently, they have
a different reserve than you and is quite substantial difference and what -- and how you
respond to that?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well, I can't completely speak for Berkshire, that I've never stopped me before.
So, first of I bet you're going to find mirror images of any sealing and assuming company.
You just never see it because I thought this close so firstly. Secondly, there in a radically
different put it this way if I had like 0.02214 in the surplus ratio, I would have more options
as well. So any news that they find is going to be positive news, but it can go the other
way.
So but -- over not that you have to excuse you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Analyst
So, look I'm happy to have you here. You tend to be very good at answering the technical
questions, as well as the -- just get those answers that's the easier ones to. So, I was
looking through the financials and last year I think GAAP 2017 versus 2018, the combined
ratio or the loss ratios were generally flattish.
There might be a little bit difference, but ex cap basically more or less flattish. But if I look
at the statutory financials, I see huge improvements in lines like workers compensation,
other liability, commercial line and we're talking about potentially in some cases 500-600
basis points of improvements, I mean 1000 basis points of improvement. And can you talk
a little bit about if someone's running through your financials line by line in the step filings?
Why the improvements are so sizable on the staff side? And they're not coming through
the GAAP side. And B, if there is something going on here, does that bode well for '19
results? Are we seeing that out earlier than we should?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Okay.
I'll call that part of A through A of the SAT question. So well, first definitionally, the head
the other than defense myself, when I got joined AIG Financial supplement information
10-K, information is the whole enchilada. And therefore, there's no intercompany
reinsurance issues that matter. Schedule B is really a reflection of the US Pool, there's
reinsurance that comes in and then the adjustments in schedule in the consolidated
schedule peak, which I have to talk to him about because almost unreadable, need a

Page 6 of 17



Company N ame: American I nternational Group I nc
Company Ticker: AI G US Equity
Date: 2019-05-28

magnifying glasses either that stuff, takes out the major, but not all of the internal
reinsurance originated.

FINAL

So when we step back and think about you got a couple of things happening and then I'll
get into some of the line-by-line things is --

Analyst
And by the way you supply these adjustments to shareholders, if they want to see them,
you make them there easier to find and they're on the other two right even writing a
small, that's right?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

That is true. You can download it and blow it up as legally, as big as you like. So you've got
a couple of things happening as I'll call the US business is shrinking, I'll say the core here
pre Validus US business in some areas is shrinking, you're having higher percentages in
the internal quota shares that are coming in, some of them are removed it and those
adjustments, but not all of those are removed. So you've got a little bit of that happening.

Bloomberg Transcript

Some of them like if I talk to commercial auto for example. Commercial auto, it is
reduced, it's reduced to the still and it's unacceptably high loss ratio. What I have to
double check whether it's less ratio or combined ratio that tells me something, right. So
there's some of those that -- so and reason I'm bringing that up just to be brutal on this.
When your loss ratios are close to 80 or 100 percentile in the industry, it's pretty simple to
institute some of the changes. If we were trying to go from 65 percentile to 50 or from
50 from top percentile, that's a lot more microscope have been showing together. There
are big changes that we can make that have big impacts, only part of which would be felt
in actually year '18, which to your question portends well and so I think actually year '19. So
of course, a lot I would view that way depends on other lines would work which otherwise
other abilities must be a big one that has that trend, even improvements in workers
comp, but other liability in commercial auto is by far and away 2,500 basis points of
improvement year-over-year.

Analyst
And then the question, I would have is why on the GAAP triangles, when we don't have
the same granularity, but also we have I guess more internal actuarial discipline on the
GAAP financials. Well, why don't we see those numbers come through it all same year that
come through on stack?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

So, let's look at the relative proportions between it. So AIG's net reserve, loss and loss
expense reserves after ADC and everything else, that's about $50 billion. Daniel
statement will be 35-ish, 33-ish.
Page 7 of 17



Company N ame: American I nternational Group I nc
Company Ticker: AI G US Equity

FINAL

So that's two thirds of represented there and that's the unadjusted numbers, right. And
some of that then goes backwards, because to being undone, which will reduce that ratio
even more, probably approaching 50%. So of the loss ratios, you're quoting like-for-like
on that that's about 50% of the total action. So if you have -- I mean everything I declare
you got something to improve.
Yeah it's totals the same you got some that have worsened. And you've got worsening in
personal lines in a lot of areas, even CAT controlled, not only in the US I think we spoke to
that on the call, but also internationally and you've had minor changes in other areas. So
whether it is energy related businesses in and things like that, you see some movements.
So -- but getting back to that, I think the core part of your question is because it were -that's US pool with the bigger intercompany foreign business trip down.

Bloomberg Transcript

So it gets back to the US business, so other liability also mixed, its business from year-toyear between primary and excess, with excess decreasing and at a quicker rate. And then
the changes that started to come in only partially of which, because it's actually you're so
concerned for it, would have been fell in 2018. But the changes in -- casually are just
enormous. So when that try to understand this, the issues that we encountered AIG, it's
not anything we've never seen before on the management team.
We've all seen it -- we did -- the difference is they are deeper and there's more of them
simultaneously. So that's why you need a team that has a lot of experience on seeing
these kinds of things and ranking them and going through and getting a team, I'd like to
say that every area of general insurance was visited by medical practitioners. Some got
RN, some got the doctors, some areas got a team of surgeons and that was North
American commercial, that got a team of surgeons. But everything that medical attention,
but that required a lot more.
So some of the changes I'm highlighting and you're observing, I think are completely
reasonable, because of where they were, and the changes that have happened. And the
kinds of things we don't talk about, because it's not as quantifiable, is the shifts of
distribution and welcoming in the wholesale channel, which really had not been fruitful or
actually being immaterial really fits that AIG The way Lexington is being re-stood up, if you
will, creates a wholesale strategy, opens up a whole channel, and that was a really use
before, as well as a whole set of new wholesale producers. That moves you downscale,
also into the size of accounts that are there. Just AIG has a reputation of writing the big
jumbos, and in fact that's altering and that's changing.
So that's -- there's distribution changes, risk appetite changes, gross underwriting
changes, reinsurance changes, all by themselves were pretty massive. So as the funnel
broadens and the risk coming in are more diverse from distribution channels, more
tailored to the risk appetite, that's been overly communicative on the outside world of
distribution, and that's coming in and even if you don't change anything on rate level, your
rate adequacy increases, because the average quality -- the risk coming in is better. And
interestingly and I'll you see I just gave me a stream of consciousness, so I apologize I'm
going on too long here, but when we measure the rate adequacy, everybody talks about
renewal rate change, right. And that's a standard measure and we do too.

Page 8 of 17



FINAL

Company N ame: American I nternational Group I nc
Company Ticker: AI G US Equity
Date: 2019-05-28

But when you look at how the portfolio is changing and any cluster of lines of business or
sub line, we look at the relative rate adequacy of new business coming in of loss business
and of the business that was renewed, as well as what were the changes on that
renewed business, and there's no requirement, this is the new AIG There is no
requirement for premium volume to grow, margins that driver not premium volume. So
even if premium shrunk, if operating income went up or underwriting gain or loss went up.
But first that natural we're striving towards, so I would view 2019 as a another year of
surgery. A portfolio construction that's continuing to I think reap benefits.
So that will continue to reap benefits in '19, it's going to continue to reap in '20. But that's - I think I have incomplete thought there. The rate adequacy difference of new business
coming in first of what's being lost at the door is enormous, not marginal, enormous. And
that's to me, the implicit rate increase on the book of business.

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And that business going out the door I mean they're certainly talk about. We are now in a
town called a micro hardening market, I'm a big skeptic that there's anything more than
losses out there, that sound like there's -- but also there's some pricing improvements
out there, and people say, "hey, it's because AIG is got religion and they're putting less
prosperous", but this business that you're letting go isn't that attractive, I'm guessing or at
least someone's going to write it I suppose. Like how do you think about the business
going out the door with some price -- at some price it's good business or maybe I've
actually heard it sometimes at no price, there's some business that's good at no price.

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well, it's going somewhere, you know here big crisis of big self-insured retentions or that
there's an insurance crisis and nobody can find coverage.
So clearly going somewhere. If I break that into two chunks, let's say large commercial
risks and DNO risks, so large commercial AIG was writing multi-billion dollar policies out
there, sometimes multi-year. Big nets, I will go through all that you've heard Peter Zaffino,
will talk about that. But huge nets up big nets.
So when AIG either doesn't renew it, or stays on it at a much smaller capacity for grins,
let's say was $2 billion expiring in $100 million and $150 million renewed, they have a -workers have to go out and find a lot of markets, and they might need seven or eight to
fill in that gap to capacity which means they had -- probably had to go to 25 to get it done.
So initially, we weren't really sure of how much broker receptivity we would have, because
they're really having to work a lot harder to get it done. And we got a few phone calls on
that regard. But ultimately on the ones we've retained, when we have dropped our limits
gargantuanly like that our GWP was almost negligible difference.
So that followed two things, it's either we raise our price for that, or what we are charging
in the past for the capacity was woefully inadequate and the answer is both on that side.
So on the DNO side though, AIG has always been a top two or three primary DNO

Page 9 of 17

FINAL

market, an 800 pound gorilla[ph]. When we were out at Arch competing against it, we
could see that they were influencing terms and conditions, but not really price. Now the
800 pound gorilla[ph] attitude is being brought up on the front end.
And prices being pushed materially. And to your point, I would say AIG on the DNO front is
leading the increases and I would say some in property, and some areas were benefiting
from the actions of others, but in most areas I think we're being self-determined and
others are benefiting from us. So we go back to the broker analogy, like I made on the
property side. Brokers now find that their placements are getting a little easier now,
because with the stronger AIG primary in place, it's easier to complete the lead access
and what follows.
And on DNO, there's higher switching costs than you might think, everybody likes to talk
about national account business, three-line deals comes a lot of, all the collateral, TPAs,
it's tough to switch. In DNO, there's legal contractual stickiness. So a lot of manuscripting
going on, a lot of those -- there are bigger accounts anyway are very complex, years and
years have been brought into integrate something attractive to the customer, attractive to
the insurer, and you don't want to throw that out and start over again. So there's a lot of
motivation to stay, and so it's actually been very heartening inside the company, I mean
being able to push like that, see that it's sticking, sister lines of businesses are looking at
that and we're telling them to look at that.

Bloomberg Transcript

And see what they should be doing it to, that they can move the market, our AIG has
shrunk, but it's still a force and let's use that force.

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And expense ratio, I mean looking you guys have a lot of businesses in international lines
and some of your warranty lines that are high expense ratio businesses. If we look at US
Commercial, it doesn't look that out of whack with the rest of the market, but there's
clearly some extra expense in there, although talking to people I know work for AIG feels
like the expense -- the thumbscrews are on pretty tightly. How much more can AIG do on
the expense side, when what's the timeline?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well, it has been a lot of I think strength around cost containment and expense
management.
Preceding this, I actually looked back Josh, at one of your notes that you said that turn
around part 2 or when is this going to happen? And you may -- you did your C&A XL[ph]
comparison, they've gotten an article role in certain right now. And you made the
comment of CNA, I think have been 220[ph] bps to 225[ph] bps of GOE ratio
improvement. And now AIG has been there, it's been to 40 to 50 for two quarters in a
row, well 40 says a fluke, we've been -- we were saying at least since I got there into 3Q,
that this was underway, but it wasn't self-evident yet, became self-evident in fourth
quarter, I think became more sustainably self-evident in the first quarter. So that's about

Page 10 of 17

FINAL

the only comparison I would make, would see and I could you -- that was something you
would pushed out.
But there are still -- and leave you a lot of opportunities that won't be cutting into bone
and muscle, so there are still a lot of process, there's a lot of manual process, there's a
lot of checkers checking the checkers, which I think is a lot of opportunity for improvement
in change. Some of which is automation related, some of which is just post say, let's reevaluate how things are done in the company. And there's going to be real emphasis on
that, but what you've squeezed out of that is not only cost, but efficiency. I think a lot what
we've done to date has been caused first efficiency.
Second, we'll -- I think we've been looking more towards efficiency first class second. So, I
still think there's more room for improvement.

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And if nobody wants to ask any questions, I have a warning we're going to go onto life
insurance. So you can stop me from asking life insurance questions.

Analyst

Bloomberg Transcript

Just wondering around the competitive environment and what you are saying Lloyd's of
London has scaled back a bit of volume over the last year. So is that making it easier for
you to pick up business? So how are you seeing things?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

I think it's easier for us to push the market. Lloyd's has been disciplined and it's -- if you
look out, you see trade press, and you do see Lloyd's AIG in the same breath and a lot of
those. So, I would think it's good that to have the companion to help -- a sizable
companion to push back on the marketplace, more than it's an opportunity for us to get
business.

Analyst
I can't remember, if it's you or Brian, but you've talked about the double-digit ROE within
the next three years. Can you just talk about your confidence or visibility in terms of
getting to that target and the key drivers behind it?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

So, it sounds a good question. So, yeah, I'll reaffirm that too back to your original question
of double-digits in calendar 2021, so three years out. So interestingly, that also
contemplates having I'll say our Legacy Fortitude at the current level of ownership, that
doesn't comfortably getting any improvements or betterment in that.

Let's say those efforts would not be written down to make that. That's right?

FINAL

That's right.

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay.

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

So in order for that to happen, what really -- look at AIG big picture, you've got left
retirement, you got GOE, you've got this legacy melting ice cube, and you've got
corporate which is an amalgamation of expense, corporate eliminations interest expense.

Bloomberg Transcript

So call it's a drag on our way, that's how I view it. So to hit 10, you got to have L&R and AGI
both north of 10 for it to happen and that's part of the plan. I think you're focused
probably mostly on AGI, that's been the drag on the operation. And it won't be linear, but
it won't be back ended.
So when we go from '19 to '20 to '21, it's not like we're saying that's going to marginally
improve 50 bps and then with the balance improvements going to be in 2021. It won't be
linear, but it'll be better than that the first example. A lot of that is going to come from
these massive underwriting changes that we're making, it's going to come from the
increased GOE discipline that we talked about, that has opportunities not just in North
America but elsewhere. And if you look at the -- as we look at the year of and even the
quarter-over-quarter on international, you prove it felt there was all expense ratio
improvement, the loss ratio, I had to get underneath that's right ,because competing
mostly from a North American lands and say AIG's trying to get in low 20s and low 60s.
How's that possible? That's what travelers does. Travelers in North American Centric
Organization, I look at it like this now. North America is 67, international is 57, and if they
are perfectly weighted to be 62, we print the 61 A, it was weighted a little bit more
towards international. But big picture, you've got a big slug been running a pretty
consistent 55 to 57 actually.
And there have been some volatility in that and created some of those spikes, so working
on that to reduce that volatility and that mix and the same continuing what we do in North
America. The acquisition ratios, little tougher, because that's a kind of just the
consequence of your mix of business. But all of those are going to be worked out, but the
net is the path is to have GI North of that, L&R North of that. So that it more than offsets
the drag of the corporate operations, I'll call that.

So net flows are positive in the annuity business in 1Q, '19.
It's been a long time since that happen I think about 2.5, 3 years. I was on the strength of
fixed annuity sales. How sustainable is a positive net flow environment for AIG's
retirement business? And especially given 10 years lower now, maybe there was a surge
in to fixed annuities in one cube, because of the fork you sell often people got scared. Is
that a really a leading indicator of something positive to come or should the 1Q flow
results be taken with a grand slant.

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well you do have -- look, interest rates clearly are something people are going to look at.
They are also going to look at spreads and market volatility. Market volatility from
prevention from going elsewhere was helpful. I think the drag of that volatility in 4Q,1Q is
still in the minds of an investor.
So, I don't -- short-term don't see that having that big of a negative impact. Historically,
we've seen that what on -- when you have some pressure on inflow, on fixed annuities,
you generally have a slowdown maybe not proportional, but a slowdown in withdrawals
and other outflows, whether it's because the competing alternatives aren't that great
either, or behavioral finance, people are afraid that to move it. But any reduction in inflow
is not immediately, or correspondingly affected on our withdrawals the other way, so
that's part of a buffer. I think the thing to keep in mind on AIG's book of retirement
business, especially, in the IR section is as you mentioned.
It's just very well distributed, it's about a third between fixed index and variable. When I
look across at the competitive landscape, pacific life has that profile, but they're half the
size. Most of other carriers are dominated or predominant in one of those three. And
therefore, I think they're more susceptible.
Our customers can choose a little bit more what it is that they want and not having one
product pedaled. So, I think that place -- that part of it anyways going to be helpful.

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And on the group retirement side, it seems to me there's the business benefits greatly
from economies of scale. There's a lot of competition out there too.
Is there a need to be this much competition? Will there be fewer competition? Is AIG a
consolidator of this market? And given where AIG is currently playing in 41-K, 457, 43B, are
there barriers or say most that AIG can defend its position without getting larger?

Well, I mean TIAA[ph] and Fidelity of the 800-pound gorilla show. And they dominate the
record-keeping space of that's asking them to about two-thirds of that market. And with
that of course, you get else every business, but there aren't a ton of small guys to really
double up. Just probably going to be continuing some level of consolidation on that, but
when you can look at the competitive space, in the competitive space in which AIG
operates.
When you go back to your 41-K, 403B[ph] and your 457, it's really different ballgame, 41-K
is our corporate. That for years, I don't know five years anyway that flows have been
negative out the door. You're getting boomers and others, either there's a lot more -- it's
not in the accumulation phase, it's in distribution phase. And that's expected to continue,
so those that continue to march head long and expand in the 41-K space, god bless them.

Bloomberg Transcript

403B[ph] is the not for profit space, it's where we've really been focusing on. And yes
we're in healthcare and some levels of governmental and schools, and there's different
schools of segments and all that. But that on average is a younger workforce, so you're
more on average and accumulation, more than distribution. And 457s are easy to think of
them as like a top have plans or deferred comp plans, to some of the same spaces,
those would get more the emphasis.
And AIG's strategy for what I can -- it can have gleaned from all the strategy documents
that I've seen, is to really be involved -- attempt to be involved in the life cycle of a client.
So whether it's group and you're in there early on and you got a lot of 20s and 30 year
olds in there, and you make things digital, you make things more easy on a topic that you
sell, not buy basically. It's helpful, so that when you get to roll over time your top of mind.
And average age of rollers is about 55 years.
Going out of that into the IRA market is you can clearly see that demographic happening
and that's an area of emphasis as well. So, net-net, I see you minimize the negatives of
the flows by choosing where you're going to be. And the more you stay in port -- your
corporate 401K[ph], the flows are going to be outward and against you.

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And, I guess going full circle back to little guidance, I get some you're not going to get this
guidance, but maybe I can get something.
Cash flow, how should we think about, how quickly you can monetize the DTA? And if we
can think we can figure out what AIG's cash flow is on their earnings? Maybe you -- can we
talk about little bit how much extra we can put on from the DTA? And how quickly you can
monetize that, given new tax laws? And what not maybe what discount rate internally AIG
thinks about it, is it appropriate for valid in DTA?

FINAL

Well. If you look at our 10-K, you're going to see 14 -- $15 billion of net DTA, but $4 billion
of that roughly is probably record normal. That everyone has, it's not unique to AIG, it's
not a result of the financial crisis. So, when we report adjusted ROE's, and ROE's on book
value versus including AOCI versus AOCIs excluding DTA as well.
It's that really $10 billion that subtracted out. That's the typical -- the balance would be with
any company has, so timing difference between GAAP and tax and this kind of reserves,
all that kind of stuff that creates those timing differences. So that $10 billion, you should
think of as being split 7 and 3, 7 and well 3 foreign tax credits. I think it's fair to say with the
trouble GI has, that has been the life and retirement, that vision has been the consumer
of it.
And the foreign tax credits largely expire in the next three years. And we expect those to
be utilized. NOL's is much more a function of general insurance. General insurance
improvements, so my -- if kind of these question, if we're going to be hearing to that 10%
ROE by 2021, GI is going to be throwing off.
A lot of income that should be cash protected by consumption of the DTA, and that's
what we're anticipating on that not -- I agree that chapter reverse of it, but it hangs
together that we expect that to be consumed of those the -- I think it goes through -- I
think 2028 is the line share of it. It'll extend longer than that, but I think that's the line
share. But we expect to increasingly consume it.

Bloomberg Transcript

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And in a normalized year, I guess not really -- but your mathematics on that, the foreign
tax credits can be used by either departments and so therefore you have profit either
one that can consume that and the -- but the NOL's only the P&C business?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

No, there's restrictions on like 35%, 65%, restrictions on what can be consumed.
So there's a higher life cut consumption of FTC's and on NOL's. So it will consume, but GI
needs to step up to really eat them.

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And, I guess the goal that Connie[ph] was talking about will be on adjusted ROE, again
excluding DTA.

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

That's correct.

Excluding AOCI

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

FINAL

And DTA, with consumption will be less the subtract.

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And you also, I guess have a -- not you guys exclude that but, there is a couple of billion
dollars of equity in the deferred gain on the ADC, that also doesn't earn a return I guess?

Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

That's true. In fact that's what you'll -- that's what goes through the income statement that
you see $55 million to $60 million, a quarter goes through on that recognition. On that
recognitions of the deferred and recognitions for that amortization I should say.

Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

So if that is right, there's an earnings element although, some people exclude that from
GAAP, and some people exclude that from adjust, I guess there's some different
accounting for that. And there's really 10 seconds left. So that's it. I mean I gave all the
chances and we're done.
