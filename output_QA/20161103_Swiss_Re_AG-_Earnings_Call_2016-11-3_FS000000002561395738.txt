MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to Swiss Re's Third Quarter 2016 Results
Conference Call. Please note that today's conference call is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Cole, Group CFO. Please go
ahead.

David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Good morning or good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q3 2016 results
conference call. I'm here today with Matt Weber, our Group Chief Underwriting Officer;
and Guido Fürer, our Group Chief Investment Officer; along with Philippe Brahin, our Head
of Investor Relations.

FINAL

Let me just start with a brief overview of the results that we published this morning. As
you're seeing, Q3 was a strong quarter for Swiss Re with positive contributions from all of
our business units. Group net income was $1.2 billion for the quarter, bringing us to a total
net income for the first nine months of $3 billion. Both the Q3 ROE, as well as the ROE for
the first nine months demonstrate that we maintain the quality of our underwriting and
investment portfolios in a challenging market.
During Q3, reinsurance delivered $896 million of net income, underpinned by the solid
underwriting performance of our P&C and Life & Health businesses. Corporate Solutions
reported an ROE of 16.5% for the quarter and Life Capital delivered strong gross cash
generation of $248 million. The Group ROI for the quarter was a strong 3.5%.
We also announced this morning that we'll launch the share buyback program as
authorized by the 2016 shareholders meeting. We'll launch it tomorrow the 4th of
November, as we've already received all the necessary approvals to allow us to do so.
Finally, we underlined in our presentation the continued external recognition of our
engagement in sustainability. The Swiss Re was again named Industry Leader in the Dow
Jones Sustainability Indices as well as other indices.
With that, I'll hand over to our Head of Investor Relations, Philippe Brahin, who will
introduce the Q&A.

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Many thanks, David, and good day to all of you also from my side. So as usual, before we
start the Q&A, I would like to remind you to please restrict yourself to two questions and
register again for follow-up questions.
So with that, operator, could we please have the first question?

Q&A
Operator
The first question comes from Thomas Seidl, Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. First question is actually on your targets. David, you just
mentioned the ROE target is 700 bps above risk free, roughly 8.5% and 10% economic
network growth. Now at nine months, you have 11.6%. If you normalize just the P&C Re
segment, so you overrun to the tune of $800 million and then realize gains, the highest in
2011, a few hundred million of over-earnings there, I would say so.

FINAL

On an underlying basis, would you say you're pretty close to the 8.5% ROE level, right
now? And if so, what makes you confident that with the continued price pressure, you can
meet this target over the next one, two years? That's my first question.
And the second then, regarding the two P&C segments. In both segments, the underlying
loss ratio increased significantly. I think in the – P&C Re is up 5 percentage points, 6
percentage points, and in the CorSo segment, 8 percentage point, roughly speaking. So,
what were the drivers? And again, what makes you confident that you come back to the
previous levels here?

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

All right. Thank you, Thomas. I'll pick up the first question, and I'll ask Matt to respond to
your second. So indeed, you've seen our numbers through the first nine months. Our ROE
target is U.S. clearly risk free for (4:00) 700 basis points. Of course, those targets are
through-the-cycle targets. They're not targets that we expect to meet every business
segment, every quarter. But they're through-the-cycle targets. So I think that it's, anyway,
fair to that starting off from 2016, we're certainly on track. You do various types of
normalizations, which I can understand that each of you have your own way to do it. But
actually one of the benefits of having these through-the-cycle targets, because a lot of
that up and down adjusting, I think, falls away once you look over a little bit of a longer
period of time, which we believe is absolutely the best way to do it.
In terms of your question about are we confident about the next one or two years. I would
say that we are confident in the context of we're well positioned. I think we still see good
opportunities to provide meaningful value to our clients and, therefore, also extract
meaningful value for our shareholders.
It's a tough market. These are challenging targets, some would say, from time-to-time,
ambitious given market circumstances. I do think we benefit from a very strong market
position, we benefit from a diversified business mix. And so, yes, they remain our targets,
and I hope to be reporting to you on that, of course, over the next several quarters and
the next several years. And we'll see how we get along.
So with that, let me turn over to Matt for questions regarding the P&C businesses.

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 16674983 <GO>}

Okay. Good afternoon. I wished I could give a very short answer. Unfortunately, it's a little
bit longer than just one bullet point. So, generally, across both business units we have
seen, of course, market softening relative to the year before. And as a result of this
markets softening, the loss ratios have increased a little bit in all lines of businesses.
In addition to that, we reduced peak nat cat, given that under EVM the economic
profitability for a portion of our book was just not given anymore, had we renewed as it
was up for renewal. So, we had to reduce or we decided to reduce some peak nat cat
exposure, which on average across our book further increased our loss ratios.

FINAL

Then on the reinsurance side, we encountered this year an unusually high amount of
agricultural losses, most of it coming from France, a little bit also coming from China. And I
would say, these three reasons are the key reasons why our underlying loss ratio
corrected for prior-year development or adjusted for prior-year development and
adjusted for nat cat were higher than the year before.
Please note that when we adjust for nat cat, we do not consider agricultural losses as nat
cat losses. So, an increase or a decrease from that angle (7:23) comes after the
adjustment.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Okay.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thank you, Matt. Can we go to the next questioner, please?

Operator
The next question is from Xin Mei Wang, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Xin Mei Wang

{BIO 16662657 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. So, my first question is just from follow-up on the previous one. Could
you talk about how you think about the full-year guidance for both the segments, please?
I think you still kept the 99% for P&C Re. So, that implies a sub-100% underlying in 4Q. If
you could explain the reasoning behind that? And also similarly for CorSo as well, I think
you're saying that that's not going to be match anymore. So, what kind of number should
we be thinking about there?
And then, my second question is on the reserve leases. I understand they've been pretty
positive across the board, also some charges in Asia. What is the driver of these releases,
given your best estimate reserving? Is it again a factor of low inflation relative to
expectations or is it something else? Thank you.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thank you. Matt, right over to you.

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 16674983 <GO>}

Okay. Good. So, the first question related to the expected loss ratios or the expected
combined ratio, it's not guided, it's an expectation. We mentioned at the beginning of the
year and that's every year, the year before, we made the decision to not update this
expectation as we go through the quarters.
On the reinsurance side on year-to-date basis, we stand at the combined ratio of 100.4%,
so slightly above the 100%. Little bit, a tad higher than we thought it would be. Looking at
Page 4 of 29



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2016-11-03

FINAL

everything, we think there is a decent chance that at year-end, we end up with a
combined ratio below 100%. Of course, there is no certainty that this is going to happen,
but a decent chance.
On the Corporate Solutions side, we stand on a year-to-date basis at 103.7%. The
reasons are the following. Our expense ratio is higher given the fact that we didn't
increase our premium writings as much as we planned to do. This in response to an
accelerated market softening a little bit higher than what we thought it would happen.
Secondly, also on the Corporate Solutions side, we reduced property business that is nat
cat exposed, again, given the fact that it did not meet our economic hurdles under EVM.
We also reduced a little bit on the surety side and on the trade credit side. And this
combined with we are experiencing a tad, not a huge amount, but a tad more market
softening than we thought what would happen, make us believe that it will be highly
unlikely for us to meet the 101%, which we expected at the beginning of the year.
With respect to the reserve releases, on a global basis, given that we do not have a
single large bucket where we experience a huge amount of reserve releases, it spreads
pretty much all over the world, most of it in the Americas and in Europe, in Asia.

Bloomberg Transcript

Some of the releases we have seen were offset by an increase of the New Zealand
earthquake losses from 2010 and 2011. But given the fact that we are seeing these
releases pretty much across the whole globe and across all main line of business. And
even if we trail down in most segments, we conclude that this is just result of the inflation
which continues to be very low.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thank you, Matt. Can we go to the next question, please?

Operator
The next is from Kamran Hossain from RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. Afternoon, everyone. I've got two questions. The first one is just about, there were
some reports in the press about potentially yourselves and a large U.S.-based reinsurer
taking on some legacy deals. Can you talk a little bit about if you are thinking about deals
like this? And kind of what the rationale of taking them on would be? So, that's question
one.
The second question is just about inflation. And I guess, in the UK, it's something that
we're worrying a little bit about here. It'd be really helpful if Matt can give some
comments just about how well you are positioned, especially given your UK exposure to
any kind of sudden spike in the inflation, that'd be really helpful. So that is my take (12:58).
Thank you.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thank you very much. Well, let me first just respond to the rumors that you were
referring to. As you know, we can't allow ourselves to get into a position to respond to
various things that may be reported from time to time regarding various matters. So, we'll
stick to that policy on this one as well, and we won't be responding to market rumors. So, I
hope you'll appreciate that, Kamran. I'll turn it over to Matt for the second.

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 16674983 <GO>}

Look, on the inflation side, sometimes people ask me what keeps you up at night. And to
be perfectly honest, I sleep very well. But if I didn't sleep very well, it probably would be
because I was thinking about inflation and the possibility that the ever decreasing inflation
of the past actually could turn around.
So, we are observing this very, very carefully. And of course, we are not just observing it,
we are taking it into account in the pricing and in the costing and in the reserving as well.
On the costing side, we are taking it account via the loss severity, trend factors, and we
actually entertain a significant amount of R&D, trying to forecast the loss severities, which
then our underwriters are using before a piece of business is bound.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So, what you're saying, Matt, if I was the UK motor (14:33) insurer, I might be looking at
paying a little bit more for my reinsurance next year? Would that be a sensible assumption
or not?

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 16674983 <GO>}

Look, that would be a forward-looking statement, which I will be hesitant to make at this
point. But trying to taking to account, inflation is a core element of underwriting and
costing, which is a core competency of every reinsurance and insurance company, but
especially also of Swiss Re. So, we are taking this very carefully.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thank you, Matt.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Thanks very much. I appreciate your answers.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

FINAL

Hello. Hi there. I was intrigued the comment you made that part of the reason the
underlying combined ratio was higher in the quarter was you looked at your motor books
in the U.S. and the UK. Maybe if you could just give us a bit more color on what is it you've
identified there?
Is this the kind of severity issues we're seeing, particularly in the U.S. personal lines,
primary writers, or what is it? And presumably, the implication from the comment in the
slide is this is a catch-up on your calendar year or your current year loss picks on auto
books. So, just clarify in detail, that would be useful.
Second question. On the Life business, we've seen some primary Life writers in Australia
do some catch-up on visibility income and lump-sum payments reserving. How do you feel
currently about your reserve situation in Australian Life market given that it looks like the
claims environment in still pretty tough? Thanks.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thank you, Andrew. I think, I'll give it to Matt. Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 16674983 <GO>}

Great. So, motor UK and U.S., mostly U.S. actually, that is a segment where today we know
that nine months ago when we wrote this business, we were a little bit too optimistic in
our assumptions. Please know that whenever we try to look forward and make a pitch
(16:50) with respect to loss trends, it's an estimate. And sometimes, you are too
pessimistic, sometimes you're too optimistic. So here, we were too optimistic with
respect to both the severity and the frequency.
In our case, it might not true for everybody else, but in our case, it is driven by commercial
motor. And within commercial motor, it's driven by trucking business. In our opinion, the
two most important reasons are; the first reason, after the financial crisis, a number of
drivers were let go. And few years later, when the economy picked slightly up, drivers
were rehired by companies, including also the construction sector, but not the drivers that
initially were let go were rehired. Younger, more inexperienced drivers were rehired. And
that has led to an increase in loss frequency, which in addition to that is intensified by an
increasing amount of distracted driving. 4G is fantastic, but it does not help with the
accident frequency. In addition to that, over time, we are seeing a trend towards heavier
trucks with heavier loads, which also means if something happens, the impact, the
severity is likely higher.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And it was a catch-up for your – the whole year's loss picks (18:51), was it, that we saw in
the quarter?

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 16674983 <GO>}

Page 7 of 29



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2016-11-03

You see, what we did is an adjustment to the high priority loss ratio, which matters for the
development to come.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. And is this quota share that you're doing in U.S. commercial auto or is it an excess
loss or...?

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 16674983 <GO>}

We write both proportional business and non-proportional business. And if you get the
inflation wrong, the impact is bigger on the non-proportional side, because the excess
inflation is bigger than the underlying inflation.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Andrew. The second question regarding Australia, I guess I'll
take. I guess, a number of you will remember several years ago, I think it was 2013, we
experienced some issues with parts of our Australian business, which led us to really do a
deep-dive review and make sure that we had the right structures in place and measures
in place, communication with clients and whatnot, to allow us to really stay on top of that
business. And in the meantime, we've seen that that business has responded in a good
way, positive way and we feel like very comfortable with it.
The issues that you were just referring to, I'm not aware of, either not the issues that have
– it does in a way that it would be brought to my attention, Andrew. So, a little bit of an
answer. I'm not aware of anything that would allow me to give you an answer that indicate
that we've picked up those types of trends that you're referring to.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Yes.

Operator
The next question is from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca. Please go ahead,

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. So, one question is on this whole concept of the tailor-made, which
has been driving growth for several probably years now. And thanks to the sigma team at
Swiss Re, we got a chance to see a bit more about what are the tailor-made transactions.
Could you comment a little bit about where exactly in the three or four types of
transactions of mixed risks or capital or strategy, could you comment where this growth
typically comes from? Is it all spread out or – and I would also say that definition is quite
Page 8 of 29



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2016-11-03

broad based. Has it always been like this? So, just a bit of comment on where the tailormade comes from.

FINAL

And second question is, there is this speaker note comment around an upcoming FINMA
model change that is likely to boost solvency. Could you give us a sense of magnitude
here please and how it would – or how it could potentially influence any future capital
measures? Thank you.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. I'll take a stab at both and then maybe ask, Matt, if he wants to add
anything to the question regarding the tailor-made or bespoked transactions. So first,
thanks for the feedback on sigma. We'll pass it back to our team. The whole intent was
(22:10), I think, to help the market, including our clients understand some of the
opportunities available to them.

Bloomberg Transcript

You're absolutely correct, we started talking about tailor-made large structured, bespoke
transactions already going back, I think, to perhaps as early as 2011, 2012 on a consistent
basis. That's because we recognized that there was a possibility for us to, in essence,
provide more value to our clients by bringing together our research-based knowledge,
our global reach and tying that in with our very intense client relationships at various levels
with our client.
Now, you said something along the lines, and it's a little bit of a vague description tailormade. That's correct. Tailor, large, bespoke, they basically reflect transactions that, on the
one hand, have a certain size and substance; and number two, are something different, if
you will, in terms of the business mix, the nature of the relationship that we established
with the client. It goes a little bit beyond the typical syndicated type of risk that you may
see coming through the panels or what we refer to them as flow business.
It's actually around the globe. There's not a individual region. It's also various lines of
business. It's both Life & Health as well as P&C. These things are not coming from one
individual client or one individual region.
We have, as you know, very extensive contact with a very well-diversified group of clients
around the world. And we're in constant engagement with them, looking to help them not
only solve issues they may have around volatility, their P&L or capital issues that they'd like
to address, but also helping them grow their business. And these transactions are
excellent tool that we apply to actually demonstrate our ability to differentiate. It's not just
capacity that we're providing typically, It's a lot of additional value-add products.
Let me leave it at that. I want to pick up the second, and then I'll give it off to Matt, so he
can actually supplement (24:15) if he wants to. So, the FINMA model, yeah, we wanted to
flag that. It was out in the marketplace. FINMA has indicated they're contemplating some
adjustments to the way in which the SST ratio is calculated. In essence, is a mechanical
adjustment, but the adjustment will make the ratio outcomes a little bit more comparable
with the way that Solvency II is calculated. What we've said is that, we do look at this as
somewhat of a mechanical type of an adjustment.

Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2016-11-03

FINAL

The likelihood – but the rules are not finalized, but the likelihood based upon what we
understand their intent is, is that will optically increase the ratio. But what we want to make
sure everyone understands is that, in and of itself, that doesn't change the nature of our
excess capital versus the 100% requirement.
We may come back to that at our Investor Day in December, a little bit depending on how
FINMA gets along in terms of finalizing the rules and that we understand they really are
going to take place. But I think the key message that we want to bring right now is that
this change may well take place. We see it as somewhat more of a mechanical change
than anything else. The likelihood is the reported ratio will go up.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

And if I can just follow-up quickly, the target range could also change presumably?

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Well, let's wait and see what FINMA actually finalizes. And once we understand that, then
we'll talk about that. We'll update you all on our capital position, our SST ratio in the first
part of next year, as we always do. And I would certainly anticipate that by that time, the
rule will be finalized and we'll be able to talk about our risk tolerance range. Matt, anything
you want to add on the tailored transactions, bespoked.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 16674983 <GO>}

Yeah. First, actually, I must say, I was pleased to see that I'm not the only one who gives
long answers sometimes (25:59) question. You said pretty much everything I would have
said. Let me just add two additional thoughts. Typically, bespoke transactions are more a
thing of mature markets than high growth markets. So, at least, historically, this has been
the case. And secondly, it's very hard – given that they are bespoke and tailored, it's very
hard to classify them, because the needs they try to address can be very diverse ranging
from capital relief to smoothing out earnings, to accelerate earnings. So really different
needs.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Can I just quickly take if – between complexity of risk and capital support if you had to
distinguish, would you say most of the growth is the capital support side or most of the
growth is complexity side, or both could be an answer? That's it for me (27:08).

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 16674983 <GO>}

Look, it changes over time. It's just – if we wrote – and you know we did this in the past. If
we wrote a big motor quota share somewhere in Asia, that would not be at yield that
requires a lot of capital. It actually would require very little capital under EVM. But as soon
as you make signal, a little bit nat cat, the capital consumption increases very quickly. So,
there is no uniformity and therefore it's very hard to give you a short answer.

FINAL

I just politely request people to restrict themselves to two questions. You can get back in
the line if you want to, but we want to make sure we give everyone a chance to ask their
questions. So, thank you for that, Vinit. May we go to the next question please?

Operator
The next question is from Olivia Brindle, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.

Q - Olivia Brindle

{BIO 17273762 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi there. So, first two questions. On the credit transactions, there was a comment you
made, I think, in some of the headlines from the media conference, which said that those
tailored transactions would likely have an upward impact on your combined ratio. Just
wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that. I mean, given that is a mix of different
lines of business, presumably it will push it up to the extent that it's large casualty deals,
but also where you do shorter tail and lower combined ratio tailored transactions as well.
So just wondering how do we understand that comment, whether you're saying that
overall those deals will have a higher combined ratio? And so just some color around that
would be helpful.
The second question around capital. So, I think historically you've been very clear that you
will return excess capital, but maybe not as clear on exactly how you determine the level.
So, firstly, just wondering why you've decided to go with $1 billion today and how you
come to that being the right number? And also, second part of the question, how are you
thinking about the right level going forward? I mean, if I look at some of your comments
on the outlook for the market, they seem reasonably cautious. How is that leading you to
think about capital in terms of whether you might want to hold more or less? Thank you.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

All right. Excellent. Of course, I made the comment this morning you're referring to, but
first I'll give Matt a chance to explain my comment, and then maybe I'll add to it. And I'll
come back, Olivia, to your second questions around capital.

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 16674983 <GO>}

Okay. Look, four years ago, when we looked at the pipeline of large and tailored
transactions, many of them included nat cat exposure. This portion of the pipeline right
now we pretty much cannot write any more because under EVM, it's just not profitable
anymore. So, as a result of this, our large transactions and tailored solutions on the P&C
side are more weighted towards long tail lines and that automatically increases the
combined ratio.

FINAL

Okay. Thanks. And then, the second question about the capital level and why $1 billion. On
the one hand, I'll give a short answer, but then I'll give a little bit more context. The billion
was actually what we asked authorization for from the shareholders earlier this year. And
under the Swiss rules, we actually need to have that authorization in order to give us the
flexibility to launch such a program during the course of the year.
And we've talked in the past about how we look at our capital management philosophy,
prioritizations and that really hasn't changed. So we start from the premise of maintaining
superior financial positions at all times. We certainly would like to maintain the regular
dividend and we would like to grow it where we've been successful in investing in the
business.

Bloomberg Transcript

And we still will invest in the business, if it meets two criteria online with our strategy, one
that we've communicated and it meets our financial hurdles. And for large allocations of
capital, of course, we make sure that the hurdles that we apply are sufficient to
compensate for the allocation of capital and the risk associated with the transactions. And
then when we find ourselves with excess capital, then we look for ways to give it back.
And we said for a number of different reasons having previously done the special
dividend, the repatriation from tax-advantaged account, that we would look for the
repurchase program as one that gives flexibility; and also based on feedback from our
shareholders, one that most shareholders have indicated they have a preference for.
Now, in terms of the amount of capital that we hold, it starts with this premise of
maintaining the superior financial condition. And we've expressed that simplistically in the
form of an SST ratio of 185%. We think that gives us a very strong position, the ability to
absorb large losses and continue to be meaningful and active and engaged with our
clients, even after large losses would occur.
Now, we hold some buffer. The buffer is intended to provide a little bit of protection for
the inherent volatility of our P&L. So, we hold a dividend reserve. And we hold a buffer for
what we think to be potential – they're not earmarked, potential investments that we may
wish to make over the course of a 12- to 24-month period. And when we hold capital that
is above that level, then we think about returning it to shareholders.
Now, this year we asked for authorization for $1 billion. You made a comment about what
may happen going forward and the market outlook. Certainly, we'll come back to that in
February when we bring you our full-year results and we speak to you a little bit about
what we want to do on the dividend side. So, let me just hold off a little bit with any
comments about what we may say in February, but we'll come back to it. We won't forget.
Thank you.

Yes. Thanks for taking my question. The first one is on the pipeline, which you mentioned.
So, can you give us a little bit of color on how optimistic you are on this pipeline on tailormade? And maybe also the gross number for P&C Re excluding the tailor-made deals?
And the second is coming back to run-off profit, both in P&C Re and CorSo, and if you can
tell us what we should expect as a normal rate as a percentage of the common ratio for
the coming quarters? Thanks.

question first. So, the pipeline looks good and we are happy with it. However, we have to
be aware that the hit – the pipeline has to look good, because the hit probability is far
away from 100%.

With respect to the open market reinsurance business, so the business that is shown to
almost everybody often by a broker, in that segment, since the beginning of this year, we

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you very much. The P&C running investment income was $210 million in the
third quarter, which is a pretty low number. I know that the yield's coming down in the rest
of it. But I'm just wondering, is there anything funny going on that makes that unusually low
number or should we be taking that as a guide for the future? And then secondly, for the
two Life divisions, the increase in unrealized gains this year is dragging your return on
equity by at least 2 percentage points. I know that this year's results are being flattered by
realized gains, but you also seem pretty confident in maintaining your rate guidance that
you gave about a year ago in spite of that unrealized gain drag. So, what should we infer
from that? I mean is there something – anything you can point to specific that's going

better in Life & Health or Life Capital, or are you now expecting to be at the bottom end
the range rather than the top end of the range, or is there everything else that explains
how you're maintaining that guidance in spite of quite the drag from the unrealized gains?
Thank you.

FINAL

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Excellent. Thank you, William. I'll ask Guido to respond to the first and I'll pick up the
second question.

A - Guido Fürer
Thanks. This fact of running yield and gain realization, you have to put it in a broader
context. If you look a bit at gain realization, this is part of the nature, particularly in a
portfolio, which has some portfolio activity similar, as Matt has described on the insurance
and reinsurance side. Of course, we look where we see some more value for the same
capital and potential than shift. Based on that, you should always see some gain
realization. Again, if you look at now, I could get you picture (36:59) – coming back to your
question on the P&C side, I could get you picture (37:02) around 25% this gain realization,
if I basically compared the total investment income on the group level.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, if you look through that, you see it's a good competition. And just to give you one
figure out of this $267 million overall gain realization, $90 million comes from government
bonds, the rest basically two-thirds is either corporate, equity alternatives or in the
principal investment area. That's why it's a good composition.
Now, if you take that as an input, particularly if you look at equity or maybe corporate
credit, we came to a conclusion – we saw rich market, in particular, also on the corporate
credit side spread-wise. If we look at beginning of the year, kind of the investment grade
in the U.S. were around 165 basis points in respect of spread above government. And
now, we're around 130 basis points. And we believe these are good levels to take some
of the profit and this exactly happened in P&C.
Similar point also on the equity side again, we reduced equity a bit in Q3. And again, this
has led us to the conclusion that there is a better deployment of the capital. And this you
should expect clearly in the P&C portfolio, but you should also expect it, to a certain
extent, in Corporate Solutions, although that's much smaller.
Now, in Life & Health, in the Life Capital area, that's much more kind of a buy and hold
portfolio. Now, also there you see some moves. Again, we have Guardian. Guardian is a
major acquisition in the Life Capital piece, of course taking on new assets and having, at
the same time, some Solvency II introductions. But in respect of matching requirements
again has suggested to take some of the profit on government bond and basically locking
in attractive corporate credit spreads.
That's why at some gain realization, you should take as a natural kind of capture of
economic opportunity. And even government bonds, even there, I think you should
there's expect some true economic driver behind it. And Life Capital was a good
Page 14 of 29



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2016-11-03

FINAL

example. When we acquired Guardian, we were long in respect of our economic position.
That's why we took clearly the lowering of UK yield as another reason to basically make –
bring closer to economically match position. That's why gain realization, per se, is clearly
driven by economic views and economic positioning which we do.
Now, looking at the running yields on the P&C side. Again, you see it's around 2% at the
moment. And this fluctuates a bit between 2.1%, 2.2%. If you go back, yes, it was slightly
higher, 2.3% last year. Of course, if you have an active portfolio approach, it's very natural
that you have a quicker integration of the lower yield environment compared to buy and
hold.
On the other hand, these are also the portfolio which allows to take economic position, I
think more of opportunistically than in your Life & Health, in your Life Capital context. But
kind of the bottom line message is running yield, it's one indication where one important
contributor is in respect of future investment income, by far it's not the only one. And
that's why we clearly add additional economic values through active positioning of
portfolio, which will lead hopefully to some gain realization.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Guido. Actually, part of your answer to the first question already segues into
William's second question on the Life Capital side. We did have, of course, an
extraordinary level some gains in the first half as we were positioning the portfolio we had
acquired to Swiss Re's governance and Swiss Re's approach to capital regimes.
But William, your comment is spot on, obviously, with very low levels of interest rates that
has inflated the equity element of this ratio, it becomes increasingly challenging for us to
hit that 10% to 12% range. Still, we remain committed to it. It's not easy. It's intended to be
ambitious in fact. Since we announced that several years ago, I think we've been
successful notwithstanding inherent volatility that comes. It's not going to be possible for
us going forward to hit that range every single time.
But if you look at this business for what it is, it's a long duration business. We think we
have a very strong portfolio. We took a number of measures several years ago to address
it. We continue to write what we believe to be very attractive business.
I think that we're in a good position to be able to deliver a good steady stream of income.
The actual position in the range maybe on the upper side, maybe on the lower side from
time to time, depending on what happens with the equity component. But we remain
convinced that the business that we have on our books is a good solid business, and that
we continue to have opportunities to write good new business.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Okay. So, there is nothing sort of specific top-down you'd referred to? So, a normalized
result, but you could say, inflation's being great, that helps our combined ratio. When I'm
looking at the Life businesses, I can say higher unrealized gains hurts your ROE, but your

Company N ame: Swiss Re AG

outlook still stay confident. There is no sort of a single big picture issue that you'd point to
that's helping your returns level?

FINAL

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

I think it's diversified book. The fact that we have taken measures to make sure that we
respond to portfolios that were underperforming. When we set the range, of course, we
already had factored in – I won't say we were exactly right on interest rates, but we
factored in that it could move up or down depending on what would happen.
As Guido just indicated, I mean, at this point in the economic world and financial markets,
you almost can touch the portfolio for even normal stuff without realizing some sort of
gain here and there. But we're not accelerating gains for financial reporting purposes. We
have a high quality portfolio, both from the liability side as well as on the asset side.
And while we accept that there may be some volatility in that range, we've been outside
of that range. We've had several quarters where we were actually well above the 12%. We
think if you look at this business over a longer period of time, then we're going to be in a
good position to achieve that. It won't be easy, but that's what we will strive to do. Thank
you.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions from me please. Just wanted to return to the capital
position and your view of it. David, listening to you, you keep using the word kind of
flexibility. I'm intrigued why you need so much flexibility, if you like, because the $1 billion
buyback itself, as you already alluded to, gives you flexibility to cease that if you do get a
large loss. And your capital position, both on S&P and on SST, gives you buffers on top of
buffers.
So, I'm struggling to see why you need to introduce an element of uncertainty over this
buyback that you're announcing now. I think historically, you've kind of said we want to see
how hard it can cease and work through, but I think the reality is that your peak apparels
are much more evenly spread throughout the world. So, if you could just shed a bit a light
on that.

Page 16 of 29



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity

FINAL

I suppose a linked question might be, I mean if Hurricane Matthew had made landfall at a
$20 billion loss, would that have actually scupper the buyback at this stage? That's my first
question.
Secondly, a more general kind of conceptual point. I mean, over the past, I suppose, one
to two years, you've been growing in casualty more than others, and it seems like a kind
of countercyclical approach, if you like. If we look at the results coming through in casualty,
those results don't look great. The combined ratio is consistently above 100%. And in Q3,
it was at 102.6%. What you make of that strategy to have grown in casualty? Was it the
right decision in hindsight and what's the outlook in that segment, please?

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. I'll pick up the first question, then I'll ask Matt to respond to the second. So,
flexibility, we believe that it's incredibly important to maintain flexibility. While we want to
always have the superior capital position, we also need to be agile and able to respond to
opportunities that come our way. And these opportunities are not always easy to predict.

Bloomberg Transcript

Indeed you correctly referred to last couple of years, only last year did we actually started
with the buyback program, now this year the second one. We said we want to wait a little
bit into the year to see both how our capital develops, how our income develops as well
as what opportunities we see to invest. Things can change very quickly.
I won't respond exactly to what would have happened had Matthew hit and had it been a
certain level of loss, but this is exactly that type of thing that we would like to be able to
respond to it. And if we get into a situation or we find ourselves in a situation where the
market opportunities to deploy the capital are attractive, we want to be able to do that.
So, our shareholders I think understand it. We have discussions with them about that. The
idea of the share repurchase program is it gives us an opportunity if we come to
conclusion during the course of the year that the capital buffer that we've built up is really
excessive of what we think we should hold. We can go ahead and start returning capital to
shareholders in advance of the full-year result announcements and the full-year dividend
discussion.
So, I think the flexibility is one that we think is absolutely appropriate and it may even be
essential in order to allow us to respond to these opportunities that can come our way,
and they can come from different sources, by the way. So, we're looking for opportunities
across all of our business units.
It needs to make sense. We want to deploy capital, as I mentioned earlier, both strategic
sense as well as financial sense. If we come to the conclusion that we hold more capital
than we recently expect to be able to deploy, then we look to give it back. And with that,
I'll ask Matt to respond to the second question.

Okay. So, with respect to casualty, given the highly combined ratio and high – actually, it's
not that high. It is above 100%. But given the fact that the combined ratio is above 100%,
was it right decision? I would like to give the following answer.

FINAL

Not this quarter, but in the past, we had some quarters where the combined ratio was
high given adverse development coming from asbestos. We would have had these
adverse development with and without new business being written.
Secondly, a good portion of the casualty growth – not all, but a good portion of the
casualty growth came along with growth from large transactions. And we just recently
reviewed our total large transaction book and concluded we are very happy with how it
has performed over the last five to six years.
So, boiling your question down to the so-called flow business, which is not a fantastic
expression, I would describe it as follows. On the liability side, it was the right decision. We
are happy with what we are seeing. Of course, not every individual deal behaves the way
we anticipated. Some behave better actually, some a little bit less, but overall we are
happy. On the motor side, I admit the underestimated severity and frequency of losses.
We're looking at our book there. We are not entirely happy.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the work comp side, where our strategy is and has been for a very long time to not
write the high access (49:28) business, but focus only on some proportional – on some
very few proportional treaties and operating in the primary side in the first $2 (49:42)
million, we're actually very happy with this decision.

Good afternoon, everybody. I have two questions. My first question is also on the P&C
reinvestment income and it's going into the same direction then William's question on the
$210 million in investment income. I was also surprised to see that this low level, despite
the fact that you had some quite a significant volume growth in the past, which would also
have had to compensate the decline investment yield. However, we have noticed this
lower level of the $210 million and I would like to rephrase it again. Is the $210 million the
right level that we should look going forward? And then my second question is on the
buyback. Could you shed some light on your thinking behind the timing now, because we
have now a shorter timeframe until the mid of February? And what were the drivers and
your thoughts behind that?

Apologies.

A - Guido Fürer
Again, so P&C, there you should expect most of active positioning, and that's why if you
look at the underlying portfolio, of course, it has the shortest duration compared to Life &
Health. That means in respect of fixed income, yes, you see probably – just based on the
duration, you see a lower kind of current investment income.
Now, it's very – actually, there is no way to give any forward guidance. Again, I mentioned
this is an active book. And again, if we composition equity now – as I mentioned before,
we sold in Q3, if we have a massive sell off in equity market, maybe this will change our
appetite in equity. Similarly with corporate credit, again we reduced corporate credits. We
took profit based on the spread tightening. This was the economic profit-taking. And
again, if a spread developing in different direction getting extremely wide, and we believe
now it's a good point to go back, we will see a different line in respect of current
investment income. That's why, important is that you consider that part of the book. There
we can take, let's say, the best – that's the best place to take economic position. You
should expect more turnover in that book compared to the other one, which I referred to,
which is Life Capital, and Life & Health. That's why the composition of returns are different.
In respect of guidance, again there you see the biggest realized gain out of reason which
I mentioned before, which of course has an impact on the underlying running yield. On the
other hand, again if things are changing and, let's say, if yields are going up, of course,
this is offers enormous potential to not only deploy cash, which we're holding, but again
Page 19 of 29

achieving higher net investment income line, just based on yield. That's kind of my answer
to your question.

FINAL

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thank you, Guido. Let me come back to the question regarding timing of the buyback. So,
I saw a few comments about that this morning and I'm very happy to give some insights
here.
You may recall last year, we announced our intent to launch a program, but they were
subject to receiving various regulatory approvals. And then, we received those approvals
and we were able to launch the program, off the top my head, somewhere around the
middle of November and then we concluded it the very beginning of March. I think it was
the 12th of November till 2nd of March.

Bloomberg Transcript

When we looked at it this year, we said maybe we can actually try to achieve the
following, that we go ahead and start the program very quickly after announcing it, and in
order to do that, we actually sought the requisite approvals in advance of being formally
agreed to, by our board yesterday, subject to their agreement, of course, but we actually
were able to go ahead and achieve those agreements in advance of announcing our Q3
results.
And we have – I think our full-year results announcement for 2016, I think, scheduled
around the 22nd or 23rd of February. So actually there's not a whole lot of difference here.
We hope to conclude the program now by 17th of February. So if you look at the actual
number of days is actually just a few – perhaps, a few days shorter than it was last year.
And we just want to be able to include the final outcome whenever we announce our fullyear results.
Just like last year, you can track where we're getting to with the program on a weekly
basis on our website. And of course, there are rules that also govern how active the
purchase program can be in the marketplace. But Frank, there is no additional thinking or
guidance, other than we see an opportunity to launch it a little bit earlier than we did last
year and we'd like to try to close it by the time we actually announce our full-year results.
It's just that simple.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you for taking my questions. I've got two. Firstly on the large tailored
transactions. You talked about the impact on the level of combined ratio going forward
from the growth there. But anything you can talk about in terms of volatility of the
combined ratio going forward? I'd imagine some of the capital release should have a bit
more stable profitability. So, does that mean that we should expect low volatility going
forward? I guess related to that, some of the outside losses that we saw this quarter in
terms of agricultural losses and motor, is that related to large transaction that was up
more from flow (55:52) business?
And the second question is around just a quick on Corporate Solutions. You talked about
kind of the market situation there. Is there anything that you see currently that makes you
a bit more positive about growth going forward? Thank you.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Okay. Just to be fair, should I ask Guido to answer?

A - Guido Fürer
You can try.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Matt, how about you give it a try.

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 16674983 <GO>}

Okay. I will try and Guido can clean up after me. So, with respect to will we have more
volatility given that we expect over time to continue to write more large and tailored
transactions, possibly yes, but not necessarily, because a portion of the volatility comes
from nat cat. And right now, we are really not including nat cat in almost any of the large
transactions we are writing.
So, in the short term, I would say maybe we might even see less volatility. Of course, if
you write more long tail-related large transactions, this means while you pick up less
shock, risk potential, you expose the balance sheet to more trend risk. That comes
without saying. The actual (57:36) losses came to a very large extent to our agricultural
flow business book.
On the Corporate Solutions side, look, we are now in a soft market and we are not in a
hard market. This does not mean that every piece of business is bad. Of course, there are
segments where we are still writing and feel good about it. And of course, your question
could be what are the segments, if you intended to ask the question, I'm not intending to
answer it, because that's a trade secret, but it's not all bad. but given the past years, it is
absolutely necessary that now we enter cycle management territory.

We actually have started to do this already on the Corporate Solution side. For instance,
with respect to umbrella business, we shifted our book from high asset business to lower
asset business. We have shifted our book already from large companies to medium-sized
companies. Offshore energy, we have massively reduced over the last several months.
Aviation, we are very selective on large airlines. We are writing almost no space business
these days, because we just couldn't do it in a profitable way.
I mentioned already on the property side, we have reduced our peak nat cat exposures,
also on the CorSo side, but also on the reinsurance side. And in Corporate Solutions, we
are very cautious in Brazil. We continue to do that, and some industries such as, for
instance, steel producers, we almost don't write them.

FINAL

The view on interest rate is, we expect lower for longer. That means there's no priced in
hope that yields will sharply go up. That's also the base how we cost the business on the
reinsurance and insurance side. That means, we always work with the current yield curve
whatever the market is pricing. From that point, a few of you can argue you're somehow
neutral from a business point of view. Of course, for the overall industry, higher yield
would help.
And our forecast is clearly not an upbeat one. That's why also you saw the reduced sum
of equity EBITDA on the corporate credit side. Then we think – believe now we see a lot
of support in the market from where it comes (1:01:29) and this clearly cannot last forever.
Now, the mismatch question which you raised, Swiss Re is pretty much neutral. We were
neutral already in Q2. We capped that position. It's a very, very tiny short position. That
means, from an overall point of view, Swiss Re Group is basically, from again talking about
ALM, from economic point of view, not taking any major interest rate position.
You saw the huge unrealized gain position, which we have in the book. Of course, you
know this due to the GAAP treatment of our assets. And that's why we have to make
distinction between ALM, which is more economic description compared to GAAP one.

Bloomberg Transcript

But again, yield wise, we assume that the current yield assets will not disappear. That's
why we try also to position portfolio in areas where we still believe we have a relative
value. And again, relative value comes from the structure of our book, be it in which
market can work (1:02:34). Again, if you only have the Swiss book, I think it would look very
different compared to very global, on which we have – which is dominated by U.S. dollar.
Again U.S. dollar compensates you for some of the risk. That's why, overall, I think we can
believe, as you can see, the investment results are not completely immune. On the other
hand, you see quite a sticky part in it, again, based on the fundamental long (1:03:00)
book which we have.

Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is on, can you update us on how the
Chinese market has evolved post implementation of C-ROSS? Now that you are close to

one full year under the new regime, are you seeing a shift from the regular motor quota
share to, let's say, the cat business?

FINAL

And secondly, can you please explain how the Life Capital cash generation was so high
during the quarter despite the dip in the interest rates? Thank you.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Excellent. So, Matt, you want to respond regarding China, and I'll respond regarding Life
Capital.

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 16674983 <GO>}

Yeah. So, in China, C-ROSS had exactly the expected effect. We saw, let me say, less
incentives for clients to buy motor and more incentives to buy nat cat and we saw a little
bit shift and we expect this to continue.

Bloomberg Transcript

And regarding the gross cash generation in Life Capital, a combination of things. First and
foremost, I think it really is the most important, the underlying business is performing well,
certainly in line with our expectations. We've a number of offsetting elements and we
have lower interest rates – slightly lower interest rates, of course, which tends to pull that
down under the Solvency II regime that our closed Life business operates in the UK.
Offsetting that, we continue I think to be successful in finding synergies and delivering
synergies, reducing our expenses loads.
There is also a number of other quasi one-off things that impact us in any given quarter.
We also have, of course, as you see in Q3, the positive benefit of lower tax rates being
enacted in the UK. So, a number of different elements contributed to the quarterly gross
cash generation. I think if you look at the first nine months, you'll see that we're on track.
The number of things have also there been pluses and minuses, but the most important
thing is that the underlying business is very much performing in line with our expectations.
Thank you.

The next question is from Michael Haid from Commerzbank. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Coming back to reserve releases and inflation, I
have a hard time believing that I should assume zero run-off profits for you going forward.
When you reserve new business initially, you obviously take into account expected
inflation. If later on actual inflation turns out to be lower as you initially reserved for, you
must have run-off profits.

FINAL

Your reserves are usually on your back book for several years. That's the nature of longtail business. That means that you probably must have more run-off profits to come, as I
have a hard time to believe that your reserving was based on the current low inflation
levels. Did you release all reserve redundancies that came from the low inflation
environment which we currently have or what is the mistake in thinking that I make?

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Excellent. Thank you, Michael. Matt, you want to respond.

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 16674983 <GO>}

Look, the reserve – the inflation – and by the way, maybe it's important here to say, when I
use the term inflation in the context of our reserves, I mean of course loss-relevant
inflation. And since this affects mostly casualty wage inflation and even, more importantly,
medical inflation is what matters. So, please don't think of inflation as CPI type of general
inflation.

Bloomberg Transcript

The problem is right now, the inflation, also the medical inflation, is very low. However, our
reserves are here to pay for the losses and the loss developments also in the future. And
we have absolutely no guarantee that the relevant inflation pieces, including wage
inflation and medical inflation, are going to stay where they are right now.
You heard concerns coming from the UK. In the U.S., for instance, wages are going a little
bit up. There is some uncertainty related to the future U.S. President. And together with
this uncertainty, there is also some uncertainty related to ACA, Obamacare, and that
could have an impact on inflation. So, personally, I take the low inflation the way it is
currently, but I do not think it's going to stay where it currently is for always and ever.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

If I...

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

So, is it fair – yes.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

If I just may add to that, we have a very well established and consistent approach to
reserving for all of our businesses and, certainly, for the long-tail business is extremely
important. We position ourselves prudently within a best estimate range. We look at all of
our business effectively every quarter around the globe. Time to time, we do deep dives.
The effects that you were just referring to, we have seen as the industry has seen as well
over the course of the last several years.
So, time will tell, of course, how these reserves now evolve over time. But I think what's
important is that we're not somehow hiding capital in the form of incremental buffers on
reserves. We're not changing our reserving policy. And just like we're not trying to

Page 25 of 29



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2016-11-03

accelerate gains on the asset side, we're not trying to manage the realization of our best
view of what the ultimate loss ratio, the ultimate loss levels are going to be on the
exposures that we have.

FINAL

So, it's very key here that we maintain consistency. We do position ourselves, on a
prudent basis, within the best estimate range. And we report on that on, obviously, a
regular basis and once a year a little bit more detail.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Is it fair to say that the reserve releases or the run-off profits that they generally come
from business which is close to be settled or – settled?

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

No, I think as Matt indicated earlier, it comes from a wide range of businesses across all
the various geographies. So, there's not a single vintage, if you will, if I understand your
question correctly. It really is looking at our entire portfolio across all lines of business,
across all geographies. We've seen a fairly consistent – if you look at over the course of
the last handful of years, consistent positive development amongst other reasons, of
course, no doubt coming off the back of inflation levels that were lower than what we'd
have originally costed. We were conservative in (1:10:36) the costing, and maybe some
other things have contributed to it as well.

The next question is a follow-up question from Olivia Brindle. Please go ahead.

Q - Olivia Brindle

{BIO 17273762 <GO>}

Thank you for the follow-up. Just on CorSo. I mean, you talked about some of the issues
in that business at the moment. I'm just looking at the expense ratio, which was almost
39% in the quarter and you referred to some ongoing investments in that business. So,
just wondering whether there was anything specific in that quarter that we can sort of strip
out? And what is the expense ratio that we should be thinking about going forward?
Obviously, 39% is a very, very high level. It doesn't feel like that's the number we should
be extrapolating. But equally, it's probably a little bit higher than in the past. So, just some
color on the expense point would be helpful.

A - David Cole

FINAL

Very much appreciate the follow-up question. So, let me put it into the context. From time
to time, I see comments about people looking at CorSo, and indeed they want to look at
it on a quarter-by-quarter basis and try to extrapolate that into the future, based on the
number of different factors, including things like combined ratio, normalized or not.
And while I can understand it, I think it's important for everyone to realize that we see a
business opportunity here that we have decided to invest in. And it's really a long-term
investment program, based on what we see to be a very long-term attractive market.
CorSo has a relatively modest position. It's a growing position, and we're very pleased
with the growth that we've shown over the last handful of years. But it's a market that we
believe that we can continue to experience profitable growth going forward. Now, it'd be
silly for us to put on the gas, put on the brakes; put on the gas, put on the brakes, based
on any individual quarter's results.
Specific to your question, Olivia, I would estimate it's probably 2% to 3%, something in
that range. It's not to be the same exactly every quarter or so. But our expense ratio is
probably elevated beyond what we would see as where we would aim to achieve going
forward, as we are investing in this business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, from time to time, our premium levels are up or down, depending on things like FX
rates and things like, is it a soft market, yes or no. All these things are relevant to us and
we certainly don't ignore them, but we can't base our investment program on one
quarter's results.
So, I really encourage everyone try to take a step back from that when they're thinking
about Corporate Solutions. Look at our results over the last couple of years, look at the
market opportunity, look at the capabilities that Swiss Re has and kind of go with this in
understanding that investment case. Thank you.

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 18460437 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. It's also a question on CorSo (1:13:28), and I hope that you will not be
obliged to answer the same. It's actually on the credit and the combined ratio, which
spiked this quarter compared to last year. It's actually quite contrary to what we see on
the monoliners, which tend to normalize a little bit on the loss they have in Latin America
and Asia Pacific. So, can you comment on this? What's your view on what's happening on
credits in these regions and what's your outlook? Thank you.

{BIO 16674983 <GO>}

FINAL

Can I ask quickly, what – could you define for me monoliner, please, because there is
more than one definition that is possible?

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 18460437 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, I would define monoliner, for instance, (1:14:17), these kind of players which
have (1:14:20), for instance, but not the broad range of the business that you have.

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 16674983 <GO>}

Okay. Look, I cannot comment on what some of our clients are doing or experiencing. I
can only comment on what we are doing and what we are experiencing. On the credit
side in Corporate Solutions, we have experienced an increase in loss activity recently.

Bloomberg Transcript

On a global basis, we have seen a higher frequency this past quarter of small and midsized losses. We did not see that in Q2 and we did not see that in Q1. However, we saw it
in Q3. So, at this point in time, we believe it's a quarterly blip in operation, but we are
staying alert and continue to observe.
In addition to that, as I mentioned already, we are taking a bit of capital off on the credit
and surety side in Corporate Solutions. In addition to that, we have seen in Asia the Bank
Trade and Infrastructure loss of the order of US$10 million approximately. This is a that
type of losses, which sometimes happen. In most quarters, they do not happen, but
sometimes they do happen. And whenever such a loss happens on the Corporate
Solutions side, it immediately has a 10 point combined ratio impact, order of magnitude.

Hi. Just a quick follow-up for me, actually. I just like to – the new Rhode Island Legislation,
potentially going to open up the market, to close the business in the U.S. I appreciate you
can't comment on particular deals and things. But you could perhaps just comment about
what your appetite is for dealing in that sort of market were the market to open up as it
