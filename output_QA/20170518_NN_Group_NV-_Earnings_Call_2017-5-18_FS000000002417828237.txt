FINAL

Yes. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our conference call to discuss the NN
Group's results for the ﬁrst quarter of 2017. I will start oﬀ today's presentation by looking at
the highlights of the ﬁrst quarter results, as well as the commercial developments during
the quarter. I would also like to spend some time talking about the Delta Lloyd acquisition
and the integration process.
Delﬁn Rueda, our Chief Financial Oﬃcer, will then talk about the ﬁnancial details of the
results at group level and for the individual operating segments, as well as our capital
position including the pro forma numbers for the combined entity that we have disclosed
today. I will conclude the presentation with a wrap-up, after which we will open the call for
a Q&A. As customary, we also have our Chief Risk Oﬃcer with us, Jan-Hendrik Erasmus, to
answer your questions.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, let me start on slide number 3, by reminding you that the results reported today are
for NN Group on a standalone basis. Delta Lloyd has issued its own press release this
morning reporting on the ﬁrst quarter of 2017. In addition, we have disclosed several pro
forma numbers for NN Group and Delta Lloyd combined to give you some insight into
the capital position of the combined entity. The pro forma Solvency II ratio for the
combined entity is estimated at approximately 180% at the end of the ﬁrst quarter of 2017.
I will talk about this in more detail on the later slide.
In August, we will publish the full consolidated results and capital position for the
combined group for the second quarter of the year. NN Group delivered a strong
performance for the ﬁrst quarter of 2017. The operating result of the ongoing business of
€406 million represents an increase of 33% on the same quarter last year with all
segments contributing to the increase. We continue to improve eﬃciency and
Netherlands units achieved further cost savings in the ﬁrst quarter, bringing the cost base
down to €748 million.
Commercial momentum was also strong. Total new sales of our insurance businesses
were up 28% at constant currencies. This was driven by higher Life sales across the
insurance Europe region as well as sales of the COLI critical illness product introduced
last year in Japan. Our asset manager attracted net inﬂows of third-party assets of €2.1
billion and NN Bank continues to report a strong production of new mortgages.
Our balance sheet and capital position remain robust. The cash capital of the holding was
€3 billion at the end of the ﬁrst quarter, driven by dividends received from subsidiaries, as
well as the senior debt that we issued in January. NN Group Solvency II ratio at the end of
the ﬁrst quarter was 238%, down slightly end of fourth quarter last year reﬂecting market
variances, partly oﬀset by operating return.
Let's turn to slide 4. In order to deliver an excellent customer experience, we continually
invest in new and improved products and in innovation. Let me give you some examples.
NN Bank launched an innovative app called Brickler. House buyers using this app can

FINAL

search for a new home, calculate the amount that they can spend, and compare proposals
from diﬀerent mortgage providers all at the same time in this app.
Another innovative app that we're currently piloting is Gappie. This app allows customers
to arrange on-demand car insurance when borrowing a car from family or friends. This is a
unique concept as it links the insurance to the use of a car instead of the ownership. The
insurance cover can be taken up by the hour, and you can switch it on and oﬀ as required.
Gappie was developed by our innovation lab, Sparklab. And following its success in the
Netherlands, NN has now opened Sparklabs in Hungary and in Turkey. At least six other
labs will be launched shortly.
In line with our multi-access distribution strategy, our business in Poland has built a
modern and innovative IT platform for banks which allows products to be introduced
within weeks. And in Japan, we have started oﬀering our COLI products via Sumitomo's
Life's sales network of approximately 30,000 agents.

Bloomberg Transcript

In addition to innovation at NN, we also look for opportunities to invest in third-party
ﬁntech companies. An example of this is OptioPay, which has developed an innovative
business model that allows consumers to convert incoming payments into higher value
product services or vouchers with a broad range of merchants and service providers.
Let's move to the next slide, slide number 5. The acquisition of Delta Lloyd by NN Group
will materially strengthen our leading position in the Netherlands and Belgium. Most
noticeably, we'll achieve additional scale and capabilities in the Dutch pension market
that will allow us to enhance our customer proposition and capitalize and to shift to
Deﬁned Contribution products.
We will double the size of our Non-Life business. Our asset manager will receive
additional assets under management, and we will double our presence in Belgium with a
complementary product oﬀering and distribution channel. Delta Lloyd also brings with it
some valuable distribution capabilities, such as the joint venture with ABN AMRO and the
OHRA Direct brand.
Overall, we believe that there is signiﬁcant and compelling strategic logic for the
acquisition. On the 23rd of December last year, we set out the ﬁnancial beneﬁts of this
transaction. At that time, we indicated expected cost synergies of €150 million and an
increase into free cash ﬂow in the range of €250 million to €300 million both by 2020.
And we also indicated that you should anticipate a double-digit increase in the dividend
per share in 2018.
Moving on to slide 6. Just over a month ago, the oﬀer for Delta Lloyd was declared
unconditional, and we have already started the process of bringing the two companies
together. Immediately after the settlement of the oﬀer, we announced the senior leaders
of all business units and the support functions at head oﬃce. These leaders then
addressed the employees of their units at 65 town hall meetings held at 29 diﬀerent
locations, all on the 18th of April.

FINAL

The integration process is being led by the Integration Management Oﬃce which we put
in place sometime ago, charged with ensuring a smooth and successful combination of
the two companies. The dedicated integration managers of all business units and support
functions meet on a weekly basis with a regular interaction with us, the management
board, who are of course ultimately responsible for executing.
I would at this point like to thank the Delta Lloyd and NN employees for their
professionalism in what is, of course, a challenging time for all. It is gratifying to see all our
colleagues working well together to integrate procedures and systems. There is much
work to do to integrate the operations of NN and Delta Lloyd, and this will inevitably have
consequences for employees. We are committed to doing this in a fair, balanced, and
timely manner with respects for the talents and strengths of employees.
During the coming months, we will develop detailed plans for the new combined entity
and we'll give a strategic update to the market during our Capital Markets Day on the
30th of November. We will then be able to give you more information on the integration,
cost savings, and targets.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's turn to slide 7. Our balance sheet remained strong post the Delta Lloyd transaction.
On the 23rd of December, we indicated to you three points. The ﬁrst was that we saw the
pro forma Solvency II ratio at the third quarter of 2016 at approximately 185%. We have
updated that today to approximately 180% at the end of the ﬁrst quarter of 2017. The
adjustments we anticipate making for actuarial assumptions are in line with our original
expectations. Overall, we feel comfortable with this level of Solvency II ratio.
The second point we highlighted was that the pro forma ﬁnancial leverage was at the top
end of our internal appetite levels. Since then, we have taken a signiﬁcant step in bringing
the leverage down through the transaction we did with Fonds NutsOhra which reduced
the nominal debt by just over €400 million.
The third point we highlighted was that we expected to operate at the top end of our €0.5
billion to €1.5 billion cash capital target range. At the end of the ﬁrst quarter this year, the
pro forma cash capital was estimated at €1.9 billion, which is of course above our target
range. This provides us with some ﬂexibility to manage our leverage position going
forward should we desire and also to fund any recapitalization of the Dutch Delta Lloyd
entities that may be needed.
We continue to actively manage our balance sheet, and we took actions during the ﬁrst
quarter to reduce our capital sensitivities. Overall, therefore, I feel we're making good
progress on the balance sheet with our Solvency II ratio remaining strong, already some
reduction in our leverage and a very healthy level of cash capital.
I will now hand over to Delﬁn Rueda. Delﬁn?

FINAL

Thank you, Lard, and good morning to everyone. NN Group reported an operating result
of the ongoing business of €407 (sic) [€406] (11:30) million in the ﬁrst quarter of 2017, up
33% of the same quarter last year. This increase was driven by higher results in all
segments. The higher operating result together with a higher non-operating items and
the lower hedge-related loss at Japan Closed Block VA is reﬂected in increasing the net
result.
The center graph shows the items reconciling the operating result to the net result. The
non-operating items include almost €100 (sic) [€150] (12:04) million of gains on the sale of
government bonds and equities.
Let's now look at the ﬁrst quarter performance of the individual segments on slide 10. As I
already mentioned, all of our operating segments have posted higher results this quarter
compared with the same quarter of 2016. The increase at Netherlands Life was mainly
driven by a higher technical margin and lower expenses, partly oﬀset by lower fees and
premium-based revenues.

Bloomberg Transcript

The current quarter includes €41 million of private equity dividends whereas the ﬁrst
quarter of 2016 was supported by €59 million of private equity and exceptional dividends.
At Netherlands Non-life, the improved result was generated by a favorable claims
development in the individual disability portfolio. The D&A combined ratio for the ﬁrst
quarter was 95%. The results of Property & Casualty also improved, reﬂecting a favorable
underwriting performance in the ﬁre book, although this was largely oﬀset by an
unfavorable claims experienced in both Miscellaneous and Motor. The P&C combined
ratio improved to 103.6%. For Netherlands Non-life, as a whole, the combined ratio
improved to 99.7% from 104.3% in the ﬁrst quarter of 2016.
The higher operating result of Insurance Europe reﬂects higher fees and premium-based
revenues, while the ﬁrst quarter of 2016 was impacted by a €4 million provision related to
the terrorist attacks in Belgium.
The operating result of Japan Life went up 20% from the ﬁrst quarter of 2016, that
excluding currency eﬀects. This reﬂects higher fees and premium-based revenues and a
higher technical margin, partially oﬀset by higher expenses.
The increase in the operating result of Asset Management was driven by higher fees
despite higher expenses. Total Assets under Management decreased to €194 billion from
€195 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 as net inﬂows of third party assets of
€2.1 billion were more than oﬀset by net outﬂows in Aﬃliated Business.
The main components of the segment Other are the holding result, the reinsurance
business and NN Bank. The improved results of this segment in the ﬁrst quarter were
caused by a higher operating result of NN Bank of €24 million.

FINAL

Please now turn to slide 11, which gives more details about the expense savings in the
Netherlands. We have set ourselves a cost target, which aims to reduce the annual
administrative expenses of Netherlands Life, Netherlands Non-life, and the holding
entities to €685 million by the end of 2018. This is a reduction of around 15% compared
with the annualized cost base at the end of the third quarter of 2015.
The expense reduction program is well on track. We achieved €14 million of additional
savings in the ﬁrst quarter of 2017, bringing total cost savings since the start of the
program to €71 million. We will continue to focus on improving eﬃciency by
implementing a range of cost containment measures to deal with upward cost pressures
as well as investments in the business. On the next slide, I will take you through the free
cash ﬂows of NN Group.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide 12, we show the movement in the holding company cash capital during the ﬁrst
quarter of 2017. The holding company cash capital position increased to €3 billion at the
end of the ﬁrst quarter, that is from €2.5 billion at the end of 2016. The free cash ﬂow
during the ﬁrst quarter was €242 million, driven by €296 million of dividends received
from subsidiaries. Details of the dividends upstreamed by segment can be found in the
appendix to this presentation, the cash divestment proceeds relate to the sale of
Mandema & Partners which was completed in January 2017.
The cash capital position is temporarily boosted by the issuance of €500 million of senior
notes in January, which were used to repay the €476 million non-qualifying subordinated
notes earlier this month. And there were cash outﬂows for the acquisition of shares in
Delta Lloyd in February for an amount of €180 million and for the NN shares repurchased
in the ﬁrst quarter for an amount of €82 million.
On slide 13, I would like to talk you through the developments in NN Group's Solvency II
ratio. This slide shows the movement of NN Group's Solvency II ratio, the eligible Own
Funds under Solvency Capital Requirements during the ﬁrst quarter of 2017. During the
quarter, the Solvency II ratio decreased slightly from 241% to 238%. This was mainly due to
market variances, partly oﬀset by the operating return.
I will start with the largest movement. Market variance had a negative impact on the
Solvency II ratio of 9 percentage points. This was mainly due to the widening of credit
spreads on French government bonds ahead of the French presidential elections, and
which, as you know, have since tightened again. This was partially oﬀset by positive
performance of equity and real estate investments. The market variance this quarter also
includes a negative impact from curve (19:00) steepening as well as an increase of the
Solvency Capital Requirements due to higher equity risk.
The operating return had a positive impact of 7 percentage points. This quarter, it
includes the impact of transfers from the separate account to the general account at
Netherlands Life, which led to an increase in Own Funds of €55 million. As the balance of
the separate accounts has reduced signiﬁcantly in the past few years, we expect that the
positive impact of such transfer will be limited in the future.

FINAL

As you know, we disclosed the sensitivities of our Solvency II ratio every six months so we
will provide them for NN Group, including Delta Lloyd at the second quarter results in
August. However, I would like to give you an update now of the sensitivity to government
bond spread as a result of management actions that we took in the ﬁrst quarter of the
year, such as the purchase of credit spread locks on government bonds.
As a result of these actions, the impact on our Solvency II ratio of 50 basis points increase
in government bond spreads has reduced from 37 percentage points at the end of the
previous quarter to around 25 percentage points now. While we generally hold these
government bonds to maturity, and, therefore, consider their spread widening or
tightening as temporary ﬂuctuations, this action help us to reduce the short-term volatility
of our Solvency ratio.

Bloomberg Transcript

I will now move on to the pro forma numbers that we disclosed today for the combined
NN and Delta Lloyd entity. We estimate that the pro forma Solvency II ratio of NN Group,
including Delta Lloyd, at the end of the ﬁrst quarter of 2017, is approximately 180%. This
includes a number of items such as the amount paid to acquire 93.3% of the Delta Lloyd
ordinary shares, as well as our current estimates of the impact from aligning actuarial
assumptions, initial capital synergies and restructuring costs. It also includes the impact of
the transaction with NutsOhra, which was completed in April.
The ﬁrst quarter pro forma holding company cash capital position for NN Group,
including Delta Lloyd, is estimated at €1.9 billion. This number reﬂects the cash
movements since the end of the quarter being the cash settlement for the Delta Lloyd
ordinary shares paid in April, the debt ﬁnancing, the repayment of operating leverage by
NN Bank to the holding company and the repayment of the subordinated notes in May.
As Lard has already mentioned, this is above our target range of €0.5 billion to €1.5
billion. Please bear in mind that this number is before the deduction of the 2016 ﬁnancial
dividend, which will be paid in June, restructuring costs and potential capital injections
into Delta Lloyd units, as well as dividends to be received from operating units.
Let me just remind you that this pro forma numbers are based on current estimates. We
will be reporting full consolidated results and capital numbers for NN Group and Delta
Lloyd combined in the second quarter earnings release in August.
Both the pro forma Solvency ratio and cash capital at the holding are strong, giving us
high level of ﬂexibility. This is conﬁrmed by the pro forma ﬁnancial leverage position,
which is set on the following slide.
Please turn to slide 15. In this graph, you can see the pro forma ﬁnancial leverage position
of NN Group plus Delta Lloyd, which is just under €6 billion at the end of 2016. Since then,
we have issued new subordinated notes and senior notes, the proceeds of which were
used to repay existing debt of NN Group.
The pro forma ﬁnancial leverage position has increased as a result of the €900 million
debt ﬁnancing and the €200 million operational leverage repaid by NN Bank in April.

FINAL

However, on the other hand, we have delivered through the transaction with NutsOhra,
which reduced notional debt by €405 million.
So on balance, the pro forma ﬁnancial leverage position of the combined entity has
increased by around €750 million and now stands at €6.7 billion. Our strong free cash ﬂow
generation give us the option to further deleverage should we want to. We will continue
to manage our ﬁnancial leverage position so that it remains consistent with a single A
ﬁnancial strength credit rating.
And with that, I will pass you back to Lard for the wrap-up.

Eilard Friese
Yes. Thanks, Delﬁn. Let me on slide 17 round oﬀ the presentation by saying that we are
happy with a strong set of results that we have reported today. I am particularly pleased
that every segment has returned to solid performance and has contributed to the increase
in the group's operating result.

Bloomberg Transcript

Eﬃciency in the Netherlands improved further and commercial momentum was strong
with a 28% increase in new sales at our insurance units, good third party asset inﬂows at
our asset manager and healthy production of new mortgages at NN Bank. Our capital
position remains strong with a Solvency II ratio of 238%.
Going forward, we have two priorities. The ﬁrst is to successfully integrate Delta Lloyd into
the NN organization and extract the synergies that we foresee. The integration process
has been launched and we are working hard to ensure smooth transition. Secondly, we
will continue to actively manage the balance sheet and capital position in order to keep
them strong.
This is the ﬁnal set of results for NN Group as a standalone entity. From the second
quarter, we will be reporting results for the combined entity of NN and Delta Lloyd. We
look forward to this new phase in our journey as one combined company. What will not
change going forward will be our focus on further improving the customer experience
through innovation, helping our customers to secure their ﬁnancial futures.
I will now open the call for your questions.

FINAL

Good morning, gentlemen. Just two questions if I may. Firstly, on the sovereign spread
sensitivity, when precisely was that moderated, particularly relative to the peak in French
spreads in late February? And consequently, how much of the negative drag that we saw
in the ﬁrst quarter might ultimately be reversed in the second?
And then secondly, this ﬁnal question is actually partly a request. Is there any intention to
publish the historic pro forma IFRS numbers up to, say, 1Q 2017 before the close period? I
ask that because that will give us something to play with ahead of results in August.
Thanks.

A - Eilard Friese
Yeah. Thanks, Farquhar. The ﬁrst question will be answered by Jan-Hendrik, and the
second by Delﬁn. Maybe it's good to start with the second one. Delﬁn, on the IFRS
ﬁgures.

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Farquhar. Yes, that's – but the answer is, no, we won't publish any or give
guidance of any pro formas, 1Q. You will see that with the opening balance sheet and the
disclosure of the second quarter in August.

A - Eilard Friese

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, Jan-Hendrik?

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

Thank you, Farquhar, for that question. To put that into context, I guess we did roughly €5
billion of spread locks during the quarter, which reduces sensitivity from 37 percentage
points to around 25 percentage points. It wasn't done on one day, it was done through
the quarter and also it wasn't speciﬁcally on the French sovereign, it was done on a basket
of high-quality triple AAA sovereigns and AA, so it's not speciﬁcally to France. But there
will be some muting of the mean reversion, if you can see it like that.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Okay. That's ﬁne. Just coming back on the IFRS numbers because obviously that leaves us
a little bit at sea in terms of what we might expect at the second quarter?

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

This is certainly. Farquhar, I understand that. You have to take into account that the
accounting principles applied by Delta Lloyd are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than those of NN
Group, and we needed to ﬁnalize our alignment of actuarial assumptions and decide the
balance sheet at day one. And that, as you know, takes some time and eﬀort. So I think
you will be well advised that we will not provide any interim guidance on that until we've
got the ﬁnal numbers ready for disclosure on the 17th of August.

FINAL

The next question is from Mr. Ashik Musaddi, JPMorgan. Go ahead please.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of questions. First of all, in terms of cost savings, how
should we think about it? I mean, on one hand, you have given a cost saving from the
merger of around €150 million, and if I look at slide number 11, you're still focused on your
own cost saving as well, which has still left around €75 million. And then, you're also
discussing about potential deleveraging if you have suﬃcient cash at the end of the year.
What I'm trying to understand here is how much of the overlap is here, i.e., for example, if
you have your own cost saving, is it like fully baked into €150 million that you're guiding
for the merger or there could be some mutually exclusive stuﬀ in that as well and the debt
reﬁnancing as well. So, any color on that would be really helpful.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second thing is thanks for your SFCR reporting. It's very useful to get more color on
the adjustment factors. But one thing we noticed is the impact on VOLA on the regulatory
basis is pretty high, the beneﬁts. But then you're also ﬂagging on page number 24 that
you also take into account sovereign spread shock. So, why do you think we should look
both together and not just the impact on the regulatory basis?
The third question is with respect to standard formula. I mean, is it possible for you to give
us any color about how your standard formula has moved versus your internal model
Solvency ratio since you last changed this model? Thank you.

A - Eilard Friese
Thanks, Ashik. I'll take the question ﬁrst on the cost savings, and then I think Jan-Hendrik
will do with the SFCR component. So, ﬁrst, on the cost synergies. Our view on the cost
synergy potential has not changed compared to the guidance that we gave earlier at the
time that we announced the transaction. We expect €150 million pre-tax of annual cost
synergies by 2020. But please bear in mind that these cost synergies are on top of the
existing plans to reduce the expenses of both companies. So, both NN and Delta Lloyd
have existing cost programs, the €150 million are on top of that and to be delivered by
the end of 2020 and it's pre-tax.
Now, if you look at the split of where this needs to come from, it's diﬀerent business units
and head oﬃce that will contribute to this. We expect approximately half of the cost
synergies to be realized in the Life and Non-Life areas, so the big units. And we expect
that in terms of timing to materialize to integrate the same within three years.
While the eﬃciency improvements in the bank and the Asset Management business will
account for approximately 30% of the expected annual cost savings, we expect that to be,
let's say, more on the earlier end of the timeframe. And then, the remainder of the cost
Page 10 of 24

Date: 2017-05-18

FINAL

synergies are expected to achieve – to be achieved in the centralized functions where
there's overlap and other segments. And also there, we expect those, the bank and Asset
Management and the overlap of functions, et cetera to be on the earlier end of the
expense synergy reduction program and the Non-Life and the Life to take a bit longer. As
you may expect, this is more complicated to do from a technology point of view.
We will provide you the – on the Capital Markets Update, we aim to provide you a more
granular update on this. And please note that the disclosure we did today on slide 11, for
instance, the Delﬁn took you through on the expenses were on a standalone basis for NN.
So, please note that, Ashik.
With that, I'm going to hand over to you, Jan-Hendrik, for the SFCR comment.

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Thank you, Lard, and also, Ashik, for your questions. You're right, we published the
SFCR this morning. We wanted to put this out on the same day as our 1Q 2017 release and
you've also spotted there's a peculiarity in there, which is that you see a very large
standalone VOLA eﬀect in the appendix.
This is – you have to put this into context and you sort of answered the ﬁrst part of the
question almost for me by saying that you have to look at this together with the sovereign
spread, the numbers which we show on page 24. And you have to realize that this is part
of a combination, an internal model is made up of many diﬀerent elements and this
treatment is agreed with the DNB that we will also shock sovereigns and then use the
VOLA in this way to oﬀset some partly that eﬀect.
You would not do this in the standard formula, which is also why we ﬂagged the ﬁgure on
page 24, because under the standard formula, you would not shock sovereigns and you
would also not have spread risk capital against mortgages which is something we also
ﬂagged in that paragraph on page 24. So, you really have to look at the combination and
also realize that this is an agreed thing, it's not a transitional that will go away and we
don't really see it impacting our capital generation and crucially our dividend going
forward.
Moving on to your next question on the standard formula, it's actually a bit
uncontroversial. At the 4Q 2016, the ratio was 197%, we think it's 196% now, right. I guess I
don't think I know it's 196% now so it's moved to down 1 point, which you can compare to
3 points for our overall ratio from 241% to 238%, so very similar.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

That's very clear. Thanks a lot.

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

Yeah. You're welcome.

The next question is from Mr. Cor Kluis, ABN AMRO. Go ahead please, sir.

FINAL

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Good morning. Cor Kluis, ABN AMRO. A few questions. So ﬁrst of all, it was good to see
that you reduced your sensitivity for government bond spreads. Going forward, are you
willing to reduce the sensitivity for, let's call it, macro eﬀects further for your Solvency II
ratio? And if so, in which ﬁelds? And related to that, on the 180% Solvency ratio, could you
give an indication, of course it's not exactly clear yet about numerator and denominator of
the 180%.
And the second question is about the Solvency at this moment. It's obvious that Solvency
ratio should be somewhat higher at this moment, especially given what happened in the
French government bonds and on equity markets. Could you give some idea about, the
uptick is 5% higher or at least in that ﬁeld?
And the last thing about slide – on slide 20, there was some dividend of upstreaming of
€73 million from the category other that includes the interest on the subordinated loans.
How large was that interest rate on the subordinated loans? Is that the total amount or
could you give us an idea about that? Those are my questions.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Eilard Friese
Thanks, Cor. Four questions. Let me see how we're going to divide this. So, the ﬁrst one
that will go to Jan-Hendrik, the second one to Delﬁn and then maybe you can do one and
three at the same time which is also the update on Solvency, yeah. And then Delﬁn will
take the second question and the fourth. Yes, so please Jan-Hendrik you ﬁrst.

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

Yes, sir. Thank you, Cor, for that question. I mean, on the sensitivities, I think you have to
realize that. As I said last quarter, we do keep this under review and we do actively
manage the balance sheet within certain target ranges for us. On the other hand, we are a
long-term investor so we try not to be too reactive and we try to balance the two
concerns. I think we will continue to closely monitor the balance sheet sensitivities,
especially now as we bring in the Delta Lloyd balance sheet and work on our Q2
disclosures. So I think you can continue to see active management there. I wouldn't like to
ﬂag now which areas we will bring down further, we will also speak about that when we
do the Q2 disclosures.
And then the Solvency, at this moment, if you look at what's happened since the end of
the quarter, you will see the French, I mean, reversion as you pointed out. On the other
hand, we've also seen credit spreads tightened which is negative for our ratios. So I think
net-net, we're slightly up. I wouldn't like to put a number on it at this point, but slightly
positive.

FINAL

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Cor. I think your second question was about what to expect in the
evolution of the denominator of the Solvency. So, I understood it as how do we expect the
Solvency Capital Requirement to move going forward. Was that your question, Cor?

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

That is more the absolute amount, so you indicate 180%. What's the absolute amount for
the numerator as well as for the denominator that's more the idea?

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Okay. I think that probably it'll be better that we come back to you with the precise

Then there was a question on the interest on the subordinated debt, it's around €10
million a quarter more or less coming from Netherlands Life due to the subordinated loan
that NN Group has provided to NN Life.

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Okay. And what's then the other €63 million?

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Sorry. I'm a bit confused with the question on the dividend. You're talking about the €73
million...

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

The slight...

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yeah, but that was a special dividend coming from a legacy business that we had in the
UK related to all liabilities that has been ﬁnally settled and that was one-oﬀ dividend that
had been received from this legal entity – this legacy entity, which won't be repeated.

The next question is from Mr. Matthias de Wit, KBC. Go ahead please, sir.

FINAL

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Two questions, please. The ﬁrst is on the Own Funds generation. You
report an operating return of €0.3 billion, but if I look at the 7 percentage points you
mentioned on the opening SCR, I get to a number closer to €0.4 billion. So, can you
provide the unrounded number? And also elaborate a bit on why it improved so
substantially compared to the €100 million underlying number you reported for last year
in Q1?
And second question is on the holding cash capital and the leverage. You're currently
around €400 million ahead of your upper end of the target. And I guess it makes sense to
use this excess to redeem the Delta Lloyd senior bond. Just wonder to what extent you
plan to further delever the capital base, what is consistent with your targeted rating in
terms of gross leverage? And is there also a need to spend a lot of cash on recapitalizing
Delta Lloyd or is that not on the agenda at this point in time? Thank you.

A - Eilard Friese
Yes. Matthias, thanks for your questions. Delﬁn, can you take those, please?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Matthias. For the capital generation and the operating return in the
quarter, as you have seen, it is €0.3 billion, of which €55 million is related to the
movement from the separate account to the general account, and that is something that
going forward as the volume of separate account reduces is not expected that to be
maintained and will reduce signiﬁcantly.
I have indicated in the past as well that this operating return, as you know, will oscillate
and vary, as you know, from one quarter to another. So, apart from this €55 million that I
have just mentioned, there is nothing else or in particular that I'll mention has been
extraordinary within that quarter.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Okay. Is there anything you can say on the unrounded number because I get closer to
€0.4 billion if I'm using the 7% on the opening SCR?

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yeah. As you know that because of the changes in experience variance in the quarter, the
contribution from the Non-life, but also from Asset Management and in Life, and due to
the changes in the spreads and the value of our Solvency II balance sheet at the start of
every quarter, we've been reluctant and we continue to be in order to provide any
speciﬁc, as you know, run rate.

Page 14 of 24



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2017-05-18

So I will repeat that in the quarter, apart from this €55 million there is nothing special or
particular. There was some positive experience variance, but that as you know from one
quarter to another, sometimes is positive, sometimes it could be negative, and that
variation you will see reﬂected going forward as well.

FINAL

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

In terms of the cash capital, indeed, the pro forma level of cash capital is €1.9 billion at the
end of the quarter, and that, indeed, provide some further ﬁnancial – it provides a strong
ﬁnancial ﬂexibility and, indeed, that's something that we will consider to either reduce
leverage and there could be a good opportunity to do that in November when the Delta
Lloyd senior debt came to maturity or if we feel it necessarily to increase the level of
Solvency capital at any of the Delta Lloyd entities, but that's something that of course we
will decide over time within this quarter.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Okay. Very clear. Thank you.

The next question is from Mr. Arjan van Veen, UBS. Go ahead please.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

Thank you. I just have two questions. The ﬁrst one is just around the pro forma Solvency
position you've given. I just want to clarify a couple of points in terms of assumptions. So,
ﬁrstly, I think, at 3Q 2016, you said it was roughly a 5% reduction expected from the
equalization of assumption. So, just I think Lard conﬁrmed that in his call earlier. Can you
just conﬁrm that? Secondly, can you just conﬁrm you've adjusted for the new LAC-DT
guidance in your Solvency numbers?
And thirdly, the €476 million reduction in the sub-debt in May, you've adjusted your pro
forma capital, holding company cash for that, you've adjusted the debt position for that in
your slide. Just double checking that, that's also in your pro forma capital number of €180
million.
And then secondly, just following up on the question on capital generation. So it's much
stronger underlying than what you would assume in one quarter and I know you said it's
volatile quarter-on-quarter. But, can you maybe just give us some color as to whether that
underlying number is improving because obviously it's very weak one quarter, but this is
much stronger than even what we saw in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q last year. So, whether there's
rising interest rates or we're seeing some improvement in the underlying cash ﬂow
generation on the Solvency II basis. Thank you.

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you very much, Arjan. So, four questions. Please tell me if I forget any of the four.
So, the third (45:46) question about the impact of the actuarial assumptions but other
factors. So, this 5% decrease that you're talking about is not only the actuarial
assumptions, but also includes restructuring expenses and also our initial estimates of the
initial capital synergies that are going to be extracted.
So, what we've seen when you compare the pro forma estimate that we did at the end of
September that we disclosed in December and what we obviously know now with much
more detail analysis looking into the same assumptions is that we are very pleased that in
terms of the alignment of actuarial assumptions, they doesn't really change very material,
which was something that we are very happy with.
Of course, there are things going up and down but very much the decrease in this
Solvency pro forma ratio from 185% to 180% is very much related to the actual evolution,
the decrease on the Solvency ratio of both entities and then on Delta Lloyd since
September, and this is mainly driven by market movements.

Bloomberg Transcript

Your second question on the LACDT, the answer is yes. Since the end of December for
both NN and Delta Lloyd, we believe that we have applied the DNB guidance, as you
know, accordingly.
And in terms of the debt reduction, yes, I think your question is if that is, as you know,
what is included within that calculation of the pro forma, so, maybe I can take you through
that. So, we are taking obviously the price paid to acquire the 93% that was €2.3 billion.
Also the reversal of the equity charge on the 9.7% Delta Lloyd ordinary shares that they
were included in the Solvency Capital Requirement at the ﬁrst quarter 2017. The impact of
the transaction that we did with NutsOhra that was completed in April, so, that's reﬂected
in that pro forma. And also as you said, the alignment of the actuarial assumption, the
initial capital synergies and the restructuring cost. So this is...

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

Delﬁn, sorry to interrupt you, but the €500 million sub-debt, is that also taken out in May,
because you adjusted all the other numbers on a pro forma basis allowing for that
(48:25)?

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yeah. But you must keep in mind that the €476 million is not a Solvency II qualify – it
doesn't qualify for Solvency II purpose. So, it does not...

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Then in terms of the last question was about the underlying cash ﬂow generation on the
Solvency II basis. And I think as I explained before, yes, it was a strong quarter but nothing
atypical (49:04) apart from this €55 million that I have already indicated.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

One thing. Maybe because you're looking for some guidance in terms of the capital
generation, probably you can refer to what has been the actual evolution over the full
2016. That takes a bit less, reduces the volatility from one quarter to another.

Q - Arjan van Veen

The next question is from Mr. Robin van den Broek, Mediobanca. Go ahead please, sir.

Q - Robin van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit – we
know that Delta Lloyd reported 144% Solvency II ratio, but maybe you can provide some
details on where Delta Lloyd Life sits because of your speciﬁc comment on potentially
recapitalizing and the Delta Lloyd subsidiaries. I think that would be an interesting
comment.

Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2017-05-18

FINAL

Secondly, we know the UFR is changing. Could you conﬁrm that the impact for your
combined ratio would be around 16 percentage points? And connected to that, can you
maybe give some indication on how the quality of the capital looks like? So, basically how
much steering space do you have in the restricted Tier 1 bucket and the Tier 2, Tier 3
buckets? Thank you.

A - Eilard Friese
Yeah. So, thanks, Robin. I'll ask Jan-Hendrik to comment on the impact of the UFR and the
combined. And then, I'll ask Delﬁn to comment on your other two questions.

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Lard, and hello, Robin. Well, we've all seen the announcement from
EIOPA that they will reduce from 1 January 2018 the UFR to 4.05%. So, the impact of that
on the NN Group standalone Solvency ratio is around 4 percentage points, and on the
pro forma number, we have estimated around 5 percentage points. So I don't know quite
where your ﬁgure comes from, 16% (sic) [16 percentage points] (51:19), but that's the
number as of 1 January.

Q - Robin van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

The fully loaded, I mean, from 4.2% to 3.65%.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

Yeah. I see. So, you're rolling it forward already into the future for quite a few years. The
interesting thing is that they've also said it will reduce by 15 basis points per annum. So,
you cannot actually ever get to 3.65% if you go down from 4.2% in steps of 15 basis
points. So it is a little bit a theoretical number. I think the NN Group standalone number is
roughly in the range that you've indicated there, but to reiterate, this will happen over
many years. It's not that this will be the position today or in fact, in one year. And it will, of
course, come back through higher capital generation. As the UFR comes down, the UFR
drag, of course, also goes down and also as rates go up. So, we will see increased capital
generation as the ﬂipside of that.

Q - Robin van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

Yeah. But this could maybe be a topic of discussion also with the recapitalization of certain
Delta Lloyds units with the Dutch Central Bank. So that's why I'm basically asking these
two questions to see, yeah, a likelihood there basically.

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

Understood.

A - Eilard Friese
So Delﬁn, the other questions.

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. The Solvency II ratio of Delta Lloyd Life was 135% at the fourth quarter 2016. That was
disclosed by Delta Lloyd. And the quarter has improved somewhat in the quarter, and this
was driven by the positive impact of changes in the portfolio as well as the higher interest
rates. Please maybe just, of course, to ﬂag that this does not yet reﬂect, the actuarial
assumption alignments that we have indicated in the pro forma for the combined ratio.
But the evolution in the quarter was slightly positive.
In terms of the tiering, as you know, in Q4, both NN and Delta Lloyd, as you know, had
some tiering constraint for the Tier 3. And that is also when you look at the combined
entity, that will be a constraint, that, as you know, it's expected, as you know, to persist
after the combination. And that, as you know, is driven by the limitation of the 15% of the
Solvency capital requirement, and that's very little that we can do to amend that.
However, maybe just to ﬂag that with the Fonds NutsOhra transaction, that has given us
some ﬂexibility in the tiering as we increase the unrestricted Tier 1. And with that, we open
some small, as you know, capacity on the Tier 1 restricted on a pro forma basis. As well as,
as you know, the Tier 2, there is also not signiﬁcant but there is – we estimate pro forma to
have some scope there. And as I said, as you know, the cap on the Tier 3 is expected to
continue with the combination.

Q - Robin van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. That's very clear. Thank you.

Operator
The next question is from Mr. Debart Jooris, Degroof Petercam. Go ahead please, sir.
Yes. Hello. A few questions. First of all, on the dividend upstream, could you give us some
clariﬁcation on why there is no dividend upstream from Netherlands Non-Life this
quarter? And still on Netherlands Non-life, we see some improvements on the combined
ratio, especially on D&A. P&C is also improved but it's still at 104% almost. Could you give
us an idea when you expect this to fall below 100%? And then, very, very shortly, at which
exact date will the consolidation with Delta Lloyd start ? Will there be a full second quarter
or a partial one?

A - Eilard Friese
Yeah. Thanks, Bart (55:21). So, let me take the Non-Life question, then Delﬁn will take the
other two questions. So, ﬁrst on Non-Life. This quarter we saw the Non-Life combined
ratio of NN dropping below 100%, which is mainly driven by the favorable results we saw
in the individual disability business. If you look at the P&C business, also in ﬁre, we saw a
good result versus the same period last year. Having said that, the motor book and the
miscellaneous segment were not as strong.
You do need to note that we will continue to drive through a combination of expense
reductions, underwriting improvement, stopping non-proﬁtable products, et cetera. We
Page 19 of 24



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity

will continue to work toward our 2018 target of 97% or lower than that. This is a good
quarter. We're pleased with that, driven by disability. Please note that on the P&C side,
this can be volatile. With that, I'd like to hand over to you Delﬁn.

FINAL

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks, Bart (56:30). So, on the dividend upstream from Non-Life, I don't think there
is anything special to mention or anything to read. So, dividends come, as you know,
some quarters, others not and the only thing that we have ﬂagged. So, we do continue
seeing the capacity of the Non-Life company to distribute dividends and they will do in
due course. The only thing to ﬂag is, as you know, that there is some – for particularly
Insurance Europe, there is, as you know, some tendency to have the majority of the
dividends been in the second quarter of the year. But you have in the appendix to the
presentation, as you know, the details and you can see also how this dividends has
evolved over the last, as you know, two years as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of the days for the consolidation, in terms of – as you know, in legal terms, we
acquire control of Delta Lloyd on the 12th of April. However, for accounting and reporting
purposes, it is the day that the oﬀer was declared unconditional. And that was the 7th of
April. So, we believe that it will be very easy to account for the transaction for the full
quarter, so, that as if the transaction has happened on the 1st of April. Of course, there is a
few things that we need to check from an accounting point of view that there is not any
signiﬁcant deviation for that week. But as you can anticipate that in the second quarter of
the year, you will see fully reﬂected the proﬁt of the combined entity already for a full
quarter.

Okay. Thank you very much.
The next question is from Mr. Steven Haywood, HSBC. Go ahead please, sir.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Good morning, again, and good morning, everyone. On your Solvency II pro forma ratio, I
wonder whether you've included any capitalized cost synergies there at all. And then I see
in your press release that you've highlighted the unit-linked mis-selling again. And there is
a couple of collective actions that are happening at the moment. We'll get some update
in the second half of this year. But you say they're similar to the November 2013 claim.
What happened with that claim and also what are your expectations for the two new
claims? Thank you.

A - Eilard Friese
Yeah. So, let me talk about the unit-linked – while you call it mis-selling, but unit-linked ﬁle,
but ﬁrst maybe, Delﬁn, on the Solvency II.

Page 20 of 24



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2017-05-18

Yes. Steven, so the answer is no. We have not included any assumption or any impact of
the capitalized cost synergies. However, we have taken into account, as you know, some
estimate in the same way that we did it in December for the restructuring cost, but not for
the potential beneﬁts in terms of cost synergies going forward.

FINAL

A - Eilard Friese
And when it comes to the unit-linked ﬁle, ﬁrst and foremost, the most important thing is
that we have an active reach-out program, as you know, to customers. And we continue
that, which is the most eﬀective way of addressing any customer complaints. And we're
making good headway there. And when it comes to the legal proceedings that we see in
the industry and also against us, we update you regularly if there is something to update
you on.
What we've said is that at this point in time, there is nothing that changes our disclosures
at this point that we cannot reliably estimate if and if so, to what extent something would
come out of this. We do expect around the summertime some ﬁrst rulings to come out in
the cases against us. And for the remainder, we obviously follow the various cases in the
industry on this ﬁle closely and monitor that.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. But just on the previous one, just what happened to the collective action
that started in November 2013?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Eilard Friese
Well, the collective proceedings, I don't know where you get that 13th of November date
from, but if you talk about the collective proceedings against us in courts, we expect the
Rotterdam Court to do some rulings on this in the summertime.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. I was just referring to the press release, there is a comment about
November 2013.

A - Eilard Friese
That is when they started. I'm sorry, yeah, now I see it Steven this is when they started. But
again, we expect the ﬁrst ruling to come out before the summer.

The next question is from Mr. Bart Horsten, Kempen. Go ahead, please, sir.

Q - Bart Horsten

{BIO 2390919 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. So I have a few questions left. First, on the pro forma cash position at
the holding level. You still have a bandwidth of €0.5 billion to €1.5 billion. Is it fair to
assume that you will keep that bandwidth after consolidation of Delta Lloyd? I could
imagine that it could also increase because the increasing of balance sheet. More or less
related to that is could you also give on the pro forma – you gave your leverage, what
would be the pro forma leverage ratio at this stage?
My last question related to Japan Life. With the signiﬁcant drives in underlying result
there, is it fair to assume also looking at the premium growth still going on that this trend
will continue there? Thank you.

A - Eilard Friese
Okay, Delﬁn.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Bart. So, that indeed, we have indicated as a target to have cash capital
in the range of €0.5 billion to €1.5 billion cash capital at the holding. As you might recall
when we were presenting this target, I said that we have made it in a relatively broad
range in order to accommodate diﬀerent scenarios. And also I think at the time of
announcing the acquisition of Delta Lloyd, I said that that was one of the scenarios that we
think they are still – can be accommodated within this group.
I don't think it's right just to assume that because the SCR of the combined entity that they
require cash capital at the holdings should increase. Obviously, this is because the – in
each of the operating entities, there is also Owns Funds and we need that to basically, as
you know, look at how the Own Funds, the SCR and the risk for each of the units interact.
And as a consequence, at this stage, we are very comfortable with the range of €0.5
billion to €1.5 billion and there is no intention to change it.
It's only logical, if I may add, that as we are in the process to fully integrate in Delta Lloyd
that initially that we want to stay in the upper end of this range. But the range as a target
stays the same.

Then in terms of a pro forma leverage ratio, it's diﬃcult to do it until we have ﬁnalized the
day one balance sheet of the entity because of the accounting diﬀerence that I mentioned
before. So, this is, as you know, our ratio for which you need to have the shareholders,
IFRS shareholders equity. But what I would say is that we do expect that to be comfortable
and more importantly is that debt service capacity. And that debt service capacity that is
currently for NN Group standalone around 13 times is obviously going to reduce but we
do expect that still to be at a very good level, and certainly in accordance with our rating
objectives.
And in terms of the Japan Life, as you know, proﬁtability, indeed, we are very pleased with
the growth in the revenues and we do expect that there is some positive momentum in
their proﬁtability. But keep in mind that Japan Life has signiﬁcant seasonality. And as a
consequence, the ﬁrst quarter and the third quarter of the year tends to be higher in
terms of IFRS proﬁt. And also in the ﬁrst quarter, there has been a very good technical
result, tends to be volatile and usually, we would expect to have a lower technical result in
Japan.

Yes. Everybody, thank you for all your questions. Before we end the call, let me conclude
