{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Good morning and thank you for joining the call this morning. The Hartford second quarter
financial results were strong, with excellent Group Benefits margins and solid P&C
margins, including lower catastrophe losses than last year. We closed the acquisition of
Navigators in May, which brings expanded market and growth opportunities in
Commercial Lines. I remain highly confident of the strategic and financial benefits this
acquisition will produce.
Second quarter core earnings rose 18% over prior year to $485 million or $1.33 per diluted
share. Our businesses are performing well. The P&C underlying combined ratio was 92.6
in the quarter and the Group Benefits core earnings margin was 7.5%. The consolidated
12-month core earnings ROE was 11.7%, well in excess of our cost of equity and among the
best in the industry. During the quarter, we began share repurchases under the $1 billion
authorization and expect to continue to return excess capital to shareholders in '19 and
2020 from share repurchases and quarterly dividends, helping drive long-term
shareholder value creation.

FINAL

Doug and Beth will cover segment results in more detail, but I wanted to touch briefly on
a few high-level items. Commercial Lines underwriting results, which included Navigators
for just five weeks remained solid. Ongoing investments in technology, digital and product
are driving enhanced capabilities and growth. The cost of these investments put slight
pressure on the expense ratio, which is expected to continue for the near term.
Year-to-date, the underlying combined ratio for Commercial Lines is 92.9, a solid result in
a competitive market. Personal Lines results were much better than last year, with a lower
current accident year loss ratio including reduced catastrophe losses. Planned marketing
and other initiatives continued, increasing the expense ratio, but also driving a 49%
increase in new business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Group Benefits earnings continued to be simply outstanding with a year-to-date loss ratio
of 74.7%, almost 2 points better than last year along with a slightly lower expense ratio.
Persistency in new business levels are solid and include continued growth in voluntary
product sales. We recently appointed Jonathan Bennett, a talented and versatile Hartford
leader, Head of Group Benefits following the announced retirement of Mike Concannon.
Mike has been with The Hartford for more than two decades with a long list of
accomplishments and contributions and we wish him well. Jonathan and I will be working
closely to ensure a smooth transition and a continued track record of success in Group
Benefits. Finally, higher equity capital markets helped Hartford's funds recover from the
earnings impact of the fourth quarter decrease in assets under management.
Turning to Navigators, this quarter results include charges related to the acquisition for;
one, the purchase of the previously announced adverse loss development cover; and
second increase in loss reserves from the completion of our review for the 2018 and prior
accident years and the 2019 loss picks.
With the reserve review completed, we are fully focused on achieving the strategic and
financial benefits of this acquisition. Only 2.5 months after closing, a significant amount of
progress has been made on multiple initiatives and I am pleased with the continued
positive feedback from agents and brokers about the combined potential of our business.
We expect a smooth trend -- excuse me -- we expect a smooth integration and remain
confident of the future benefits we will realize from expanded product and underwriting
capabilities. In addition, we expect to generate good returns on this investment, reaching
approximately $200 million in core earnings, excluding the amortization of intangibles,
within the next four years to five years.
We are also encouraged by the recent firming in Commercial Lines pricing, particularly in
global specialty, which is better than anticipated when we first announced the acquisition.
Doug will discuss the market in more detail, but I would note that loss trends in certain
lines needed increased pricings to achieve acceptable returns, and in part, informed our
judgments on the acquired reserves and the 2019 accident year loss picks.
The team is focused on capturing the benefit of improving pricing, terms and conditions,
particularly in international, where results in recent years have been poor. In addition to
the trends in global specialty, we are also seeing stronger pricing and growth

FINAL

opportunities in middle and large commercial. I am pleased to see the previous
investments in expanded industry verticals, are generating strong new business growth.
To conclude on the quarter in year-to-date, our performance is strong, Commercial Lines
has momentum and the Navigators integration is going well.
The outlook for Commercial Lines in the second half of 2019, which includes Navigators,
remains largely consistent with our view, provided earlier this year. We expect an
underlying combined ratio of 92 to 94. This outlook is essentially flat with last year,
including the impact of Navigators, which has a slightly higher combined ratio then The
Hartford Commercial Lines book. In total, we are well positioned to achieve or exceed the
business metric outlook we provided in February and to sustain a strong consolidated
ROE.
Before turning the call over to Doug, I wanted to note that we recently published our 2018
Sustainability Report, which provides a summary of our commitment to environmental
stewardship, communities and giving, diversity and inclusion, and ethics and governance.
As a company in business for more than 200 years, we understand what it takes to be
sustainable, and how the Company's actions align with our mission to underwrite human
achievement. We are proud of The Hartford's track record and are committed to
achieving the specific goal summarized in our report. You could find that report along with
other information on our Sustainability Programs on our website.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Doug.

Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. This was a strong quarter for our business
units and as Chris noted, strategically significant as we closed our acquisition of
Navigators. Our Hartford Property and Casualty business units performed very well, with
strong execution on the top and bottom line and Group Benefits posted another quarter
of outstanding earnings. Underlying performance in the former Navigators business units,
which excludes prior-period development and catastrophe losses, was in line with our
expectations as we've positioned these lines for profitable growth in a rapidly improving
specialty marketplace, where underwriting is tightening and pricing is firming.
In the second quarter, we booked prior accident year reserve adjustments for Navigators
in several lines of business and also reset the 2019 accident year loss selections. Beth will
be discussing these actions in greater detail.
Our integration is off to a strong start. We've hit the ground running with teams working
together in the market and across all parts of our enterprise to align strategy, resources
and outcomes. Over the summer months, we're conducting nearly 400 agent and broker
meetings to roll out our combined product capabilities. Talent and expertise were primary
drivers of the deal, and we're very excited to have over 800 new teammates join our
ranks. The market leadership and underwriting skill these experienced professionals bring
to the combined organization is already evident. Efforts began immediately to jointly

FINAL

market our expanded product portfolio as we're now able to effectively deliver a broader
range of coverage solutions to agents, brokers and customers.
I'm very encouraged by several recent wins and the positive reaction of the agents and
brokers to writing more lines of business per account with us. Our teamwork is evident to
the marketplace and I'm confident we will continue to find more opportunities for growth.
I'll provide more commentary on Navigators performance and current marketplace trends
in a moment, but let me begin the review of our business results with Group Benefits,
which delivered another outstanding quarter, posting core earnings of $115 million with a
margin of 7.5%. The increase versus prior year was driven by favorable disability results,
higher net investment income and lower amortization of intangibles. This was partially
offset by a slightly higher life loss ratio, increased investments in technology and customer
experience, and higher commissions. The lower disability loss ratio reflects favorable
incident trends across recent accident years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Shifting over to Personal Lines, we had a solid quarter with an underlying combined ratio
of 91. In Personal Lines auto, the underlying combined ratio of 96.7 was 0.2 point [ph]
higher than 2018 with favorable frequency trends and a severity in the low to mid single
digit range. Collision severity remains elevated due to higher repair costs associated with
newer vehicles and a larger mix of total losses.
Overall loss cost trends are developing within our expectations. We remain focused on
returning to growth in AARP direct auto, our lead product for marketing and new
customer acquisition. New business in this line grew 44% for the quarter. Direct marketing
response rates continue to be strong and our conversion ratio was up versus prior year.
Over the last few years, AARP auto retention has improved several percentage points.
We remain focused on further increases to retention as a key factor and achieving total
written premium growth.
Turning over to Commercial Lines, the second quarter underlying combined ratio was
93.2, up 3.2 points versus 2018. The increase was primarily due to elevated inland marine
loss experienced in middle market, higher expenses and the addition of Navigator results
for five weeks post closing. For the quarter, renewal written pricing in standard
Commercial Lines was 2.2%, up slightly from first quarter of the year. Pricing, excluding
workers' compensation was 5.5%, up several tenths of a point versus first quarter, driven
primarily by increases in middle market. Pricing in auto is nearly double digits and we saw
solid increases in property and general liability.
Margins in workers' compensation were strong across our business units and consistent
with our expectations. Results to-date indicate that we're managing market forces
effectively, and I remain pleased with our workers' compensation pricing and underwriting
strategy as we seek to balance margins and growth.
Let me touch on a few additional details for our commercial businesses. Small
Commercial had another excellent quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 87.8.
Written premium grew 6% with $183 million of new business and excellent retention in the
high-80s. New business was led by the Foremost renewal rights deal. In addition, we also

FINAL

experienced excellent growth from our core book, with new business up 10% versus prior
year. New business flow from the Foremost deal is essentially complete at this point. This
is a great opportunity for us to scale our market leading platform and to extend our
partnership with many of our existing agents.
We also developed a number of new agency relationships that have been growing
steadily over the last year. Our team executed flawlessly on this transaction and we're
well prepared for similar opportunities in the future. In Middle & Large Commercial, the
underlying combined ratio was 100.9, increasing 3.8 points versus last year. We
experienced another quarter with a number of large losses in The Hartford inland marine
book, specifically builders' risk. Approximately 3 points of this increase is attributable to
large water intrusion claims that occurred near project completion. Several of these losses
resulted from less experienced workers on the job in this tight labor market. We've taken
action to address this part of our business and expect performance to improve.

Bloomberg Transcript

The expense ratio was also slightly higher, driven primarily by commissions. Written
premium in Middle & Large commercial increased 15%. Retentions were solid and new
business production was outstanding at $177 million for middle market, up 31% versus prior
year. New business growth continues to be fueled by our industry practice groups in areas
such as construction, programs and energy. We're also seeing strong growth in our other
core industries, including manufacturing, technology and professional services. Our
strategy of underwriting specialization is helping to drive this growth and increase our
focus on pricing and margin improvement.
In Global Specialty, comprised of US, international and reinsurance business units, the
underlying combined ratio was 90.7. Given that Navigators are only included for five weeks
of the second quarter, I'll focus my commentary on current business performance and
marketplace trends. Overall, the specialty markets are in positive transition. Industry
financial results support the need for pricing and underwriting actions as prior years have
been developing unfavorably in several lines.
Our global specialty team has experienced progressively firming market conditions each
month during the quarter. Renewal pricing for Navigators business block was in the high
single digits for the quarter, up more than 5 points from the first quarter and also from
prior year. Lines of business with particularly strong pricing include marine cargo, excess
casualty, D&O and property. This is an important time for our teams to be focused on
business fundamentals and now that the deal is closed, our Number 1 priority is improving
margin performance.
Let me now turn to the individual business units of Global Specialty. In the US, we
recorded prior-year development largely in the ocean marine, primary casualty and D&O
books, with only modest adjustment to the current year loss ratios in casualty. Underlying
performance year-to-date has been solid with strong returns in management and
professional liability lines and bond. Given the market momentum I just described, our
trends is for -- our outlook is for favorable renewal pricing trends exceeding expected
loss trends.

The international business primarily comprised of Lloyd's Syndicate and London market
portfolio has been under financial stress due to its historical growth focus. We've
increased our prior and current accident year loss ratio picks in financial and casualty lines
and are fundamentally repositioning portions of this book through underwriting and nonrenewal actions. The rapidly firming market will provide a tailwind as we execute our
business plans for needed margin improvement. In global reinsurance, our business is
mainly comprised of accident and health, property, global credit, Latin American surety
and other casualty lines.
During 2019, underwriting results have been challenged in the accident and health,
resulting in prior-year reserve development and an increase to the current year loss ratio.
This is largely a medical stop loss business and we're aggressively tightening our
underwriting and increasing pricing while non-renewing accounts that do not meet our
financial thresholds. As we look ahead with Global Specialty, I am more convinced than
ever that our expanded talent and product capabilities are a powerful addition to our
Commercial Lines platform. Vince Tizzio, our Global Specialty leader along with a very
experienced team comprised of both Navigators and Hartford teammates, are driving
business plans with great acumen and energy. As we work together every day and now
with the full engagement of our agents and brokers, I see our strategy unfolding in the
market, positioning us for further success as a commercial lines leader.
Based on our year-to-date results, our outlook for commercial lines in the second half of
2019 is for a combined ratio of between 95 and 97, with an underlying combined ratio of
between 92 and 94. Total commercial lines earned premium for the six months is
expected to be approximately $4.4 billion. In closing this quarter represents an exciting
milestone in our journey. Our integration with Navigators is in full swing.
We're operating as a combined organization bringing broad capabilities and deep
underwriting expertise to the market and we continue to see new opportunities to
leverage these skills in all parts of our Commercial Lines business. This important step
forward along with the strength of our Group Benefits and Personal Line businesses,
positions The Hartford for continued success. We look forward to updating you on our
progress in the quarters ahead.
Let me now turn the call over to Beth.

Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Thank you, Doug.
Today, I'm going to cover second quarter results for the investment portfolio, Hartford
Funds and corporate including capital management activities as well as the impact of the
Navigators acquisition. The investment portfolio continues to perform very well with no
impairments, strong LTE returns, and generally stable investment yield. Net investment
income was $488 million for the quarter, up $60 million or 14% from the prior year quarter.
Excluding Navigators, net investment income was $476 million or 11% higher than the prior
year quarter.

FINAL

Limited partnership returns were strong in all asset classes with an annualized return of
14% for both the quarter and year-to-date. This compares to an annualized yield of 9.5%
in second quarter 2018. The annualized portfolio yield was 4.2% before tax and 3.4% after
tax, slightly above second quarter 2018. Excluding LPs, the second quarter 2019
annualized portfolio yield was 3.1% after tax, flat with second quarter 2018.
Lower market interest rates and tighter credit spreads increased net unrealized gains on
fixed maturities after tax to a total of $1.4 billion at June 30th from about $700 million at
March 31st and almost no net unrealized gain at year-end 2018. As a reminder, unrealized
gains on equity securities are classified and realized capital gains in the income statement
and are not included in AOCI. Total realized and unrealized gains on equity securities
were $30 million before tax in the quarter and $162 million before tax year-to-date.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to Hartford Funds, core earnings of $38 million were flat with last year and up $10
million sequentially. Daily average AUM rose 5% from first quarter 2019, reflecting strong
market performance, partially offset by modest net outflows and was up about 1% over
second quarter 2018. Investment performance remains very strong. As of June 30th,
2019, about 70% of Hartford Fund outperformed peers on a one, three and five-year
basis. Corporate core losses of $35 million were 54% lower than second quarter 2018,
principally due to higher investment income and lower interest expense due to net debt
reduction over the last year.
As a reminder, the three main drivers of corporate results, our investment income on cash
and short-term investments, interest expense and preferred dividends and net income
from our investment in Talcott. Taking into consideration the reduction in average cash
and short-term investments due to the $2.1 billion purchase price for Navigators as well as
interest expense and timing of preferred dividends, I would expect the quarterly run rate
in corporate to be a loss of $55 million to $65 million after tax, before consideration of net
income from the Talcott investments. The impact of our proportionate share of Talcott's
net income is harder to predict and was $22 million after tax in the first quarter and $2
million after tax this quarter.
During the quarter, we began share repurchases under the $1 billion authorization. Since
its inception and through the end of July, we have repurchased about 800,000 shares for
$43 million. As previously discussed, we expect to use this program with discretion based
on current and projected holding company cash position and liquidity needs and expect to
utilize the majority of the program in 2020.
In total, second quarter core earnings of $485 million and core earnings per diluted share
of $1.33 were both up 18% over second quarter 2018. Excluding AOCI, book value per
diluted share was $41.55, up 5% year-to-date and 9% since June 30th 2018. Core
earnings ROE over the last 12 months, which includes fourth quarter 2018's wildfire
catastrophe losses, was 11.7%. Our year-to-date annualized core earnings ROE is 13.4%.
The closing of the Navigators acquisition on May 23rd impacted our results in several
areas. I will briefly review these and additional details are included on pages 6 and 7 of
the slides.

FINAL

Core earnings had a modest net contribution from Navigators as the closing occurred
more than halfway through the quarter. Net income included several acquisition-related
charges. First, in the quarter, we recorded transaction and integration-related costs of $31
million before tax, of which $21 million was related to Navigators. We expect to incur
additional charges through 2021 for a total of $90 million to $100 million before tax, of
which $15 million [ph] relates to integration activities.
Second, upon closing, we entered into the previously announced adverse development
cover and recorded a charge of $72 million after tax. Finally, we made two adjustments to
Navigators reserves after closing. We increased the pre-acquisition 2019 accident year
reserves by $29 million before tax. We also increased our estimate of prior-year loss
reserves by $159 million, of which $91 million was ceded to the ADC, resulting in a net
charge of $68 million before tax.
After these actions, there remains $209 million of coverage under the ADC for
development for 2018 and prior accident year reserves. Overall, the reserve actions we
have taken incorporate our methodologies and judgments. Going forward, Navigators
reserves will be part of our normal quarterly reserve review process.

Bloomberg Transcript

To summarize , second quarter results were very strong. We are hard at work on the
integration of Navigators and focused on maximizing the potential of all of our businesses
with our combined teams and enhanced product and underwriting capabilities. With
strong capital generation and financial flexibility, we are pleased to be able to both invest
in our businesses and return capital to shareholders. We look forward to updating you on
our progress.
I'll now turn the call over to Susan so we can begin the Q&A session.

FINAL

Okay, great. So, first question for you all. Chris, just curious, could you kind of walk through
from the Navigators perspective, now that you've got it integrated -- integrated on your
books, how does your kind of accretion forecast look? Are we at the low end, high end,
kind of what are your expectations for it ?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Sure, thanks for joining us, Brian. As we said, both Doug and I and Beth in our prepared
comments, I mean, we're confident about both the financial and strategic aspects here. I
think, on a longer-term basis, we'll still see the ability to generate $200 million of core
earnings, ex-amortization of intangibles over the next four to five years. I think there's four
levers that remain the same that we've talked about, what's going to contribute to that.
One would be expenses, two would be NII, three would be, you heard from Doug, the
actions that we're beginning to take on the in-force management to improve the margins
on the existing book. And then, fourth a contributor, but not a large one is the cross-sell
revenue. So, I would say those are the components. The waiting might be a little different,
Brian, than we first thought six months to nine months ago, particularly with lower interest
rates, but I would say that we didn't expect this level of pricing firming as rapidly as it has
been.
So, we've taken the adjustments so -- we think we needed to, particularly on the '19 year
loss picks, which is generally in line with our pricing models and our deal models, maybe
slightly a little higher, but equally, I think there is more rate environment, more rate to
capture. So, we see all those pieces fitting together to generate that $200 million of core
earnings and remainder, really, really confident and pleased with how the teams have
been interacting and behaving particularly in the marketplace.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Excellent. And then another question, I'm just curious, could you talk a little bit about your
thoughts and exposure to the reviver statutes and kind of what we're seeing -- what's
going on all these states?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Sure. I guess, there is one another point I would just mention as it relates to the
integration activities. I mean, we did guide in our prior call to $110 million to $145 million of
core earnings in 2020, Brian. I would say that's still a valid range, but I would anchor a little
bit more on the lower end, particularly given the interest rate environments. We thought
we were going to get a little quicker lift with interest rates even after marking the balance
sheet to market. So we still see $110 million-ish [ph] in 2020 as far as an accretion
potential.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great.

As it relates to the reviver statutes and activities I would say, first, we've got a long history
of managing and dealing with, I'll call it, complex claims in this area, particularly bodily
injury, mass tort. And John Kinney, who heads our team and his lawyers in claims
professionals just, I think, do an outstanding job whether it's on a primary basis or excess
basis. Remember, we have a lot of excess claims experience, particularly coming through
our First Interstate operations in Boston. So I would then say on a social side, I understand
the desire to make people -- allow people to talk about their injuries and present claims.
But on the other end, that's a slippery slope to sort of open up years of case law and
litigation and how contracts are resolved, but I know that's occurring.
But I would also say that, for us, we're primarily focusing on three major areas, the liability
associated with injuries particularly in commercial auto, obviously the sexual abuse and
reviver claims and then head injury. I'm not going to go into specifics on any particular
aspect other than we're well aware. We've been on top of these trends for a long, long
time. And as I've always said, Brian, we're in the business of paying claims and we want to
pay claims that are legitimate and where people are injured.

Bloomberg Transcript

But equally in some of these areas, we're going to be sensitive and that's a polite word of
saying, if there was contributory actions or inaction that have consequences on our terms
and conditions, in our policies, we'll be equally vigilant in asserting our rights because the
rest of our policyholders would expect that and that's where the social inflation comes
into effect that everyone's talking about. It affects everyone and we'll be thoughtful, we
want to be fair, but also make sure that people are living up to the terms and conditions in
our contract. So that's what I would -- I'll say at this point in time.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay. It makes sense. But have you reevaluated your reserve positions given what's been
going on?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

As I tried to say, I mean, we've been managing these types of activities for a long, long
time. I would say that we have case reserves and IBNR established for known losses and
obviously incurred, but not reported losses, but we're going to have to really see sort of
the volume of the new activities that really come in. So as we sit here today, I feel really
good about the balance sheet, but not knowing what's going to come out in the future
from new claims, new activities, new theories, you can never -- you can never be absolute.
But just know we do have provisions that we feel comfortable at right now.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Thank you.

Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?

{BIO 1514699 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, we can hear you.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

Hi, thanks. My first question on the disclosure within Commercial Lines, on the standard
commercial earned premium rate. So that was 2.2% in the quarter. It trended down
sequentially and then when we look back last year. I know you guys are getting more
written price right now, but I'm just trying to think about the earned premium that you're
seeing and expectations rate that you are earning through the balance of this year and
also into 2020 as I think about the underlying margin profile for Small Commercial and mid
to large -- your mid to large account segments and just thinking of the rate versus trend
and kind of the underlying margin expansion you might see or contraction there?

A - Doug Elliot

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Elyse, good morning. It's Doug. I would suggest that the earn trend is going to follow
some of this momentum on the written side. So, obviously it's a calculation and as we see
slightly upward signals in those pricing indicators, the earned premium will follow that,
number one. Number two, we gave you a comp/ex comp split right. So you know that
we've got a little bit of negative pressure on pricing, particularly in Small Commercial that
will play out, and the mechanics of that, our loss trend at the moment might be slightly
ahead of where the Small Commercial pricing is. But in middle, we've done a nice job of
achieving flat to just slightly down pricing in comp, and so very pleased with what we're
seeing in middle.
In the non-comp lines, we're feeling better than we were 90 days ago about signals in the
marketplace and our ability to get a little bit of rate. I know that the changes are not up
materially, but they matter to us and several key lines, they're moving in the right
direction. So we're on the rate push hard. We're working hard account by account and I'm
encouraged by what I see as we close out the second quarter.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And my second question, on the Navigators book, so you guys took a
true-up on prior year and then also on the current year. So, on the current year
adjustment, I'm assuming the adjustments were really saturated kind of in the same lines
where you took the prior-year development. And then, can you also just give us a sense
of where the underlying margin you're starting with for that business given that you've
now trued it up versus your expectations when you announced the deal.

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Sure, I'll start with that and, Doug, please feel free to add in. So the lines that we adjusted
for the current year some were consistent again than the US wholesale casualty area and
a little bit in the D&O and E&O book and as Doug mentioned, kind of in the international
Page 12 of 22

FINAL

casualty area. And when we look at the -- our projections back at the time of the
acquisition, we had anticipated needing to increase those accident year picks a bit, I
would say, the final adjustments that we made were probably 1 point or 1.5 point higher
than that, but relatively speaking, sort of in line with what we were thinking.
So, a lot of the things that Doug talked about as it relates to the book and actions that
we're taking and pricing will obviously help improve those margins going forward. And our
views on their underlying margins were included in the overall guidance that we gave for
the second half of 2019. And again, their book, we would expect to run at a higher
combined ratio than our historical Hartford book.

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

The only thing I would add, Beth, is that some of that Navigator combined ratio dynamic is
playing into the fact that our new outlook is just slightly up 1 point or so on the underlying.
So, the mixing in of that Navigators book in accident year and calendar year 2019 is
causing a little bit of that bump.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Q - Josh Shanker

Through the date of acquisition.

FINAL

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yeah, this then implies a increase to the Navigators combined ratio about 500 basis
points in addition to what's going on in the rate market right now. When you think about
modeling or the next year, how much attritional policy and premium decline do you expect
as you put through the necessary rates to get to a Hartford level of conservatism in the
book?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Josh, this is Doug. I would say it's a little premature for us to take you all the way down
through that path. We are building those plans. We had original plans obviously. We've
been updating over the course of last two quarters, but there are so many moving pieces.
And as you know, as Chris commented on, several of their core lines are going through an
aggressive degree of firming at the moment. So, we are making decisions and plans
around what we see in the current marketplace around retentions -- required retentions,
pricing, and also new business levels that we think are appropriate for not only the
combined ratio as it sits here today, but also what we think the opportunity is in that book
moving ahead. So, we'll provide more of that as we go forward the next several quarters.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, and I guess, this is another easy one. Was there any prior-year reserve
development on the Navigators loss reserves not applicable to the Nikko cover and how
should we consider the risks associated with that non-Nikko covered part of the portfolio.

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Good question. So, as it relates to the actions that we took in the second quarter for prior
years, all of it was applicable to the cover. I'll remind you that there was probably about
$100 million of reserves that we excluded from the cover, which was primarily covering
things like unallocated loss adjustment expenses. We are obviously taking the exposure
on reinsurance collectability, and then a handful of specific claims that were not covered.
So, as it related to the actions we took, we saw no need to make any increases to those
reserves that were not covered by the reinsurance agreement.

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Josh, it's Chris. One, welcome. Thanks for joining the call after your Rolling Stones concert
last night. Second, I would just add a little color, again, the allocated -- unallocated loss
adjustment expense in the reinsurance, it's similar to other transactions we've done with
Nikko and the handful of claims that Beth described, I would say, relate to pollution
exposures that we judged favorably. So, I don't think there's going to be any big surprises
that are going to materially change any view on reserve positions and/or the reinsurance
transaction in total.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. I appreciate the answers. I'll re-queue, maybe I'll get lucky. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse.

FINAL

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First question, thanks for the color on
the expense ratio increase. Curious about, I believe you said, some of it's due to upwards
pressure on brokerage commissions and I think you also mentioned that in -- on last
quarter's call. Maybe you can help us understand as like what -- how big of a component
that is and is that -- and what's kind of driving that? Is that being driven by some of the
private equity backed brokers or is it all of them kind of doing the same thing?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Mike, this is Doug. It's more run rate commission. And so, when I think about quarter-toquarter, a 1 point -- 1 point, 2 points [ph] of change in the expense area, but half of that is
coming from commission. Much of that is coming from small commercial where we either
have special deals happening. We've got terrific profitability indicators. So, our
contingencies around loss are up a little bit year-to-year and I would just characterize what
we see in small as normal, competitive, commission adjustments.

Bloomberg Transcript

What we see in the middle, more related to reinsurance. I don't even think of that in the
case of normal brokerage. It's just we have some ceded commissions and reinsurance, a
little bit different than they were last year. So, that's why I describe the commission piece
as really normal operating circumstances.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay , that's helpful. And lastly, switching to Group Benefits, clearly excellent results
continue. Doesn't look like you guys changed your guidance there. Maybe you can kind of
update us on the competitive environment in Group?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Mike, let me just speak to guidance and Doug can give you some of his color on the
competitive environment. The 6% to 7% guidance on margin, we still believe is a longterm guidance that is reflective of long-term conditions. Obviously, in the near term here,
we've been outperforming which we would honestly expect to continue at least through
the second half of '19. So, we're not changing -- not updating, but we are -- acknowledged
that we are performing better primarily from incidences, but I would remind you that it is
still a competitive environment, Doug, and the Top 10 Group Benefit players control large
portion of the market, but competition is still fierce as ever and we're remaining
disciplined. I don't know if you would add any color, Doug?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

No, I would agree with that. I think we are competing well in the space. The numbers are
pretty good shape. Across the industry, our numbers are obviously outstanding. Second
quarter is not as large a quarter as the first quarter, but our sales were up a bit in the first

quarter. We feel good about that. We continue to grow our specialty products, our
voluntary products. So you see that in our supplement. Just very encouraged, and Chris,
our disability trends are in good shape. So a strong quarter for our Group business.

And our next question comes from the line of Paul with Sandler O'Neill.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

Good morning. Just one question. You didn't mention any changes to reinsurance related
to the Navigators acquisition. I was wondering if that might change significantly over time
given Navigators was a pretty heavy user of reinsurance over time.

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Paul, in the short term, I would suggest that reinsurance programs are largely going to
stay in place. Our teams are working diligently on a combined basis, evaluating what
programs need to come together over time, what programs will be less standalone et
cetera. So, as I think about the rest of 2019 and the early part of '20, largely think of their
programs intact and then we'll adjust over time and share some of that information as it
comes.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

As you've now re-examined the book, are there any pieces of Navigators that you want to
shrink or re-address significantly?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Paul, again, we just closed -- what? 75 days ago? Really excited and we've been focused
on obviously our go-to-market activities in the US and in London taking the corrective
actions that Doug has talked about. We like all the pieces that we see, but we're just -are going to continue to learn. It's why we're keeping the reinsurance programs the same
and to learn from the Navigators team and adjust accordingly. And I would say the same
thing with any major pieces of the business. All fits together, it works. We like it, but we've
only owned it for 75 days.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. My first question, I guess it is a multi-part
question with regards to the large property losses that you're seeing in Commercial. So
one, are those related to the large losses you saw in the first quarter or part of the same
trend. Two, could you maybe elaborate a little bit on the actions you're taking? And three,
when do you expect these actions actually result in lower margins?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Thank you, Yaron, this is Doug. So a few comments about our marine book. We did see
some adverse experience in the first quarter which I did comment on first quarter call, a
bit more in the second quarter. Again, second quarter leaned a little bit heavier into
builders' risk. It's a policy we offer associated with construction sites where essentially we
replace the damaged property on the site. I think there's quite a bit of volatility in the
second quarter. We have pulled the covers back across all those losses. I mentioned
water intrusion in my commentary. So in a number of pipes, couplings, connections
damaged material values in some of our construction sites. So we're on it.
We changed the leadership in the underwriting profile of that business about 15 months
ago. That process is well underway. These projects run several years. We know exactly
where our inventory is today. Yeah, I don't think this is over at the end of June, but I do
think this is well-managed, well-contained. Both claim engineering and also our
underwriting teams are working together. And there's a little volatility in a pretty small line
first and middle, we'll have a little volatility, but it isn't something that right now is keeping
me up. I think the line is not just putting pressure here at The Hartford. I think there are
others in the business that are feeling that pressure, but as I think about the rest of 2019
and 2020. we'll get this issue behind us. I don't think it's a huge deal and we'll share a little
bit about that journey as we go forward.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, and that's helpful. And then my second question relates to the personal
auto book. I think, you were saying that you're seeing severity in the low-to-mid single
digits, which just seems a little lower than what we've been hearing or seeing among
other carriers. Can you maybe talk about what would drive severity to be a bit lower. Is the
Hartford book -- is it a different mix of cars? Is it different policy type? Different negotiated
arrangements with auto shops? What's driving that?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

It gets really hard for me to compare ourselves to others. There are many different
nuances, the various books. And when I talked about severity, I'm combining all elements
of severity right, our collision is up a little bit, our liability severity is in pretty good shape.
And obviously, our frequency numbers are in a very strong shape for the first six months
of the year. So, I don't know how to contrast our book with others. It is heavily AARPdominated, that plus 50 crowd, that matters relative to drive -- miles driven, parts of the
year etc, but I don't think there is something that sticks out to me right now that is saying
our severity is causing something that others might not be seeing.

I don't think there is any one reason that suggests our book will perform differently than
others. We manage aggressively all of the comp liability and physical damage collision
matters for our customers. And I think we do a very adequate job. We work with terrific
partners on the outside and have a dedicated competent team inside. So I think we are
thoughtful about our claim process and I don't have a reason to suggest our numbers -or understand why they're different than others.

Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with B.Riley FBR.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

Hey, good morning, thanks. I actually had, I think, a couple related to commercial auto. The
first is a question on the inland marine losses that are disclosed has been elevated. Could
you describe what those are? I'm just curious if they are related to wheels-based [ph] loss
or something else?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Yeah, the builders' risk essentially would be equipment, materials on the job site. So I
don't think auto there. I think water intrusion causing damage to all kinds of equipment in
(inaudible) on the walls, et cetera. There were earlier in the year a couple of marine losses
in transit, when you think in transit marine, that would have involved the (inaudible) there
was a little commercial auto pressure there, but primarily second quarter I'm talking about
intrusion of water in a four-wall structure.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

Okay, got you. And then just on the commercial auto overall. It has not been a topic that's
come up on this call, but it is still a major issue for the group and so I'm curious kind of
where you think pricing versus loss cost is there and kind of where The Hartford sits in the
process of the industry getting on top of those liabilities?

FINAL

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Yeah. I guess I'd start by suggesting make up of our book is largely Small Commercial with
the middle market fleet book as well and now Navigators brings, especially auto
component to us. In terms of our core book, we've been managing aggressively auto for
six, seven years now. Our exposures are down materially over the last five years, plus
30% tip change in auto, still not satisfied with our rate adequacy today. Our combined
ratios are still not acceptable across both small and middle. And so there's still more work
to be done.
Given where we see pricing today, yeah, I think that pricing from our view, in our middle
and small books is on top of loss trend, which means we are now delivering better
margins, but we're very careful -- with a very careful eye watching 2016, 2017 , 2018 some
of those years that are closing up and this line has our full attention and we'll over the
next several quarters for sure.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

Is it a growth opportunity the if you have your pricing right relative to loss trend? Are you
seeing a lot more opportunity to write business?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Well, there's a lot of business in the marketplace. It is on the top of our growth priority.
We're certainly not a major monoline provider and I'm talking about historical Hartford at
the moment. We certainly look at it when we're rounding out accounts and we want to
protect our account. So, no, it's not on the top of our queue list to be chasing monoline
auto. With our specialty auto division now with Navigators, I think, a good opportunity.
They've got terrific instincts. They've got great data and they'll be thoughtful about their
opportunities, but I would ask you to think about the different pieces of our book and all
told, we're not an enormous auto player relative to the industry in general.

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

I think that's the big distinction, Doug, right. We're not big fleet players. I mean, we tend
to ensure trucks vehicles on the small to medium-sized business. We're not national
programs, it's not -- just given the environment, Randy, it's not a growth area as Doug
said.

Hey, thanks, good morning. This would have already been pretty clearly confirmed but
just, I guess, from my own head. So the new 92 to 94 guide wouldn't be any different if it
weren't just the addition of Navigators mix and do you feel just as good about Navigators
as you did at the time of the deal, is that right?

FINAL

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

That's right. With the exception, we have built in a little bit of this pressure on builders' risk
both what we experienced first half has set our view. So we've tweaked our loss ratios in
the marine area, second half of the year, largely all the other lines remain on track.

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Yeah, and I'll just add to that, Ryan, just to be clear. So absent Navigators, we probably
would be 1 point down relative to what our original thought was for second half of the
year.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Understood.

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So obviously, Navigators coming in at a higher loss ratio -- combined ratio, it's kind of is in
the mix. But we put it all together, we feel very good about being able to be in that range.

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Ryan, I would remind you the compare on that, you have to almost go back to 2018 and
think about what happened in Qs 3 and 4, we were doing some adjusting to the workers'
comp line still in Q3 of last year. I think that's something that just have to factor in here.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Got you. And I think I wanted to go back to Elyse's question. I think, Beth did a good job
talking about the accident year actions and how those compared to the original
expectations at the time of the deal, but I'm still having a little bit of hard time with -- I
think, there was like a $150 million of gross charges that Hartford took and there have also
been some charges that Navigators had taken in the quarter since the deal -- the
acquisition was announced. So, yeah, I mean, on the reserving side, would you say that all
the activity that we've seen has also been around the level that you would have expected
the time you announced the deal or could you just highlight some areas where things
ended up being a little bit more elevated?

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Yeah. So if you go all the way back to the time we announced the deal, I would say that
the -- our views relative to reserve increases have increased from there. We obviously
took that into consideration when we started to look at purchasing an adverse
development cover. I would say that the actions that we took are relatively consistent with

Page 20 of 22



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2019-08-02

what we would have thought at the time that we entered into the ADC. So we sort of
incorporated those views when we looked to purchase protection.
And as I said in my remarks, I feel very good about the fact that the remaining $209
million under that cover and I would say the areas that we're seeing -- the increases are
relatively consistent, just again some of the size of those increases has changed and we
incorporated all of that as we thought about our 2019 accident picks, both what we felt
needed to be adjusted from what Navigators had recorded pre-acquisition, as well as
incorporating those views into our updated guidance for the second half of this year.

Yes, ma'am. Your final question will come from the line of Mike Phillips with Morgan
Stanley.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mike Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Hey, great. Thanks for having me [ph]. Appreciate it. I guess, Doug made some
comments on the reserve issues in some of the smaller lines professional liability and the
turn in general liability. I guess, I was looking to see maybe a little more detail and kind of
what exactly you're seeing there, how confident you are that you got things fixed, and
maybe some pressures going forward in those specific lines for professional liability?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Mike, I would say that if you go back and think about some of the pressure spots in
Navigators towards the end of last year and early this year, obviously, there has been
some pressure in the international book. Some of that marine book internationally and
also the D&O book and they were addressing some of their own and essentially as we
looked at the tail factors when we looked at those cases we just decided that we needed
to make some adjustments.
So that's how we think about several of those lines in the US. Our view of tail and tort
came together with their actuaries and we spent a lot of time debating and looking at
things. So, I don't look at what we did over the last quarter. These changes as anything
very, very different than our discussions last summer, but they were updated based on
facts and debates as we came together and closed the second quarter.

Q - Mike Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Okay, thanks. I guess one more on Personal Lines, and if I could turn back to that. You
commented that the premium drop in Personal Lines was cut and part of it was due to
Page 21 of 22

non-renewal business, and I guess maybe when you expect kind of an inflection on that
piece of the Personal Lines?

FINAL

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Well, our goal is to be turning into growth as we close out 2019 and move into 2020.
We're encouraged, because as you can see, our new business numbers look much more
positive than they were at this point last year. Again, we're working on retention, the rate
change. The book is at a pretty solid profit perspective. So I think the rate change
probably won't move a lot over the next six to nine months, but we think the new
business will grow and if we get a little lift in retentions, we'll see those positive numbers
move, approaching end of year 2019.
