{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Yes, thank you, Anita, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our conference call
to discuss NN Group's results for the fourth quarter of 2019. I am joined today by Delﬁn
Rueda.
So let's get started with the highlights as shown on Slide 3. NN Group has reported a
strong performance for the fourth quarter of 2019 with almost all segments posting a
higher operating result compared with the same quarter in 2018. Let me call out a few
highlights. We are making progress in improving the proﬁtability of our Non-life business
and this is reﬂected in the combined ratio of 93.6% in the fourth quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

The results of Japan Life were materially this quarter, reﬂecting better mortality and
surrender results, despite lower sales following the tax revision in that country. And NN
Bank, if you exclude the one-oﬀ beneﬁts, reported a $6 million higher result and
originated a record volume of mortgages in 2019. We have also made further eﬃciency
gains across the organization bringing the total cost reduction of the units in scope of the
integration to EUR360 million compared with the full year 2016 expense base. Delﬁn will
discuss the ﬁnancial results of each segment and the cost savings in more detail later in
this presentation.
Our balance sheet remains strong, with a Solvency II ratio of 218% and cash capital at the
holding company of almost EUR2 billion. This solid position allows us to propose a 2019
ﬁnal dividend of EUR1.40 per ordinary share, which will be tabled at our AGM in May, and
brings the full year 2019 dividend per ordinary share to EUR2.16, up 14% from 2018.
We are also announcing today a new share buyback of EUR250 million, which is
anticipated to commence on the 2nd of March. We welcome the comments of EIOPA and
D&B that the current capital requirements for insurers are adequate. We continue to
believe that our robust capital position allows for strong shareholder returns.
There were many developments within NN during 2019, including the further integration
of the Delta Lloyd businesses as well as various regulatory changes in Europe and Japan.
Despite this, we never lost sight of our customers and our objective of helping them to
secure their ﬁnancial futures, which is reﬂected in a further increase in customer
satisfaction during the year. Our employees are at the heart of servicing our customers,
and therefore, I am pleased to see that our employee engagement also increased in 2019.
I will talk about the commercial performance on the following Slide. Value of new
business in Europe was up 21% in 2019 compared with the previous year. Reﬂecting an
improved business mix focusing more on protection products as well as higher sales.
Total value of new business for the year, however, was down due to a sharp drop in sales

FINAL

in Japan in the second half of the year, following the revised tax rules for COLI products.
We expect this to continue into near-term as SME customers await more clarity on how
the market and products will develop.
On the other hand, we saw higher sales in the Netherlands in 2019 on the back of a larger
volume of renewals of group pension contracts. As already mentioned, NN Bank
originated a record volume of mortgages in 2019. There are attractive assets -- these are
attractive assets in terms of yields and their low risk proﬁle. Of the total origination of
almost EUR8 billion, more than EUR5 billion was transferred to the Group's insurance
companies for their investment portfolios as well as to NNIP's third-party mortgage fund.
I will now move on to Slide 5. The presentation of our fourth quarter results is also an
opportunity to look at our performance over the longer-term. We set our current Group
ﬁnancial targets in 2017 and made good progress in all three metrics. We are well on our
way to achieving the planned EUR400 million of cost savings, having already reduced the
2016 expense base by EUR360 million. Our operating result before tax has grown by an
average of 6% per annum since 2017. And we generated EUR1.2 billion of free cash ﬂow
available for shareholders in 2019.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's now turn to the next Slide, where we talk about our updated dividend policy. NN
Group has a track record of distributing excess capital to shareholders, having paid a total
of EUR4.8 billion of ordinary dividends and share buybacks since IPO, including the ﬁnal
dividend and share buyback announced today.
Our approach to this has not changed. However, we now want to give clear guidance on
what shareholders can expect in terms of capital returns on an annual basis. Going
forward, we will pay a progressive ordinary dividend per share, which means that we aim
to grow the dividend per share over time. We also intend to execute a recurring annual
share buyback of at least EUR250 million. Additional excess capital will be returned to
shareholders unless it can be used for value creating opportunities.
Today, we have announced a proposed ﬁnal dividend of EUR448 million. This is the
equivalent of a dividend per share of EUR1.40, bringing the total 2019 dividend per share
to EUR2.16, which is a 14% increase on the 2018 dividend per share. The full year dividend
comes to EUR698 million and represents a payout ratio of 50% of our 2019 net operating
results. Looking back, we have increased the dividend per share by an average of 9% per
annum since 2015.
We have also announced a share buyback of EUR250 million, which is anticipated to
commence on the 2nd of March, and will be completed within 12 months. This decision
takes into account the fact that in 2020, we will pay EUR566 million for the acquisition of
Vivat Non-life, and we will also repay EUR300 million of maturing senior debt, which we
intend not to reﬁnance.
And with that, I will pass you over to Delﬁn.

FINAL

Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with NN Group's operating
result in the left hand chart, which amounted to EUR428 million in the fourth quarter of
2019, up from EUR343 million a year earlier. Almost all segments contributed to this
increase. And I will talk you through each segment on the following slides.
The fourth quarter net result shown in the right-hand chart, was EUR329 million. This
compares with a loss of EUR533 million in the same quarter of 2018, which included a
goodwill impairment of EUR852 million. If we look at the full year 2019 performance, the
operating result increased 10% compared with 2018 to almost EUR1.8 billion. This result
included EUR121 million of non-recurring beneﬁts versus EUR38 million in 2018. Excluding
these items, the higher operating result was mainly driven by better underwriting results
at our Non-life business and higher results in Japan. And ﬁnally, on this slide, the increase
in the full year net result mainly reﬂects the goodwill impairment taken in 2018.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving on to the next Slide, I will take you through the operating performance of the
individual segments. Starting on the left, the operating result of Netherlands Life in the
fourth quarter remained broadly stable at EUR193 million, reﬂecting lower expenses partly
oﬀset by a lower investment margin. The full year operating result was down on 2018,
largely due to lower fees and premium based revenues as well as lower private equity
and special dividends, partly oﬀset by lower expenses.
As David already mentioned, the Non-life business posted another good result this
quarter with our combined ratio of 93.6% and compared with 96.4% in the same quarter
of 2018. The increase was driven by higher results in the Property & Casualty portfolio,
which increased from EUR17 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 to EUR38 million on the
back of favorable claims development and lower administrative expenses.
The results of the Disability & Accident portfolio were broadly stable at EUR19 million, as
lower expenses were largely oﬀset by unfavorable claims development in the individual
disability portfolio, which was partly covered by reinsurance with NN Re.
The full year 2019 combined ratio for Netherlands Non-life was 95.4% versus 99.4% for
2018. The third chart shows the operating result of Insurance Europe. The fourth quarter
2019 result was impacted by various factors, including higher administrative expenses as
well as lower pension fees in Romania, following the pension reforms in that country. This
was partly oﬀset by favorable, mortality and morbidity results in Belgium. On the other
hand, the full-year result was up on 2018, mainly driven by higher performance fees and
protection growth.
Finally on this Slide, the increase in the operating result of Japan life reﬂects a higher
technical margin driven by favorable mortality and morbidity results as well as higher
surrender results reﬂecting the increased persistency of the portfolio, following the
revised tax regulations for certain COLI products. This in turn, resulted in lower DAC
amortization and trade commissions. The full year operating result was up 23% on 2018, if
you exclude currency eﬀect.

FINAL

The other segments are shown on Slide 10. The operating result of asset management
increased to EUR41 million, compared with EUR30 million in the fourth quarter last year,
driven by a decrease of administrative expenses as well as higher fees. Total assets under
management decreased to EUR276 billion, compared with EUR287 billion at the end of
the third quarter, reﬂecting negative market performance as well as net outﬂow of assets.
The increase in the full year operating result was mainly driven by lower expenses, partly
oﬀset by lower fees.
The segment Banking reported an operating result of EUR54 million for the fourth quarter
of 2019, driven by higher fees and other income. Including a EUR20 million non-recurring
beneﬁt relating to the valuation premium on mortgage sales as a result of lower mortgage
rates. The interest result also increased, mainly reﬂecting penalty interest on a higher
volume of mortgage redemptions as well as lower funding cost. The full-year operating
result was higher than in 2018, mainly reﬂecting the non-recurrent income that I
mentioned before.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, the segment Other, reported a loss of EUR44 million in the fourth quarter versus a
loss of EUR48 million in the same quarter of 2018. This includes an improved holding
result, reﬂecting higher investment income and fees, partly oﬀset by a lower result in the
reinsurance business, while the comparative quarter included a EUR10 million nonrecurring charge in the holding expenses. The improvement of the full year operating
result in 2019 versus 2018 was inﬂuenced by non-recurring items.
Let's move on the cost savings on the Slide 11. As you are aware, we aim to reduce the
expense base for the business units in the scope of the integration by EUR400 million by
the end of 2020. We are making good progress towards reaching this target, with
additional cost savings of EUR36 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, bringing total cost
reductions to EUR360 million compared with the 2016 full year expense base. However,
as we have guided in past quarters, expense reductions will not be linear, and some units
will see expense increases to support their growth plans and make necessary investments.
I will now move on to the free cash ﬂow on the Slide 12. The cash capital position at the
holding company was almost EUR2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. Free
cash ﬂow during the fourth quarter was EUR233 million, driven by EUR347 million of
remittances from subsidiaries. This was oﬀset by capital ﬂows to shareholders of EUR186
million, representing shares repurchased in the fourth quarter under the share buyback
programs.
The total free cash ﬂow for 2019 was just under EUR1.2 billion, reﬂecting total remittances
received from subsidiaries of almost EUR1.5 billion. This was partly oﬀset by EUR200
million of interest, holding company and other expenses which includes a one-oﬀ tax
beneﬁt. Details of all the remittances upstream by segment this quarter can be found as
usual in the appendix of this presentation.
Looking ahead, there are several large cash outﬂows that we expect in the ﬁrst half of
2020. Firstly, we will pay an amount of EUR560 million for the acquisition of Vivat Non-life,

FINAL

which we expect to close in the ﬁrst quarter of this year. And secondly, we intend not to
reﬁnance, the EUR300 million of senior notes when they mature in June.
On the Slide 13 and 14, the last slide in my section. I will take you through the
developments in NN Group Solvency position. NN Group solvency ratio was 218% at the
end of the fourth quarter, up from 217% at the end of the previous quarter. This ratio
reﬂects the deduction of the proposed 2019 ﬁnal dividend of EUR448 million that we
announced today, and which will be paid in June. Before deducting this dividend, the
solvency ratio was 224% at year-end 2019. The operating capital generation for the fourth
quarter added 4 percentage points to the ratio. Market variance increased the ratio by 3
percentage points; mainly as a result of credit spread movements and changes in interest
rates.
Let's turn to the next Slide for the full year movement. The Solvency II ratio was 230% at
the start of 2019, an increase at the end of the year to 233% before the EUR1.2 billion of
capital ﬂows to shareholders. This increase was despite volatile ﬁnancial markets,
including a substantial decrease of interest rates, movement in credit spreads and a
reduction of the vola from 24 to 7 basis points.

Bloomberg Transcript

The total operating capital generation in 2019 was EUR1.3 billion, which added 20
percentage points to the ratio. Market variance had an adverse impact on the ratio of 14
percentage points, mainly reﬂecting the impact from movements in credit spreads and
lower interest rates, partly oﬀset by positive equity and real estate revaluations. Capital
ﬂows of EUR1.2 billion represents the 2019 interim and ﬁnal dividends as well as the
EUR500 million share buyback program announced in February last year.
And now I will pass you back to David, for the wrap up.

David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Thank you, Delﬁn. Looking back at 2019, NN Group has delivered a solid ﬁnancial
performance both in the fourth quarter as well as for the full year. Most of the business
units reported better results. In particular, we saw an encouraging improvement in the
Non-life proﬁtability, resilient results in Europe and Japan, despite the regulatory changes
in those regions and continued growth at the bank.
We also improved eﬃciency throughout the organization with a total cost savings of
EUR360 million achieved to date compared with the 2016 expense base. We have today
announced an update to our dividend policy, consisting of progressive ordinary dividend
per share, as well as a recurring share buyback of at least EUR250 million each year.
For 2019, we are proposing a ﬁnal dividend of EUR448 million or EUR1.40 per share,
bringing the total 2019 dividend to EUR2.16 per share. This is an increase of almost 14%
compared with the 2018 dividend per share. We are also initiating a new share buyback
program of EUR250 million, which is anticipated to commence on the 2nd of March and
will be completed within 12 months.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)
Thank you, Mr.Knibbe. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now start a question-and-answer
session. (Operator Instructions). The ﬁrst question is from Mr.Cor Kluis, ABN AMRO. Go
ahead please, sir.

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, good morning. Cor Kluis, ABN AMRO. I've gotten a couple of questions. First of all
about the EIOPA review Dutch Central Bank sent out a note last week, which seems quite
favorable. Could you elaborate a little bit on what you expect that the EIOPA review would
bring? And there're some talks about -- in the market about the release of the risk margin,
maybe as a compensating factor. So yes, could you elaborate on your view on that item?
My second question is about Japan. Japan result was -- I think was around EUR225 million
higher than expected. Part of that was due to the lower lapses, basically, which seems to
be quite recurring. Could you also elaborate a little bit on a higher level, of -- which part
of the EUR25 million beat was due to the higher -- or the lower lapses. And could it be net
times four for the future eﬀect on the P&L, the Japanese IFRS proﬁts. And then other
question is about the storm that we had the last couple of days on the weekend. Initial
ﬁgures in the Netherlands about total cost of the storm based on that, I would say around
EUR40 million, EUR50 million cost, maybe for the storm? And could you elaborate on
that? Do you have some reinsurance? From which level does reinsurance start to beneﬁt
for? And that's my questions.

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Cor. Let me give the question on the EIOPA review in Japan to Delﬁn,
and then I will talk about the storm.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Good morning, and thank you, Cor for your questions. On -- well, on Solvency II, I mean,
we could be talking for long. I think that this process has just started and it's very diﬃcult
to predict what changes will be ﬁnally being discussed and ultimately approved by the
European parliament. Also we need to take into account that any amendments approved
by the European parliament to the Solvency II directive will only start being eﬀective the

FINAL

starting on 2023. So therefore, there is plenty of time to analyze and react to any potential
change and impact.
Nevertheless, I think you're right. We take comfort and welcome the comments made by
diﬀerent important regulators that the current capital requirements for insurers is overall
adequate and that they favor a balanced approach with a more or less neutral outcome.
And I think on that sense, the remarks coming from EIOPA is that they clearly are open to
look, again, at the risk margin despite EIOPA initially not proposing any change. It is very
reassuring, especially due to the large amount of the risk margin. That as you know, with
low interest rates, the risk margin that we have has increased from signiﬁcantly this year.
So any review on the risk margin is -- will be welcome.
For Japan, indeed, there is quite a few aspects interacting here. The sale of -- the sales has
come down very signiﬁcantly. So overall, for the full year period, has been a very good
year. And as we indicated, the negatives from the lower sales are being oﬀset by better
persistency. But equally, the year has beneﬁted and also in the quarter from favorable
mortality and morbidity results and that last part, can be volatile. And you can see that in
the press release, the contribution from the technical margin.
Looking forward, it is diﬃcult to give guidance as, it is very uncertain of how the COLI
market might evolve, but I think it is more than fair not to take the 2019 proﬁts as a
guidance. And probably it is better to work around, as you know, the 2018 results. But as I
said, very uncertain of how this might evolve going forward.

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Delﬁn. Then on the storm, well, ﬁrst of all, it's too early. I mean, the storm
was primarily happening Sunday, Monday and a bit on Tuesday. So the current focus is
really on servicing our customers in the best way we can.
The industry did come out with an estimate of around EUR150 million for the full industry.
But I think we also need to be careful with that number. Not everybody immediately
claims. Sometimes it takes a bit longer for people actually to report it in. But that would
be a ﬁrst estimate. It is fair to say that the impressions are that this storm will nowhere be
near to the big storm that we saw in January of 2018.
On reinsurance, yes, we do have a cat reinsurance. Currently, we don't expect that will -we will hit that level.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thank you very, very much. I just wanted to talk about the annual buyback. So
you previously had some kind of limits on cash. And you could have looked at your
composition every year. Is there any situation, I mean, any likely situation, for example,
holding company cash or M&A that might stop you from doing a buyback, that's question
one. And sort of also relates to that, so you relax the idea of a payout ratio, would you be
happy for that payout ratio to go up just to deliver a progressive dividend, to go up
beyond 50%.
Second question is, given the uncertainty in what will happen with capital position. I
mean, you've talked about levers that you do have, in any case, to support your position
in the Netherlands especially. Could you talk about what you're actively looking at right
now, for example, in terms of longevity reinsurance or hedging. Those are my questions.
Thank you very much.

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Yes. Let me pass it on to Delﬁn. Thank you, Farooq.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Thank you, Farooq. How to think about the share buyback going forward, I think just you
look at it as a continuation of our existing policy of paying excess capital to shareholders
over time. I think right now, we've seen already since the introduction of Solvency II in
January 2016. I mean, we are comfortable of what we have seen in terms of operating
capital generation and the risk. And with today's announcement, we wanted to give more
comfort into the, basically, a continuation of the share buyback and setting a minimal
level.
I think that you need to look at this as the intention under normal circumstances of
continue with the share buyback with this minimum, of course. Any signiﬁcant aspect in
terms of aﬀecting our Solvency are very signiﬁcant opportunity that is value creation in
terms of M&A will have to be taken into consideration at the right time in order to decide
of the share buyback.
In terms of the ordinary dividend, what we have done is continue with the growth, the
policy to grow our ordinary dividend over time. And we have eliminated if you like the
constraint related on linking it to the IFRS proﬁt. So from that sense, we have de-linked the
two. But otherwise, the progressive dividend policies are growing the intention to grow
the ordinary dividend over time.
In terms of levers to support capital, I think -- I mean, ﬁrst, I mean, the more basic aspect is
that we continue working on improving our excess return on our investment portfolio
through the re-risking improving the contribution operating capital generation from the
Non-life business, growing proﬁtably in the diﬀerent areas. And expanding the growth of
the bank. But I think, you're referring to additional actions around the normal. We've been
looking at the possibility of doing longevity reinsurance and that's a very clear possibility
when we ﬁnd the right terms, conditions and the right opportunity. And also, of course,
Page 9 of 24



Company Name: NN Group NV

Date: 2020-02-13

depending on the ﬁnal outcome of for the Solvency II, there is the possibility in order to
look at our hedging and accommodate it accordingly.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

FINAL

Can I just ask on the ﬁnal point about levers, are you actively looking for longevity deal at
the moment?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, we have been looking at it already for a while. And as we have said in the past, we
will act upon, when we think that the right terms and conditions are applicable. We have a
very strong level of Solvency, and we have not rushed into it because of pressure on our
solvency capital or our dividend policy as a consequence. But yes, we've been looking
into that for a while.

Thank you very much.

The next question is from Mr.Ashik Musaddi, JP Morgan. Go ahead please, sir.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning, Delﬁn, good morning, David. Just a couple of questions.
So sorry to put this question again on dividends. So when you say progressive dividend, I
mean, if I look at your earnings guidance for medium-term, it's 5% to 7%. So is that a
reasonable way to think about progressive dividend, like 5% to 7%. Or -- I know that
earnings can be volatile, but like given progressive, just wanted to understand like are we
talking about 3%, 5%, 7%? Any number or some color on that would be helpful.
Secondly, if I remember correctly -- I mean, you have always talked about buyback in past
like when you don't do a deal, you will return the money to investors. But suddenly this
morning, there is a bit of change in tone because you are now reassuring on the minimum
EUR250 million buyback. Now what has changed in last two, three, six months that your -this change in tone has come through? And does it mean that buyback will only be
EUR250 million because, clearly, your -- if I look at your Solvency II capital generation, you
are generating about $1.3 billion, $1.5 billion. If I look at your free cash ﬂow, which is the
money that goes to holdco net of dividend, net of debt cost an all, it's about 1.1 billion,
$1.2 billion. But what you are paying at the moment, which is dividend plus buyback is still
$950 million. So there is still more room to do more buybacks in future if there is no deal.
So is that understanding correct? Or would you say that I'm missing something on this? So
that would be the second question.
And the third one is going back to P&C combined ratio. Now that has improved quite a
lot. I mean, 93.6%. I don't remember when I have seen that number with NN. So how
much of that would you say is luck? And how much of that would you say is like structural

FINAL

changes? Should we start getting comfortable at around 95% combined ratio for the
year? Or would you say, it's too early to bake that in and 97%, 98% is still the right
number. I mean, the reason why it is important now is because, you are getting VIVAT as
well, which will make your P&C contribution much bigger. So what sort of combined ratio
should we start thinking about? Thank you.

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Thank you, Ashik. Delﬁn will take the ﬁrst question and I will come back on the other two.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Ashik, thank you. Progressive dividend, what guidance to give? I think, one always have to
be careful on providing a very explicit guidance. I think that really nothing has changed in
terms of the guidance that you have -- the guidance for the behavior we have done so far.
I think, when you look at since the IPO, basically, we have a growth -- we have grown our
ordinary dividend per share by 9%, as you know, per annum. So the last two years, 2018
and 2019 has been more elevated than that and one has to see that, that over time
guidance the possibility to grow the ordinary dividend over time is there.
One thing that is important to realize, and I have made reference in the past is that there is
certain elements particularly how the investment margin and the contribution of the
excess return operate diﬀerently from IFRS and operating capital generation also play a
role here. So that means that while in the previous years, we have seen more stable
investment margin, we have been -- a gradual contribution in the excess returns come in
there. So overall, I think we see the opportunity to grow the ordinary dividend going
forward.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Sorry, one just follow-up on this. I mean, one thing that also comes into the equation now
is because you have this recurring buyback. I mean, 2% share count reduction means that
your buyback has to grow up by 2% just if you assume the ﬂat dividend cost. And on top
of that some growth. Is that the right way to think about it?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

There are -- Ashik thanks for the question. There are many ways to look at it. I tend to look
at in the simplest way possible. Ordinary dividend, you mentioned it yourself, is only part,
a portion of our whatever way you look at it, operating capital generation or free cash
ﬂow. And therefore in itself, there is room in order to maintain that growth of the ordinary
dividend. We have always favored a stable growth of the ordinary dividend and basically
used the share buybacks with a bit more ability or ﬂexibility in order to provide the
additional return to shareholders based on the circumstances, including the possibility of
doing acquisitions or in order to absorb the necessary shocks. So from that point of view, I
don't see the ordinary dividend growth limited particularly by any factor.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. That's very clear. Thank you.

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Yes, then on the share buyback and the question around what has changed. Let me start
what has not changed. So we have a strong track record of returning cash to
shareholders. And this approach has not changed. However, we want to give a clear
guidance on what shareholders can expect in terms of capital returns on an annual basis.
So -- and maybe to take you bit through the thinking process. So obviously, in Q4, we
need to announce our proposed ﬁnal dividends. We have strong results and a strong
balance sheet. So therefore, we announced a 14% increase in our a regular dividend.
Then also of course, this quarter the current share buyback of EUR500 million is ending
and we felt it was important to give an update on that, which we have done by
announcing the EUR250 million and we do this in the context of already a full year with
the Vivat acquisition and the EUR300 million of senior debt that we intend not to
reﬁnance.
I think the third piece and that is new is that we've been on the road a lot. We spoke to a
lot of shareholders. And I think the feedback was very clear. In general, people very much
like the capital return. And at that point, we've given EUR 4.1 billion. By now if we include
all of this, EUR4.8 billion back to shareholders. That is generally well appreciated. But
people were looking for more guidance on how do we look at capital allocation on a -- on
an annual basis. And therefore, we decided to give more guidance on this and this is
indeed along the lines of the progressive dividend per share, which Delﬁn already talked
about, a recurring annual minimum share buyback of at least EUR250 million. And then
also that any additional excess capital. And I think that was what you were potentially also
referring to, so any additional excess capital to be returned to shareholders, unless it can
be used for value creating opportunities.
So based on that, we'll have to judge next year what the amount of share back buy will be.
But of course, we have announced that our intention is that the minimum is EUR250
million.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. That's clear. Thank you.

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

And then on the combined ratio for P&C. Indeed we're pleased to see the progress on
P&C. I think, this is a long path we're on by repricing improving our underwriting,
reducing our cost. The cost of the company in total has already been reduced with around
EUR100 million. So we've been seeing a downward trend in combined ratio.
It is good to keep in mind that this was a very favorable quarter as well. I mean, we had
very benign weather in Q4. And also in terms of large ﬁres, it was a favorable segment.
And good to note also that indeed we expect to on board the Vivat non-life business,
which has a bit of a higher run rate so far in terms of combined ratio. So from that point of
view, I'm happy to see the progress, but we're not changing our guidance of structurally
below the 97%.

Well, we'll have to take it as it comes. For now, our guidance is 97% or below. The reality is

once you really own the book, you will always get more insight than we have today. So we
ﬁrst need to see how that -- once we own that book, and we start to repricing it and
bringing it to NN standard. We ﬁrst need to see that impact. So no change here.

The next question is from Mr.William Hawkins, KBW. Go ahead please, sir.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you very much. Thank you again for the clarity about capital management on
slide 6. That's really useful. I'd like to follow up and just ask what that implies for your
capital generation and earnings growth prospects that you still have in place summarized
on Page 5 because you could argue that if you're decoupling your dividend from
operating earnings. It's a sign that your operating earnings and your free cash ﬂow
probably won't be linked as closely in the future as low interest rates and things like that
lead to a divergence. And it might also beg the question about whether 5% to 7% growth
in IFRS earnings is still sort of an achievable target. So can you just talk through whether
your revised dividend policy implies any changes about capital generation or earnings
growth.
And I suppose speciﬁc question that, that ends with is your current 5% to 7% is very much
assuming that the growth is coming from the non-Dutch operations. And bluntly,
insurance Europe and asset management and Japan life have been more of a
disappointment than anything over the past few years. So is there a risk that those
marginal growth entities, they're going to have to reduce their expectations, when you
think about the future?
And then secondly, I think, you -- can you just be clear in terms of the process for deciding
whether to top up the buyback, are you telling us that, that will clearly only happen now at
the year-end review process? Or is it possible it could happen at the interim or at any
other period of time, or whether to go above $250 million, is that now ﬁxed as a year end
decision? Thank you.

Okay. Thank you, William. Let me give it to the Delﬁn for the ﬁrst question. I'll take the
second one.

FINAL

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, William. Well, IFRS operating result grew by 6% in the period of 2017 to
2019. So that was within our guidance. But of course, as you know, we are disclosing
always what are the non-recurrence and there are positives and negatives coming there.
Currently, there is no change on the existing guidance of growing the IFRS operating
result between 5% to 7% over time.
And you are right, there is some decoupling between what is the IFRS proﬁt and what is
the operating capital generation. I made reference already to the fact that while
investment margin for example in Netherlands life has been under pressure because of
the low interest rates and the lower-yielding assets have been entered into the investment
portfolio versus higher-yielding assets with higher book -- sorry, I should say, loweryielding assets, but with higher book yields being maturing, you don't see that pressure in
the operating capital generation. As we move to mortgages, as we move into other
assets, the excess return over the swap curve with volatility adjusted and the CRA has kept
increasing. And therefore, that gives us conﬁdence of that decoupling vis-a-vis the return
to shareholders in terms of ordinary dividends or share buybacks. In terms of the second
question on the share buyback, I think David.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Yes. Yes. William. No, I think the answer is simple here. The -- no, it could also be at
another moment in time. So we'll take this as it comes, but it doesn't have to be at the
year end.

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

Yes, thank you very much. Sorry, I know that you've probably answered this, but I'm going
to start -- say it in a slightly diﬀerent way. Can you just again, just talk about -- I know
there's been a decoupling of the dividend from IFRS, which I applaud which is good. But
should we think of the dividend and the interplay between the dividend and the buyback
as if there's changes in the operational capital generation, it'll come through at the
dividend level and any excess beyond that comes through in terms of the buyback. Is that
the way that we really should think about that. That's the ﬁrst question.
The second question is just in relation to -- I know you're going to redeem a senior debt.
But are you looking to reset some of the capital structure of the group in terms of Tier 2

Page 14 of 24

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Thank you, Johnny. I'll give this to Delﬁn.

FINAL

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you very much, Johnny. So I -- again, I think about this in the simplest way
possible. I said that for the ordinary dividend, we have the capacity to grow it on a stable
basis. And therefore, I would not link that to any particular other metric. When you look at
the operating capital generation in the full year 2019, that has been EUR1.3 billion. And we
have seen also in the previous year, good levels on that metric.
The payment of share buybacks and ordinary dividends depends very much on the level
of surplus capital, excess capital or surplus that you've got. And that is not only measured
by the ﬂow in a particular year or period of time. It also depends on what is your stock of
capital. What is the level of solvency. No doubt that if you have a level of capital, which is
tight, your dependence of further repayment to shareholders will be more dependent on
what is the ﬂow in the year. You've got a more prudent position. You can absorb
ﬂuctuations when it -- when they come.

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

In terms of the way we think about our debt, we will be always look at the market and
what is the price at which our Tier 1 and Tier 2 are trading and see if there is an
opportunity to look into lower yields or the rest. But at this point of time, we are not
envisaging to do any restructuring of our leverage position, which if -- when you look at
the including the reduction of EUR300 million of senior, we have a level of ﬁnancial
leverage of around 25%.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Yes, basically questions on the capital generation, also a recurring
topic. But can we maybe get at least the UFR drag that has been over 2019, reported and
compared to the level of 2019 or at least the delta? And also when looking in Q4 in
isolation, I think going into the quarter, there was some fear that had the theme
surrounding of the billions could be EUR0.2 billion, but was still EUR0.3 billion. So can
Page 15 of 24

Date: 2020-02-13

you shed somewhat light on the underlying generation there because it still feels quite
good especially given in mind to what the curve ended, end of Q3, so that clearly was an
elevated UFR drag here over the fourth quarter. That will be helpful. Thank you.

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

FINAL

Delﬁn?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Good. Thank you, Albert. So the UFR drag really ﬂuctuates from one quarter to another,
depending on what is the starting position of the interest rates. We have seen that the
UFR drag in Q4. This last quarter has been more pronounced because the level of interest
rates in September were very low. For next quarter, as the interest rates went up in
December, we will see less of an impact in terms of UFR drag.

Bloomberg Transcript

So this -- that is because of this big volatility that mentioned in, speciﬁcally, the amounts
don't think are that helpful. But compared to 2018, I can tell you that the change was
signiﬁcant, because of the level of interest rates. But I think that the most important
element for me is that despite all these ﬂuctuations from one quarter to another, we have
seen that for the full year, we have got a solid evolution in terms of the growth of the
operating capital generation,
market movements ﬂuctuate from one period to another. So one can look at the full year
'19 with minus 40 -- minus 14, one-four, percentage points decrease. Last year was plus
20%. If you look it from the moment of the acquisition of Delta Lloyd, actually market
movements are zero. So we need to get used to this ﬂuctuation for one period to another.
But despite that we managed during the year to generate EUR1.4 billion of operating
capital generation, and that is very clear. In terms of the operating capital generation in
2019, basically that was rounding down to EUR1.3 billion.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Yes. But -- I appreciate your remarks but, in the upcoming Investor Day, is it maybe
something also scheduled to give a new starting point on capital generation to, let's say,
what your excess spread has been over '19? What's direct has been in the risk margin
release to have basically a kind of clean starting point for us to model things going
forward? Is that something that's scheduled for the Investor Day? Or is that not really
planned?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. I think, Albert, you're right, coming into more detailed description of how the
operating capital generation. This is something that we are looking at for the Capital
Markets Day. So that we can get more color into how this has evolved and expected to
evolve going forward.

FINAL

Q - Andrew Baker

{BIO 3694545 <GO>}

Hi, thank you for taking my questions. So just two for me, please. First is on the holding
company cash target. So historically, this has been EUR0.5 billion to EUR1.5 billion. But in
reality, it has been managed in excess of this. So as we look forward and obviously with
the announcement of the current buyback today, is this a commitment to managing the
holding company cash within that range as opposed to in excess of that.
And then secondly, on the Solvency II ratio, I don't think the interest rate sensitivity
reﬂected the actual impact of rate movements in the fourth quarter. So can you just
provide a little bit of insight into what drove the disconnect please? Thank you.

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Yes. Delﬁn?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. The whole company cash target continues to be in between EUR0.5 billion and
EUR1.5 billion and as we have said in the past, we can be temporarily outside of that
range, but when that happens, the intention will be to come below that level. You will see
as a matter of fact that in 2020, there's going to be signiﬁcant outﬂows that we have
referred to with the acquisition of VIVAT non-life, there is the EUR300 million of the senior
debt that matures in June. It is the ﬁnal dividend that we have announced of EUR448
million that is being paid in June.
Then in September, we will have the interim dividend calculated with 40% of the total
dividend. So yes, you will see that things that will ﬂuctuate within that range.
In terms of the evolution of interest rates. Indeed the impact was less pronounced than
you would expect from an outside in perspective. And this is mainly due to non-parallel
shift of the curve. At the end, moves in the short end and longer end have very diﬀerent
impacts. And that's right. Just looking at the sensitivities as published at the end of June,
the actual positive impact has been lower.

FINAL

Yes. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. I feel there's a bit of risk that
I'm going to be repetitive in what I'm looking for, but I'm going to try anyway. So on 2018,
I think if you look at your own funds movement, you had EUR1.2 billion in your operating
bucket going to EUR1.3 billion this year. For SCR, I think your release was EUR0.3 billion in
the SCR, going to EUR0.1 billion in 2019.
I was just wondering, '19 versus '18, your own funds is still showing an uptick despite rates
going against you. So just wondering also considering the continued re-risking you're
doing potentially more stable rate environment, the tax environment. I think is also
beneﬁcial for you. Could we see an acceleration of your own funds generation from that
perspective. And I was also wondering, if you could talk a little bit about your SCR release
going forward? Are there any more strain related elements in 2019?
I appreciate the Japan Closed Block VA is the largest driver for going from minus 0.3 to
minus 0.1. But I was just wondering if other than that, this is a normal run rate for your SCR
release given the runoﬀ of your books? That's the ﬁrst question.
The second question is as the questioning also shows, I mean, your free cash ﬂow is still
sizably below your own funds generation in the operating bucket. Why is that? And is
there any good arguments to make what that gap could close going forward?

Bloomberg Transcript

And lastly a bit in connection to the longevity deal. I was just wondering if you would do a
deal, what would you do with the capital that will be released? Would that be -- I mean,
yes, if there's no M&A on the table, would that just be additional shareholder return?
Thank you.

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Delﬁn?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Robin for your questions. I'll try to remember everything that you
asked for. First was on the movement on the own funds and the SCR, 2018 versus '19.
Starting with your comment about the decreased interest rates, that had a negative
impact in our operating capital generation in '19 no doubt, the UFR drag, as I mentioned
before the increased. But we also see in the year that the expected excess return that I
have also referred to before. So as you said, I also run the risk of being a bit repetitive
myself, but the excess return has increased in 2019 versus 2018.
Also, we have much more contribution coming from the bank as well as Japan life and
some of the other units as well. The reduction on the expenses also have some impacts
on the holding expenses. So there are quite a few elements there. Also the contribution in
'19 includes a better performance of our non-life entity. So that was also another positive.
One aspect, however that you need also to take into account is that, as from 2019, we
have already started deducting from operating capital generation, the cost of our hybrid
capital and that is EUR160 million a year. So that basically the evolution versus '18 should
Page 18 of 24

FINAL

be looked at more favorable -- with more favorable eyes, taking into consideration that
already reﬂects that deduction.
Going forward, again, it will be the re-risking and the diﬀerent activities that we have
performed. In terms of the own funds generation and the free cash ﬂow, of course, the
free cash ﬂow is -- depends on the level of solvency and the level of surplus capital in the
units is driven by the dividends that it comes from the subsidiary. And we have seen that
in certain areas, the solvency position has also reduced versus what used to be in the
past. We have seen free cash ﬂows relatively elevated in non-life and some of the business
units. And in other areas, we see that there is an increased contribution for proﬁts. So
there is not a one-on-one relationship between onw funds and free cash ﬂow. Yes, I think
that answers that question. And the third one was about the longevity, and I think David
will answer that.

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

I understand the question. Actually, we will have always during the year, we will potentially
have pluses and minuses. This is also why we have now given a more clear guidance on
how to -- how we look at this on an annual basis. And so again, we will start with a
progressive dividend and recurring annual share buyback and then any additional excess
capital also to return unless we can use it for other opportunities. So if we would have a
capital release on this or any others, all of that we will put in the context of this guidance.

Q - Colm Kelly

{BIO 19140684 <GO>}

Thanks a lot for taking my questions. And it's certainly the additional guidance around the
minimum capital return is very welcome for time and so thanks for that. But one question
is just obviously the dividend is no longer linked to the IFRS proﬁt. So in some respect, it
gives a little less clarity to investors in terms of the sustainability of that growth where
we're trying to validate the growth of that. And equally it's diﬃcult to assess the exact
quantum of excess capital. I appreciate; you have an internal framework of assessing
excess capital that could be distributed in addition to the guidance today.
But how externally should we be thinking about that framework? Should we be assuming
excess capital is anything in terms of holding company cash above your targets? Is it a
solvency ratio above a certain level. It's just there's a little lack of clarity on exactly what is
the measure we should be looking at to determine that excess capital or indeed the
dividend growth rate, if you could answer that, please? Thank you.

Thank you, Colm. Guidance for ordinary dividend, and we expect to grow that over time
and we should not link it to any particular metric. In terms of how to look at excess capital,
indeed one good reference is to look at the holding capital -- the cash capital at the
holding and as you know to which extend, the cash capital is within the range outside of
the range. But again, we do not want -- we do not like to have a mechanical link to any
particular ratio, and we will -- we welcome the stability of the returns. So sometimes we
might pay more of what it has been the increase of surplus capital in the period.
Sometimes we can pay less. We do expect to have more regular payment going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two. So ﬁrst one is by
formalizing the buyback, did you actually ruling out the possibility of large scale M&A at
all. So that's the ﬁrst question.
And then secondly is on the EIOPA review on the volatility adjustment side, so basically, I
think the current view is that they will allow for the VA for the -- based on the company's
own asset mix, that means actually for Dutch insurers, mortgages could be taking into
consideration. And I just want to have a very high-level explanation how this like
mortgage be taken into account of VA will aﬀect your VA beneﬁt as well as the dynamic
VA beneﬁt. Thank you.

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Fulin. The -- so our best case is still that we give back excess capital to
shareholders. And I think -- and also since the IPO, we now have returned EUR4.8 billion
including all the -- all of the recent announcements. I think also today, we make it clear
that what shareholders can expect in terms of capital returns with a progressive ordinary
dividend and a recurring annual share buyback of at least EUR250 million. Any additional
capital that we then can return, unless it can be used for value creating opportunities.
It means that speciﬁcally, if you look at M&A, I think, we have always been very disciplined
in terms of our ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial criteria, which we have applied to the Delta
Lloyd acquisition and to the VIVAT acquisition. So in any case, we will always be very
disciplined on this criteria, taking into account our capital policies. Then on EIOPA, let me
get this to Delﬁn.

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you Fulin for your question. I think it's far from clear of what any ﬁnal
recommendation is going to be ﬁrst tested in June by EIOPA or recommended later to
the European commission. And what the European commission will bring to the European
parliament for both and what ﬁnally will be implemented in relationship to Vola. There are
many talks about potentially having a speciﬁc VA, which I don't know, probably it is
unlikely that it might happen, but who knows. Yes, there could be elements like allowing
matching adjustments in a diﬀerent form or incorporating in the Vola some elements that
recognize the long-term -- the nature of the long-term liabilities of life insurers, very early
to speculate about what that will look like or what possible beneﬁt it will arise from it.

Q - Fulin Liang

{BIO 21126177 <GO>}

Thank you. I think, can I have a follow-up question. What if the mortgage is -- the spread
of mortgage it will be incorporated into volatility adjustment, what the impact will be to
the own funds as well as to SCR.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, currently, the volatility adjuster is based on a reference portfolio, which is determined
by EIOPA on a regular basis based on the average investment of the insurer. So if the
volatility adjuster, where to incorporate somehow the spreads of mortgages, that will
incorporate another factor. But that is the impact that this has on the calculation of own
funds.
When you talk about the impact on the solvency capital requirement, that becomes more
complicated, because that will depend in the case of large groups like ours that has an
internal model, it will very much depend not so much on the Vola, but what is the internal
model reﬂect the shocks and the movements of the spreads as you know over time. And
we currently have an approach to model the credit spread shocks in which we reﬂect the
liquidity of liabilities in the asset shock.
And as a consequence, I'm not sure what a change in the deﬁnition of the vola would
have, as we will have to be looked into the perspective of the internal model that has
been designed and approved by our regulator and which at this point of time, I don't see
any reason in order to perform any rework. So in that sense, diﬃcult to assess what impact
that might have.

Yes, good morning. The ﬁrst one is on the dividend capacity of NN bank. I think you were
back to dividend last year. How much can we expect? Are you thinking about close to
100% payout ratio on the bank? Or will there be more kind of -- mid-range of I mean
around 50%.

FINAL

Then on Japan life, I was wondering if you could also update us on the new sales on the
COLI products? What you have seen following the -- all the tax changes there?
And then the ﬁnal one, relates on the share buyback again. The recurring nature of the
share buyback is actually, it's quite unusual actually for insurance companies to put the
wording recurring in the -- on the presentation. Can we assume that D&B has agreed on
this recurring nature of the buyback. What was the kind of -- do you need an approval
process when you kind of add on something -- a recurring buyback? Or at the end of the
day, they're just approving every year again the buybacks and it will be up to them also to
validate a general buyback program. Thank you.

Yes. Thank you, Benayoun. Let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Delﬁn. So on question
two on Japan. Yes indeed so we have seen sales going down in the market on the back of
the tax reform. It's fair to say that the market is still absorbing this change and SME
owners and brokers to be fair are still trying to ﬁnd out exactly what these products mean
and what the added value is. This is a market phenomena. So we haven't seen a real pick
up yet of sales. We're conﬁdent that it will happen. At the end of the day, we introduced
three new products. We're doing a lot to invest in relationship with the brokers and
training, but the Japanese market takes a bit of time to get adjusted to the new situation.
Long-term we're convinced that we will be able to ﬁnd ways in products and services to
service the SME owners. Then on the share buyback, indeed it is important as I said that
we wanted to give more guidance on our capital allocation on an annual basis. That is
also why we talk about the recurring nature. In conversation with D&B, I mean, we have a
constructive and professional relationship with D&B. They are obviously aware of the
analysis and the policies that we do, but I'm not further going to discuss any details on
these conversations. Then on dividend capacity of NN bank, Delﬁn?

Yes. Thank you, Benayoun. So indeed the dividend capacity of NN Bank going forward,
you should think about it in terms of the net proﬁt of the bank. The dividend will be less
than 100% payout as we need to retain some capital to fund the growth of the bank. But
the bank is currently at a good level of solvency capital.
And of course the reference of 2019 is very special because in 2019, was the combination
of one special dividend coming due to the upstream of Ex-Delta Lloyd mortgage
originator that has been merged with the bank. So that was EUR20 million non-recurrent
dividend. And in addition in 2019, we had the full year dividend of 2018 and the interim of
'19. So going forward, you will always of course have this year, the interim of 2020 and the
ﬁnal of 2020 will be paid sometimes in 2021.

The next question is from Mr.Farquhar Murray, Autonomous research. Go ahead please.

Q - Farquhar Murray

Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions, if I may. And I apologies, they're both actually
on capital. Starting with the EIOPA. I mean, it's indicated there's going to be a holistic
assessment in March. I just wondered how much line of sight do you have on that exercise
so far? And what are the expected diﬀerences in that versus previous quiz exercises in the
October paper?
And then secondly, just on, kind of, the matching adjustments and speciﬁcally mortgages,
how much national discretion is there around that speciﬁc issue? Is it a matter of national
discussion? Or is it an EU level topic. Thanks.

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Thank you, Farquhar. Delﬁn?

Yes. Farquhar, I don't know. I don't know what EIOPA will put forward in the holistic
assessment which we do expect probably in March. Certainly their ﬁrst review or
consultion paper that EIOPA did was indicating quite a lot of negative potential aspects
on that. So I do expect or hope, I should say to have a more balanced approach from
EIOPA. But I have no insight of what they're planning to do here. I mean, what, certainly as
I've mentioned before, I think the comments that we have heard from EIOPA and other
regulators, I think are supporting on our view that EIOPA review over time will be
manageable.
In terms of the mortgages on matching adjustment, I mean, I think it's up to the regulator
in order to take -- if the conditions for a proper matching adjustment is to be ﬁt. I mean,
diﬀerent than the UK or the Spanish market that insurers have not traditionally do the
same approach of liability management in terms of matching assets to particular
portfolios. So there is some technical complexities around it, but it's a question of being
dealt by each local regulator.

Okay. Thank you, Anita and thank you, everybody for listening in and for all the questions.
Let me wrap up by saying that NN Group has today reported a strong set of results for the
fourth quarter and the full year 2019 as well as a solid balance sheet and capital position.
We have also provided clear guidance on our dividend policy, which consists of a
progressive dividend per share and a recurring share buyback of at least EUR250 million
each year. We announced today that we will initiate a new share buyback program for an
amount of EUR250 million, which is anticipated to commence on the 2nd of March.
Thank you all for joining the call today and I look forward to seeing many of you at our
Capital Market Day in June. Have a pleasant day.
