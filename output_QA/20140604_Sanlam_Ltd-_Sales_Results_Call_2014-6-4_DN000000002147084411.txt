Bloomberg Transcript

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Sanlam operational update for the
four months ended the 30th of April 2014. All participants are now in listen-only mode,
and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after today's presentation.
(Operator Instructions) Please also note that this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to hand the conference over to Johan van Zyl. Please go ahead, sir.

Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to this
conference call. I'm joined on the call by the Sanlam Financial Director, Kobus Moller; and
also Wilkus Oliver, the Head of Group Finance.
By way of introduction, I'd like to say that it was a very pleased -- it is very pleasing to
report a solid start to the 2014 financial year to shareholders this afternoon. The South
African operating environment proved particularly challenging in the first four months of
the year. But I am very happy to say that the diversified profile of the Group across
products, market segments and geographies stood us in very good state yet again and
enabled us to achieve strong growth in most performance metrics.
A number of factors impacted on the Group's results for the first four months and I think
before we get to the results, let me just highlight few of those. Firstly, disposable income
of consumers in the middle-income and entry-level market segments in South Africa
remained under pressure from particularly high debt levels and inflation, and in particular,
in this case, I think administered inflation like electricity rates and taxes, healthcare and

FINAL

things like that has gone up quite a bit. This was aggravated by unprecedented industrial
action in the mining sector and particularly in the platinum mines.
Sanlam Sky's largest branch is located in Rustenburg, which is the heart of the platinum
belt. The region accounts for about 10% of Sanlam's price value of new business and this
was adversely affected by the strike action from a new business production perspective. I
must say, in spite of the difficulties experienced in the economy, that the other Sanlam Sky
branch has performed in line with our expectations. Also, weather conditions in South
Africa were more favorable in 2014 than the comparable period last year, translating into
a significant improvement in the margins and from crop insurance.
The Indian economy is currently growing below its potential with a (inaudible) impact on
the growth achieved at Shriram Transport Finance Company, which is fairly large and
matured in being its context. The other operations in the Shriram Capital Group continued
to deliver strong growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

Persistency experience across the Group is holding up very nicely and remains within the
Group's assumptions. Long-term interest rates increased by 0.4% since the end of
December 2013, but more importantly for this reporting period is that they were 2.2%
higher than in April 2013. This had a marked negative effect on value of new business
growth reported for the first four months on 2014 on a like-for-like basis.
Investment market volatility continued amidst uncertainty around the tapering of
quantitative easing in the US and gross prospects of the China economy. And lastly, the
weakening of the rand exchange rate against most currencies during 2013 resulted in a
much weaker average exchange rate for the four months to 30 April, 2014 compared to
the same period last year. This, of course, has been -- had a positive impact on the
translated earnings of the non-South African operations.
In this context then let's have a look at the results. The details of the Group's
performance for the four-month period are included in the SENS announcement released
earlier today. Still things need to be highlighted, firstly, overall new business volumes
excluding white label increased by 21% with new business -- life business, up 20% new
investment business up 24%, and general insurance short-term insurance business
increasing by 9% when compared to the first four months of 2013. Within Sanlam Personal
Finance, Glacier delivered another sterling performance with growth of more than 30% in
the mass-affluent space.
The individual life business, operating predominantly in the mature middle market -middle income market achieved satisfactory growth of 11%, driven by single premiums and
recurring premium retirement annuity business. Traditional guaranteed plan and annuity
products did well in the higher interest rate environment. Sanlam Sky operating the South
African entry level market had a difficult start to the year, being adversely affected by the
industrial action in the mining industry that I already alluded to. Despite this, it managed to
achieve good growth in individual life recurring premiums.

FINAL

Recurring premium group business in this market segment had a slow start to the year
with less new schemes written in 2014 than fairly high base that we have from last year.
This is however a normal feature of the segment and we expect improvement in the
remainder of the year.
In Sanlam emerging markets, we achieved another stellar performance with new business
growth of 58%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions during 2013, growth of 47% is still
higher than our own targets. In that respect, I think it's important to note that all regions
contributed to this growth.
Sanlam investments delivered growth of 29%, an exemplary performance in a very
competitive market. Wealth management and the international business were the main
contributors. 12% [ph] growth at the South African asset management operations is
particularly satisfactory, again, given a very competitive market.

Bloomberg Transcript

Growth in Santam, gross written premiums were satisfactory, considering the competitive
environment, the tough conditions experienced in the economy and the low GDP growth
in South Africa. In particular, the motor car sales numbers released during the last week
would give you an indication of how tough it is in this space. But in my way, in spite of this
continued on its solid growth bar.
Overall, net fund inflows of 10.7 billion, that is excluding the white label; labels represents
a very good performance in light of the 2.5 billion outflows experienced from Sanlam
private investments and particularly low margin business. As I said, these outflows do
come from low margin share incentive portfolios with net inflows into the more profitable
discretionary mandates. So, we're very happy with the mix of business there.
This brings us to the financial results. The net result from financial services or the net
operating profit, as we used to know it, increased by some 40% from last year. This
includes maiden contributions from corporate transactions concluded in 2013. All
operations contributed strong growth with Santam in particular posting that welcome
turnaround in its underwriting performance.
Asset-based fee income was, in general, supported by higher average level of assets
under management, following strong market performances in the latter part of 2013 and
also the positive performance that we've had so far this year. A few remarks on our
capital. We still remain well capitalized with the healthy solvency level. The Group's
discretionary capital amount to some ZAR3 billion at the end of April. Our focus remains
on concluding value-adding opportunities to utilize discretionary capital. We have a
pipeline of opportunities that are currently being investigated and we will make
announcements to the market on these in due course.
In conclusion, looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we expect investment market
volatility to persist. Growth in the South African economy is also not expected to improve
and downside risks exist should industrial action continue at the current sched. New
business production will be challenging under these conditions.

In addition, the second half of 2013 was a great strong period for most business units in
the group, its together with the contribution of acquisitions concluded last year, sets a
very high hurdle for growth. So the base effect is pretty high.

FINAL

Growth rates are therefore expected to moderate going forward from these current
levels. We would like to thank you and I will now open the call for questions from the
audience.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Risto Ketola from
Standard Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Risto Ketola

{BIO 4929572 <GO>}

Yes. Afternoon. I've got three questions, if I may. The first thing, I just wanted to check,
you said all regions had more than 40% growth in EM. I mean, does that imply that
Namibia and Botswana also grew individually of more than 40%?

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No. I didn't say -- I said overall the growth with all regions contributing towards the 40%,
not all growing at 40%.

Q - Risto Ketola

{BIO 4929572 <GO>}

Okay, all right. Okay, that makes more sense. And the second thing is, there's no
commentary on the EB business, I just wanted to know how that is growing.

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

Yeah. I think, it's doing fairly well. The recurring premiums did fairly well. And it's on track, I
don't think there is anything funny there, it made its contribution and it's nicely up.

Q - Risto Ketola

{BIO 4929572 <GO>}

Okay. And --

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

(Technical Difficulty)

A - Wilkus Oliver
Volumes are slightly down on last year, but the profitability is higher, so we have good
quality business, that's (inaudible).

Q - Risto Ketola

{BIO 4929572 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay, perfect. And the last thing is, you mentioned surplus capital of some 3 [ph] billion. I
mean, would that be closer to 3.5 or 2.5, I mean, I'm just trying to get -- the numbers are
little but low compared to what I had. I'm just wondering whether it's 3.0 or whether it's 3
something?

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

It's close to 3 billion. That is the number; it's not -- its pleasure to see them 2.5 or 3.5.

Q - Risto Ketola

{BIO 4929572 <GO>}

Okay, alright perfect. And then the last question is, is life insurance becoming like MTN?
This is endless pools of money. The single premium volumes are just unbelievable across
all the companies.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

No, it's not like MTN. But you should think about what are the options. I mean, a lot of the
money is still being pulled short-term interest rates, which is a good indicator for what
people can get from cash flows. Really low -- in the past, we had a lot of money going to
housing, buy-to-rent type of an approach. That money isn't going there. And thirdly, if we
really look at the retirement and the whole movement in the '90s towards guaranteed
contributions rather than with the whole pool of money being retailer -- becoming retails
(inaudible) people retire and particularly the last three years that we've had with assets in
retirement fronts actually just exploded with close -- in South African base of close to 20%
compounded over the three years.
As these people retire, it's easier for them to retire, because they have more assets, as
the economy becomes under pressure, people moved up. So a lot of these effects
combined actually create the pool, which means that as the -- while the sun is shining,
people should make hay and that is reflected in the numbers, but it can't continue.

Q - Risto Ketola

{BIO 4929572 <GO>}

Yeah, I mean, I think you're leading this something it's quite interesting -- it sounds almost
like you're saying that the number of people retiring year-to-year isn't very constant, you
saying that people actually elect to retire in times like this. And if the market --

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

They elect to retire, because they have the assets on the one hand and because it's not
going well at where they work.

Q - Risto Ketola

{BIO 4929572 <GO>}

Yeah.

Essentially opt out and things combined have created an above normal trend and
(technical difficulty).

Q - Risto Ketola

{BIO 4929572 <GO>}

FINAL

All right. That's a good point, Johan, I'll put in my notebook. Alright. Okay. Thanks. That's
all.

Our next question comes from Brian Mushonga of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Q - Brian Mushonga

{BIO 16209522 <GO>}

Good afternoon guys.

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

Good afternoon.

Q - Brian Mushonga

{BIO 16209522 <GO>}

Few questions. If you take out the acquisitions from last year (Technical Difficulty) from
financial services?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

What's the number if you --

A - Wilkus Oliver
The impact is around 5% to 7% of the growth.

Q - Brian Mushonga

{BIO 16209522 <GO>}

First (inaudible) from the acquisition -- acquisitions.

A - Wilkus Oliver
Yeah.

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Brian Mushonga

{BIO 16209522 <GO>}

And then the 3 billion in discretionary capital, I assume, it's now something closer to 2.7
after the transaction in Uganda, would that be correct?

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}
Page 6 of 13



Company N ame: Sanlam L td
Company Ticker: SL M SJ Equity
Date: 2014-06-04

Yeah. This is the end of April number, it's not anything that we have announced since --

A - Wilkus Oliver

FINAL

From sum [ph] 3 to sum 2.7.

Q - Brian Mushonga

{BIO 16209522 <GO>}

Okay, fair enough. And then just in terms of that 2.7, should we be thinking more in terms
of we're likely to see ten more wonders or two more MCIS?

A - Wilkus Oliver
No. I think MCIS would be on the higher side. The idea is to really deepen and strengthen
our existing relationships with partners. And therefore, we are unlikely to -- we have one
or two territories on the -- particularly in Africa, where we're still building our footprint and
so, but by and large, it's the existing deals, and then the amounts are relatively small.

Q - Brian Mushonga

{BIO 16209522 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Wilkus Oliver
Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

Sir, can I just -- on Brian's question, I think it's -- I mean, I think something that to keep in
mind when you look at something like our six months results, is that do we have merger
acquisitions last year, we started to account from May and from April, PNO business and
also some of the acquisitions in India. So I think just keep that in mind when you look at the
half year results for example. And the impact will be bigger on the six month basis than on
the four month basis.

Q - Brian Mushonga

{BIO 16209522 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Our next question comes from Hanna Barry of Moneyweb. Please go ahead.

Q - Hanna Barry
Hi, Johan. Thanks very much. I also have three questions. So the first one relates to the
corrective action in Sanlam's intermediated business. If you could just comment on that
whether that was sort of across the board rate increases or selected rate increases on
higher risk?

Page 7 of 13



Company N ame: Sanlam L td
Company Ticker: SL M SJ Equity
Date: 2014-06-04

And then I now expect Sanlam life insurance has the capital adequacy four times higher
than the statutory requirements, which seems quite high and that in effect of use of
capital. So I just like to know that the reason why it's so high?

FINAL

And then the last point is just on the too low margin share incentive scheme portfolio at
Sanlam Private Investments and as such on those, if possible, could you elaborate a bit on
the those low margins in --

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

Yeah surely.

Q - Hanna Barry
Thanks.

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. In terms of the corrective action on the intermediate business in general
insurance, a big part of that would be increases, but not across the board. I think, we are
very careful in that; we don't want to chase particularly good times to the direct players,
who are fairly aggressive. So premium increases would be one way of addressing it, but
simply better underwriting and better management of the risk that we do; we spoke
particularly about crop insurance.
We've done much better and so forth, but in that whole space, the corrective action that
we're actually thinking. Partly underwriting, particularly, if you assumed payment and things
like that means you do run a higher risk there, that is where we've addressed some, but
not across the board, where it's been fairly selective.

Q - Hanna Barry
Okay.

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

In the -- on the capital of Sanlam Life being four times, this statutory requirement, of
course, this includes, remember, also what we call surplus or discretionary capital [ph]. I'd
just spread spending that -- stripping that out, we've spoken about the pipeline and so. It
will come down and it will come down, I think, to around three times, which is still a high
number.
But then you have to look at the whole San process. This is on the old system, which is not
risk-based; we're moving to the new Solvency II risk based San system in South Africa. And
I think it's much more prudent to look at, it's not going to require less capital.
And in that context, we think the capital is appropriate. It may be -- but too high, but we're
very happy that for the moment that is the amount of capital that is required in our
business.
Page 8 of 13



Company N ame: Sanlam L td
Company Ticker: SL M SJ Equity
Date: 2014-06-04

We haven't really sorted out all the issues around San, particularly diversification and one
or two other things, not inside a particular license, but between licenses and participations
and things like that.

FINAL

This is, there is still a great area that we're sorting out and so forth. One on the Sanlam --

Q - Hanna Barry
Private investments --

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

Yeah, yeah. Private investments.

A - Wilkus Oliver
I think, we should distinguish in that business between put through mandatory, we have
discretionary mandates which is the higher margin business, and then we will provide a
Field Administration Service. And this (inaudible) division, it's fairly accessed on our books,
or what we managed on behalf of third parties but it's very low margin. So if we lose, we
doesn't even given impact on our profitability, really.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

Just on that, we have just north of 100 billion in the book. And about 40 billion is where
we have the mandate our self, that is worth much more, charge a higher fee and we
manage the money. On the rest, we simply provide administration services. And we do
trade in some portfolios if that people so want us to do that. But we don't do the asset
management from that.
So -- and if you lose part of that, it looks like a big effect but in reality, it is such -- it's a few
basis points that you lose.

Q - Hanna Barry
Okay. Just to clarify, was that because he was answering last?

A - Wilkus Oliver
Can you just run again?

Q - Hanna Barry
Okay. So -- the answer to the first and second questions?

A - Johan van Zyl

Yes, between (inaudible).

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

It happens in the -- not in the first four months but in the next two months.

Q - Unidentified Participant
That's fine. And then your 40% increase in operating earnings, can you give us a sense of
what's your increase in your cash operating earnings was, because that's probably more
important for us, that's the value of the dividends?

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

Yeah. This is a very detailed stuff. Do we have that number?

A - Wilkus Oliver
I don't have that. I'll try to answer before the end of the call, I'll send it quickly if I can.

FINAL

The difficulty there's been I think as we have said that there is the big -- one of the big
reasons for the turnarounds in last year to this year (inaudible) for example something like
Santam. In Santam, there's no underwriting here, first quarter last year and that recovered
quite strongly. But that didn't necessarily change the dividend potential. And so, it's
difficult, we forecast an (inaudible) the dividend, for example, say, it's not that easy to
really calculate a cash earnings for a four-month period. And so --

A - Wilkus Oliver
But I give you until the end of the call.

Good afternoon. Johan. Good afternoon, Kobus and everybody.

A - Wilkus Oliver
(inaudible)

Q - Unidentified Participant
Johan, in last year, SEM invested about close to a quarter of a billion in Capricorn. What's
your current holding there and what are your intensions with Bank Windhoek going
forward, I mean, is there likely with that some of the existing discretionary capital, will it be
invested in Capricorn and how much?

Page 11 of 13



Company N ame: Sanlam L td
Company Ticker: SL M SJ Equity
Date: 2014-06-04

Secondly, how much of the capital is likely to go to your partnership with Ubuntu-Botho
and what's the status of Ubuntu-Botho Financial Services?

FINAL

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. On the first question in terms of Capricorn Bank Windhoek, they are
partnering in Namibia. By and large of the Sanlam business, we own 55% of the Sanlam
business, Capricorn owns about 25% -- 30% of business there, which is the Bank
Windhoek Coding company. And then we have local players there, broker and we'll also
have NEMIC, the federation of -- the labor federation over there as a partner in the
Sanlam business.
As they own about 30% in us, we own about 23% in them at different levels. In the holding
company of Capricorn, allowed that directly at Bank Windhoek level and we've also ruled
and we do asset management and in particularly our unit trust business, we've taken from
the Sanlam side and we've given that (inaudible) that increased our stake over there.
So we are strategic stakeholder in them, just above 20%, and the idea then is we get the
bank insurance business, we do their life stuff, they do our asset management and/or the
unit trust business and increasingly also in the general insurance side, there is a similar
arrangement.

Bloomberg Transcript

And that works fairly well for us. So the idea is to increase that or to become a bank or any
of that. But just to cement that partnership and I think so far, things have been working
very well. We've been partners for a long time over there.
If we talk -- speak about UB [ph], we haven't really allocated any specific money towards
UB. We've agreed that we'll support them in a number of areas, but it's up to UB to see
what needs to be done, what they would like to do and where they ahead. And as soon
as they clarify their own strategic positioning and so, we will have a look in to see what we
can support and where we would like to support them. Of course, and what works for
Sanlam. It can't be seen, there are separate company, they have their own views, they
already are empowerment partners, they own a substantial stake in us, 14%, which is
worth around 16 billion at this moment in time, they agree to paid all the debts. I think it's
a good story. But they still have to clarify their own future.
And as far as I understand, that busy with that, and hopefully next time, when we speak,
we can provide some more insight into the future.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Thank you.
