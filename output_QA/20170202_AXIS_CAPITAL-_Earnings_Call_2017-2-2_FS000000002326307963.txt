{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Linda, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us
today. Last night, AXIS reported fourth quarter operating income of $101 million or $1.14
per diluted share, bringing our full year operating income to $4.48 per share, an 11%
increase in year-over-year operating income per share and improvement in operating
ROE to 7.9%. Our core operating performance strengthened in both the quarter and full
year, as the improvements we've put in place allowed us to absorb both higher industry
cat losses and negative market conditions, and still deliver for our customers, partners in
distribution, and our shareholders. We entered the year with diluted book value per share
of $58.27.
Adjusting for dividends, diluted book value per share grew 10% over the last 12 months.
This is a satisfying rate of growth, considering the significant selloff experienced in the
bond markets in the weeks following the U.S. election, which impacted the value of our
fixed income investments. We also continued our practice of managing our capital for the
benefit of our shareholders. During the year, we increased our dividend by 9% and
returned $644 million to our shareholders through common dividends and share
repurchases. Over the last five years, we returned to our shareholders in excess of 100%
of aggregate operating income including the break-up fee earned from PartnerRe in 2015.
We've been able to do that while we grew our overall business by optimizing our portfolio
and reducing volatility for enhanced capital efficiency, as well as more strategic use of
reinsurance and third-party capital.
Again, this quarter, we demonstrated our efforts to reposition our portfolio are bearing
fruit. In the year with higher global catastrophe losses, our combined ratio for the full year
was only up about 1 point, despite the cat loss ratio being up about 3 points over the prior
year. I would also note that while observers report that 2016 was an above average year
for the 10-year average, let me rephrase that, that the cat losses for 2016 were above the
10-year average, our own cat loss ratio was actually 3 points lower than our 10-year
average.

In 2016, we took bold steps forward, taking significant tangible actions to strengthen our
market positioning and profitability across our businesses. We extended our geographic
reach by expanding our presence in Dubai and setting up the launch of our Miami office to
address the Latin American market. We increased our scale and market relevance in key
sectors. This included organic growth in many of our initiatives bringing on new market
leaders and teams and the recent announcement that we're acquiring Aviabel, a Premier
European Specialty Aviation Insurer and Reinsurer. By acquiring Aviabel, we're absorbing a
portfolio that complements our existing airline business while extending our physical
presence into Brussels and Amsterdam on the continent.
We also built on our strengths. We invested in and committed to lines in markets that are
consistent with our objectives of relevance, profitability and scale, and where we have the
best opportunities to drive profitable growth. A recent example was our decision to
redirect our U.S.-based resources and key personnel to the U.S. wholesale E&S market for
property, primary casualty, and excess casualty lines, where we have historically held a
very strong market position. I hasten to add that this not an exit from retail markets. We're
still very successful in covering U.S.-based property and casualty lines to retail program
and facilities in the U.S., as well as through our London platform. And of course, we
continue to deliver a wide range of professional lines through all retail and wholesale
channels.
We made significant progress in developing strategic capital partnerships and positioning
AXIS as the company that best matches risk to the most appropriate capital. We now have
over $1 billion of additional capacity available through our strategic capital partners. An
important component of our third-party capital strategy was the creation of Harrington Re,
a $600 million specialty reinsurer launched together with The Blackstone Group. These
partnerships allow us to do more for our clients and partners in distribution, share risk with
knowledgeable long-term investors, and earn attractive fee income.
For the full year, we reported fee income of $22 million, and we expect that this is just the
beginning as we see fee income as a steady and growing source of attractive revenue for
AXIS. Through these initiatives and others and the hard work of our dedicated employees
across the globe, we are reinvigorating our brand and laying the foundation for a
differentiated leader in global specialty risks, achieving intelligent growth in selected
markets, optimizing our portfolios, matching risk with the right capital, and delivering solid
and stable profitability.
I'll report more on market conditions in our outlook for 2017 after Joe covers the highlights
of our financial performance. Joe?

Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we generated strong
results, featuring net income of $131 million and an annualized ROE of 9.9%. Our net
income this quarter benefited from continued good underwriting performance, including a
decrease in our current accident year loss ratio, ex-cat and weather, together with
continued favorable prior-year reserve development, strong investment income and
foreign exchange gains.

FINAL

These positive factors were partially offset by a higher level of catastrophe and weatherrelated losses in the quarter primarily related to Hurricane Matthew and an increase in
general and administrative expenses. Our book value declined by $1.50 in the quarter to
$58.27, principally driven by unrealized losses on our available-for-sale investment
portfolio due to higher U.S. Treasury rates.
Moving into the details of our income statement, our fourth quarter gross premiums
written decreased by 9%, with decreases reported by both segments. Our insurance
segment reported a decrease in gross premiums written of $6 million or 1% in the fourth
quarter compared to the same period in 2015. After adjusting for the impact of foreign
exchange movements, our gross premiums written increased by 1% in the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

An increase in new business written in our property and professional lines was attributable
to growth in our London book including MGA in program business, and growth in our
liability lines was attributable to our U.S. primary casualty book. These increases were
partially offset by decreases in our credit and political risk as well as our accident and
health lines. The decrease in credit and political risk was due to timing, and the decrease
in accident and health was largely due to the non-renewal of a treaty in our North
American reinsurance division in a low-volume quarter for that operation. I would note,
however, that our A&H book grew by almost $80 million or 22% on a year-to-date basis.
Our Reinsurance segment reported a decrease of $64 million or 34% in gross premiums
written in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease
was primarily driven by timing differences in our professional liability and liability lines of
business, partially offset by an increase in our agriculture lines. After adjusting for the
impact of multi-year contracts and timing differences, gross premiums written decreased
by $13 million or 7%. Further, it is worth noting that our fourth quarter is not a meaningful
production period of our Reinsurance segment.
Consolidated net premiums written decreased by 22% in the fourth quarter of 2016
compared to the same period of 2015. Insurance net premiums written were down 8%,
reflecting lower premiums written in the quarter and increased premiums ceded in our
professional and liability lines. Reinsurance net premiums written were down 52%,
reflecting the decrease in gross premiums written in the quarter, as well as the impact of
retrocessions to Harrington Re on our liability and professional lines.
On a year-to-date basis, reinsurance gross premiums – gross and net premiums written
were up 11% and 2%, respectively compared to 2015. As we discussed with you in
previous quarters, we have been ceding more of our reinsurance premiums to our
strategic capital partners in recent periods, particularly in our liability and professional lines
due to the launch of Harrington Re in the third quarter, as well as increased retrocessions
of our catastrophe and property business throughout the year. Consolidated net
premiums earned in the fourth quarter of 2016 are comparable to the same period in
2015 in both segments.
Our fourth quarter consolidated accident year loss ratio increased by eight-tenths of a
point to 66% compared to the same period in 2015. During the quarter, we incurred $59

million or 6.4 points in pre-tax catastrophe and weather-related losses primarily
attributable to Hurricane Matthew and U.S. weather-related events. Comparatively, we
incurred $10 million or 1.1 points primarily attributable to U.S. weather-related events during
the same period in 2015. With regard to Hurricane Matthew, we incurred pre-tax net
losses of $52 million, with our Insurance segment contributing $39 million, and
Reinsurance segment contributing $13 million to these losses. After-tax net losses
attributable to Hurricane Matthew are at the low-end of the range we indicated last
quarter.
Our fourth quarter current accident year loss ratio, ex-cat and weather, decreased by 4.5
points to 59.6%. Our Insurance segment's quarterly current accident year loss ratio ex-cat
and weather decreased by 6.4 points from 62% to 55.6%, primarily due to a decrease in
midsize and attritional losses in our property, marine and liability lines partially offset by
the adverse impact of rate and trend and changes in business mix. Our Reinsurance
segment's quarterly current accident year loss ratio ex-cat and weather decreased by 2.5
points from 66.1% to 63.6% due to a decrease in midsize and attritional losses in our
credit and surety lines, partially offset by increased loss experienced in our agriculture
lines and the ongoing adverse impact of rate and trend.

Bloomberg Transcript

Year-to-date, our consolidated current accident year loss ratio increased by 1.8 points to
67.4%, driven by a 2.9-point increase in the cat loss ratio. During the year, we incurred
$204 million of pre-tax catastrophe and weather-related losses net of reinstatement
premiums compared to $100 million in the same period in 2015. After adjusting for these
events, our current accident year loss ratio decreased by 1.1 points to 61.8%.
Our insurance segment's year-to-date current accident year loss ratio, ex-cat and
weather, decreased by 1.9 points from 62.5% to 60.6% due to a decrease in mid-sized
and attritional losses in our marine and property lines, partially offset by the adverse
impact of rate and trend, changes in business mix, and increased losses in our insurance,
credit and political risk lines. Our Reinsurance segment's year-to-date current accident
year loss ratio, ex-cat and weather, decreased by three-tenths of a point from 63.3% to
63.0%, due to a decrease in mid-size and attritional credit and surety lines and partially
offset by the adverse impact of rate and trend.
Turning to loss reserves established in prior years, our results continue to benefit from net
favorable loss reserve development, which amounted to $68 million during the fourth
quarter. Short-tail classes in both segments contributed $31 million of this balance. In
addition, our professional, insurance and reinsurance reserve classes recorded $16 million.
Our motor reinsurance reserve class contributed $15 million and our liability reinsurance
reserve class contributed $12 million of the net favorable prior-year development during
the quarter. Our year-to-date favorable prior-year development was $292 million
compared to $243 million in 2015.
During the fourth quarter, our acquisition cost ratio increased modestly by 0.7% compared
to the same period in 2015. Our Reinsurance segment's ratio increased by 0.3% of a
point to 25.9% due to the impact of retrosessional contracts. The impact was partially
offset by changes in the business mix and a decrease in adjustments related to losssensitive features.

FINAL

In 2015, the ratio included the benefits of fees from strategic capital partners, which are
now included in other income or offset against general and administrative expenses. Our
insurance segment's ratio increased by 1.1 points to 14.5% driven by an increase in variable
acquisition costs, primarily related to our MGA and broker portfolio business and the
absence of a favorable federal excise tax adjustment, which benefited 2015, partially
offset by increased ceding commissions on our professional lines' ceded reinsurance
programs.
Our G&A ratio increased by 2.6% in the quarter compared to the same period in 2015.
Focusing solely on dollars, expenses in the quarter have increased by $23 million. We did,
however, have some unusual expenses in Q4 2016, including severance and transition
costs related to the closure of four U.S. retail business units, cost associated with the
introduction of a new retirement provision in our equity plan and stock compensation
expenses, which reflected the higher company share price on cash-settled awards.

Bloomberg Transcript

In addition, incentive compensation expenses increased in the quarter compared to 2015,
reflecting our stronger 2016 performance. Adjusting for unusual items and timing, we
believe that our run rate in the quarter is consistent with the full year adjusted ratio in the
mid-15s. Overall, we reported underwriting income of $66 million and a combined ratio of
96.7% for the fourth quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our underwriting income was $279
million with a combined ratio of 95.9%.
Net investment income was $96 million for the quarter, driven by the strong performance
from our fixed income portfolio attributable to an emphasis on longer spread duration
assets and our alternative investment portfolio driven by hedge funds. Overall for the
year, net investment income met our expectations as strong performance in the last three
quarters offset negative volatility in our hedge funds reported earlier in the year. In the
aggregate, the total return on our cash and investment portfolio for the quarter was
negative 1.1%, including foreign exchange movements or 0.8% – negative 0.8% excluding
foreign exchange.
The total return in the current quarter was primarily driven by unrealized losses on fixed
income securities as a result of the increase in the U.S. Treasury rates and the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the pound, sterling and the euro. For the year, our
total return on investments was 2.5%, including foreign exchange movements or 3%
excluding foreign exchange. The total return for the full year was primarily driven by
contributions from net investment income and unrealized gains as a result of the
tightening of credit spreads particularly in high yield and strong equity markets.
During the quarter, we issued $550 million of 5.5% Series E preferred shares and
repurchased $49 million of our 6.875% Series C preferred shares using a portion of the
net proceeds from the Series E issuance. We intend on using a portion of the remaining
net proceeds from the Series E preferred share offering to redeem the remaining $351
million of our Series C preferred shares outstanding. Until the redemption of our Series C
preferred shares in April, our preferred dividend expense will be temporarily elevated.

FINAL

During the quarter, we repurchased an additional $123 million worth of common shares
pursuant to our 2016 board authorized share repurchase program. In addition, we
announced the share repurchase authorization program of $1 billion of the company's
common shares effective January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. At February 1, 2017,
the remaining authorization under the repurchase program approved by our board of
directors was $975 million.
In conclusion, I'd like to reiterate our strong underwriting performance this quarter and to
note that we continue to make progress towards achieving and realizing the benefits of
the strategic goals we have discussed with you in prior quarters. Finally, I'd like to remind
you of the additional disclosure we introduced in our financial supplement last quarter,
relating to our activities with our strategic capital partners, which includes details of
premium ceded by our reinsurance segment to our strategic capital partners, as well as
details of fee income generated as a result of these arrangements.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Albert.

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Joe. Before opening up the call to questions, let me provide an update on
market pricing and our January 1 reinsurance renewals. As with the rest of the market,
we've observed continued pricing pressures in most lines and markets in the fourth
quarter. Although we are seeing both pockets of stabilizations, and increases were
warranted. The overall average price change for our insurance book was minus 2% in the
fourth quarter. This is a lesser decline than the negative 3% experienced in the third
quarter of 2016, and the fourth quarter of 2015. Consistent with prior quarters. The
greatest pressure is on catastrophe-exposed property and London-based global
specialty lines. Large accounts continue to be more competitive than smaller risks.
The U.S. property and casualty marketplace closed 2016 on a positive note for us. The
overall rate change for our U.S. division was up 3% in the fourth quarter. Casualty lines
continued on the path of positive rate movement, while property lines witnessed the
slowing of rate declines as compared to previous quarters. In property, we are seeing
glimpses of carriers taking corrective underwriting actions, which we hope will translate to
improving rates in 2017.
In our international division, we saw an overall rate change of minus 5% for the quarter,
which although disappointing, is a deceleration of market pressures. In London, too, we
are seeing the very first tentative signs of result to improve market rates. Energy,
property and aviation represented the most competitive conditions. But we are managing
our book carefully, reducing our business volume where necessary and increasing our
writings of smaller, less volatile risks. The aviation market, in particular, has shown some
encouraging signs of late, and many feel, we may be approaching a bottom.
In our professional lines division, overall rates declined 2% in line with the rate change
experience in the third quarter. Aggregate E&O rates were flat for the quarter, although

Page 7 of 20

FINAL

with some softening seen in excess cyber coverages. D&O lines declined 4% with primary
layers slightly down while excess and Side A experienced more significant declines.
As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, our resources and efforts are focused on
businesses where we have competitive strengths and feel the market offers us
opportunities for profitable growth. We continue to make great strides in our accident and
health business, growing strongly again, and reaching underwriting profitability in 2016.
And we are committed to building on that milestone in 2017. We continue to build our
resources to better serve our clients and partners in distribution, and are excited about
new opportunities to expand our footprint including our new office in Miami, which will
allow us to reach further into the Latin American market.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving on to Reinsurance. Our client-centric efforts at positioning AXIS Re as a more
relevant core reinsurer continue to bear fruit. Clients are increasingly consolidating panels
and differentiating between core reinsurers and secondary carriers from whom they are
prepared to opportunistically purchase coverage. And we are pleased with our enhanced
positioning. At January 1 renewals, we saw good submission flows across many lines and
markets. Although pricing continues to soften year-on-year, we were encouraged by
increased discipline from some competitors in certain lines and regions. The magnitudes
of price declines were generally lower across the reinsurance portfolio at January 1.
Government and non-governmental agencies are increasingly concluding that private
industry is the right partner for the transfer of risk which is a very positive trend for our
business. We also saw growth opportunities in motor, where clients are addressing
pressures from Solvency II. There was increased interest in combined programs
consolidating across similar lines of business and geographies, and we proactively work
with clients to find solutions in many cases. The January 1 period represents approximately
55% of our global reinsurance book excluding agriculture. We grew gross premiums by
approximately 10% on expiring business, although we expect that this will be somewhat
offset by increased sessions to our strategic capital partners in 2017.
We maintained our core discipline and focus on key relationships, looking for the best
deals with clients where we add value. We made some changes to our overall mix of
business to protect our profitability, including getting off certain programs. As we look
further into 2017, we will conservatively expand our reinsurance product and geographic
scope into areas like mortgage, floods, regional multiline, and using our Lloyd's Syndicate
to better serve our clients. Throughout our company, both insurance and reinsurance, new
initiatives and existing business alike will be approached with discipline, but we feel there
are still good profitable opportunities to pursue.
Our relationships with key partners and distributions are stronger than ever. And we are
increasingly confident of our ability to build well-balanced, profitable portfolios. We will
continue to expand our ability to match the right risk with the right capital and generate a
growing stream of attractive fee income to enhance our overall returns. In closing, I'm very
pleased with our progress across the organization in 2016. While our results do not yet
reflect the full benefits of the actions we have taken, and there is more work to do, our
team did a great job of driving our company forward, and I am excited about our
company's trajectory into 2017 and beyond.

With that, I would like to open up the call for questions. Operator?

Q&A

FINAL

Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Elyse
Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. First question, in terms of looking at the margins within the insurance
book, you saw a pretty strong improvement in the fourth quarter and also for the full year.
And you mentioned a couple of times kind of the benefit of mid-sized losses. Was it a
relatively low year in 2016 or a high year in 2015, and how do we kind of neutralize, I
guess, for the benefit that you might not expect going forward in 2017? I'm just trying to
get at – what kind of margin profile do you see on the underlying, just on the loss side for
the insurance book in 2017?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That's a fair question, Elyse. What I would say is that yes, 2015 did have, as we discussed
in that year, a higher frequency of energy losses, in particular, and certainly less so in 2016.
But although there were less events that affected us in 2016, I would say that it's more
than just luck. Part of the reasons that we have a lower number of large losses is that we
have changed the construction of our portfolios. We've reduced our limits available, we've
changed our reinsurance programs. And so, although we've had some losses, they have
affected us less in 2016 than they did in 2015. Our business will always have volatility of
large losses, but we believe that we've constructed our portfolios to be less vulnerable
than they were in the past.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then on the reinsurance side, you mentioned in your commentary some areas
that you're looking to expand in in 2017 like mortgage, flood, and a few other areas. What
does that do to the margin profile, as you go in that business, the margin profile of your
reinsurance book?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, it depends on each one of them. So if you look at the mortgage business, the flood
business, those tend to have generally lower technical ratios. And the regional multiline
business would tend to have more of an average technical ratio. Expanding by offering
our products into Lloyd's should have no impact.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Did you guys have any losses from the New Zealand earthquake in the quarter?

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

FINAL

Okay. And then one last question, in terms of the reserve development, what accident
years did the favorable development come from in the quarter?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Elyse, it's Joe. It really came from all accident years. If you want to characterize the
reinsurance development, prior year development, it came from all lines of business and
all accident years. And on the insurance side, it was almost all lines of business and most
accident years. So really across the whole spectrum. I can give you more specifics if you
want, but basically it's all accident years and all lines of business.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
The next question is from Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. A couple of questions. You had mentioned on the reinsurance side that
you did have some increase in agriculture-related losses. I guess, I'm wondering where
that happened, because it seems like the U.S. crop business was particularly good this
year?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Right. Jay, we actually had some adverse experience in our European book. We had one
large claim due to the French floods and droughts that occurred in that country. So for the
most part, our U.S. business was good as was the rest of the industry's, but we had a
large loss in Europe.

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Got it. That's helpful. And then on the G&A expense, where that did go up partly due to
some severance expense, those charges that you took, will that result in savings going
forward? And if so, I don't know if you can quantify it or not?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yeah. So let me give you some specifics here, Jay, on G&A because we thought we were
going to get that question. First, and let me say, that we will deliver by the end of 2017 on
the promise we made two years ago to eliminate $50 million worth of expenses, which
has and will help offset increases in other areas.

So, we had $25 million in what we call one-time or timing-related items in the fourth
quarter, and there were three major components. Severance, as Albert mentioned, most
of which related to the decision to redeploy capital to the E&S wholesale market. We
reduced staff in the fourth quarter, as a result. And that was about $9 million of the $25
million. I'd say that's more one-time. Share-based compensation, as we explained, part of
our restricted stock awards are paid out in cash; with a significant increase in our stock
price in Q4 that increased our expenses. That was $7 million and frankly, it was a catch-up
in the fourth quarter for the whole year. And then, third, we had performance-based
compensation. Our fourth quarter results caused us to increase our year-to-date
performance, which resulted in higher compensation there as well. So, that was a catch-up
adjustment as well. So, I'd say, severance was more one-time and the share-based
compensation and performance-based compensation were more catch-ups, and that was
about $4 million, if I didn't mention that.

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Great. That's really helpful. Thanks.

A - Joseph C. Henry

The next question is from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you, and good morning. First question, Albert, on the ROE profile for the business.
If you're looking back for the last three years, you made great progress basically shaping
the business portfolio and that's showing up in low volatilities. But on the other hand, the
underlying margin is actually – combined ratio shifted higher. And your ROE was like 12% in
2013 and now down to close to 8% in 2016. I just wonder is that business portfolio sort of
like at a steady state and what are the drivers for ROE improvement going forward?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Kai. I think that there are a couple of factors, one of which is the entire industry
suffered from lower investment income, so that's just part of the contributor. But focusing
on the portfolio, we're actually confident that the portfolio, although it might deliver
higher technical ratios with the mix that it has, it's a more capital-efficient portfolio and,
therefore, positive on the ROE. And certainly, when we look at our economic analysis, we
see that the portfolio in 2016 had a better RORAC than in 2015 and we certainly are
expecting that in 2017, it will have a better RORAC, return on risk adjusted capital than
2016.
So as far we're concerned, what matters is making the most efficient use of capital. We
believe that the changes that we have made are going to deliver improved RORAC. And
then separately, the quality of the underwriting has improved. And as I indicated in my
comments, we do not believe yet that our results fully reflect some of the changes that
Page 11 of 20



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td

Date: 2017-02-02

we have made. As you know, part of our reserving policy is to ensure that we give positive
indications time to mature before we reflect them in our reported loss ratios. And so, we
believe that further progress will be achieved in the loss ratios, which ultimately will reflect
in better ROEs going forward.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. And then, on the share repurchase, 2016 actually you returned more than you
earned, including some breakout fees for the PartnerRe deal. I just wonder, given that
your risk profile now is significantly reduced, what's your excess capital position? Can you
sustain a share buyback that's above your annual earnings?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Kai, as you know, we start our year assuming that we're going to give back to our
shareholders all of our operating income in the form of share repurchase and dividends,
and then we adjust up or down based on how the year develops and that continues to be
our expectation.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Do you have estimates of your current excess capital position?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We would not disclose our estimates of excess capital position.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Lastly on the U.S. tax reform, some argue that U.S. players' tax rate going
lower, and some global players tax rate could go higher. Do you think that could
potentially change your competitive position in the marketplace?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Kai, let me answer your question maybe a little bit differently than you asked it. First, with
respect to tax reform, it's early days, and I think it's very difficult to predict where tax
reform may go. As you would expect, we monitor closely all the proposals regarding tax
reform. With respect to the border adjustment proposals, which have gotten a lot of
attention in the last couple of weeks, the House Republican Blueprint for tax reform does
not provide much specificity as to how this adjustment would apply. So, with respect to
insurance and reinsurance companies, to me, it's unclear whether a U.S. cedent would be
considered to be importing a service or exporting a risk to a foreign reinsurer.
If it's viewed as an import, we support efforts to carve out financial service payments
including insurance and reinsurance payments from the border adjustment provisions. I'd
also note that this only applies to U.S.-sourced business, and we have a significant amount
of our business, which is sourced from outside of the United States. Against the backdrop
of a shifting landscape, we believe the flexibility built into our organizational structure with

Page 12 of 20



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td

investments and platforms such as Lloyd's will allow us to react reasonably nimbly to
legislative changes and to proactively optimize outcomes once we have more clarity.

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

And Kai, let me add. So I think Joe gave you a good view of how we look at the situation
right now and our preparedness to respond (37:51). But I also want to respond to one of
your comments which is how does this affect your competitive position. And I think there is
a difference between where we get our income, where we pay our taxes and our
competitive position. Our competitive position has been nothing but improved over the
last several years. We continue to focus on service, we continue to service to – on agility,
claims payments. Those things will not change. And as I said earlier, our relationship with
our producers and clients are as good as they've ever been. We will continue to do that.
And then, when we get some clarity around taxes and other factors, we will do what we
need to do to optimize results at that point.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's great. Thank you so much.

The next question is from Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Good morning.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

I guess the first question is kind of on capital philosophy and the new preferred issuance
that you did. I know, Joe, you said you're going to retire the Series C, but I believe you'd
still end up with a net increase in preferred equity and given the changes in the book to a
more capital-efficient profile, why do you need more capital?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

It's not that we need more capital, it's we want to have more efficient capital Charles.

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

As you know, one of the factors that we look at, is ensuring that we have a strong ratings
from the rating agencies because we think it's appropriate in our marketing. The rating
Page 13 of 20



FINAL

Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2017-02-02

agencies give full credit to a certain amount of perpetual preferred capital. So, if we're
going to get the same 100% credit for perpetual preferred shares that cost us $5.50,
versus our equity which has a higher cost of equity, we think we should maximize the
amount of that cheaper preferred shares. So, we will maximize the amount of preferred
shares that we can, where we get full credits point from the rating agencies and then, we
then manage our total capital. So it's not that we need more capital, as we've said, we've
bought back a lot of stock but we think that this allows us to replace equity with lesser
cost preferred equity.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Okay. And so I mean, that's what I was – maybe I didn't ask it properly is that, I thought
that due to the changes in the book, the total capital need because of the new capital
efficiencies of changing the portfolio and the reinsurance buying would have meant that
you just needed less equity, less shareholder equity in general for the book of business.
So, it wouldn't necessarily need to be replaced, but there will be a free up of capital due
to the restructuring of the overall portfolio.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I generally agree with what you're saying, which is why we've been able to return all of our
operating earnings while we've been growing the book and we will continue to manage
capital appropriately to balance capital efficiency on the one hand, but also, financial
strength and ratings on the other, and the opportunity for profitable growth where we
find it. So, it's a balancing act. We think that we have been very strong stewards of capital
and we will continue to pursue down that path.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Okay. I guess then on the insurance book or insurance business overall and how you think
about it going forward to generate the returns necessary. I mean, I guess if we're looking
down the road, one year, two years down the road, how do you view the contribution of
earnings in the insurance business relative to the reinsurance business as these changes
take place regarding underwriting and other? I mean, it's still overall higher contribution
from the reinsurance business. Do you expect that to maybe not parity but to get closer in
the future, or do you expect the relative contributions from the business to remain at their
current balance levels?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Charles, I would prefer to answer the question by saying that I have a very high level of
confidence that the profit contribution from insurance will increase over time as the
various actions that we have put in place start to be reflected through. Ultimately, as you
know, there's a fair amount of things that affect the contribution from one area or the
other, the location of cats and so on and so forth. But what I can tell you is that, the team
is very committed to delivering stronger financial returns, and my expectation is that we
would have stronger returns coming out of the insurance book.

Okay. And then just finally on the strategic partners and the cede that you've done from
the reinsurance side, and I believe there's also a cede from the insurance side that's not
included in the disclosure in the supplement. But I guess, I'm just trying to get a better
understanding of what's your thoughts or what's the full scope of what can be ceded,
provided, when you think about how you use those facilities and those partnerships? It's a
couple of $100 million here, can it be a multiple of that or is it mostly there? I'm just trying
to understand to what level that can get over – not even necessary 2017, over a multi-year
period.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Charles, that's an excellent question and from our perspective, strategic capital
partnerships are really about funding the totality of our portfolios. It's not necessarily
limited to the cat business or to liability business on the reinsurance side. It's really about
getting into partnerships with investors who have an appetite and we've got a broad
range of products and we're happy to share anyone of those products with them. So as
we walk down this path with our capital partners, we would be very happy to continue to
cede to them any kind of insurance business, A&H business, reinsurance business that fits
their appetite.
From my perspective, I see nothing wrong with growing the top line of this company and
having a greater proportion of our risks shared with strategic capital partners. Because I
believe that that is the best way to manage an insurance and reinsurance company in this
market. If we have the capital available to us, we can do more for our clients and our
partners in distribution. We've got knowledgeable strategic partners who are willing to
work with us and accept risk. And we have the ability to earn fees to enhance our capital
efficiency and improve our ROE. So you should expect us to continue our efforts to gather
and garner more third-party capital and to creatively find structures where we can share
more risk with third-party capital. We think that is the right way to go.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

And how should we think about the fee component of that relative to an earnings
perspective. How much is expense offset versus profitability – to get a handle on what – if
I think of this growing over time from a $22 million fee in 2016 to $40 million in 2017, how is
that contribution from an earnings versus just an offset of expenses that are currently
undergoing in your business? I'm just trying to get some...

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Right. That's fair. Joe, I think you could confirm that, but I believe that we've estimated
that about two-thirds of the fees...

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Two-thirds. Yeah.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Page 15 of 20



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td

...go to offset G&A. There's obviously some profit in that too, but from an accounting
perspective, those go to offset G&A, and then one-third of the fees will end up in other
income because they reflect profit contributions and other forms of revenues that don't
properly offset G&A.

The next question is from Brian Meredith of UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks. A couple of questions here for you. The first one, Albert, could you talk
about your exposure to the potential changes in the Ogden discount rates?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Sure. So some people in the investment community may not be familiar with them, but in
the UK, there is a methodology to calculate lump sum payments for large claims and the
Ogden discount rates are utilized for that. The Ogden discount rates are currently
approximately 2%, and there's talk that the Chancellor will reduce those rates. Obviously,
if you reduce those rates, that would make the lump sum payment higher. So it only
affects one small part of our overall book of business, and that's the motor book.
What I will say is that – as I hope you already know from the discussions we've had with
the way we set reserves, we prudently set reserves with conservative assumptions with
regard to a number of areas, and they are set with the expectations that not every trend
that we have in place will continue. And so, we set our reserves to be able to absorb
unexpected changes, whether they be frequency, severity, or discount changes. We are
comfortable, at this point in time, that our reserves can properly reflect the risk of lower
Ogden rates.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. Could you give a general sense of how much of your reserves would be
exposed to it? Because I completely agree that you guys set reserves very conservatively,
but it could impact the magnitude of favorable development actually going forward given
the discount rates.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I appreciate that. What I would suggest is that we wait until we find out what the Ogden
rates are, and then we can provide you with more specificity. At this point in time, we
Page 16 of 20

would just be guessing, and I'm not sure that's helpful.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then Albert, next question, could you give us some views on kind of
what you're seeing with respect to loss trend? I mean, a couple of companies have
purchased adverse development covers, and kind of thinking about that is that maybe
some fear that loss trend is starting to pick up. Are you seeing that?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, they're certainly picking up in certain lines. I mean, you've heard about motor liability
trends going up. You've heard about passenger motor liability. We don't do any real
motor business in the U.S., so that's not affecting us. And you've also seen in the D&O
world a significant increase in D&O cases. So that's the industry. I'm pleased to say that, in
our book, we've been following our book in great detail for a number of years, and we
have taken action where we needed to, when we needed to. And not to necessarily
repeat some of these issues, but we addressed the D&O book back in 2013, and we
discussed those issues with you. And I'm pleased to say that notwithstanding the fact that
class action claims are at probably the highest level they've been in a long time, our
participation in those claims is as low as it's ever been.
And that speaks to the construct of our book. We've always been cautious about motor
liability, and so we do not have a large net exposure to motor liability. Although, today, we
are taking advantage of the opportunities that are coming out of motor liability. With
regard to some of the casualty claims, you heard that last year, we got out of excess
casualty globally, not in the U.S. but in the global facilities. So I think that we were, to-date,
quite good at reacting to the early signs and have been shifting our book such that we
feel very good about where our book is, and we do not have any of the concerns today
that have been expressed by others.

Q - Brian Meredith

The next question is from Meyer Shields of KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. Two questions, if I can. First, setting aside the impact of rates and trends – the
project of shifting your business mix to lower volatility and higher capital return lines, is
that impact – specifically on the loss ratio, is that basically done?

Page 17 of 20



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I'm sorry. Can you expand on your question? I want to make sure that I understand and
respond to what you're looking for.

FINAL

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Yeah. So, as I understand it, one of the major projects of the past few years was to focus
on lines of business with both less volatility and maybe smaller margins because the
overall returns on capital were better. So that seems to have worked, but it does imply
lower technical margins compared to the proceeding book and I'm wondering whether
that business mix shift has basically played out.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right. Yeah. The answer to that is generally yes, but what I would say is that it's not simply
a mix from a short tail or a catastrophe line to a longer tail or a general liability line.
Certainly, we've done that. But the real hard work has actually been in shifting the way we
put risks into each of these individual portfolios. So let me give you an example. We're still
very strong participants in the energy world. And that is very good business, but we've
changed the way that we're building our portfolios. We've grown; we're now a very large
leader in the renewable energy work and doing less on the marine side.
We're taking smaller limits which, again, reduces the volatility. So none of those things
affect, if you would, the gross line-by-line change in technical ratio. Same thing in property.
We still write a lot of property, but we've done a lot of work in terms of our risk selection,
in terms of managing micro zonal concentrations and so on. So I don't want to leave you
with the impression that we've given up on low technical ratio, volatile lines and shifted
the book entirely into long-tail lines. It's been a combination of that shift, yes of course,
but also some significant improvement in the way that we are selecting risk and building
our portfolios. And that has gone very well and will continue.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. That's very helpful. Second question, and this is really naive. If there is a change in
U.S. tax rates – or let me ask this differently. How much global reinsurance demand reflects
arbitraging difference in tax rates between, let's say, the U.S. and Bermuda?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

There are different views on that one, Meyer. I don't know how to answer it because when
you're – when we're doing business in the U.S., we charge the same rates as U.S.-based
reinsurers. So how do you respond to your question? I think that it's a market clearing
price as you know. And so, the market clearing price is not necessarily set by people who
have one tax rate or people who have a different kind of tax rate. There's a discovery
process. I think as we see the tax environment changing, we're obviously going to see
how different companies react and we will do whatever we need to do at that point in
time to optimize our portfolio.

seeing in the market relative to your portfolio yield on the fixed income side?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yeah. The new money yield is about 2.8%, Jay. So it spiked up actually in the third and
fourth quarter. We have built in frankly some rate increases into our 2017 plan. So this is
not necessarily going to dramatically change what we forecast at our income to be going
