Presentation
Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. This is Gianandrea Roberti. I'm Head of Investor Relations of
Tryg. We published our Q3 results earlier on this morning, and I have here with me
Morten Hubbe, the Group CEO and Barbara Plucnar Jensen, Group CFO, to present the
ﬁgures. Over to you, Mort.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Gian and good morning to all of you. And we start oﬀ on Slide Number 3 with
the ﬁnancial highlights of the quarter. We reported Q3 pre-tax result of DKK779 million,
slightly lower than last year's DKK825 million, positively impacted by the core business,
where the technical result of DKK870 million is up 14.3% compared to the same quarter
last year, and negatively impacted by the capital markets movements, resulting in an
overall investment loss for the quarter. Quarterly dividend of DKK1.7 per share is
announced and a solvency ratio of 169.
If you look at the technical result of DKK870 million, it's driven by a stable combined ratio
of 84.4%. This includes large and weather claims weighing for 3.3% compared to 6.8% last
year, while on the other hand, run-oﬀ gains were lower at 5% compared to 8.7% in the
same quarter last year.

More importantly, the underlying claims ratio continues to improve, 70 basis points for
Private and 60 basis points for the Group, while the expense ratio was ﬂat at 13.9% for the
quarter, despite very signiﬁcant investments in IT development. We continue to expect
the full year underlying claims ratio, which will be better than last year's underlying. The
investment result of minus DKK29 million is actually split in good returns on nearly all
asset classes in the free portfolio and a loss on the match portfolio after a quarter that saw
a lot of volatility, particularly at the long end of the interest rate curve and also movements
in other ﬁnancial income and expenses, broadly in line with guidance, but perhaps we
can elaborate on the moving parts in Other.
If we look at Slide 4 on customer highlights, we're very satisﬁed to see that we continue to
improve in this area. Customer targets might seem soft, but there is a very strong link to
customer loyalty and retention, and thereby a very strong link to expense ratio and
earnings. This quarter, we are particularly pleased to see a continued improvement in
retention rate, not only in Denmark where we have the support of the bonus scheme, but
also in Norway. Of course, we continue to see a good help from the bonus scheme in
Denmark. You can see that particularly the non-customer knowledge of the membership
bonus scheme continues to improve. In Q3, it's up almost 40%, but bear in mind, still only
29% now of the non-customers in Denmark realize that we have this bonus scheme. So
there is further room for improvement.
On Slide 5, we elaborate on the composition of the technical results. Clearly, the overall
technical result has improved due to the inclusion of Alka business, but also the improved
underlying claims ratio. The Private segment, of course, being the largest, helped by the
inclusion of Alka, but also a strong, continuous improvement in the underlying claims.
Bear in mind that it is in the Private segment that we see a very high growth in the quarter,
as we've seen in previous quarters, but now helped more by Private Norway as well. And
bear in mind that this is our most proﬁtable segment, which actually improves further the
business mix for Tryg, and overall improve proﬁtability and return on capital longer term.
Be aware that the total run-oﬀ on Private lines is approximately 5 percentage points lower
than the same quarter last year.
In Corporate, we saw an underlying improvement, primarily based on price initiatives in
Norway. But in our view, we still have to signiﬁcantly improve proﬁtability in all three
countries for our Corporate business. We have started well with price increases of 14% in
Corporate Norway this year. We need that to continue and these include Corporate
Denmark and Corporate Sweden in further improving, particularly underwriting year
proﬁtability before run-oﬀs. In Private Sweden, we've initiated proﬁtability initiatives to
mitigate that motor claims inﬂation that's slightly too high, but it does take some time to
get the full impact of that.
On Slide 6, we elaborate on the synergies of Alka. Alka is doing extremely well. We see in
the third quarter DKK23 million of synergies from the Alka integration and for the three
quarters now in total, we've reached DKK66 million out of the DKK75 million promised
synergies for the full year. Roughly half of the synergies are related to costs. And as you
may recall, this is in line with our expectations that these cost synergies will show up in the
P&L ﬁrst. But the largest synergy driver remains the claims area, but it does require
harmonization of processes and routines.

FINAL

You may recall that we started on capitalizing the agreements we have with motor repair
shops in Tryg. That is moving along nicely. And now we're moving on to the agreement
that Tryg has with craftsmen, which will particularly improve property claims and we will
see that in the coming periods. We remain conﬁdent in our ability to achieve the 2021
synergy targets, and in general are very satisﬁed with the process of integration.
On Slide 7, on shareholders' remuneration, our focus here remains extremely high. We are
announcing a third quarter dividend per share of DKK1.7, in line with the previous quarters
this year, and in line with having a policy of ﬂat quarterly dividend throughout the year.
Our business continues to produce very strong proﬁtability. And of course, the overall low
growth implies limited increase in capital requirements. And then you should bear in
mind that we are quite deliberate in growing our Private lines and SME businesses, as
these are areas where we have the highest proﬁtability, but lowest capital requirement.
And overall, that change of mix also reduced in Corporate, will produce an even stronger
and more healthy business mix and stronger capital returns.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we jump to Slide 9, we elaborate slightly on the split of growth. Organic growth,
excluding Alka, was 6.8%, clearly higher than usual and carried by growth in all areas. We
do prefer to grow in the Private segment, where proﬁtability is the highest. And we are
quite satisﬁed that Private Nordic has a growth of 8.6%, excluding Alka. Commercial was
helped by Alka and had a growth, excluding Alka, of 4.8%, partly driven by improved
retention rates, which we saw in Private lines as well, a small net inﬂow of customers, but
also we are starting to see price initiatives in Commercial Norway to improve proﬁtability.
The last is a trend that we expect to continue in the coming periods as we further want to
improve proﬁtability in Commercial Norway.
Corporate showed a growth of 4.5%. There is, of course, a high impact from price hikes in
Norway Corporate, where price hikes so far this year has been 14%. As a result, we've also
seen some reduction in the portfolio, that is to be expected and to be accepted. In
Denmark, of course, the renewal rates are high, helped by the membership bonus, but we
do see in the coming periods a necessity that we want to improve further pricing and
proﬁtability also in Corporate Denmark and Corporate Sweden. And we do expect some
impact in the top-line growth of the entire Corporate area in 2020, due to higher
proﬁtability initiatives in the coming period.
Sweden showed a relatively high growth, driven primarily by pet insurance and accident
insurance. We see, as mentioned, that motor insurance, the proﬁtability is not quite where
it should be. So we are pushing through initiatives that might reduce the Swedish growth
going forward.
On Slide 10, we show the normal ﬁgures on price increases, and clearly adjusting prices in
accordance with inﬂation continues to be extremely important and we have further
tightened our close monitoring to see all developments as -- at as -- early stage as
possible. Proﬁtability initiatives are, of course, often price, but also combined with a
number of claims initiatives to further improve earnings in several areas.

FINAL

The development on Slide 11 on customer retention rates is very positive. Clearly,
extremely important, not only for a customer experience point of view, but also from a
quality and earnings point of view. And actually customers' view of Tryg is best monitored
through the retention rates. So very pleased to see the positive development in Q3
compared to same period last year for all areas. Clearly, Denmark is helped by the bonus
model and continues to improve, but also actually we see continued improvement in
Norway without the bonus model.
And over to you Barbara on claims.

Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Thank you very much Morten. Let's move to Slide Number 13 for more details on the
development in our claims ratio. In Q3, we saw a continuation of an improved underlying
claims trend. The Group's underlying claims ratio improved by 60 basis points, Private by
70 basis points. Please note that all the quarterly ﬁgures for 2018 have been adjusted to
include Alka.

Bloomberg Transcript

Price adjustments and the claims excellence program, including claims synergies related
to Alka are the main drivers behind the improvement, but also the rebalancing that
Morten spoke about of the portfolio to its more Private business supports the overall
improvement for the Group. Tryg expects the improvement in the underlying claims ratio
to continue for the rest of 2019 and into 2020.
Please turn to Slide 14 for the large claims and weather claims. When it comes to Q3, it
was a very benign quarter in terms of (inaudible) claims with only DKK46 million
compared to DKK228 million in the third quarter of 2018. The opposite was true for the
weather claims, which were much higher in Q3 '19 compared to Q3 '18, which was mainly
due to cloudbursts in Norway. The discounting impact in Q3 '19 was much lower than the
same period prior year, given the much lower interest rate level in Q3, 2019 across all
countries.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

That is perhaps an area where everyone should be aware and look into the numbers,
because really the change for the quarter is quite steep.

Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Exactly. The run-oﬀ result was much lower with 5% of the combined ratio compared to
8.7% in the same quarter last year, primarily due to a lower run-oﬀ in the Private business.
Please turn to Slide 15. Here you can see the development in the expense ratio, where you
can see that for Q3 '19, it was stable at 13.9%, which is in line with our guidance of an
expense ratio of approximately 14%. The underlying dynamic continues to be that an
improved eﬃciency should support our investments in digital solutions, which is
important for us to maintain the momentum and be ready for the future.

FINAL

Recently, we saw an increase in the number of FTEs. This was primarily reﬂecting
continued insourcing of our claims handling related to the health insurance in Denmark
and continued expansion of the Guarantee business in Germany. As a reminder, the jump
in the number of employees from 17 to 18 is of course driven by the inclusion of Alka.
Please turn to Slide 17 for an update on our investment capital and target. This slide
should be well known. We show the split between the match portfolio of DKK30 billion
and the free portfolio of approximately DKK11 billion. Asset allocation on the free portfolio
is roughly unchanged, apart from small adjustments in the ﬁxed income portfolio.
However, for the development in the two portfolios, we should look at Slide Number 18.
The third quarter of this year was again a very, very volatile quarter, where we saw a lot of
impact from the movements in the ﬁnancial markets. The overall investment result was a
loss of DKK29 million, split [ph] between a positive result on the free portfolio of DKK97
million, a loss of DKK69 million on the match portfolio and other ﬁnancial income and
expenses at DKK57 million, in line with the broader expectations.

Bloomberg Transcript

The free portfolio produced good performance across all asset classes, while positive
ﬁxed income returns were the key driver this quarter due to the falling interest rates. The
match portfolio produced a loss, which was primarily driven by the regulatory deviation,
which turned negative in the quarter that experienced a sharply increased volatility intraquarter, especially if you look at mid-July to mid-August, where swap rates for 20-year
maturities moved sharply for all the relevant currencies, so Danish kroner, Norwegian
kroner and Swedish kroner. And just looking at the Danish 20-year swap, it was down 70
basis points, which has only recovered modestly in the last part of the quarter.
At times of such big movements, the sensitivity of the interest rate risk in long-dated
liabilities may change more of the corresponding sensitivities of the assets. And this drove
the negative result in our latest quarter. When it comes to the other ﬁnancial income and
expenses, this was in line with our expectations, where roughly half of this amount is
driven by interest expenses on our loans.
On Slide 19, you can see an overview of our solvency position. At the end of Q3, the
solvency ratio was 169 compared to 171 at the end of the second quarter. Own funds were
broadly ﬂat, as the net proﬁt was oﬀset by the dividend payment and by an actuarial loss
on pension obligations booked under OCI due to the falling interest rates in Norway.
The SCR was slightly up, driven by increased market risk, again, impacted by slightly
increased duration in the Corporate bond portfolio and a small increase in the insurance
risk, driven by the favorable topline development.
Please turn to Slide 20. This is a limited -- or a slide with limited amount of new
information. And I think the most important highlight on this slide is that, as we have
talked about previously, we have currently more or less fully utilized our Tier 1 and Tier 2
capacity. More importantly, on Slide Number 21, you will see the sensitivities to our
solvency ratio. This is very similar to what you have seen in previous quarters. And again,
the biggest sensitivity is to the covered bond spread, which should not surprise anyone as
Page 5 of 21



Company Name: Tryg A/S

covered bonds are our largest asset class by far in the total investment portfolio.
Sensitivities to equities and interest rate movements are relatively low.

FINAL

Please turn to Slide 22 for our targets and our outlook. We will conclude this presentation
by repeating our well-known ﬁnancial targets for 2020. We repeat that we remain
conﬁdent that we can deliver a technical result of DKK3.3 billion, a combined ratio at or
below 86%, an expense ratio around 14%, and ﬁnally an ROE at or above 21%.
Moving towards 2020, our Private and Commercial segments are likely to continue to
show a good top-line development, while Group growth is likely to be negatively
impacted by the proﬁtability actions across the entire Corporate segment, which Morten
also mentioned earlier in this presentation.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I'm glad to repeat here Barbara that those initiatives will be stronger across all three
countries than this year, where it was primarily Norway.

Bloomberg Transcript

Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yeah, exactly. In general, the lower level of interest rate is making our life harder as we
discount the claims reserves, which are much lower rate compared to just a few months
ago. Just to give you a few proof points of that. We were looking at 0.5% at the end of Q3
'19 versus 1.3% at the end of Q3 '18. This creates an important headwind to us, but we
expect to be able to mitigate this by the additional work and proﬁtability initiatives that we
have in place, and therefore, our DKK3.3 billion technical result guidance for 2020 is
ﬁrmly repeated.
With that, I think I can refer to our favorite quote from John D. Rockefeller and open up for
our Q&A session.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Asbjorn Mork
of Danske Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Good morning from my side. If I may refer to your favorite quote from Rockefeller, if I look
at the solvency ratio for Q3, 169, of course, slightly lower Q-over-Q. Now it's not so far, so
you need to look at extraordinary dividend potential for the full year. So I was just
wondering if you could give us any ﬂavor on how do you look at the capacity to pay an
extraordinary dividend at the year-end, also considering that you've utilized your Tier 1
and 2 capacity. Thanks.

FINAL

Morning Asbjorn. As you know, we don't guide on the extraordinary dividends. And I
would be disappointed if we didn't get the question, but we still don't guide on
extraordinary dividends. But clearly on a serious note, we will of course take a careful look
at our solvency position at year-end. And together with that look at our internal forecast
for the coming periods, both of earnings and on capital consumption.
If we do accumulate too much equity, it does cause problems for our 21% post-tax ROE
target. So we don't have an interest in that. And then also bear in mind that compared to
where we start now, we still see that we are in the process of getting Sweden into our
internal model, which is a longer-term positive driver, where we're not completely in
control of the timing because it needs to be approved by the FSA. Bear in mind also that
the business mix we're working on between Private lines and Corporate lines, longer
term, will have a signiﬁcant impact on the solvency and dividend capacity. But all in all, I
can assure you we will return to the matter after carefully taking a look at all of those
issues.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

So if I understand you correct, Morten, it means that you would not have any issues being
slightly below whatever your actual solvency target is for the short term if you can see a
steady progress for mid-term?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

That was a cheeky variation of the question, Asbjorn. As you know, we don't have an
explicit solvency ratio target, but what I did say and where you are right, is of course, for
us, it's not just a matter of a one-second picture of the world, for us, it's a matter of making
sure that we have a long term healthy view on the development on the business mix, the
capital consumption, the earnings capacity and the dividend capacity. And, of course, we
do take a longer term view on that because we are in this for the longer run.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay, fair enough. If I may ask on your actual underwriting, the 60 basis points underlying
claims improvement in Q3, of course very nice time to get that when you get the low rates
hitting your underwriting as well. Is this sort of the level that we should expect you to run
at going forward? I mean now that you have turned your business -- turning your business
to more private-oriented growth area. So should we expect your Q2 -- the next couple of
quarters beat your 30 basis points to 50 basis points guidance? And is this solely your
own operations, or is it a matter of pricing discipline in the market given the low rates?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, I guess you can say that with 60 basis points and the 70 basis points, we are slightly
higher than normal. And I would be cautious just to assume that that then continues for all
of the quarters going forward. There is no doubt that we do see a longer-term trend of
continuing to improve underlying claims. We do see areas where Corporate should be
able to contribute more, because I guess we have been through a long period now where

Page 7 of 21



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2019-10-10

FINAL

Private lines have delivered most of the improvement and Corporate lines has been
behind the curve. Corporate lines should improve more.
We have seen that Alka and the processes around Alka also helps the underlying
development. And to be honest, for us, we see underneath a -- the Group-wide
underlying development, which is positive. Lots of pockets that are either better or worse
than what you see on the reported total entity. So we think the -- we've slided on the
higher side this quarter. So don't just assume that, but there are lots of pockets we can
continue to further improve, and the composition of those pockets will change over time.
And this is an area where we spend a lot of our time, because it creates a lot of value.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay, fair enough. On the growth side, in Q3, especially within the Private lines, the 8.6%,
it doesn't seem that that actually is coming from the Danske Bank agreement, which I
guess is starting slowly to get some sort of traction. So is that correctly understood, this is
your -- more or less solely your current agreements that you have that is driving this
growth? And should we expect that then to potentially continue to 2020 and then when
you get the next material distribution agreement, this really kicking oﬀ?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

To a large extent you are correct, but if you look at the actual movements on the portfolio
day-to-day at the moment, which comes prior to the earned premium, we do see now that
we get portfolio growth from both Danske and Nordea at the same time for a short period
of time. That will of course stop as the agreement with Nordea stops and they start
cooperating with their new partner. And I guess, we should expect also some more laps
from the Nordea portfolio as that portfolio gets no new customers and potentially more
activity from a new Nordea partner.
So you're right that there is limited impact from Danske in the earned premium numbers
for the quarter. We see a positive development in the portfolio numbers, but we will get
some more headwind from the Nordea portfolio moving onwards.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay, fair enough. And then...

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

So Asbjorn what we should focus on is the other growth drivers that you see in Private
right now, which is very much down to the product innovation that continues. Remember,
over the last 18 months, we have launched around 60 products in this time span. You see
you can, say, cross-sell and up-sell to existing customers with very high retention at the
moment. So there is a number of growth drivers other than the partnerships as well.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And elaborating on that Asbjorn, I still think we see a slight improvement that Norway
pulls some of the product growth weight, but the reality is that the main pullback comes
Page 8 of 21



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2019-10-10

from Private lines Denmark. And we are working very hard to export that to both Private
lines Norway and Commercial lines Denmark and Norway. And these areas are starting to
wake up from a product expansion point of view, but the majority of that potential is
ahead of us and not behind us.

FINAL

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay. I guess that brings me to my ﬁnal question, because if I look at the development in
Q3 and the communication that you have on improvement potential going forward, the
fact that you're able to mitigate most of your headwind from lower rates in Q3 and the
fact that you get higher synergies from Alka already now and another at least DKK75
million for next year, it looks like you're still -- even with low rates, you're still on your way
to beat your guidance for next year, the DKK3.3 billion with some margin. Isn't that the
case?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think there is a good chance that we will meet the target. But what you forget in that
equation is the messaging we gave around the Corporate segment. On the Corporate
segment, we see that there is a need for us to continue to work not only with, you can say,
the risk assessment and the work on prevention with the large customers, but in particular
also with price increases. And we know that will have an impact on the top line for this
particular segment. So yes, you can say when you see a positive trend in the Private and
also starting to be in the Commercial segment, that should be counterweighed by the
actions that we're taking on the Corporate segment.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And then we'll see -- I guess we did not have in our plans that the discount rates would fall
as much as they did this quarter. That does create more work for us. Will we be able to
mitigate that? Yes, that is clearly the plan. We do also see that we need to be able to
handle larger amounts of large claims than we've seen in this quarter, for instance. And
then we do see that in time the run-oﬀ gains will stabilize at a slightly lower level than
what we've seen historically. So just make sure that you don't count all of the positives and
no negatives when you try to do the math. Our signaling is that we have a high target of
DKK3.3 billion. We will deliver that target also with lower discount rates, but we're not
signaling any strong over-performance to that target.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

All right, fair enough. That's all from my side. Thanks a lot.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mads Thinggaard of ABG. Please go

Yeah, hi, this is Mads from ABG. Thank you for taking my questions. The ﬁrst one is going
a bit back to what Asbjorn discussed about premium growth before. Could you -- I mean,
now you are kind of -- you're rolling out I guess the price initiatives in the Corporate
segment from Norway to Sweden and Denmark. Could you put a bit of light on if that is
already not 2020, but Q4, that we could see an eﬀect there? And also on the very high
Private premium growth, you are talking about pluses and minuses, but what about -- I
mean what kind of potential is left in the portfolios, where you are cross-selling from
(inaudible)? I mean have you come to a point where we will -- we actually could see, I
mean, less potential lift, meaning a lower run rate of the organic Private premium growth?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, I guess if you take the ﬁrst question, ﬁrst Mads that -- I don't think you should expect
any impact from Corporate in Q4. Q4 is not a very big renewal season for corporates. The
biggest renewal season is clearly Q1. So a lot of the changes will happen starting from Q1.
So it is going on with the customers now. Both from a reporting and P&L point of view, Q1
is really the ﬁrst quarter where you will see some of that impact.
I think from a penetration point of view in Private lines, if I were to look at our growth for
2020, I would clearly include a negative impact from Corporate. I think the Norwegian
Corporate book is down a bit more than 4%. This year, we will see some similar impacts in
Corporate Sweden and Denmark, but as regards Private, as you asked about, I don't really
see that -- that pocket is emptying anytime soon. We see that NITO is growing
signiﬁcantly. We see that OBOS continues to grow signiﬁcantly. We're actually now testing
-- as Alka is selling more than 40% online and a lot of the online sales is single product,
we are testing to use franchise concepts and other concepts to contact the single product
customers in Alka to add more products to the portfolio with very strong success, but it's
very early days.
We are also seeing that the rollout of taking some more of the Private lines product ideas
to Norway is really not very far in the process. We see that Commercial lines has almost
not begun. And if you do the Private lines Denmark, where we've come the furthest, we
have still only sold new products to the customers that are either new customers or
coincidentally are in contact with us on the phone. We have still not found a way of rolling
out the new products to the broad portfolio of existing customers. Not exactly easy, but it
means that all of these examples are areas where we see lots of potential to continue to
work with the new products. So for us that work has not stopped in any way. That is
something we will spend a lot of time on in the further coming years.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. I get it. So Private is still -- actually not that much of headwinds for Private
currently. So -- yes, then my second question is on -- I mean on other income and costs. I
mean it is minus DKK62 million this quarter and of course, there's goodwill component in
there, but probably not changed. I mean what are the moving parts here? Is this I mean
before your deal with Danske gets fully up and running that you have a -- a kind of more
of a drag from that or could you explain a bit how that works?

FINAL

Well, you're deﬁnitely touching the right parameters there Mads. The two biggest
components of the movement in this quarter is of course the goodwill related to Alka,
which is around DKK32 million, and then obviously, we don't have the income from the
Nordea agreement that we used to have. Right now, we are building the Danske
collaboration. So you can say that is impacting us in this quarter.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Okay. And then, I mean it is not like that it's portfolio based, but it's more new sales
based, this one. So it comes back relatively quickly. How do you expect that to...

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

You're right that it is more new sales based than it is portfolio based. So you're right, but it
does come back. In my experience, saying fast and new partnership in the same equation
is often not clever. So it does take some quarters to get back to the level. And of course,
we are also looking at when is the rebuilds that income becomes the same, and when is
the rebuild that some of the costs need to be lower. And we do look at a combination of
both to get to the right balance again. So I would expect a few quarters before we are
where -- at least before we are where we should be.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonny Urwin at UBS. Please go
ahead, your line is open.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi there, good morning. Just two from me, please. So ﬁrstly, where is pricing running
roughly in aggregate across the whole book and where is claims inﬂation? It sounds like
you're just calling out a bit more claims inﬂation activity in places, obviously Sweden in
particular.
Secondly on Corporate. So I guess the language is more negative today around remedial
action versus the language in the second quarter. What exactly are you planning for the
reshaping of that book next year? Are there any lines of business in focus, and just any
more detail there would be great. Thank you.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I think if we start with the Corporate segment and the actions planned, obviously, those
are large customers and we look at every individual customer looking at what products do
they have, what is the risk proﬁle and so forth. So it will be looking at a combination of
price adjustments to reﬂect inﬂation movements to inﬂect the risk proﬁle of the individual
customers, etc., etc. So it's a quite thorough work that is going on and it's not to say that
it's one size ﬁts all, because that doesn't ﬁt with a segment like that.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I guess we can elaborate slightly further joining on that and say that it's only natural that
we took the ﬁrst step in Norway, because Norway was clearly the biggest part of the
Corporate challenge. I think we should be quite satisﬁed with 14% so far this year in
Corporate Norway, but more structurally, we have reduced our exposure to ﬁsh farming in
Norway quite dramatically. We have also reduced our exposure to commercial buses
quite dramatically. Out of Sweden, we are reducing our exposure to international liability
quite signiﬁcantly, particularly the exposure to US liability out of Sweden has been a
challenge and continues to be a challenge. A lot of Swedish corporates have activity in
the US, but liability lawsuits, etc. in the US, even small from a Swedish entity, are just a
nightmare. But also larger commercial vehicles in Sweden we are more or less exiting
completely. But I guess when you look at all three countries and now particularly Denmark
and Sweden, the main challenge is really that the pricing component that goes to large
claims exposure is not strong enough, and it means that when you have large property
claims and you have the large liability claims, the return on capital simply becomes too
low.
And when we see that in combination with an ability to grow the retail business with
much, much higher capital returns, we do see that it makes a ton of sense for us to reduce
the exposure to large claims and volatile areas in Corporate, so average pricing up, most
large claims exposed to lines down and then an acceptance of lower top line and then
rather shift more the weight of the portfolio to Private and SME, which is performing and
growing extremely well.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Makes sense.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I guess when it comes to pricing, there is a general -- I mean, I guess you asked the
question in a shape that doesn't really concur with the way we manage it, because I guess
the overall answer is that we're always 0.5 point, 1 percentage point above perceived
inﬂation. Perceived inﬂation is, in those periods, higher in Norway than in Denmark,
higher in the craftsmen-related products, more stable in Sweden. But Sweden is higher in
motor, but what we have -- the way we handle it is actually that we are in every business
segment, in every single line of business, we have work to further and further and further
improve the group of people across procurement, across claims, across actuarial and
across product development that monitors all of the small bits and pieces moving every
month, so that we see actual developments as fast as possible and react as fast as
possible. And there are sales in this area where price increases are 20% or 25%.
So I guess we are moving further and further away from the just broad price changes to
much, much more accurate price changes and all the time targeting that those are slightly
higher than the inﬂation we see. So I think we are becoming more sophisticated in that
area, but it is an area I think we can further develop in the coming years.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jakob Brink of Nordea. Please
go ahead, your line is open.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Three questions please. The ﬁrst one, I think you said Morten that
Norwegian Corporate premiums were down 4%. I don't know if I heard that correctly. But
if you could then maybe also tell us what has happened to technical proﬁt on Corporate
Norway in the same period?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And as a ﬁrst question, I think we look at it -- you're right to get the speciﬁcs. Pricing in
Corporate Norway is up 14%, a bit more than 14% actually. Total volume, including the
price increases, is down 4%. We look at it on a reported level and on a risk ratio level
where we sort of normalize large claims, etc. to see the actual quality of the book. We are
seeing in almost all lines that the risk ratios are dropping well. We still have two, three
lines of business in Norway where the actual claims inﬂation continues to be even higher
than this price increase. And then we have still had large claims in Corporate Norway,
particularly in the beginning of '19. I guess, Q3 in general is quite benign from a
Corporate large claims point of view, but a single quarter's reported earnings in
Corporate really doesn't tell you anything about the quality. And the reality is, if you look
across all three countries, and if you look at underwriting year proﬁts with a -- or
combined ratio with a normalized large claims level, we are at combined ratios at or
above 100%. And Norway is actually the worst of the three. So we are still at above 100%
levels if you take out the one-oﬀ gains and if you normalize large claims. So risk ratios are
improving, but I mean not enough yet.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay. And just to follow up on that, so in Denmark and Sweden, do you expect sort of -- I
guess you said that actually. So you expect sort of the same reaction on volumes, 4%
down, or is worse [ph]?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

That's a very good question Jakob, because the reality is that in Norway the price
reductions, to begin with, were much bigger, and I guess Protector [ph] was a lot of -played a big role in driving that (Technical Diﬃculty]. I think there's been a strong
acceptance amongst customers and brokers that this was necessary to improve. I think in
Sweden and Denmark as the price reductions have not been anywhere close to
Norwegian levels, and the earnings challenge is not as strong as in Norway, it's a little bit
more of an open question what will be the reaction in the market. So I would hesitate a bit
to predict that. But I would expect that top line in total for Corporate Denmark and
Corporate Sweden in 2020 will be negative, but it's really, really tricky to guesstimate the
volume as a few single customers can move the needle quite signiﬁcantly.

FINAL

So that's why we would plan for a strong growth in Private and Commercial and a
negative growth in all three countries of Corporate, but with a large uncertainty as to the
volume. But on the other hand, we are very certain that this will improve earnings in
Corporate and it will reduce capital consumption in Corporate. So we have no doubt that
it will create value, but predicting the top line is really tricky.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

I'll just try to do the math in Norway then, it looks like you must have lost around 16% of
your sort of starting volumes, which has then increased 14%, to give you the minus 4%
[ph]. What would be sort of the threshold where it starts to be an issue for scale in the
segment, which is oﬀsetting the expense ratio...

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, actually the -- I think you're asking the right question. But in reality, the math is not
right, because the issue is, ﬁrst of all, we haven't reached the renewal date of all
customers. So we haven't earned 14% across the entire portfolio yet. Then also there are
pockets within the reported numbers that are actually not our premium, but other
companies' premium. So for instance if we have fronting where we administrate business
for an international company in Norway, then we get a cost fee, but we have nothing to
do with premiums and claims. So we don't do price increases on those customers,
because they don't relate to us. So there you're actually taking out of the equation when
you try to calculate the net-net impact. So actually the net-net loss is lower than what
you're trying to calculate. So I think your logic is right, but I don't think you have the
numbers to do the math correctly, and that leads you to overshooting on the actual lapse.
But having said that, our view is that of course we need to control this in a thoughtful way,
but also that longer term, having a portfolio with much stronger Private, much stronger
Commercial SME and somewhat smaller Corporate, that does create value. We just need
to steer that process in a mindful way.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

And then just on the solvency, and again regarding the Corporate, what is that again -- I
mean how is the sensitivity on your SCR from Corporate premiums?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yeah, I think the -- if you answer that question from a lifetime of a Corporate customer
angle, then it's really quite simple, because the capital consumption of a Corporate
customer is often twice as high as that of a Private customer. But bear in mind that the SCR
is a function of both the premium and the exposure from the premium and the claims and
the liabilities. So while you get a positive almost straightaway from the lower premium,
then it does take a number of years for the actual claims liability to run out of your books
and thereby out of the SCR. So there is a short-term, long-term view to this. And of course
we are monitoring both, because they both impact our earnings and they both impact our
longer-term capital consumption and dividend potential.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

FINAL

And then also looking at the -- you can say the composition of the products with the
Corporate business that is lost, it makes a huge diﬀerence whether it's the long-tailed
products compared to the short tail. So it's not easy to just make a like-for-like
comparison.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

So you could say that if for instance Norwegian workers' comp is a big part of what we
lose, that is one of the worst drivers on the capital consumption. So that's great. If, for
instance, when we cede away, taking out international liability insurance out of Sweden,
that is also one of the worst capital-consuming, low-return lines, so that is very positive.
On the other hand, it does take a while for the tail of these liabilities to roll oﬀ. So longer
term, the math is very clear, but it's not just done with the taking out the premium.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. And then very ﬁnal question, coming back to Asbjorn's very ﬁrst question on the
solvency ratio and an extraordinary dividend, so I understand you don't want to guide,
but -- on the solvency ratio, but last year, would you have done an extraordinary dividend?
The way I can calculate it, the solvency ratio would have been 155. This year, if I get, of
course, Q4 and everything else right, it will be 161 or something, so 5 basis points, 6 basis
points above what it would have been last year where you did not do an extraordinary
dividend. So is that 5 percentage points, 6 percentage points really the diﬀerence or have
something else changed, i.e. if you will do an extraordinary dividend?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I appreciate the creativity of the question. I think to be honest that we don't do the math
of 5% or 6% and then we make a decision. We try to look at where is the business headed
from an earnings point of view and from a capital consumption point of view, and where is
it headed from an internal model development point of view. To include Sweden, what is
the impact of that. To reduce Corporate, what is the impact of that, what is the speed of
that impact, how does our prognosis look from an earnings and capital consumption
point of view. And then we take all of that into the equation, and then we make an
intelligent choice based on that. And that is more forward-looking than just a
mathematical calculation of 5% or 6%.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yeah. And I think on top of that obviously last year that was the timing, where we just went
to the market to fund the Alka acquisition. So you can say it would be a little bit diﬃcult to
go out and argue why we should then on top of that also pay out extraordinary dividend.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yeah, agreed.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Ryan at Bloomberg
Intelligence. Please go ahead, your line is open.

Q - Kevin Ryan

{BIO 1814771 <GO>}

Thank you very much. I just had one question, some clariﬁcation really, which leads on
from the recent questions as well. You mentioned that low interest rates were clearly not
helpful. I was just wondering whether you are building low interest rates into the rates
you're trying to push through [ph] in Norway and elsewhere in your portfolio, because
clearly it's got a solvency issue, particularly on the larger Corporate side if we carry on, as
it would appear, we will do with these extremely low interest rates. Perhaps you could
oﬀer some insight into your thinking around that. Thank you.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

There is no doubt that when you look at what are appropriate rates in the Corporate
segment, you need to be quite careful about the capital consumption, because it's very
high, you need to be quite careful about the volatility assumptions, because that actually
moves the needle on the capital consumption quite signiﬁcantly. And then you need to
be quite careful on the assumptions you make on interest rates and discounting because
a lot of the longer-tailed lines do sit in Corporate.
We have been gradually building the continued lower interest rate level into our
assumptions on future rates. We didn't predict how much rates would fall in Q3, to be
honest. So it's not like we have the perfect model that says now Q3 has this adjustment
and then this is the driver for 1st of January pricing. But I think in broader terms, we have
captured well the lowest interest rates and built that into the rate requirements for
Corporate. But when we look at the current pricing, we mentioned the 14% price increase
in Norway, which is not enough. So the journey from improving where we are now to
getting to the right balance in Corporate in all three countries, it's a several years project,
so we cannot get the right pricing in one go.
So the fact that we see continued lower interest rates is not really a challenge, because we
have generally built in low interest rates and we have several steps of price changes to
get to the ultimately correct price. So -- but there's no doubt that we do punish Corporate
from the point of view that we are seeing more volatility on the large claims, for instance,
in Corporate Sweden, but also Corporate Norway, both on property and liability, and we
are seeing a lower discounting rate, and both punish the earnings of Corporate more. So
it is also some of the drivers that makes the decision of rebalancing even clearer.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. Good morning. A clear case in question left on my table. On the
Corporate, you said that Norway was -- have been minus 4% [ph] in volume this year. You
were uncertain whether the impact would be worse or bad than Denmark and Sweden.
But is it fair to assume that your price -- that we should expect Corporate volumes next
year to go down by -- in the magnitude of DKK150 million to DKK200 million? That seems
to be the magnitude or approximately 1% of Group premiums coming from the pricing
initiatives.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well that's -- I would hate to give you the wrong number, Per. I think in some ways, you
can argue that the steepest reduction should come from Sweden, because there we have
a weaker starting point market position. In Denmark, the bonus scheme should help the
journey more. I wouldn't rule out that the reaction could be higher than the number you
mentioned. So -- but it is extremely tricky to see what is the net impact. It is -- I would
estimate a negative from all three countries. I would not be surprised if the number is as
high as you mentioned, and the number could be higher.
So I wouldn't give a guesstimate here, because it's -- some of these customers pay DKK30
million, DKK40 million in premium. So we'll just shift a handful of them to either the
positive or the negative. You can easily move another DKK200 million. So I really don't
want to guesstimate that.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

Company Name: Tryg A/S

Corporate Norway in both '18 and '19. In '18, we saw quite a low customer lapse as a result
of that. In '19, we've seen more of a lapse as a result of that. It is not easy to predict the
sort of short-term impact of that. And our hesitation comes both from the uncertainty, but
also from the fact that if we are too keen on protecting the top line on Corporate, then our
eﬀorts on carrying out the proﬁtability initiatives and price changes becomes too weak.
And as we see it, the current growth in Private lines and Commercial lines are so strong
that we can capture also a signiﬁcant negative component from Corporate and whether
we look at earnings or we look at capital consumption or we look at ROE or we look at
dividend potential, all of those KPIs improve when we improve Corporate. So we really
should do that even if the result could be higher or more negative than what you
mentioned.
Okay. I was just a bit confused on the proﬁt impact. As I noted, Barbara earlier on the
discussion of how easy it was to reach the DKK3.3 billion, she talked about headwind from
the pricing initiatives, but you are talking about this being a positive. I assume it's the
latter and not the ﬁrst outcome.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

The headwind was predominantly from the discounting impact and then obviously, as you
can see, as Morten was saying, the pricing impact will have an impact on the top line.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

(Multiple Speakers) talked about the headwind on top line and help on the earnings and
then we talked about headwind on the discounting. So, if we've got some of that mixed

I think, to be honest that the moving parts on motor Sweden have been sort of fairly small.
So in a Group context quite small. I don't think it's an industry-wide issue. There are some
pockets in motor where the exposure we have priced have not been priced completely
accurately. It does impact our Private Sweden numbers. It is more to do with our own -- to
be honest, slightly too slow reaction. Every time you do a new tariﬀ then you need to
make sure that you re-calibrate very often and very frequent, because we always need to
do that and there are some pockets in motor Sweden where we've been a little bit too
slow on that. We have now reacted and the numbers are really quite small from a Group
point of view, but a little bit more meaningful from a Swedish point of view.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

I see. When you say too slow, you're talking about weeks, months or year?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I would say that we've been a couple of quarters reacting [ph] on something, I think we
should have spend a couple of months reacting on, and that actually back to the
comment I mentioned earlier that I think over time insurance has always been too slow to
react on the most recent changes in patterns and we've always used sort of more
traditional extra-error methodology of waiting to see the longer trends and the bigger
movements. And I think from a certainty point of view, that's great. But you get behind the
curve in two seconds. And I think that's why we're working quite hard and we've been in
most areas, quite successful in ﬁrming up, the timing and the time of reacting to new
trends are much, much shorter period and Sweden Private is not up to speed on that yet.
So, we are further improving on that area.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay. I mean we obviously seen a problem of not reacting quickly to trends in motor in
Norway in the past as well. So, are we on top of the case in Sweden?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I can promise we're on top of the case in Sweden, and I think what made the Norwegian
case more diﬃcult was the extremely high growth in Teslas and the like. I think in Sweden,
the total portfolio of cars have been much more stable. So we're talking about much more
smaller moving parts than in Norway.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Yes, yes. And can I just ask -- I don't know if this has been asked earlier as well, sorry. But
on the Corporate side of things, was there any change in the trend that meant that you
want to increase prices signiﬁcantly in Denmark and Sweden? Or is it just the fact that the
strategy is that you don't like Corporate as much as you used to in the past?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, to be honest, I don't think that there is any sort of large new pieces of information
out there. I think that the worry on Corporate proﬁtability and capital returns has been
there for a while. The biggest challenge was in Norway. We reacted to Norway ﬁrst, and
Page 19 of 21

FINAL

you're always trying to understand how much proﬁtability can you improve with how
much of a top-line impact. And I think it's becoming clearer for us, so the challenge has
been clear for a while.
The lower assumed longer-term runoﬀs do not help the equation. The lower discounting
rates do not help the equation. And -- but generally I think the need has been there for a
while. We have just become clearer and clearer on the willingness also to let more top
line go in the process, and are also seeing quite clearly how much that impacts, not only
P&L, which is in the obvious place to start, but how much it actually impacts capital
consumption. And through capital consumption also the ROE and the future dividend
potential. And if you may recall, if you go back to the Capital Markets Day we had in 2017,
already back then we started talking about the rebalancing. And actually if you do the
math from 2017 to now, you can already now see how the retail component is becoming
bigger and bigger of the Group, and you will see that trend continuing as Corporate
strengths and as Private and SME grows. So it is really a longer-term trend where we are
becoming slightly more harsh in the next 12 months, but it's not a new trend.

Good morning, everyone. Just a quick question, please. It's on the run-oﬀ gains in Private.
So conscious that you've been running at sort of a 3% to 4% level in the last few quarters.
Could you explain kind of the drivers behind this drop that we've seen to-date, please?
Thank you.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, I guess, the -- actually if you go through the various quarters, you can actually see on
the reported Group level fairly stable trends on total run-oﬀ levels. I guess, this quarter,
the large claims have been quite benign and the total run-oﬀs level is also lower than
we've seen, for instance, last year. But actually if you dig into the individual quarters, you
see a lot of variation on the composition of that run-oﬀ, and in particularly Private lines,
has a signiﬁcantly lower run-oﬀ, almost 5 percentage points lower run-oﬀ compared to
last year. I wouldn't read too much into that; that is quarterly volatility in the composition
of the run-oﬀ. And I think we expect that to continue also in the future that from quarterto-quarter the composition will jump, and you will see more stability on the Group
numbers.
