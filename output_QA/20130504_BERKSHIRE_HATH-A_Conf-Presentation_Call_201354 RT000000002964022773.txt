Presentation
Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Good morning. I'm a little worn out. We're going to -- well, first of all, I really want to thank
Brad Underwood. He puts the movie together every year, does a terrific job. Andy
Heyward and Amy are responsible for the cartoon. They also produce "The Secret
Millionaire's Club," which has been a huge hit this year, and I really want to thank them for
their part in this, too.
And finally, Carrie Sova who-- who puts this whole affair together, she's four months
pregnant. She got her MBA, I think, yesterday or-- and, in addition, she is the ringmaster
for all of this. Let's give Carrie a terrific hand. We'll go through a few figures, few slides. I'll
introduce the directors and make one or two more announcements, and then we'll get on
to the questions. Now, if we could put up the first Slide, which is the earnings that were
released yesterday. And as you can see, it was a good quarter.
It wasn't quite as a good a quarter as it looks, which I'll explain in a second. But really all of
our businesses did very well. You should focus on operating earnings. Charlie's getting a
head start here on the peanut brittle and fudge, so I'll catch up later. It was a very good -it was a benign quarter in insurance, but our other businesses, particularly our big
businesses, did quite well, and I don't remember whether we've ever had operating
earnings of more than 3 point -- almost $8 billion. But, in any event, it was quite
satisfactory.

FINAL

Now, we'll put up slide two. The insurance earnings were helped a bit. They were still
terrific without these factors, but they were helped a bit by the fact that the dollar was
strong, and that reduces the liabilities we have on outstanding in foreign currencies. So if
we have losses we're going to pay in the future and they're payable in pounds or euros
and the dollar appreciates against those currencies, we get a small benefit from that.
We also have it -- it hurts us in other ways. We have so many different kinds of businesses,
and then we own other earnings through Coca-Cola that operate around the world, that I
really never know whether when the dollar goes up or down, whether it helps us or not.
So I've never been able to figure it out. So we just sort of take it as it comes. And we do
want to explain that to you, the insurance earnings.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then we had another item, which is kind of interesting. We've had a disagreement
with Swiss Re about a life reinsurance contract, and that's -- the disagreement's probably
lasted for well over a year, and that was settled in the first quarter. And as you can see,
we showed a gain of $255 million pretax from settling this disagreement, but,
interestingly, Swiss Re showed a gain of $100 million also from settling the disagreement.
So, we are working on an arrangement with Swiss Re whether we'll get in an argument
every quarter, and both report higher earnings when we settle it.
It's magnificent what accounting can do. One real high point of the first quarter was the
pickup which I noticed -- which I noted --in the annual report, about the gain in both the
closure rate and the persistency rate at GEICO. These are hugely important factors. And if
we'll put up the chart showing the gain of GEICO's auto policies, the strengths I
mentioned in 2012, and not only continued in 2013, but the trend has become even
stronger. And there's a lot of seasonal to policy gains. But as you can see, month by
month, our gains have -- and policies have very significantly improved over 2012.
And, again, it's because our closure ratio, in other words, the number of people that get a
quote from us and then go on to buy a policy, that rate has improved very significantly this
year, and with it we also had a gain in persistency, the people that renew the policies with
us, and that's pure gold. A policy has a mathematical value to us of at least $1,500, so if
we had a million policies in a year -- and I'm hopeful we might do that this year -- that's a
billion-and-a-half of value that gets built into our intrinsic value, which does not show up on
the income statement or balance sheet at all, but it does increase the value of GEICO
versus what we carry it for.
And I can't resist a little sales pitch on that because this closure rate, which, like I say, is at
incredible levels, means that when people go to our website or call us and get a quote,
they find that they can save a lot of money. I mean, people love our little gecko, but they
buy the policies because we save them money. And it just so happens that in the
auditorium right near here, the exposition hall, we have a lot of very friendly people that
will help you save money, too. So I urge you -- you can walk out anytime Charlie is talking
and go and get a quote, and a very high percentage of you could save money by doing
that. And, you know, that is in the Berkshire spirit, to save money at every opportunity. So
I'm hoping you will check that out, and we will set a record for policies sold.

FINAL

And, finally, our railroad, this year, is doing very well. You saw the earnings in the first
quarter report, if you've had a chance to look at that. And we've got some figures up that
show our gain in car loadings in the first 17 weeks. It's been 3.8%, whereas the other four
major Class I railroads in the United States have had a gain of four-tenths of a percent.
That's significant money that -- and we don't have the Canadian railroads here that
operate in the United States. They both come down, the Canadian National, Canadian
Pacific. But -- but this is representative of what's been happening.
We've been helped by the fact that, fortunately, a lot of oil has been found very, very
close to our railroad tracks, and what better place to find oil? And so we've been moving
a lot of that, and it's worth -- and we'll be moving a lot more the way things are going.
And the result of all this -- we now will put up the next slide -- we're now the fifth most
valuable company in the world. And that will change over time, but I hope it changes for
the better.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'd like -- the business part of this meeting starts at around 3:30, and at that time we'll
have the election of directors. But I would like, nevertheless, for those of you who won't
stick around to the bitter end, I would like to introduce our directors, and -- Charlie and I
are directors. And if our directors would stand and remain standing when I call your name.
And no matter how strong the urge, withhold your applause until they're all finished
standing, and then you can withhold your applause then if you wish, too, but I plan to
applaud. Okay.
Howard Buffett. Steve Burke. Susan Decker. So just stand and remain standing -- there we
are. Okay. Bill Gates. Sandy Gottesman. Charlotte Guyman. Don Keough. Tom Murphy. Ron
Olson. Walter Scott, Jr.And our soon to be new member, Meryl Witmer. Okay. No more
withholding. Now, we'll start the questioning in just one minute, but there were one or two
announcements to make.
We did not put it in the -- we did not put it in the annual report because we hadn't firmed
it up yet, but tomorrow at Borsheims, our friend Ariel Hsing will be available to play table
tennis with any of you foolish enough to challenge her. I met Ariel when she was nine, and
she became the youngest women's table tennis champion of the United States, and then
last summer she went on to the Olympics. And at the Olympics, she won her first two
matches, and she won more games off the woman that became the eventual Olympic
champion than any other participant in that event. So Ariel will be out there tomorrow at 1
o'clock. And if you're courageous, you'll show up with your paddle and end up looking like
an idiot.
One more introduction, I don't know whether we can get a spotlight on him or not, but
Stan Lipsey retired this year as publisher of The Buffalo News. And, as Charlie can attest,
as well as I, back in 1978, '79, '80, we had an enormous business problem in the Buffalo
News. We were locked in a competitive struggle. And we were not doing well, in part,
because of we were operating under a tough judicial order for a while until it got reversed
on appeal.

FINAL

And Stan gave up a wonderful life here in Omaha and asked no questions and for no pay
came up to Buffalo, and The Buffalo News would not have turned out to be the paper that
it's turned out to be or produced the profits that have been produced for Berkshire,
without Stan Lipsey. So, if Stan could stand, let's give him a hand. Stan the Man. One other
announcement, then we'll go to the questions.
It was announced a couple of days ago that we bought out the final 20% of ISCAR held by
the family for about $2 billion. It's a transaction they're happy with, we're happy with. As a
matter of fact, if you saw Eitan Wertheimer dancing at "Dancing with the Stars" there, you
could have seen how happy he was. So we will now own 100% of ISCAR, but our
relationship with the Wertheimer family will continue. It's been a sheer joy. The business
has done terrifically. The people have behaved magnificently, and ISCAR will be part of
Berkshire forever. So I want to thank Eitan and his family. And, Eitan, are you here? Can you
stand up, and your family? Thank you.
Let's have a light here in the front row. Okay. Okay. We'll now move on to our questions.
We'll continue these until about noon. We'll take an hour break for lunch. We'll come back,
and then we'll continue until about 3:30, at which time we will convene the business
meeting. And we will start off -- we have three journalists who have been here before on
the right, and we have a distinguished panel on the left, including a short seller, perhaps
the first at any annual meeting, and we will start off with Carol Loomis.

Questions And Answers
A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

(Question And Answer)

Q - Carol Loomis

{BIO 7137249 <GO>}

Good morning. Speaking for the three of us, I hope here, we have received into the
thousands of questions. We don't even know how many. And if we didn't pick your
question, it was because we just didn't get to it.
I do want to tell you that Warren and Charlie have no idea of what our questions are going
to be, no hints at all, and so we look forward to sending them curve balls. I'll start off here.
Warren, you measure Berkshire -- this is from William Bernard [ph] of Colleyville, Texas.
You measure Berkshire's corporate performance based on growth and book value per
share. The table on page 103 of the annual report shows book value per share has grown
at less than an average 12% a year for 9 of the last 11 5-year periods, yet in your last
annual letter, you state, quote, "The S&P 500 earns considerably more than 12% on net
worth," and then you say, "That seems reasonable for Berkshire also."Why do you say
that, given the past record showing that Berkshire has not been earning that much, or is it
that you expect to earn that much, recognizing that it is not assured in the future?

A - Warren E. Buffett

FINAL

It certainly is not assured in the future. And the last ten or so years have not been the best
for business, generally. But if the stock market continues to behave in 2013 as it has so far,
this will be the first five-year period where the gain in book value per share has fallen
short of the market performance, including dividends, of the Standard & Poor's.
And that won't be a happy day, but it won't be -- it won't totally discourage us because it
will be a period where the market has gone up in every one of the five years. And as
we've regularly pointed out, we're likely to be better in down years as we did in 2008, for
example, which is the year that gets dropped this year. We're likely to do better in down
years, relatively, than we do in up years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Charlie, how do you feel about the prospects of -- I should point out, incidentally, that we
use book value because it's a calculable figure, and it does serve as a reasonable proxy
of the year-to-year change in the intrinsic value of Berkshire. If we could really give you a
figure for intrinsic value, and back it up, that would be the important figure. As I pointed
out, if we gain a million policyholders at GEICO, that actually adds a billion-and-a-half to
intrinsic value, and it doesn't add a dime to book value. So, there's a significant gap, which
is why we're willing to buy in stock at 120% of book value -- a significant gap between the
two. But book value is a useful tracking device.
I should point out also -- I did this in the annual report in respect to Marmon -- when we
buy the ISCAR stock, which we pay about $2 billion for, the day we buy it, we mark it down
in terms of our book value by roughly a billion dollars. So a billion dollars comes off our
book value for making a purchase which we regard as quite satisfactory. And so there are
these distortions that occur. But in the end, we have to do better for you than you would
do in an index fund. And if we don't, we aren't earning our pay. And I think we'll do that in
the future, but I don't think we'll do it every year, and we've proven that in the last few
years. Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, I confidently expect that Berkshire's going to do quite well over the long term. I don't
pay much attention to whether it's five years or three years or -- I think we have
momentums in place that are going to do Okay. Of course, we won't do as well in the
future, in terms of annual gain averaged out, because our past returns were almost
unbelievable. So, we're slowing down, but I think it'll still be very pleasant.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

At 89, Charlie is not really concerned about this stuff year-to-year. I mean, he's taking a
longer-range view.

FINAL

Okay. Jonathan Brandt, who is a newcomer to the panel, his area is the other-thaninsurance aspects of Berkshire Hathaway. And I can assure you that no one has paid more
-- I played Jonny in chess when he was about four years old, and, I don't know, I must have
been 40 or something at the time, and he kept insisting during dinner that we play chess
afterwards.
And we started playing, and, of course, he got me into some impossible position in a few
moves, and I told his parents to put him to bed. So, Jonny, I still have kind of comebacks in
me, so be careful what you ask. Jon Brandt.

Q - Carol Loomis

{BIO 7137249 <GO>}

Good to see you, Warren. A question about ISCAR: what do you feel are the specific
competitive advantages that ISCAR has over its primary competitor, Sandvik, and, in turn,
what advantages does Sandvik have over ISCAR as the larger player?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Sandvik is a very good company, and ISCAR is a much better company. The
advantage it has is brains and incredible passion for the business.
It's interesting to reflect on ISCAR because if you go back to -- what would it be? -- 1951 or
thereabouts, when Stef Wertheimer, who had come from Germany, was in Israel, started
ISCAR, just think of the prospect that was facing him. Here was a company like Sandvik, or
in this company -- country -- Kennametal, or different countries, well-entrenched
companies, well-entrenched, well-financed. And here's this fellow in Israel, 25 years old,
and the raw material for these cutting tools comes from China. It isn't that the raw
material is in Israel.
So everybody buys their tungsten from China, and they sell to customers that are using
large machine tools throughout the world, but they're selling it to heavy industry to a
significant extent. So they're selling to people like Boeing or General Motors or big
industrial companies in Germany, and there's no great locational advantage, in terms of
being in Israel doing this. But here's this 25-year-old fellow getting the tungsten from
thousands of miles away, selling it to customers thousands of miles away, competing
against people like Sandvik, and this remarkable business, ISCAR, comes from that.
And there's no other answer you can give to your question when you see that result than
to say that you have had some incredibly talented people who never stopped working,
never stopped trying to improve the product, never stopped trying to make customers
happy, and that continues to this day. Sandvik is a very good company. I can tell you that
based not only on the figures, but on every other aspect of business observation that I
possess, that ISCAR is one of the great companies of the world, and we feel very
fortunate to own it and to be associated with their management. Charlie?

Well, it's a good comparison. Sandvik is a fabulous company, and it's a particular
achievement to really do a little better in the competitive market, as ISCAR has done.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

number 1.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Hi. Dan Lewis [ph] from Chicago. First of all, I wanted to thank you for letting us in the
building early today. But let's not -- Let's not do that again next year, though. I don't want
to wake up any earlier to get in line.

A - Warren E. Buffett

A - Unidentified Speaker
Always a comeback. When you think about Berkshire in the decade after you're gone, my

what are your big worries and, you know, what can go wrong?

FINAL

Well, it's a good question. It's one we think about all the time. And that's why the culture is
all important, the businesses we own are all important, because those trains will keep
running and people will keep calling GEICO the day after I die. There's no question about
that.
And the key is preserving the culture and having a successor as CEO that will have more
brains, more energy, and more passion for it, even than I have. And it's the number one
subject that our board considers at every meeting, and we're solidly in agreement as to
whom that individual should be. And I think the culture has just become intensified year
after year after year. And I think Charlie would agree with that.
I mean, we always knew what we were about when we first got involved with Berkshire,
but making sure that everybody that joined us, that the owners, the shareholders,
directors, managers, everybody that bought into this what I think very special culture. That
took time, and -- but it is -- I think it's really one of a kind now, and I think that it will remain
one of a kind. I think that anything that came in -- any foreign-type behavior would be cast
out because people have self-selected into this group, into the company, and it would be
rejected like a foreign tissue if we got the wrong sort of person in there.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have a board that is especially devoted to Berkshire. We don't hold them by paying
them huge amounts, it may be noted. And we have people who have brought their
companies to Berkshire because they want to be part of it, as did ISCAR. So, I think that
whoever succeeds me -- and it will be a lot of newspaper stories and people -- after six
months, there will be a story that says, you know, it isn't the same thing. It will be the same
thing. You can count on that. Charlie, what are your thoughts?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, I -- my thoughts are very simple. I want to say to the many Mungers in the audience,
don't be so stupid as to sell these shares.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

That goes for the Buffetts, too. Okay. Becky?

Q - Analyst
This is a question that comes from Ben Knoll, who happens to be the chief operating
officer at the Greater Twin Cities United Way. And he writes in that after the Heinz deal,
there was a column that was written indicating that you had gotten the better end of the
Heinz deal from your Brazilian partners. That column said that your return was likely to
come from the preferred stock dividends, with the common equity portion being dead
money. It also said that the way the deal was structured indicated your low expectations
for the market overall. Is this an accurate portrayal of the deal and of your expectations
for the market overall?

FINAL

No. It's totally inaccurate. The -- it's interesting. Jorge Paulo Lemann and I were in Boulder,
Colorado, in early December. And I can't remember if it was -- yeah, on the way to the
airport or when we got in the plane. But he said that he was thinking about going to the
people at Heinz and proposing a deal and would I be interested.
And I, because I knew both Heinz and I knew Jorge Paulo, and I thought highly, very highly,
of both, I said, "I'm in." And maybe a week later -- I don't remember exactly how long-- I
received from Jorge Paulo, who I had known for many years starting at Gillette when we
were both directors -- I received a term sheet on the deal and another sheet on the
governance procedures that he suggested.
And he said, "If you got any thoughts about changing this, just let me know." They were
just his thoughts. It was an absolutely fair deal, and it was -- I didn't have to change a word
in either the term sheet or the governance arrangement. Now, we actually, Charlie and I,
probably paid a little more than we would have paid if we had been doing the deal
ourselves, because we think that Jorge Paulo and his associates are extraordinary
managers.

Bloomberg Transcript

They're both classy, and they're unusually good, and so we stretched a little because of
that fact. We like the business, and the design of the deal is such that if we do quite well
over time at Heinz, that their $4.1 billion will achieve higher rates of return than our overall
$12 billion. We have a less-leveraged position in the capital structure than they have. We
created -- they wanted more leverage, and we provided that leverage on what I regard
as fair terms and what they regard as fair terms.
If anybody thinks that the common is dead money, you know, we think they're making a
mistake. But we'll know the answer to that in five years. But the design of the deal,
essentially -- we have more money than operating ability at the parent company level, and
they have lots of operating ability and wanted to maximize their return on $4 billion.
So my guess is that five years from now or ten years from now, you will find that they've
earned a higher rate of return on their investment. But because we put more dollars in,
we will have received that same rate of return on our $4 billion, plus of cap common
equity, but we also will have received a very fair return on the $8 billion that we put in that
created more leverage for them. Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, as you said, the report was totally wrong.

FINAL

Thank you. At Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance group, Mr.Ajit Jain appears to be
employing a new strategy recently with some high profile actions. Berkshire signed a
portfolio underwriting arrangement with Aon to do business with Lloyd's. And then last
week, there was the hiring of several AIG executives. It appears that Berkshire may be
taking a broader share of the market. What is the goal of these moves, and won't these
actions eventually produce more average results?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, you -- the goal is to take a greater share of the market. There have been two
important moves made by Ajit's operation in the last month or so. One is the -- the first
one that was announced -- was this participation of 7.5% in all of the business. Originally, it
was announced as applying to the Lloyd's market. I believe it's been extended to the
entire London market.

Bloomberg Transcript

And, now, bear in mind that the people that are insured still have the right to pick who
their insurers shall be, so it isn't totally automatic that we receive 7.5% percent of every
slip. But we had had an arrangement for a couple of years with Marsh on a marine book
and perhaps some other areas, but not across the board. And we think that -- we think
that the profit possibilities are reasonable for that business, or we wouldn't have entered
into it.
It will give us more of a cross-section of business than we've been used to having, but it
doesn't mean that we give up our present business at all, either. The second item you
mentioned is just in the last week or thereabouts. It was announced that four pretty wellknown insurance people that had been with AIG had joined us to write, primarily,
commercial insurance, initially domestically, perhaps, but around the world. And these are
people that reached out to Berkshire. In the case of at least one of them, even reached
out a number of times in the past. But we were ready to enter this field with these people
who were very able people. We've had a number of people reach out since the
announcement was made only a week or so ago.
So I think you will see Berkshire, in addition to all of the other insurance businesses that
has had over the years, I think you'll see us become a very significant factor, worldwide, in
the commercial insurance business. I mean, it could be business that reaches into the
billions. In fact, I would hope that it would -- it could be -- you know, a fair number of
billions over time. And we've got the right people. We've got capital like nobody else has.
We have the ability to sign on to coverages that other people have to spread out among
others. So, I think we're ideally situated to go into this business, and I'm looking forward to
it. Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, generally speaking, I don't think the reinsurance business is a very good business for
most people. And I think it's a very desirable part of Berkshire's business, the way it's run,
but it's different from something like the other businesses, which would work pretty well if
somebody else owned them. I think our reinsurance business under Ajit is very peculiar,
and other people who think it's easy are going to find out that it isn't.

FINAL

Yes. And I should point out, this commercial insurance business also, I mean, it will be
primary insurance. The Aon arrangement is a reinsurance arrangement, but we will be in
the primary business. So, it will be large commercial risks, but there's a lot of premium
buy-in there, and there's a lot of chances to make mistakes. But I'd rather have the group
we have overseeing that business than any other group I can think of.
Okay. Station 2?

-- called Snapshot. Is that still the case, and if so, why wouldn't that technology give
GEICO better data to potentially give discounts to customers?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yes. That still is the case, and Snapshot has attracted a fair amount of attention and there
are other companies doing that. It's an arrangement, essentially, to tie -- well, the term
"Snapshot," perhaps, says it -- to get a picture of how people really do drive.
Insurance underwriting, you know, is an attempt to figure out the likely propensity, based
on a number of variables, of a person having an accident. Now, you know, in life insurance,
it's very obvious that somebody 100 is -- if you don't know anything else about them -- is
more likely to die in the next year than somebody that's 20. When you get into auto
insurance, figuring out who's likely to have an accident involves assessing a number of
variables, and different companies go at it different ways. Clearly, on statistics, if you're a
16-year-old male, you're more likely to have an accident than I am.
Now, that isn't because I'm a better driver. It's because the 16-year-old is probably driving
about ten times as much, and he's trying to impress the girl sitting next to him. And that
doesn't work with me anymore, so I've given it up. But the -- we ask a number of
questions, and our attempt, as much as possible, is to figure out the propensity of any
given applicant, or the possibility, that they will have accidents.
And there are a number of variables that are quite useful in predicting. And Progressive is
focusing on this Snapshot arrangement, and we'll see how they do. I would say that our
ability to sell insurance at a price that's considerably lower than most of our competitors,
evidenced by the fact that when people call us, they shift to us, and, at the same time,

earn a significant underwriting profit, indicates that our selection process is working quite
well. I mean, if your selection process is wrong, if you treat a 16-year-old male and give
him the same rate that you'd give a 40-year-old that's driving their car 3,000 miles or
4,000 miles a year, you know, you're going to get terrible underwriting results.
So our systems, our underwriting criteria, have been developed, you know, over many
decades. We have a huge number of policyholders, so that it becomes very credible,
these different underwriting cells. And everybody in the business is trying to figure out
ways to predict with greater accuracy the possibilities that a given individual will have an
accident. And Progressive is focusing on this Snapshot approach, and we watch it with
interest, but we're quite happy with the present situation.

Okay. Andrew?

Q - Andrew Ross Sorkin

{BIO 6340618 <GO>}

Okay. Warren, we got a couple questions related to this. Warren, now that you're on
Twitter and the SEC is allowing companies to make material announcements over social
media, what are the implications for Business Wire, a unit of Berkshire?
Do you agree with the SEC's new position on the distribution of material information, and
would you consider selling Business Wire given the new rules? If not, how do you think
Business Wire will have to transform itself ? And, by the way, what are you doing on
Twitter?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

I haven't figured that last one out yet. The -- no, I think it is a mistake. Some companies
have announced -- made important announcements -- on webpages, and some, in certain
cases, they've messed it up and caused a fair amount of trouble. But the key to disclosure
is accuracy and simultaneity. I mean, if we own stocks, or are thinking about owning stocks,
we want to be very sure that we get accurate information and we get it exactly at the
same time as all other people.
And Business Wire does a magnificent job of that. And I do not want, if I'm buying Wells
Fargo, or selling it, or whatever it may be, I do not want to have to keep hitting up to their
webpage, or something, and hoping that I'm not 10 seconds behind someone else if
there's some important announcement. So, Business Wire has got a traffic record of
accuracy and of getting the information to every part of the globe in a simultaneous
manner, and that is the key to disclosure.

And I think -- I don't think that -- I don't think anything has come close to doing that as well
as Business Wire. So I think we will do very well. We've got a sensational manager in Cathy
Baron Tamraz. I couldn't be happier with the business, so we will not be selling it. And if I
could clone Cathy, I would do it. I will not -- Berkshire, when it puts out its information -and we like to put it out, actually, after the market closes because we think there's so
much to digest that it's a terrible mistake to have people try and figure it all out in reading
a one- or two-page announcement. But anything important from Berkshire, or any of our
companies, is going to come out on Business Wire so that people get accurate
information at exactly at the same time. Charlie?

Thank you, Warren and Charlie. Thanks for this unusual invitation. I'm honored, and I look

Q - Doug Kass

{BIO 3559809 <GO>}

I would note, you have me asking the last question in the group, though. My first question
is a follow-up to Carol Loomis's first question. Warren, it's said that size matters.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

It does.

Q - Doug Kass

{BIO 3559809 <GO>}

In the past, Berkshire has purchased cheap or wholesale. For example, GEICO,
MidAmerican, your initial purchase of Coca-Cola. And, arguably, your company has shifted
to becoming a buyer of pricier and more mature businesses, for example, IBM, Burlington
Northern, Heinz, and Lubrizol. These were all done at prices, sales, earnings, book value
multiples, well above your prior acquisitions and after the stock prices rose.
Many of the recent buys might be great additions to Berkshire's portfolio of companies;
however, the relatively high prices paid for these investments could potentially result in a
lower return on invested capital. You used to hunt gazelles. Now you're hunting elephants.
As Berkshire gets bigger, it's harder to move the needle. To me, the recent buys look like
Page 13 of 107

preparation for your legacy, creating a more mature, slower-growing enterprise. Is
Berkshire morphing into a stock that has become to resemble an index fund and that,
perhaps, is more appropriate for widows and orphans, rather than past investors who
sought out differentiated and superior compounded growth?

FINAL

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yes. There's no question that we cannot do as well as we did in the past, and size is a
factor. Actually, the -- it depends on the nature of markets, too. We might -- there will be
times when we'll run into bad markets, and sometimes there our size can even be an
advantage. It may well have been in 2008.
But there -- I would take exception to the fact that we paid fancier prices in some cases
than, say -- in GEICO, I think we paid 20 times earnings and a fairly-sized -- good-sized -multiple of book value. So we have paid up -- partly at Charlie's urging -- we've paid up for
good businesses more than we would have 30 years or 40 years ago. But it's tougher as
we get bigger, I we've always known that would be the case. But even with some
diminution from returns of the past, they still can be satisfactory and we are willing -there's companies we should of bought 30 years or 40 years ago that looked higher
priced then, but we now realize that paying up for an extraordinary business is not a
mistake.
Charlie, what would you say?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, we've said over and over again to this group that we can't do as well in percentage
terms per annum in the future as we did in our early days. But I think I can make the short
seller's argument even better than he did, and I'll try and do that.
If you look at the oil companies that got really big in the past history of the world, the
record is not all that good. If you stop to think about it, Rockefeller's Standard Oil is
practically the only one, after it got monstrous, continued to do monstrously well. So,
when we think we're going to do pretty well in spite of getting very big, we're telling you
we think we'll do a little better than the giants of the past. We think we've got a better
system. We don't have a better system than riding up oil, you know, but we have a better
system than most other people.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yes. In terms of the acquisitions we've made in the last five years, I think we feel pretty
good about those and -- overall -- and, obviously, including the Heinz. We are buying
some very good businesses. We actually, as we pointed out, we own eight different
businesses that would each be on the Fortune 500 list if it was a separate company, and
then in a few months, we'll own half of another one, so we'll have eight-and-a-half, in
effect.
Well, you haven't convinced me yet to sell the stock, Doug, but keep working. Section 3.

FINAL

Thank you. Jonathan Schiff, visiting from Macau, China. You briefly touched upon this. But
on our side of the world, there's a lot of discussion about the U.S. dollar's status at the
world's reserve currency. I'm sorry, there's some feedback. It's kind of weird. What would
be the effect upon the U.S. and the world economy if the dollar loses that status as a
world reserve currency?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, I don't know the answer to that, but fortunately, I don't think it's going to be relevant.
I think the dollar bill will be the world's reserve currency for some decades to come. I think
China and the United States will be the two supereconomic powers, but I don't see any -I think it's extremely unlikely -- that any currency supplants the U.S. dollar as the world
reserve currency for many decades, if ever.
Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

Well, there are advantages to a country that has the reserve currency, and if you lose that,
you lose some advantage. England had a better hand when it had the reserve currency of
the world than it had later when the United States had the reserve currency of the world. If
that eventually happened to the United States, it would not be, I think, all that significant.

This question comes from John Custabal [ph] of the Philadelphia area. Mr.Buffett, you
have said in the past, specifically in a 1999 speech that was printed in Fortune, quote, "You
--"

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

FINAL

You would bring that up, wouldn't you?

Q - Analyst
I would bring that up, right. I'm so glad he sent this question. "You have to be" -- you have
said, "You have to be wildly optimistic to believe that corporate profits, as a percent of
GDP can, for any sustained period, hold much above 6%." Corporate profits are now
greater than 10% of GDP. How should we think about that?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

What we should think is pretty unusual, and particularly considering the economic
backdrop. Corporate profits are extraordinary, as a percentage of GDP, at least looking
back on the history of the United States. And what's interesting about it, of course, is that
American business, to a great extent, is complaining enormously -- or frequently, anyway - about the level of the corporate income tax.
Now, the corporate income tax is about half what it was 40 years ago, as a percentage of
GDP. But yet, as you point out, corporate profits are at an all-time record, as a percentage
of GDP. So I would have you take with a grain of salt the complaint that American business
is noncompetitive because of our corporate income tax rate, which gets so widely
complained about. American business has done extraordinarily well at a time when
inequality, actually, is -- has widened considerably -- both measured by net worth and
measured by income, if you take the top versus the people down below.
Well, we heard from one of the people here. And, it will be interesting to see whether
these levels can be maintained. Corporate -- business has come back very, very strong, in
terms of profits, from the precipice that we were on in the fall of 2008, the panic.
Employment has not come back, the same way. And that's going to be, I would say, a
subject of a lot of public discourse. And you're seeing -- you're reading more about that,
currently. If I had to bet on whether corporate profits would be 10% of GDP -- and, of
course, we're talking about profits that are earned outside the United States, I believe, in
that -- in the figures you quote -- I would say they're likely to trend downward. But I think
that, of course, GDP will be growing, so that does not mean any terrible things will be
happening to profits.
Charlie, what do you think about the --?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, I wouldn't be too surprised if that 6% figure turned out to be on the low side, in the
estimate. Just because Warren thought something 20 years ago, doesn't mean it's a law
of nature.

FINAL

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, I'm a natural conservative on such items. But you've got to recognize that the stocks
themselves are owned by a lot of endowments and pension funds and so on. So it -- that
figure doesn't mean that the world's becoming grossly more unequal. There's no
automatic correlation between those two figures.

A - Warren E. Buffett

Do you feel the corporate tax rate is too high?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, I think when the rest of the world is -- keeps bringing the rates down, -- there's
some disadvantage to us if we're much higher. So I -- I rather like Warren's idea that
people like us should pay more, but the corporate tax rate, I'm glad to have lower.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Okay. He's the Republican; I'm the Democrat. Jonathan?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jonathan Brandt

{BIO 17988091 <GO>}

Thanks, Warren. You probably have a couple of dozen direct reports from the multitude of
noninsurance businesses that Berkshire owns, and this arrangement seems to work
wonderfully for you. But I wonder if this could potentially pose a challenge to your
successors. Adding smaller units like Oriental Trading and the newspaper group, even if
they are economically sound transactions individually, could arguably add to the
unwieldiness of the organization. How do you weigh the benefits of adding earnings with
the risk of leaving a less-focused and harder-to-manage company for even highly capable
successors?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yes. I think my successor will probably organize things a little differently on that, Jonathan,
but not dramatically so. And we'll certainly never leave the principle of our CEOs running
their businesses in virtually all important ways except, perhaps -- except for capital
allocation.
But, I actually have delegated a few units to an assistant of mine, and my guess is that my
successor will modestly organize things in a somewhat different way. I've grown up with
these companies and with the people and everything, and so it's a lot easier for me to
communicate with dozens of managers, sometimes very infrequently, because they don't
need it. It just -- sometimes it's their own preference to some degree.
And somebody coming in fresh would want, obviously, to be -- to understand very well -and that person will understand, in fact, understands now -- very well, the major units. But
Page 17 of 107

FINAL

you're right, when you get down to units that we have, you know, some businesses that
make, you know, only $5 million or $10 million a year or something like that. And my guess
is that it gets rearranged a little bit, but that won't really make any difference. I mean, the
real money is made by the big businesses. It will continue to be made by the big
businesses, and the insurance business, and a little change in reporting arrangements,
maybe one more person at headquarters if they go crazy, will really take care of things.
Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, I think, of course, it would be unwieldy to have so many businesses, a lot of them
small, if we were trying to run them through an imperial headquarters that dominated all
the details. But our system is totally different. If your system is decentralization, almost to
the point of abdication, what difference does it make how many subsidiaries you have?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yes. It's working pretty well now.

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

It'll work pretty well afterwards, too. But my successor is not going to do things identically.
It'd be a mistake. But the culture will remain unchanged. And the preeminence of the
managers of the operating units will remain unchanged, and then every now and then
something comes along and a change needs to be made. Sometimes it's through death
or disability, or sometimes a mistake is made. But, in the end, we're now trying to acquire
companies that are at least at the $75 million pretax level.
Incidentally, the best acquisitions -- to some extent, the best acquisitions -- certainly from
my standpoint makes it easier -- is the one -- is these bolt-ons that I talked about in the
annual report, in which we did, I think, $2.5 billion worth of last year, because they fall
under the purview of managers that we've got terrific confidence in and they add really
nothing to what happens at headquarters. And, of course, the best bolt-ons out of all are
when we do buy a -- buy out -- a minority interest.
When we buy $2 billion worth more of ISCAR, or a billion-and-a-half more of Marmon, with
another billion-and-a-half to come in the next year, you know, that's adding earning power
without it, you know, posing any more work. Those are the ultimate in bolt-on acquisitions,
getting more of a good thing.

My basic answer is I don't know.

Yes. I might say I have nothing to add. But Scott, you came from Overland, so we'll do our

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

I think you're-- the questioner -- is right to suspect that it's going to be difficult.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

It's going to be -- yeah, it is really uncharted territory. And as many people have found out,
whether it was the Hunt Brothers buying silver or whatever it might be, it's a lot easier to
buy things, sometimes, than it is to sell them. And the Fed's balance sheet is up around
$3.4 trillion now, and that's a lot -- those are a lot of securities. And the bank reserve
positions are incredible. I mean, Wells Fargo is sitting with $175 billion at the Fed earning a
quarter of a percent, and really earning nothing, after attendant expenses.
So, there's all this liquidity that's been created. It hasn't really hit the market because the
banks have let it sit there. You know, in classical economics, you know, that's how you juice

FINAL

the economy, and you pushed it out by having the Fed buy securities and create reserves
for the banks and all of those things. But, believe me, the banks want loans. I mean, they
are not happy -- Wells is not happy -- having $175 billion at the Fed, and they're looking
every place they can to get it out, with the proviso that they hope to get it back from
whoever they get it out to, which can slow down a bank at times.
But it-- we really are in uncharted territory. I've got a lot of faith in Bernanke. I mean, he -- if
he's running a risk, he's running a risk he knows and understands. I don't know whether
he's affected by the fact that his term expires pretty soon, so he just hands the baton off
to the next guy and said, "Here. Here's this wonderful balance sheet. And all you have to
do is bring it down a few trillion dollars," you know. And I gave a few lectures at George
Washington University last year, if you care to read them, and maybe it'll help you.

Bloomberg Transcript

This is something we haven't seen and it certainly has the potential for being very
inflationary. It hasn't been so far. In fact, my guess is that the Fed wishes it had been a little
more inflationary. If you're running up a lot of debt, it gets measured in relation to nominal
GDP and the best way to run up now, easiest way to run up, not the best way, the easiest
way to run up nominal GDP is to inflate and my guess is that they never would admit it.
But that the -- at least some bad numbers are probably disappointed that they haven't
seen more inflation. It won't be when they start selling, it'll be when the market gets any
kind of a signal that may be just the buying ends, maybe that selling will take place, it's
likely to be the shot heard round the world, now it doesn't mean the world will come to an
end but it will certainly mean that everybody that owns securities and it was felt that
they've been driven into them by extremely low rates or the assets have to go open price
because of -- because interest rates are so low. We'll start re-evaluating their hand and
people re-evaluate very fast in markets. So while I've been talking Charlie, have you got
any new insights?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, generally speaking, I think that what's happened in the realm of macroeconomics
has surprised all the people who thought they knew the answers, namely the economists
who would have guessed that interest rates could go solow and stay solow for so long or
that Japan a mighty powerful nation could have 20 years of stasis, after using all the tricks
in the economist bag.
So I think given this history, the economists saw that we have a little more cautious and
believing they know exactly how to stay out of trouble when they bring money in massive
amounts. It is a huge experiment. Yeah.

Well, I worry about even more than inflation. If we could get through the next century with
the same results we had in the last century, which involved a lot of inflation over that long
period, I think we'd all be quite satisfied. I suspect it's going to be harder not easier in this
next century and it wouldn't surprise me, I'm not going to be here to see it. But I would
predict that we may have more trouble than we think -- than we now think.

Q - Becky Quick

{BIO 16400962 <GO>}

This is actually a follow-up to the shareholder from Overland Park. The question that was
just asked this comes from Anthony Starace, who is in Lincoln, Nebraska and he says how
is the Fed zero interest policy affected Berkshire Hathaway's various business segments,
for example has it helped or hurt their operations and profitability.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, it's helped. Interest rates are to asset prices sort of like gravity is to the apple. And
when there are very low interest rates there's a very small gravitational pull on asset
prices. And we have seen that getting played out, I mean, people make different
decisions when they can borrow money for practically nothing than they made back in 1981
and 1982 when Volcker was trying to stem inflation and used and the government bond
rates got up to 15%.So interest rates power everything in the economic universe, and they
have some effect on the decisions. We borrowed the money on the Heinz purchase, so a
lot cheaper than we could have borrowed it 10 or 15 years ago. So that does affect what
people are wanting to pay.
So it's a huge factor and of course, it will presumably -- it will change at some point.
Although as Charlie has pointed out in Japan it hasn't changed for decades.
So if you wanted to inflate asset prices, bringing down interest rates and keeping them
down. First -- at first nobody believe they stay on the very long. So it reflects the
permanence that people feel will be attached to the lower rates, but when you get the
30-year bond down to 2.8%, you're able to have transactions take place. It makes houses
more attractive. I mean it's been a very smart policy but the unwind of it has got to be
more difficult by far than buying, I mean it's very easy if you're the Fed to buy $85 billion a
month, and I don't know what would happen if they started trying to sell $85 billion.
Now, when you've got the banks with loads of reserves there that it might -- it certainly be
a lot easier than if those reserves that are already been deployed out into the real
economy. Then you would really be tightening things up. But I am -- this is like watching a
good movie as far as I'm concerned and because I do not know the end and that's what
makes for a good movie. So we will be back here next year and I will or maybe in two or
three years and I will tell you, I told you so and hope you have a bad memory. Charlie?

FINAL

Well, I strongly suspect that interest rates aren't going to stay this low for hugely
extended periods. But as I pointed out practically everybody has been very surprised by
what's happened. Because what's happened would have seemed impossible to
practically all intelligent people not very long ago. At Berkshire, of course, we got this
enormous float in the insurance business and our incremental float we're carrying huge
amounts of cash is worth less than it was in the old days and that I suppose you'd give
some surety to you people because if that changes we may get an advantage.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah, we have $40 billion at the end of the first quarter, we had whatever was $48 billion
or $49 billion or something like that in short-term securities. We are learning basically
nothing on that. We do not -- we never stretch for yield in terms of commercial paper
brings 10 basis points more than treasury, our money. We don't count on anybody else. So
we keep it in treasuries basically. And so we're earning nothing on that. So if we get back
to an environment where short-term rates are 5% and we would still have the same
amount then that would be a couple billion dollars of annual earnings pre-tax that we
don't have now, but of course, it would have lots of other effects in our business. We have
benefited significantly and the country has benefited significantly by what the Fed has
done in the last few years. And if they can successfully pull off a reversal of this without
getting a lot of surprises and we'll have been a lot better off. Cliff ?

Thank you.
Cliff incidentally, you ran at 240 last year, didn't you in the marathon at Lincoln?
I was in Lincoln marathon after the (inaudible)
We've got, we've got incredible talent on this.
I wanted to ask you more about the commercial insurance business to Berkshire's interest.
If the business is attractive, why not make an acquisition. Do you think that public company
valuations are too high today?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. There are too many commercial operations that we would want to inquire big ones
there, it wouldn't do much. I mean, we've acquired -- when we acquired GUARD Insurance
as workers' compensation, but it's just -- it's a small acquisition, it's a good acquisition but
that is a commercial in effect underwriter that we acquired like last year.
But if you look at the big ones, some of them we wouldn't want, there's a couple that we
would, but the prices would be probably far higher than what we think we might be able
to develop a comparable operation for. I mean we in effect, I think we're going to build a
very large commercial operation. And essentially we build our book value, and we pick up
no bad habits of other companies at least we hope we don't.

FINAL

So it's really better to build and buy if you can find the right people with the right mindset
and that everything in the business. And we've got a terrific manager, obviously Ajit, and
these other people have sought him out. So I think if there were certain commercial
operations that we could have bought them at the right price we'd have done it. But
we've not been able to do that. So we'll build our own and I predict then that we will have
a good and significant commercial insurance operation in a relatively short time. Okay.

Good morning. My name is Benjamin. I'm from Appleton, Wisconsin. And I had a question

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

That would certainly be my exact reaction but I don't -- I'm really looked into it but I I'll put
it this way. Of our $49 billion we haven't moved any to Bitcoin. Well the truth is I don't
know anything about it. That doesn't always stop me from talking about things but it will in
this case. Okay, Andrew.

Q - Analyst
Okay. Bill Ackman the Activist Investor who's also a Berkshire investor as well has raised
questions in recent months about the legality of the multi-level marketing company
Herbalife, he called it a pyramid scheme. Berkshire owns a multi-level marketing company
too, the Pampered Chef. Will Ackman's attack on Herbalife have any impact on the
Pampered Chef or Berkshire? And do you believe Ackman's concerns are legitimate? How
do you think about the debate over multi-level marketing companies and decipher, which
ones are legitimate and which ones are not?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah, I don't know anything, I've never actually even looked at a 10-K of Herbalife. So I do
not know about their operation. But I think the key obviously is whether a direct marketing
operation is really based on selling product who would be distributors of one sort, and
loading them up. And instead of said this in effect selling it to end users and a Pampered
Chef is 1 million miles away from anything where the money is made in anyway by selling
the level A and then those people selling the level B and all that sort of thing.

It is true that certain people -- lots of people get paid on the results, the selling results so
other people that they recruit. But this business of loading up people with a couple
hundred dollars, package or something that they never sell and that being sort of the
main business, and I don't know anything about Herbalife on this. I do know about
Pampered Chef and that is not Pampered Chef's business.
Pampered Chef's business is based on selling to the end user and we have thousands
and thousands and thousands of parties every week where people were actually going to
use the product buy it from somebody. And we are not making it, we're not making the
money by loading up people and then having them leave the sales force and our profit
coming from that, Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

I think that should be the distinguishing characteristic, if I were regulating the industry, I
would look very hard at operations where thousands of people got their hopes as to
earning a living by selling the product invested their savings and buying a whole bunch of
product that they didn't need themselves. And then, sort of being abandoning the hope
and being left with the product and the parent companies are the some of the -- the main
companies just going out and selling millions and millions of people on a dream, that was
not fulfilled. Johnny?

Q - Analyst
Warren. Much of Berkshire's returns over the last decade have been based on your
reputation and your ability to extract remarkable deals from company's interests as
compared to the past when you conducted yourself more as a value investor digging and
conducting extensive analysis. What gives you confidence that your successes imprimatur
will be as valuable to Berkshire's as yours has been?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well the successor will probably have even more capital to work with and they will have
capital presumably from time to time when markets are in distress and at those times
very few people, two people have a capital and a lot fewer people have the willingness to
commit. But I have no question that my successor will have unusual capital at times when

Page 24 of 107



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2013-05-04

FINAL

at turbulent times when the ability to say, yes very quickly with very large sums sets you
apart from virtually anybody in the investing universe.
And I would not worry about that successor being willing to deploy capital under those
circumstances, and being called upon. I mean that Berkshire is the 800 number. When
there's really sort of panic end markets and for one reason or another people need
significant capital. Now that's not our main business. It happened a couple times in 2008.
It happened once in 2011, but that's not been our main business, but it's fine and it'll
happen again.
And I would think if you come to a day when the dollar has fallen a thousand points a day
for a few days, and the tide has gone out and we are finding out who's been swimming
naked, that those naked swimmers may call Berkshire. They will call Berkshire if they need
lots of money. And Berkshire's reputation will become even more solidified in terms of
being willing to provide capital for sound deals at times when most people are frozen,
and when that happens, when I'm not around, it becomes even more the Berkshire brand,
and not anything attached to a single individual. Charlie?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, I would argue that in the early days, Warren had a huge success as a value investor in
little loan companies because his competition was so small. He stayed in that field. You
would have to be in bigger companies, and he's competition would be way more intense.
He's gotten into a field being a good home for big companies that don't want to be
controlled in meticulous detail by headquarters, where there isn't much competition. So I
would argue that he's done exactly the right thing and it's ridiculous to think that the past
is the thing he should have stayed in.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

But we will send, I think he's probably referring to something like the Bank of America

FINAL

A - Unidentified Speaker
Hi, my name is Andre from Beverly Hills, California. During very key events like the
Sanborn incident, when you were buying See's or when you were buying Berkshire stocks,
you persuaded people to sell you their shares when they really didn't want to what were
your three keys to influencing people in those specific situations.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah, I don't think you're brought up Sanborn and you brought up See's and I don't think
the See's family, there's been a debt in the See's family.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Was Larry See he wasn't at the time.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And he'd been the instrumental, I guess grandson of Mary See and the operator and
there was a rest of the family really didn't want to run the business. So it was put up for
sale and I didn't even hear about it until they had one other party. I don't even know who it
was, but they negotiated deal with and that it didn't go through. Charlie probably
remembers this better than I do, but we certainly See family and Charlie persuaded me to
buy it that we didn't persuade them to sell it. Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yeah, we didn't buy anything from any unwilling sellers. And in Berkshire we started buying
that 1962 in the open market. It had quite a few shareholders. It was a -- it traded fairly
actively and we bought a lot of stock and we did buy a couple of key pieces. We bought
one for Otis Stanton who is Seabury Stanton's brother, but Otis wanted to sell. It wasn't
the most attractive business in the world. I mean, it was a textile company that lost money
in most of the previous years and over a 10-year period that had significant losses. And it
was a northern textile company.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

So we bought stock in the market. A lot of stock in the market, we had two big blocks
from Otis Stanton from some relatives of Malcolm case but they were happy to sell with. I
never met at the time I bought the stock from Otis Stanton I had never met him. So I
delivered no personal sales to him. And the same thing is true of the Chase family that,
not Malcolm himself but some relatives they sold us a block of a 100,000 shares. But we
were not out convincing anybody to sell their stock. So they've been very little that I can
remember where we talked to Betty Peters about avoiding a transaction we thought was
done when months ago was considered merging with Financial Corp Santa Barbara I flew
out to see her in San Francisco. But she stayed with us. She did not sell her stock and
remains a shareholder to this day, 30-plus years, almost 40 years later.

{BIO 7137249 <GO>}

This question comes from Mark Troutman of Crested Butte, Colorado. And you've
touched on this Warren and Charlie on little fringes today. But this is a direct question.
Warren, both you and Charlie have described over the years, how you have built Berkshire
Hathaway to be sustainable stainable for the long term. I am having difficulty explaining to
my 13 year old daughter and frankly too many adults also in easy to understand terms
Berkshire's business model and long-term sustainable competitive advantage. Can you
give all of us and particularly my daughter Katie who is here today the Peter Lynch 2
minute monologue explaining the business of Berkshire Hathaway and its merits as a long
time investments for future decades?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Okay. Charlie you talk to Katie. I'm going to have some fudge.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

I'll try that. We've always tried to say the same and other people a lot of them like to go
crazy. That's a competitive advantage. Number two, as we've gotten bigger, we've used a
sort of golden rule that we want to treat the subsidiaries the way we would want to be
treated if we were in the subsidiaries. And that again is a very rare attitude in corporate
America, and it causes people to come to us who don't want to come anybody else, that
are a long-term competitive advantage.
You've tried to be a good partner to people who come to us and need a partner with
more money that is the competitive advantage. And so we are leaving behind a field
that's very competitive and getting into a place where we're more unusual. This was a
very good idea. I wish we've done it on purpose.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

A few years ago a person who is in this audience I believe came to me and he was in his
60s. And he said that for about a year, I've been thinking about selling his business, and
the reason he'd been thinking about it was not because he want to retire and we're not -we very seldom buy business from people who want to retire. He didn't want to retire at
all, he was loved what he was doing.
But he had an experience in buying business a few years earlier from a family where he
had known the fellow that build it, a fellow had died and then just everything bad started
happening in the family and the business and the employees everything else. So he really
wanted to put to bed the question of what happened with his business, he wasn't really

Page 27 of 107



FINAL

Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity

cared a lot about monetizing it or having the money. He just wanted to -- he want to put
his mind at ease that what he spent lovingly building up over 30 or 40 years was not
going to get destroyed or that his family would get destroyed, if he made a -- if he died
so he said he thought about it a year and he thought about it and he thought well if I sell it
to one of my competitors, and they would be a logical buyer they usually are, is why we
have antitrust laws, if he sold it to a competitor they would come in and basically they
would put their people in charge they would have all these ideas about synergy, and
synergy would mean that the people that helped him build the business over 30 years
would all get sacked and that the acquiring company would come in like Attila the Hun and
be the conquering people and he just didn't want to do that to the people that had
helped him over the years.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then he thought he could -- he might sell it to some private equity firm and they
figured that, if he sold to them, they loaded up with debt what she didn't like, and then
they resell it later on. And then -- so he would have again lost control, he might do the
same thing that he didn't want to have happen in the first place in terms of selling it to a
competitor or whatever it might be.
So when he came to me he said, he described this and he said it really isn't because
you're so attractive, but he said you're the only guy left standing. I mean, yeah, you're not
a competitor. You're not a private equity firm and I know I will get a permanent home with
Berkshire and that the people that have stayed with me over the years will continue to get
opportunities, and they will continue to work for me. And I'll get to keep doing what I love
doing, and I won't have to worry about what will happen if something happens to me
tonight. Well, that company has turned out to be a wonderful acquisition for Berkshire and
our competitive advantages, we had no competitors.
And I think well, we will see more of that. We've seen a lot of it over the years. We'll see
more of it. Charlie anything?
And I don't think you mentioned the fact that developing a shareholder base still it's
different than -- we do look at shareholders as partners and it's not something in a public
relations firm work force or anything of that sort. We want you to get the same result. We
get and we try to demonstrate that in every way we can. Jonathan?

Q - Jonathan Brandt

{BIO 17988091 <GO>}

I have a couple of questions about Burlington Northern's two energy franchises coal and
crude. Given that cold fire generation is in gradual structural decline, can you discuss
whether the tracks locomotives and other assets used to deliver coal can be redeployed
equally profitable serving other customers. Are those assets fungible? Can you also
discuss whether crude by rail can continue to grow even as pipelines are built to serve the
Bakken and as the currently large geographic spreads and crude prices potentially narrow,
you've talked about the flexibility of crude by rail on TV, can you elaborate on that please?

A - Warren E. Buffett

Page 28 of 107



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc

FINAL

Yeah. There was no coal moving. We would not find a lot of use for some of the tracks we
have, there's no question about that. So, I think what you're talking about it would be very
gradual over time. But I mean the outlook for coal is not the same as the outlook for oil. A
lot of the coal in terms of the year-by-year fluctuations may depend on the price of
natural gas, because some of the generating capacity can go in either direction.
In terms of oil I think the view a few years ago was that, there might just be a little blip in
terms of rail transportation. But I've talked to some oil producers, the largest up there in
the Bakken and I think there will be a lot of rail usage for a long time. In fact increased rail
usage. Oil moves a whole lot faster incidentally by rail than it does by pipeline. Most
people have sort of a visual conception that the oil is flowing at terrific speech through
pipelines into the rail cars are sitting on the sidelines someplace but it's just the opposite
you can move oil a lot faster.
And with change -- with different market prices and different refinery situations and all
that, there's a lot of flexibility in the oil transportation by rail. Matt Rose is right up front
here and if somebody give him a microphone, I think he can probably tell you a lot more
about moving coal and oil than I can. Matt? We got a spotlight some place that can focus
right out here in front.

A - Unidentified Speaker

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. So Warren, the two franchises are really different. That's just the way the geographic
is laid out. We expect the coal franchise to basically stay about where it is today
depending on natural gas prices as well as what happens with the EPA.
Our crude by rail right now we have about 10 loading stations in the Bakken with about 30
destination stations. We're currently in negotiation looking at about another 30
destination stations. So it's really exciting time right now. We're handling about 650,000
barrels of crew today. We think will be at 750,000 by the end of this year and we see a
pathway to 1.2 million to 1.4 million.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

When you think of the whole country producing 5 million barrels a day, not long ago that is
a lot of oil. And of course, it isn't just the Bakken, the shell developments. They can open
up a lot of things over time at that. Okay. Station 7.

Q - Analyst
Good morning Warren and Charlie. My name is Bill Hensey from Milwaukee Wisconsin. I
have a similar question. Back in 2009 you made a substantial investment in HarleyDavidson with a five-year term at 15%. I noticed that it now o comes due in 2014,what are
your plans or thoughts once that investment comes due?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, what we'd like to do is not answer the mail and I guess let them keep paying at 15%
but that won't happen. Those were -- we had a few private transactions during a period

when the corporate bond market was basically frozen, and received unusual terms
although the best terms of this company is obviously could have obtained at that time and
those deals are coming due and I wish the five-year deals have been tenure deals. And -but those -- that was a special time and in effect that's a depleting asset that we have
that's left over from five years ago.
We won't see anything like that for a while, but we'll see similar things at some point in
the future I mean, the world is given the access is, and they have consequences and we
are always willing to act and we did not think Harley-Davidson was going to go broke. I
mean it was that simple any kind of company that gets its customers to tattoo ads on
their chests can't be all bad. But it will be a sad day when Harley-Davidson notes mature.

This question comes from Andishy Tuzush who asks, if Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, if
they purchased stock in a company that you have reviewed before and did not believe to
be a good investment, would you share your thoughts with them?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I would probably not know they were even buying it until maybe a month after they
started. I do not -- they do not check with me before they buy something. I gave them
each and other billion dollars on March 31st, and I do not know whether they've spent $1
billion or whether which stocks they bought.
Now, I will see it on portfolio sheets. I got a monthly, but they're in charge of their
investment. They got a one or two things that are restricted on in terms of things that, for
example, we own a chunk of American Express and under the bank holding company law,
we would not be allowed to buy another share. So there's a couple of things like that that
restrictions they have. But otherwise wise, they have no restrictions on what they buy, they
bought things I wouldn't buy. I buy things they wouldn't buy that's part of the investment
process.
I do not tell them how much to diversified they can put it all in one stock if they want to.
They can put it in 50 stocks, although that's not my style, they are managing money and
when I manage the money, I wanted to be a free agent, if he wanted to give me them,
they can make the decision where they want to give me the money, but once they gave
me the money and I had the responsibility for managing it, I wanted free rein to do what I
wanted, and I did not want to be held responsible things with my hands tied, and that's
exactly the position we have with Todd and Ted now. It takes a lot of -- it's an unusual
person that we will give that kind of responsibility so that's not something the Charlie and
I would do lightly at all. But we thought they deserve the trust when we hired them and we
believe that more than ever after washing them in action for a time. Charlie?

Thank you. I want to ask a follow-up question about snapshot at Progressive. I realize that
GEICO's first quarter numbers are very good, things are going very well to company but
Progressive is claiming that the data is profound that they're getting from snapshot that
they can give their best drivers 30% rate cuts and those customers are still their most
profitable customers. We have a lot of GEICO policyholders here today. I'm sure they're
very good drivers. Why shouldn't they go try Snapshot and try to save 30% or more? Why
isn't GEICO investing in what I think appears to be incredible underwriting tool and
potential threat.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I don't think but obviously Aggressive disagrees with us but I don't think their selection
method is better than ours. And, I would say that I might even feel that ours is a little bit
better than theirs. But every company has a different approach to it. Peter Lewis who runs
Progressive when he started the company, he told me the story himself and it was a tiny,
tiny little company came out of a mutual company as you know. And one of the
motorcycle business and the first guy that he insured or the first loss it was reported
came from some guy that was red-headed and he just decided not to ensure any
redheads for a while that -- when you don't have very much money, you can't afford the
experiment too long.
Well, Peter learned that, that was not a criteria and he knew that they had fun telling the
story. But all we're trying to do with. If I'm looking at it all these people here and I'm going
to issue insurance policies for the next year. I'm going to charge different rates to
different people.
And if I'm going to sell them life insurance I'm going to charge different rates to them. I
want to sell them health insurance. I'm going to charge different rates. There is a different
probability attached to each individual based on a whole a lot of variables at Progressive.
Before Snapshot, they had a different selection approach than GEICO and like I say, ours
has worked very well and we think it will continue to work well, and we are obtaining under
our selection system. We are obtaining a hugely disproportionate number of new
policyholders compared to the growth in the market.
So our rates are attractive and our underwriting results are attractive. And we continue
always to look for further ways obviously to refine the selection technique. But we don't
do any of it lightly because what we're doing now is working very well. And I just invite you
to compare the Progressive results with the GEICO results in the next two or three years
and I will -- if we're wrong I will be here to freely admit that we were wrong but I don't
think we will be.
Okay. Station 8. Oh, Charlie, you want to add anything on that?

Obviously, we're not going immediately copy the oddball things that every single
competitor does in the world. Particularly, when we got an operation and that's working so
well. If I were starting in the direct auto insurance business, I think Is would attempt to
copy GEICO who wouldn't work, but it would offer you the best chance, I think it's a
remarkable system and Tony Nicely you can't give him enough credit I mean it is
incredible. We will -- I hope we will gain a million policies this year. The entire industry I
don't think will gain more than 1.5 million. So we will probably get 2/3, in my view we'll get
2/3 of all the growth and we'll do it very -- and we'll do it profitably, and will save people a
lot of money. So I think that's quite a company.
Okay. Station 8.

Q - Analyst
Hi, my name is Alex and I'm from Los Angeles. Mr.Buffett I've heard that one of your ways
of focusing your energy is that you write down the 25 things you want to achieve, choose
the top five and then avoid the bottom 20. I'm really curious how you came up with this
and what other methods you have to prioritizing your desires.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, I'm actually more curious about how you came up with it because it really isn't it the
case. It sounds like a very good method of operating, but it's much more disciplined than I
actually am. If they stick fudge down in front of me I eat it I am not thinking about 25 other
choices. So I don't mean to Charlie and I live very simple lives. We know what we do enjoy
and we now have the option of doing a pretty much. Charlie likes to design buildings. I
mean, he's not a -- he's no longer a frustrated architect he's a full-fledged architect now.
And we both like to read a lot but we -- I've never made less. I can't recall making a list in
my life but maybe I'll start. You've given me an idea. Thank you. Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

What's really interesting on this subject of Warren's operating methods, you can see
happening here. We didn't know when we started out this modern psychological evidence
to the effect that you shouldn't make a lot of important decisions when you're tired and
that's making a lot of difficult decisions is tiring. And we didn't also know as well as we
now do how helpful it is to be consuming caffeine and sugar when you're making
important decisions.
And what happens of course is that both Warren and I live entirely on autopilot in terms of
the ordinary decisions of life. We're just totally habitual so we won't work waste any
decision-making industry. I mean energy and that stuff were just in caffeine and sugar. And
it turns out a little bothered evidence, this is an ideal way to sit where Warren sits. And
what he didn't know that he just stumbled into it.

I cannot remember decision that Warren has made when he was tired. He's never tired.
He sleeps soundly and he doesn't waste time thinking about what he's going to eat you
say he just eats what he is always eating. His style turns out to be absolutely ideal for
human cognition. It looks peculiar, but he stumbled into something very good.

Q - Andrew Ross Sorkin

{BIO 6340618 <GO>}

This following question comes from a shareholder who asked to remain anonymous. They
write, I'm from Omaha, and I'm thrilled you bought our newspaper as a local. Citizen but
not so much as an investor in Berkshire. I read your reasons for acquiring newspapers but
it still doesn't make sense to me economically given the downward trends in the industry.
Don't you think there are other businesses with higher rates of return that you could buy?
Why would you buy such a small business since you always say you want to buy
elephants? Please quantify exactly what rate of return you expect from the newspapers?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. I would say that we will get a decent rate of return. Whether it's most of them
incidentally have been bought and they were either as corporations or partnerships of
some sort. So they compare to buying a Heinz for example or BNSF or something of this
sort. They actually have a certain structural advantage in terms of the eventual return after
tax because we get to write-off the intangibles repurchasing that affects the after-tax
return compared to the pre-tax return that would come from this. But I would say that our
after-tax return with declining earnings which I expect would be at least 10% after tax, but I
think and a goodwill be somewhat higher.
I think it's very unlikely that it would be significantly lower and everything we have seen
today and it hasn't been that long but we have a number of papers now would indicate
that, we will meet or beat the 10%. It doesn't have -- it's not going to move the needle at
Berkshire. The papers we have bought now we're probably getting close to maybe having
$100 million of pre-tax earnings, a good bit of which is -- a fair amount of which we get a
favorable tax treatment on because they were bought from mesh corporations. And on
$100 million is real money, but it doesn't move the needle at Berkshire. But it will end up
being a very -- I think it'll be a perfectly decent return in relation to capital employed.
Now, we wouldn't have done it in any other business. I mean there is no question he is
right about that. But it doesn't require an extra ounce of effort by me or Charlie or people
at headquarters. We will get a decent return and we like newspapers and the one thing I'll
promise to do with you is I will be glad to give you figures annually as to how we are doing
relative to investment.
We are buying the papers at very, very low prices, compared to current earnings, and we
must do that because the earnings will be down. Now the interesting thing is of course is
that we see books from investment bankers and all kinds of businesses and always the
Page 33 of 107

projected earnings go up in the book. A lot of times they don't go -- in reality they don't
go off, the difference is that we expect them to go down in the newspapers and
whatever the investment salesman expect they certainly don't project that any business
they sell will have declining earnings. Charlie?

Q - Doug Kass

{BIO 3559809 <GO>}

I thought you would say that. You're going to move Berkshire will likely move to a more
centralized style or approach to management. My question is in the past, you've
demonstrated a great deal of respect for Dr.Henry Singleton, the Founder and longtime
CEO of the diversified conglomerate Teledyne. You have written about Singleton quote.
Henry is a manager that all investors, CEOs would be CEOs and MBA students should
study. In the end, he was 100% rational and there are very few CEOs about whom I can
make that statement close quotes.
Prior to his death he broke up Teledyne into three companies. Dr.Singleton told our mutual
friend Lee Cooperman that he did it for several reasons. There was one reason in
particular that Lee mentioned to me that I want to ask you about. According to Singleton,
Teledyne was getting very hard to manage for one CEO. What would you say about the
Berkshire situation, given your company's greater complexity, size, and the management
issues that you faced in the last few years? And what is the advisability of restructuring
Berkshire into separately-traded companies along business lines?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Berkshire, to me, seems about the easiest company to manage imaginable. And if you
took an earlier answer and I understand why you did, that implied greater centralization
after my death, there will be a tiny bit more, just in terms of the small companies. But I do
not anticipate any change of any real significance.
Now, Charlie knew Henry Singleton, and I think it might be interesting for Charlie to give
you his views on what Singleton did right and, eventually, wrong. And, I'll answer the last

Page 34 of 107



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity

part of your question. But breaking it up into several companies, I'm convinced, would
produce a poorer result certainly now, and I believe in the future. Charlie?

FINAL

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, Henry Singleton was a genius who could play chess blindfolded just below the
grandmaster level and never got less than an 800 on any complicated math or physics
exam. And, I knew him. He lived in my community.
But he started as a conglomerate where he was very interested in reporting higher
earnings all the time so he could keep the daisy chain going. And when he managed it on
the way down, he bought in the stock relentlessly and very logically, like a great chess
player should. And -- but he managed those companies on a way more centralized basis
than Berkshire has ever operated. And in the end, the great bulk of the enterprises, he
wanted to sell to us. And by that time he was ill and he really wanted to sell to us. And of
course, he wanted Berkshire stock. And we basically said to him, Henry, we love you and
we'd love to buy your businesses, but we don't want to issue Berkshire stock. So, I don't
think you should get the idea that just because he was a genius he did it better than we
did. He did, in some ways, because he understood these very high-tech businesses, but --

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

He played the public markets way better. I mean we're not interested in doing that
actually.

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

And he was incredible in that, and he made a fortune for shareholders that stayed with
him. But he was --- to some extent, he looked at the shareholder group as somebody to
be taken advantage of, and he issued stock like crazy. I'll bet he did at least 50
acquisitions where he wanted to use a very fancy price stock. He was playing the game of
the '60s, and we actually have never wanted to get in that game.
I mean, he promoted the stock. He had the Litton Industries background on it, and it was a
game that worked wonderfully if you didn't care about how it ended up.
And so we have not played that game. He was -- in terms of wanting to get Berkshire
stock he essentially was going into the third stage of first issuing shares at overprice, then
buying it back very underpriced, and then he was going to --

Q - Analyst
Hi, my name is Kelly Morrell from New York, and I have a question. You've been both very
outspoken on corporate and personal tax rates, as well as the trade deficit. And I'm
wondering if you can elaborate on what the top two or three things you think both
business leaders and policy makers should be focused on to preserve U.S.
competitiveness?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, I would say healthcare cost would be a big item. We're spending -- we're a country
that's spending, we'll say -- you get different figures but call it 17.5% or so of GDP. And
most of our rivals in the world are paying anywhere from, probably, 9.5% to maybe, 11.5%
or thereabout. So, there are only 100 cents in the dollar, and if you give up 6 or 7 or 8
points of that dollar, I mean, it's just like having a raw material that costs you more or
something of the sort. So, that will be a major problem in American competitiveness, it is
right now and it will -- all signs point to the fact that it will become more so.
And it doesn't relate to the Medicare problem which is a huge problem, obviously, but the
real problem is health care costs, whether it's in the private system or whatever payer
system you have. We have a big, big disadvantage in cost versus the rest of the world.
People used to talk about how General Motors had $1,500 a car in healthcare cost that
Toyota didn't have. Well, if they had $1,500 a car disadvantage in steel costs, I mean, the
management would be focused on that. If they had $150 -- if they had $15 difference in
steel cost, but health care costs, which are sort of beyond the control of any one
company, promise to be a huge competitive disadvantage.
Overall, though, incidentally, I mean, the United States -- since the crisis of 2008 we have
done very well, compared to most countries, and our system works. But if you asked me
the number one problem for American business, I would say it's that healthcare cost
disadvantage. Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, I would add that I don't think it does our competitiveness any good to have this
grossly swollen securities and derivative markets. And the young men from Caltech and

Carol?

Q - Carol Loomis

{BIO 7137249 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

This question picks up, indeed, from where you were on the previous answer. It's from
John Sealme. I have never heard or read whether all of Berkshire's nearly 300,000
employees are currently receiving health benefits. If all employees today are not receiving
benefits, has Berkshire quantified the cost of complying with the Affordable Care Act?
And if so, what will be the costs be? In other words, how is the Affordable Care Act going
to affect Berkshire?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. I don't know the answer to that. The-- I'm virtually certain that we've got 70plus
subsidiaries, some of which -- one of which has over 100 itself. It's very hard to speak
totally categorically. But to my knowledge, I don't know of any units that don't have
healthcare benefits. But like I say, I mean, we just bought 27 or 28 daily newspapers, some
of them are very small, so I can't really speak to every single unit.
But healthcare costs are huge costs for us. We're actually going to do -- we do very few
things with as you know on a centralized basis but that is something where all of our
companies will try to learn what's in store for them and try to figure out some answers.
But we have not yet -- we have not assessed in any way put together the kind of figures
that that question calls for. We spent a lot of money, obviously, I mean, to get up to the
kind of numbers that are coming through on healthcare costs. I see them at some of our - a few of our individual units, as I look at their monthly reports. I will see costs rising 10%
or 12%.
And what happens in 2014, I don't know. But the same thing will be happening to our
competitors, and we will try to figure out what makes the most sense at that time. And
our individual managers are already working, particularly the larger units, are spending a
lot of time on that. But it's not something we try to control out of headquarters.

Jonathan?

Q - Jonathan Brandt

{BIO 17988091 <GO>}

Here's a question for Charlie on a subject which I consider him an expert on, and I hope I
don't prove my ignorance by asking the question. The question is about capital spending
plans at your regulated utilities and a potential long-term risk to realizing returns on
current and future capacity.
With the ongoing reduction in the cost of solar panels causing more utility customers to,
at least, consider generating electricity from their own rooftops, some worry about a
vicious circle of customers reducing their dependence on the grid, forcing utilities to raise
rates, to maintain returns on the remaining customers who, in turn, are then incentivized
to reduce their dependence on the grid, or even exit it.

Bloomberg Transcript

I understand the risks are greatest to regulated utilities in sunny places like Arizona and
California, but given how much solar power is generated in cloudy places like Germany
are regulated utilities in Iowa, the Pacific Northwest, the Rocky Mountains, and the UK
really immune?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, my answer would be I don't think anybody really knows exactly how this is going to
play out. I confidently predict there will be more solar generation in deserts than there is
going to be on rooftops in cloudy places and there's a good reason for that. And
Berkshire's big operations, as you in solar are in what amounts to desert. And we get very
favorable terms and incentives, and I think Berkshire's going to do fine in solar.
I am skeptical, myself, about trying to run the utilities of the world from a bunch of little,
tiny rooftops. I suspect there are some twaddle in that and some fancy salesmanship in
that arena. And of course, the people that did it early were foolish because the price
came down rapidly thereafter. So put me down as not totally charmed by rooftops in
cloudy areas.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

We have Greg Abel here from MidAmerican Energy. If we can direct a spotlight down
there, Greg can probably speak to this with a lot more intelligence than Charlie and I. I
noticed that Jonathan left me out of the thing entirely when he wanted to get an
intelligent answer, but I'm not taking any offense at that. Greg?

Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc

Sure. Happy to touch on it. Jonathan, I would touch on the fact you're absolutely right.
We're seeing, when it comes to rooftop solar, a decline in the total cost of installing them.
At the same time, when you compare it to a regional tariff, or a specific tariff in most of
those states, the utility is extremely still competitive. And I would highlight that as you see
more rooftops coming on, you'll see a restructuring of the tariffs, but at the same time,
there's a lot of protection for the utilities. So in the regions we're supplying power, we will
see some introduction of solar, but we're absolutely comfortable our systems for the
long-term are valuable both to our customers, and to our shareholders to Berkshire
shareholders for the long term. Thanks.

Thank you. Marc Matzoth, Toronto, Canada. Bill Gross made recent comments that his

today's investors? Thank you.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, there's no question that being born in the United States was a huge, huge, huge
advantage to me, and as I've pointed out in a recent article being born male was a big
advantage. I would not have had the same opportunities in the investment or in the
business world, remotely, that I've had if I'd been a female born in 1930.
And the timing could have been a little better. Actually, my dad was a security salesman
and, I was conceived in November, 1929. And if you remember, the stocks had gone down
dramatically at that time. There really wasn't anybody to call on, for my dad, and there
wasn't any television at home or anything. So here I am, you know. So I feel myself very
lucky that the crash of 1929 AND I came along.
And that also provided a decade more than a decade, of people who were very turned
off. Well, it was a decade of terrible business for quite a while, and then a decade of or
more of people that were turned off on stocks, just as we sort of had a decade like that in
the past decade going up to 2010 or so, people that -- a lot of people that had gotten
turned off by stocks. So that was a favorable environment. But the United States itself was
an incredibly favorable environment. If I'd been born five years earlier, I probably would
have made more money. But if I'd been born 10 or 15 years later, I would've made,
probably, less money.
But, it -- I envy the baby that's being born today in the United States. I mean, I think, on a
probability basis, that's the luckiest individual that's ever been born. And I think that they
will do very well in life in all kinds of ways, on a probability basis, better than existed one
when I was born.

And I think they'll have opportunities to do very well in the investment field, that may not
be as good a field as it was for me starting in 1950, '51 or thereabout but it will be a very
good field to operate in. And the person that has a passion for investing, born today,
coming at the age 20 years from now, is likely, in my view, to do very well, and to live far
better than we live today, just as we live far better than John D. Rockefeller lived many
years ago. Charlie?

FINAL

So insurance should be conducted as a rational activity. And one of the problems that
some insurers have had is that they would have a pressure for increasing premium
volume every year, brought upon by Wall Street, very few. We actually contracted the
business written by National Indemnity, formerly our main businesses, traditional business,
I think we contracted it, probably, by 80% or something of the sort when the business
became less attractive.
I'm not sure any manager of a public company that was answering to quarterly earnings
calls and that sort of thing, I'm not sure whether they could've really stood up to the kind
of pressure that they would receive if they followed a similar policy. We have no -- if we do
something stupid, it's because we did something stupid. It's not -- no external factors are
pressing on us. And that's a great way to operate, and it'll continue to be the way we
operate.

Bloomberg Transcript

Most people, if you own a 0.5% or 1% of the company or less, and other people are doing
things that Wall Street is applauding and you're not doing them, it could be very hard to
resist. And you respond to media criticism and all kinds of things that we don't have to do
it. And there's no reason for us to do anything stupid in insurance. You get offered a lot of
opportunities to do things that are stupid. We were major writers of catastrophe -- natural
catastrophe insurance in the United States some years ago when the prices were right.
We don't think the prices are right now, so we don't write it. We haven't left the market,
the market left us. And -- but we are not about to do something where we get paid $0.90
for running a probabilistic loss of a dollar. It just doesn't make any sense and we won't do
it. And we don't put any pressure on anybody to do it and their incomes are not
dependent on doing it. So it's not hard to be rational at Berkshire. Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yeah. There are pressures on other people that we don't want and therefore don't have.
It is very hard to shrink an insurance operation by 80% when the people who come in
every day don't have enough to do and it's just -- it's a counter-intuitive thing to do. But
it's absolutely required that you do it in a place where people go as crazy as they do in
insurance.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, it's like buying Internet stocks, in the late 1990s. I mean the all around you, you have
these people that have high IQs and they're doing it and they're being successful in it. So,
everybody from your, your spouse to your employer to the press says, how come all
these other -- how come do you think you're so smart avoiding this when everybody else
is doing it and they're making a lot of money? And, of course, it creates this social proof
where it works for a while.
That's the great danger period in all of these bubbles, is that what starts out with
skepticism ends up with your neighbor getting richer than you are because he went along
and you didn't. And that sort of thing the bandwagon effect and everything those things
are very hard to resist. But we don't have any pressures to do that sort of thing. I mean,
we just don't give a damn and if that we don't necessarily think we're smarter than the
other person on that. We just think we don't understand what it's all about. And if they can

make a lot of money, day trading or whatever it may be, good luck to them. But we're not
envious of them, but we certainly are not going to do it just because they're doing it.
Charlie, any more on that?

FINAL

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

I always say there's a reason why all that stuff is in the Bible. You can't covet your
neighbor's ass or -- I mean, they were having trouble with envy a long time ago. And it's a
perfectly terrible thing to do, and how much fun can you have being envious? We always
say it's the one sin there's no fun in.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Gluttony is a lot of fun. Lust has its place, too, but we won't get into that. Cliff ?

Q - Cliff Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

We can follow that up. Reinsurance pricing is expected to be down at midyear renewals
this year despite the fact that we've had lot catastrophes in recent years. The finger is
being pointed towards alternative capital entering the market, new capacity entering the
market. How concerned are you about this new capacity, and, what is the likelihood that
cheap reinsurance pricing soon leads to cheaper primary and commercial pricing?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. We hate dumb competition, and hedge fund -- managed money, but particularly
hedge funds have entered the insurance, and more particularly, probably, the reinsurance
business, quite aggressively in the last few years.
So one thing, it gives them a chance to have a beard, in effect to operate in Bermuda or
someplace where the tax rates are low and where they defer their own income from U.S.
income taxes for a long time, and it's a perfectly respectable beard. And it can be sold to
investors. And people talk about it, being an uncorrelated type of operation and all of
that. Anything Wall Street can sell, it will sell. I mean, you can count on that. And --

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

They like big words, too.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. And it's very salable now, and the money will flow in and the money will -- may bring
down prices, it may do stupid things in reinsurance, but that's happened beforehand in
the end, we know what we're willing to do, we know what we think the prices should be,
and we will do insurance business where we think that the odds favor us earning an
underwriting profit. And if we can't do it, we'll watch for a while. You can't afford, to go
along with the crowd in investment, insurance, or a whole lot of other things.

And it can be irritating to have a dumb competitor. I mean, if you've got a service station
on the corner and you've got a guy across the street that is willing to sell gas below cost,
you've got a terrible problem. That's why I got out of the gas station business a long time
ago. But insurance it's nice thing about it is the standby costs are not huge, so it's not like
idling steel plants or something. So we were perfectly willing in the 1980s to have our
expense ratio go up significantly because our volume went down so dramatically. And it
was a standby cost that was real, but it wasn't back breaking, and we just waited for
better days, and they came along.
Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

With our cranky, wait-it-out methods, we probably have ended up with the best largescale causality insurance operation in the world.

getting some sensational people. We've got Tad Montross at Gen Re, we've got Ajit Jain,
we've got Don Wurster, we've got Tony Nicely at GEICO.I mean we have just hit the
jackpot in terms of the people. And they like the environment of Berkshire in which to
operate, because they do not get pressures to do dumb things, which they would get at
many other places.
Okay. Station 11.

Q - Analyst
Hi. My name is Susan Tilson, and I'm from New York City. I am a long time shareholder, but
this is my first time to Omaha. This is quite the little gathering you've got going on here.
You, just a few minutes ago, Mr.Buffett, mentioned that you enjoyed a lot of advantages
as a male. I have three daughters, and I would like them to be able to go as far as their
aspirations and hard work take them. I've noticed and applaud the fact that you've added
Page 45 of 107

women to Berkshire's board, but both the board and senior management at Berkshire still
reflect the reality that in 2013 there are very few women holding the top jobs in corporate
America. Do you see this as a problem? And if so, what should be done about it?

FINAL

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, I do see it as a problem, and I've written an article in Fortune Magazine, which if you
go to Fortune.com, I guess it's in front of the paywall, you can click on it, it's only 1150
words or so. And you'll see my views on that. But there's no question that women
throughout my lifetime and for a millennia before that, have not had the same shot at
many things in the world that males have.
I mean, I have two sisters, as I pointed out in this article both are here today I believe. And
a couple of years on each side of me, and absolutely as smart as I am. They're more
personable than I am. They got along with people much better than I did when we were
young. Their grades were the same, but they did not have the same opportunities at all.

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean, nobody really wanted to limit them. Certainly, my parents love them the same way
as they felt about me, and they never would've dreamt of saying to them that, Warren
gets all these opportunities and you don't. But it just existed. And all my teachers in grade
school every one of them was a female. And the reason they were females is because
they only had a few occupations open to them. So, as a result, I had way better teachers
than I sort of deserved for the pay level that existed in it because all this talent was being
compressed into a few areas.
Well, a lot of improvement has been made but there's still ways to go. And there is a
pipeline effect, so I mean, you couldn't change it all in one day if you wanted to. But on
the other hand, that should not be an excused for not changing at all. And then I also
wrote about the fact that there's -- that when people are placed in that position, they
start believing it about themselves so they do not set their own objectives as high as their
potential would indicate.
And that's -- I use the example of Katharine Graham, who I knew quite well, and she was
very, very intelligent. She was very high-grade. She had all kinds of good qualities. But she
had been told by her mother, and she had been told by her husband, and she had been
told by society that women couldn't run businesses as well as men.
And she knew it wasn't true, but she couldn't get rid of it. And she saw herself in this
funhouse mirror, and it -- no matter how hard you tried, you couldn't really get rid of the
funhouse mirror. It had just been there too longhand I kept saying, you know, look at
yourself in a regular mirror, and you'll see somebody who's very smart and very highgrade and just as good as any male you'll find.
Her stock went up 40-for-1 when she was CEO. She wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning
autobiography. And to her dying day, she -- at one level she knew she was the equal of
the males around her, and at another level she couldn't get rid of that little voice inside of
her that came from her mother and came from all of society that said, you know, you
should take care of the garden and let the males do all the important work.

So, both the exterior obstacles they're crumbling to a very significant degree and they
should. I mean, it only took thousands of years. I mean as I pointed out in the article, we
said in the Declaration of Independence, we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
men are created equal, but they weren't so self-evident when they got around to writing
the constitution and they used a bunch of male pronouns in describing the presidency in
Article II or when they didn't get around to putting a Supreme Court, a female Supreme
Court justice on until 1981.So, the country has come a long way on it. It continues to move.
It's moving in the right direction.
But I hope it keeps moving and moving faster, and I hope that the females that are
laboring under these beliefs that were told to them about themselves that aren't true get
rid of the funhouse mirrors and get regular mirrors. And I say all this in this article if you
want to read it in Fortune.com. Thank you.
Okay. Andrew?

Q - Andrew Ross Sorkin

{BIO 6340618 <GO>}

You'll know why I'm asking this question in a second, and why I picked it. This question is
the following. Is Berkshire too big to fail? On the same topic --

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think I heard of a book by that name. Who wrote it?

Q - Andrew Ross Sorkin

{BIO 6340618 <GO>}

On the same topic, how do you feel about Dodd-Frank? And now that it's being
implemented, how is it impacting Berkshire's insurance businesses and our investments in
banks like Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. I don't think it's affecting Berkshire's insurance businesses, to my knowledge. I mean
we're -- we've had -- to my knowledge, we've never had anything that impinges on our
activity arising from a too-big-to-fail doctrine.
The capital ratios for large banks are being established at somewhat higher levels than
smaller banks, and that obviously affects return on equity. The ratios, as I understand it, for
Wells are not as high as they would be for Citi or J.P. Morgan, but they're higher than they
would be for a local bank in Omaha. And the higher the capital ratio, the lower the return
on equity will be. I consider the banking system in the United States to be stronger than,
certainly any time in the last 25 years.
Capital is dramatically higher. A lot of the -- well, a very significant part of the loans that
were troublesome are gone. The loans that have been put on the last four or five years
are far better. It's a I think we've got -- Canadian banking system is very strong, but
compared to Europe, I think our banks are or compared to our banks of 20 years ago I
think they're dramatically stronger than they were then.

FINAL

I do not worry about the banking system being the cause of the next bubble. I mean, it will
be something else. I mean, we will have bubbles in capitalism. Capitalism goes to excess,
and it's because of the humans that operate it. And we will have that again, but usually
you don't get it the same way as you got it before. I don't think it will be a housing boom
next time.
But, I am -- I feel very good about our investment in Wells Fargo. I feel very good about
our investment in U.S. Bank. I feel very good about our investment in Metal of those are
very strong banks pursuing, in my view, sound practices, and they should result -- they
should be decent investments over time. They won't earn as high a return on tangible
equity, nearly as high return as they would have seven or eight years ago, because the
rules have been changed. And they have been changed to provide thicker equities, and
that pulls down return on equity.
Charlie has been known to express himself on this subject, and I'll give him the floor.

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, I'm a little less optimistic about the banking system, long-term, than you are. I would
like to see something more extreme in terms of limiting bank activities. I do not see why
massive derivative books should be mixed up with insured deposits that are insured by
the country.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm with Charlie on that.

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

The more bankers want to be like investment bankers instead of bankers, the worse I like
it. I don't want to say more.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

I get in enough trouble on the subject already.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

I can see the journalists just licking their chops over there waiting for Charlie to throw a
thunderbolt, but he's unusually restrained.
We're now very close to noon. I've promised five years ago I wrote about five or six years
ago about the inordinate costs that investors bear and-- many investors bear ingesting
sold various types of products. And I talked about hedge funds and private equity and all
kind -- whole variety of things. The investment world has been very good at extracting a
very significant percentage of the returns that investors get for themselves. So I offered
Page 48 of 107



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2013-05-04

to bet anyone that wanted to step up to the plate that a group of hedge funds would not
beat unmanaged no-load index over a 10 year period.

FINAL

And I promised and then I got a taker, a very nice group of people. I like them. Ted Seides
and the Group. And they took me up on this. So we each put about $350,000 or so into
something where in 10 years -- well, we put it in zero-coupon treasuries, which would
mature and be worth $1 million in 10 years. And I promised to report on the bet every year.
And what we did this year, interest rates fell so far that our original $700,000 or so
investment got to be worth like $950,000 just because the five-year treasury got so low.
So there was very little appreciation left into it between now and five years from now
when it matures. So, we sold the zero-coupon treasuries and we bought Berkshire with
the proceeds, and I guarantee that it would be worth $1 million, currently it's worth about a
$1 million, $2 million, so that the charities are benefiting to some extent.
Now, Ted has one charity, which is a very worthwhile charity. And I have Girls Inc of Omaha,
which is a charity I selected. And we'll put the -- we can put the figures up on the --- there
as to where we stand at the moment.

Bloomberg Transcript

The hedge funds got off to a fast start, and were 13 points ahead of the index fund at the
end of the first year. But the last four years -- and these are funds of fund, so they really
represent probably 200 or 300, maybe hedge funds underneath. But there's two levels
of fees involved. There's the standard fees of the hedge funds, which probably many
times are 2 and 20, but can be other things, and then there's the fee of the fund of funds
on top of it.
So, we now are at the halfway point, and I'll keep reporting to you every year how we do.
And if Berkshire does well, we'll have well over $1 million to distribute to one or two
charities. You might enjoy going to a website called longbets.org. That's where -- they're
the people that hold the money.
And you will see that there are a number of propositions that people have wagered on,
and the proponents and the opponent of every proposition give a short little description.
Ted gave a description of why he thought he'd win. I gave a description of why I thought
I'd win.
But some of these are -- I just can't resist a couple of -- pointing out a couple of them. You
can see these on the web. But one of it is that a large collider will destroy the earth in 10
years. Now there's $1,000 bet on that, but I'm not sure who will collect the -- I thought that
was an interesting one. And there was one other, and then we'll go to lunch. But there are
a number of these that are quite interesting.
At least one human alive in the year 2000 will still be alive in 2150. Now, that's 148 years
from when the bet was entered, there's a $2,000 bet on that. And I hope Charlie is in
contention for the -- being the winner of that one.

{BIO 3559809 <GO>}

Thank you, Warren. Mae West once said, the score never interested me, only the game.
Are you at the point now where the game interests you more than the score? But before
you answer the question, let me explain to you why I asked it. In the past, your research
has been all-encompassing, whether measured in time devoted to selecting investments
and acquisitions, or the intensity of analysis, your interest in the old days of knowing the
slightest minutia about a company.
You once said, in characterizing Ben Rosner, "Intensity is the price of excellence "Your
research style has seemed to morph over time from a sleuth-like analysis American
Express comes into mind when you hired Jonathan's dad, Henry Brandt. You and he
conducted weeks of analysis and site visits and channel checks. Not so much in the later
investments. As an example, you famously thought of making the Bank of America
investment in your bathtub. There is an investment message of this transformation from
being intense to less intense.

Bloomberg Transcript

Would you please explain the degree it has to do with the market, Berkshire's size, or
some other factors?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. I think, actually, you have to love something to do well at it. And there may be
exceptions on that, but it is an enormous advantage if you absolutely love what you're
doing, every minute of it. And the nature of it is that that intensity adds to your
productivity.
And I have every bit of the intensity not manifested exactly the same way but it's there
every minute. I mean, I love thinking about Berkshire. I love thinking about its investments. I
love thinking about its businesses. I love thinking about its managers. It's part of me. And it
is true, you can't separate the game from the scorecard. I mean, you -- so your score card
is part of playing the game and loving the game. The proceeds are -- to me are
unimportant, but the proceeds are part of the score card, so they come with a score card.
But it's much more important -- I mean, I would -- no question about it, I wouldn't be feel
the same way about Berkshire at this point if I didn't own a share of it, if I didn't get paid. I
mean, it's what I like doing in life, and that's why I do it. So, I don't think you'll -- I don't
think it's actually a correct observation and Charlie can comment on this to say that
because we're doing things in a somewhat different way that any of the intensity or the
passion has been lost.

There's nothing more fun for me than finding something new to add to Berkshire, and
that was true 40 years ago. It's true now and it'll be true 10 years from now, I hope.
Charlie, how would you answer that?

FINAL

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, I think when you bought American Express for the first time, you didn't know that
much about it. So, naturally, you were digging in rather deeply. The second time you
bought it, I remember you got on the golf course with Olson --

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Frank Olson, yes.

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

And you just saw how he couldn't get rid of American Express if he wants to do, and then
you bought it the second time. The research is still --- the first one was hard, and the
second was easy.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

It's all cumulative.

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, it's cumulative, eventually.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. And, what I learned sitting with Lorimer Davidson on a Saturday at GEICO in January
of 1951 is still is useful to me, and I don't have to learn it a second time. I can build on it.
But that's one of the great things about investing. I mean the universe there's enough in it
so that you can finds lots of opportunities, but there -- it's not like it's changing
dramatically all the time. There are some things that may change, and we just don't play in
that part of the game if we don't understand them.
But what Charlie says is true. I didn't know a thing about American Express when the Salad
Oil Scandal hit in November of 1963. But I thought I saw an opportunity, so I learned a lot
about it. I went around to restaurants and talk to people about travel and entertainment
cards, as they were called then. I learned about traveler's checks. I talked to banks. And I
was absorbing some knowledge.
And then, as Charlie said, when we were up at Prouts Neck playing golf with Frank Olson,
and he was running the Hertz Corp., and he was telling me that there was no way in the
world that he could get rid of American Express or even get them to cut their fees. That
was my kind of business. And I knew enough to proceed to buy a fair amount of stock,
and now we own whatever it is, probably 13% of the company or thereabouts. And they
keep buying in their stock. We can't buy anymore stock ourselves.

I got asked that question in March of 2009 by Joe Kernen, Why aren't you buying the
stock of American Express? Well, it was a bank holding company, and we couldn't add a
share. But they are doing it for us, and I love it.
At Coca-Cola, at Wells Fargo, to a lesser degree, at IBM, at most of our companies, our
interest in the company goes up every year because the companies are repurchasing
shares and they probably earn more money so we got a double play going for us. But the
passion is not gone, I promise you.
Station 1.

Q - Analyst
Hi, Warren and Charlie. My name is Vincent Wong [ph] from Seattle. When people analyze
a stock, a lot of them looked at quantitative metrics, such as P/E ratio, return on equity,
debts-to-asset ratio, et cetera. So, Mr.Buffett, when you analyze a stock for purchase
what's your top five quantitative metrics that you looked at, and what's your preferred
number for each metric? Thank you.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, we're looking at quantitative and quality -- we aren't looking at the aspects of the
stock, we're looking at the aspects of a business. It's very important to have that mindset,
that we are buying businesses, whether we're buying 100 shares or something or
whether we're buying the entire company. We always think of them as businesses.
So when Charlie and I lead through value line or look at annual reports that come across
our desk or read the paper, whatever it may be, that, for one thing we have a -- we do
have this cumulative knowledge of a good many industries and a good many companies,
not all by a long shot. And different numbers are of different importance -- or various
numbers are of different importance depending on the kind of business.
I mean, if you were a basketball coach, you would -- if you were walking down the street
and some guy comes up that's 5?4? and says, you know, you ought to sign me up
because you ought to see me handle the ball, you would probably have a certain
prejudice against it. But there might be some one player out there it may sense on.
But on balance, we would say, well, good luck, son, but, you know, we're looking for 7footers and then if we find 7-footers, we have to worry about whether we can get them
halfway coordinated and keep them in school, a few things like that. But we see certain
things that shout out to us, look further or think further.
And over the years, we've accumulated this background of knowledge on various kinds of
businesses, and we also have come up with the conclusion that we can't make an
intelligent analysis out of -- about all kinds of businesses. And then, usually, some little fact
slips into view that causes us to rethink something. It was mentioned how I got the idea
about buying the Bank of America --- or making an offer to Bank of America on a

preferred stock when I was in the bathtub which is true. But the bathtub really was not the
key factor.
The truth is I read a book more than 50 years ago called Biography of a Bank it was a
great book, about A.P. Guanine and the history of the bank. And I have followed the Bank
of America, and I've followed other banks for 50 years. Charlie and I have bought banks.
We used to trudge around Chicago trying to buy more banks in the late '60s.And so, we
have certain things we think about, in terms of a bank, that are different than we think
about when we're buying ISCAR. And so there is not one-size-fits-all.
We have certain things we think about when we're buying an insurance company, certain
things we think about when we're buying a company dependent upon that depended
upon brands. Some brands travel very well, Coca-Cola being a terrific example and some
brands don't travel. And, we just keep learning about things like that, and then every now
and then we find some opportunity.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Bank of America whenever it was in 2011 was subject to a lot of rumors, terrible -- I
mean, lots of big short interest, morale was terrible, and everything else. It just struck me
that an investment by Berkshire might be helpful to the bank and might make sense for
us. And I'd never met Brian Moynihan at that point maybe I'd met him at some function,
some party of something, but I had no memory of it and I didn't have his phone number
but I gave him a call. And things like that happen.
And it's not because I calculate some price, precise P/E ratio or price-book value ratio or
whatever it might befit is because I have some idea of what the company might look like
in 5 or 10 years, and I have a reasonable amount of confidence in that judgment, and
there's a disparity in price and value, and it's big.
Charlie, would you like to elaborate?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

We don't know how to buy stocks just by looking at financial figures and making
judgments based on the ratios. We may be influenced a little by some of that data, but
we need to know more about how the company actually functions. And anything a
computer could be functioned to do, in terms of screening -- I know I never do it. Do you
use a computer to screen anything?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

No. I don't know how to. No. Bill's still trying to explain it to me. It's a little hard to be
precise on because we don't really use screens I never had screening everything. But it's
not like we sit there and say, we want to look at things that are below the price of book
value or low P/Es, or something of the sort.
We are looking at businesses exactly like we'd look at I mean if somebody came in and
offered us the entire business, and then we try to think what is this place going to look like
in 5 or 10 years, and how sure are we of it.

competitive position is what it is, and that is often not disclosed by the math.

Q - Carol Loomis

{BIO 7137249 <GO>}

FINAL

This question is from Benjamin Knoll of Greater Twin Cities United Way. Every time Bill
Gross writes a new essay on the, "new normal", I get more depressed about the
prospects for my retirement. Do you share his view that market returns in the next few
decades will be much lower than in the past few? And should we expect Berkshire's
future market returns to be greatly constrained, not only by its size, but also by much
lower equity returns overall?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah, Charlie and I don't pay any attention to macro forecasts. We have worked together
now for 54 years, and I can't think of a time when we made a decision on the stock or on
a company where a macro discussion --- where we've talked about macro. We don't know
what things are going to look like, in any precise way. And incidentally naturally we think if
we don't know it, nobody else knows. That's the conceit that we have.

Bloomberg Transcript

And so we why talk -- why spend time talking about something you really don't know
anything about? I mean it -- people do it all the time, but it's not very productive. So we
talk about the businesses. And I like Bill Gross. Sounds like Lloyd Bentsen back in -- he's a
friend of mine. But I don't -- it doesn't make any difference to me what he thinks about
the future, it doesn't make any difference to me, what any economist thinks about it.
I have a general feeling that America will continue to work well. And I don't -- there's -throughout my adult lifetime, and before that, there's always been all kinds of opinions
that about what's going to happen this year or the next year or anything like that. And
nobody knows. What you do know, with a very high degree of certainty in my view is that
BNSF will be carrying more carloads 10 years from now, 20 years from now, that there will
be no substitute for the service that they provide; that there will be two important
railroads in the west and two important railroads in the east, and that they will have an
asset that has incredible replacement value, nobody could turn out something like it, and
that they'll get paid fairly for what they do. It's not very complicated.
And to ignore what you know because of predictions about what you don't know, or what
nobody else knows, in our view, it's just plain silly. So we don't have anything against
somebody talking about a new normal or an old normal or an in-between normal, but it
doesn't mean anything to us.
My own guess is that people will do very well owning good businesses, if they don't pay
too much for them, whether they hold them for 10 years or 20 years or 30 years. And if
they try and time their purchases in some way by listening to forecasts about what's going
to happen in business and try and buy and sell them, they're going to do very well for
their broker and not so well for themselves.

Yeah. But, of course, Warren, we have a lot of money. We have to do something with it. So
we're going to do our thing no matter what the external climate is. If you're a busy
surgeon and trying to decide whether to work two more years before you retire, then you
may be more interested and rationally so, in the new normal. And I would personally
advise the guy to work an extra couple of years. In other words, I kind of agree with Bill
Gross.

I'm not talking. Over time, Fruit of the Loom and others have lost nearly all of the T-shirtfocused wholesale screen print market to Gildan, a relatively new player with very low cost
Page 56 of 107

FINAL

structure. Gildan is now going after the underwear-focused retail market and it's having
some success with certain large customers. Branding is obviously more important in the
retail market, but is there any reason to think Fruit of the Loom won't lose significant
amounts of share here over time, just as they did in the wholesale screen print market?
What can they do to protect what remains of their franchise?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. You keep your costs down and you constantly work at brand building, and you try
very hard to make sure that your main customers in turn have their customers happy with
the product, and are happy with the price points that you can deliver it at.
And you're correct that Gildan in terms of certain aspects, the non-branded aspects,
basically, of some parts of the business has hurt Fruit in the last -- last 10 years, certainly.
But we turn out first-quality, low-priced underwear with a strong brand recognition. And I
think it will be very tough to either build a brand against it or to beat our costs significantly.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now Gildan pays very little in the way of income tax as you know, because they route stuff
through the Cayman Islands, and that's a modest factor. But I think you'll find 5 years from
now or 10 years from now, that our market share in men's and boys', particularly
underwear will hold up. But you're right. They're a competitive threat. Hanes is a
competitive threat. And it's not a business that you can coast on. It's not Coca-Cola, but
it's not an unbranded product, either. And I think Fruit will do reasonably well, but it will not
get anything like the kind of profit margins that you can get in certain branded products.
Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And I couldn't name 10 books either that have -- that I regard as that much better than the
next 10. My mind is a blend of so many books I can't even sort it out anymore.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. The Intelligent Investor changed my life in terms of -- I literally had read every book
in the Omaha Public Library by the time I was 11 on the subject of investing and there were
a lot of books. And there were a lot -- there were technical books, Edwards & Magee, I
mean, that was a classic in those days, and a whole bunch of them, Garfield Drew. But -and I love -- I enjoyed reading them a lot. Some of them I read more than once. But I
never developed a philosophy about it. I enjoyed it. I charted stocks. I did all that sort of
thing.
Graham's book gave me a philosophy, a bedrock philosophy on investing that made
sense. I mean, he taught me how to think about a stock, he taught me how to think about
the stock market, and he taught me that the market was there not to instruct me but to
serve me. And he used that famous Mr.Market example. He taught me to think about
stocks as pieces of businesses, rather than ticker symbols or things that you could chart or
something of the sort.
And so it was that philosophy -- and in some way, further influenced by Phil Fisher's book
and Phil Fisher was just telling me the same thing that Charlie was telling me, which was
that it's very important to get into a business with fundamentally good economics, and
one that you could ride with for decades, rather than one where you had to go from
flower to flower every day.

And those -- that philosophy has carried me along now, I've learned different ways of
applying it over the years, but it's the way I think about businesses now. I have not found
any aspect of that bedrock philosophy that has flaws in it. You have to learn how to apply
it in different ways. So those are the books that influenced me. And, of course, in other
arenas, Charlie has probably read more biography than anybody that I know of and I like
to read a lot of it. We're just about through reading the Joe Kennedy biography. You've
read that, haven't you now, Charlie? You know, I'm not sure you want to emulate
everything he did, but it's still interesting reading.
We read for the enjoyment of it. I mean, it's been enormously beneficial to us, but the
reason we read is that it's fun. And, it's still fun. And on top of it, we have gotten very
substantial benefits from it. My life would have been different if Ben Graham hadn't gone
to the trouble of writing a book, which he had no financial need to do at all. I would have a
very different life.
Okay. Becky.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Becky Quick

{BIO 16400962 <GO>}

This question comes from Bill Miller of Legg Mason. He writes, the U.S. airline industry has
been plagued with terrible economics for over 100 years. With the pending merger of
USAir and American, the industry will have consolidated to the point where the top four
carriers will control almost 90% of the traffic. As a result, the industry has been
consistently profitable these past several years, with many of the airlines now earning
double-digit returns on invested capital and generating substantial free cash flow. Do you
think the industry's much improved economics are likely to persist? And would there be
any economic benefits if Berkshire were to own a domestic airline and pair it with
NetJets?"

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, the answer to the second is no. But the question about the industry is really
interesting, because it is true that it has consolidated very significantly. And in some
businesses, you can have only two competitors and they're still terrible businesses, they
beat each other's brains out. And sometimes they end up competing to do very stupid
things.
You can argue that that's what happened with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. I mean,
enormous companies that had a huge advantage over everybody else, but they still, in
their battle to both report higher earnings every quarter, and to beat the other guy out,
drove prices for insuring loans down to the improper levels and did a lot of other stupid
things too.
So you see -- you do see certain industries where once they get down to very -- a very
few companies, do extremely well. And you see other industries where, even when they
get to be two of them, they don't do that that well. I mean, you can take Coke and Pepsi
in the United States. I mean, they're the only two colas that people can name, and 50% or

Page 59 of 107

Date: 2013-05-04

FINAL

so of the soft drinks are colas. But if you go into a supermarket on the weekend, you will
see them pricing their product at ridiculously low prices and competing very vigorously.
So it's very industry specific. The airline industry has this situation where they have very,
very, very low incremental costs per seat with the enormous fixed costs, and the
temptation to sell that last seat at a very low price is very high, and it's very -- and
sometimes it can be very difficult to distinguish between the last seat and other seats. So
it's a labor-intensive, capital-intensive, largely commodity-type business, and it's been as
Bill Miller points out in that question, it's been, a death trap for investors ever since Orville
took off. I mean, as I've said, if there had been a capitalist at Kitty Hawk he should have
shot down Orville and done us all a favor.
But the -- but having neglected to do that, investors have poured money into airline
companies, and aircraft manufacturing companies, now for 100 years-plus, with terrible
results. And if it ever gets down to where there's one airline and there's no regulation, it
will be a wonderful business. And then the question is whether, having gotten down now
through a lot of bankruptcies, to a relatively few that are doing a high percentage of the
seat miles, whether it's a good business yet. I don't know the answer to but I'm skeptical.
Charlie?

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, the last time we represented with a similar opportunity was when the railroads did

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

That's what we don't like about it.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

And people love doing it. It's exciting to people. And you can sell the idea. I've had,
probably, a dozen proposals over the last 25 or 30 years from people that want to get
into the airline business one way or the -- and a number of them have. It's sexy, for some
reason. I mean, it -- of you go to the office of some Mr.Big CEO and say, I want to talk to
you about this new airplane, you get in the door. I mean, if you want to talk to him about
hauling coal or something, it's a little different.
So it is a business that attracts people. And you can go out and raise money for a new
airline, and the record is -- it's really been something. I don't know how many bankruptcies
there have been in the airline field, but it's an enormous number. And, of course, some
have done it more than once. We bought USAir. I bought that. I was at Gorat's with Ed
Colodny, and he explained to me how wonderful the airline was -- he's a good guy,
incidentally and I wrote a check. And by the time the check was cashed, they were having
troubles. I mean, it did not take longhand then they went bankrupt twice. We were very
lucky we actually made quite a bit of money on it, as it turned out, because there was a
little blip at one point. But I think it went bankrupt twice after we bought it.

Q - Cliff Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

I want to ask you about share repurchases. How hard a floor should shareholders think
about the 1.2 times book value buyback multiple? Are there circumstances under which
you would not be buying back at 1.2?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Well, generally speaking, book value has got nothing to do with the price at which
you should purchase your shares; intrinsic business value does. And the correlation
between intrinsic business value and book value throughout the investment universe is,
there's virtually no correlation. So book value is unimportant to most companies. It actually
has -- it has a reasonable tracking utility at Berkshire.
Our intrinsic business value is very considerably above book value, and we have signaled
that -- we'll say it right here. We've said it before but in addition, we've signaled that by
saying that we would repurchase our shares as long as we had a substantial cash balance,
met all the needs of our operating companies, at 120% of book value, and if we got the
opportunity to buy it there, we would probably buy a whole lot of it.
The calculus is very much what I put in the report. You take care of your business with
money first, and if you can buy additional businesses at something where you add to the
per-share value of the business, you do that. If you can repurchase your shares at a
significant discount from intrinsic value, it's like buying dollar bills at $0.90 cents or $0.80
cents or whatever it may be, and it's a very sure way of improving per-share value. It's
been very difficult for us to do it because every time we announce it, people say, well, if
it's -- if he thinks it's worth more than 120% of book.

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yeah. Those cheapskates are willing to pay that.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

All right. Well, if at least one cheapskate is willing to pay that the -- and, they're right. And
we don't really -- we've got mixed emotions on it. We don't really like the idea of running
a company where it makes most of its money by buying its partners out at a discount, but
Page 62 of 107



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2013-05-04

if partners want to sell out at a discount, we also like the idea of buying and making, sure
money that way.

FINAL

We haven't done much of it. Most of the time our stock has sold in a reasonable range in
relation to intrinsic business value. We would think that probably a fairly significant
percentage of the time in recent years it sold at, at least some discount. There were a
few years when we thought it sold for more than intrinsic business value.
But if it, in our opinion, the directors' opinion, the stock is selling at a significant discount
and we've got the money around and we've got the stock offered to us in a reasonable
quantity, we will buy it, and then -- and there could be circumstances it's unlikely but there
could be circumstances where we'd buy a whole lot at a price that would be attractive for
the stockholders who stayed in.

Yes. Although, I -- as I said earlier on this weekend, they're rebuilding it so rapidly now that
I felt like Rip Van Winkle. They've torn down so many of the buildings I remember. It's
amazing how much Omaha has changed the last five years.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, you have to remember that a third of the lifetime of the country has passed during
our lifetime, so you have to expect a little change occasionally, Charlie.
Okay. Andrew.

Q - Andrew Ross Sorkin

{BIO 6340618 <GO>}

Okay, Warren. We got a couple of questions related, this year, to climate change and its
impact on the company. So let me ask this question from Clem Dinsmore, who asks: If
asked, what would the underwriting experts at your casualty insurance and reinsurance
companies advise you and your fellow board members are the emerging risks to
Berkshire's many enterprises from the changes in extreme weather associated with
climate change?

Bloomberg Transcript

And I would add that Jed McDonald asked a separate question, but related, saying, what
are your thoughts on the price on carbon debate?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, as you've noticed if you've been here the last few years, the climate really is
getting a lot warmer. Obviously --- well, Charlie knows far more about science than I do,
which is not saying a whole lot, but the -- my general feeling is that there is a -- certainly a
reasonable chance that people that are worried about warming and the effect of CO2, et
cetera, are right.
But I don't know enough so that I can say that, that I can speak as any kind of an expert on
it. I don't know the answer on it, but I certainly am willing to assume that there are a lot of
very smart people who think that, and I think that it's a reasonable assumption. I don't
think that it makes any real difference in assessing insurance rates from year-to-year.
We have a general tendency to be pessimistic in our assumptions about the likelihood of
natural catastrophes, but we would have that general bias, which I think is useful,
regardless, if there were no carbon emissions of any kind going on. We would still assume
that whatever the past history had been of natural disasters, we would assume that they
were going to be somewhat worse. And the global warming in terms of resetting prices
of insurance from year-to-year is not a real factor. Our general pessimistic bias is
something of a factor.

The second part about pricing of carbon emissions, do you want to repeat that again?

FINAL

Q - Andrew Ross Sorkin

{BIO 6340618 <GO>}

The full question and I abbreviate it was, what are your thoughts on the carbon -- the price
of carbon debate? Do you think it's a feasible way, for example, to incentivize efficiency
improvements and capture the externalities of carbon's damaging effects, or is it a lofty,
idealized concept too tricky to figure out in practice?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

I would say that the question calls for having Charlie give the answer.

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, you've got to realize that I'm a Caltech-trained meteorologist, but that was before
they'd invented most of modern meteorology. I think that I carbon trading is pretty
impractical, a whole bunch of nations with different ideas, and so on.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I think if you're going to change habits, the correct answer is carbon taxes. I think
Europe, because they're socialists and wanted to tax the thing that people needed the
most, they put these big high taxes on motor fuel. So they did it by accident and not
because it was a good idea vis-a-vis global warming and a lot of other issues, but
because they really needed the money.
But I think they stumbled into the right policy. I think the United States should have way
higher taxes on motor fuel, and that's efficient. Some group of shareholders thought they
like clapping for high taxes.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

They weren't all clapping.
Okay. Doug?

Q - Doug Kass

{BIO 3559809 <GO>}

Warren, my next question is both a question and an unusual challenge. I'm asking this next
question because in the past, you've been open to inviting your audience to apply for
jobs. In 2002, you suggested that shareholders who thought they were eligible to send in
their qualifications if they were interested in seeking a seat on your board of directors.
And, again, in your 2006 letter, when you advertised for a successor to Lou Simpson at
GEICO, you said at the time send me your resume. In the past, you have discussed your
views on short selling. You have cited that stocks tend to rise over time, and you've talked
about the asymmetry between reward and risk. By contrast, the last 15 years has
demonstrated that short selling can be a value additive tool to total return when done by
professionals. In fact I believe Todd Combs had success as a short seller when you hired
him.

My question is, would you ever consider committing capital to a short-selling strategy?
Would you or Berkshire consider being my Homer Dodge, who invested in your
partnership after the original seven investors? Would you or Berkshire Hathaway be willing
to give my firm at least $100 million in a managed account?

Bloomberg Transcript

If Seabreeze failed to outperform the increase, during the two-year period, of the book
value increase in Berkshire, all the earned fees earned would be contributed half to the
Sherwood Foundation, and half to two charities of my choice, including the Jewish
Federation of Palm Beach County? And even if Seabreeze outperformed Berkshire's
change in book value, 25% of the earned fees would be contributed to the charities.
And I want to add something else. You talked about being technophobic. Technology may
be very hard for Berkshire to invest in, but it is also disruptive to many industries whose
business models are scathed by it, and this produces very fertile ground for short-selling
opportunities.

listen to us or us. No, we -- I may even propose a little wager at some point, but we'll let
that ride for the time being.
I've known -- well, if you go back far enough, we did a reasonable amount of short selling,
and I've certainly identified lots of companies that I thought were far overpriced, and I've
identified a fair number of companies that I not only thought, but was virtually certain,
were frauds. And so, Charlie -- I mean we've been seeing them ever since we got in the
business. But making a lot of money short selling is still is not a game that appeals to us
over a long period of time. It's one of those things that --

Ben Sauer [ph] from Shreveport, Louisiana. Could you be more specific about what
factors you considered when determining what a fair price was for an acquisition such as
Heinz? And also, what sources do you use to make judgments about major changes that
will affect an industry?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, we usually feel we're paying too much. Isn't that right, Charlie? But we find the
business so compelling, the management, our associates, so compelling, that we gag and
we get there on the price. But we -- there is no mathematical -- a perfect mathematical
formula.
Looking back, when we've bought wonderful businesses that turned out to continue to be
wonderful, we could've paid significantly more money and they still would have been
great business decisions. But you never know 100% for sure. And so it isn't as precise as
you might think. Generally speaking, if you get a chance to buy a wonderful business and
by that, I would mean one that has economic characteristics, that lead you to believe with
a high degree of certainty, that they will be earning unusual returns on capital over time -unusually high and, better yet, if they get the chance to employ more capital at -- again at
high rates of return that's the best of all businesses. And you probably should stretch a
little.
Charlie and I have had several conversations where we were looking at a building -- a
business which we liked, and were sort of gagging at the price, and Charlie or I will say,
let's do it even though it kind of kills us to pay that last 5 percent. We did that with See's
Candy. Charlie was the one that said, for God's sakes, Warren, write the check. I was the
one that was suffering. But it's happened quite a few times, hasn't it, Charlie?

It almost always happens. Modern prices are not cheap.

FINAL

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

No, no. And great businesses, you're not going to find lots of them, and you're not going
to get the opportunity to buy them and although you do in the market. The stock market
will offer you opportunities for profit, percentage-wise, that you'll never see, in terms of
negotiated purchase of business. In negotiated purchase of a business, you're almost
always dealing with someone that has the option of either selling or not selling, and can
sort of pick the time when they decide to sell, and that entire sort of thing.
In stock markets, it's an auction market. Crazy things can happen. You can have, you know,
some technological blip that will cause a flash crash or something. And the world really
hasn't changed at all, but all kinds of selling mechanisms are tripped off and that sort of
thing. So you will see opportunities in the stock market that you'll never really get in the
business market.
But what we really like, we really like buying businesses to hold and keep. We like buying
cheap marketable securities too. But particularly when you've got lots of cash coming in
and you're going to continue to have lots of cash coming in, you really want to deploy it in
great businesses that you can own forever.

comes in here that you voted for President Osama.
Now, here is the question.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

This guy is trying to kill me, and he's doing it --

Q - Carol Loomis

{BIO 7137249 <GO>}

Over the years, you've frequently alluded to your legendary reputation for thriftiness, and
you've extolled the virtues of the managers of Berkshire companies who have invariably
been extremely cost conscious. If these are hallmarks of the philosophy which has
enabled you to achieve your astounding success, how can you possibly support an
administration which has plunged our country into $16 trillion worth of debt, and has not
indicated the slightest concern or the efficiency, inefficiency -- over the inefficiency of big
government?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Well, the $16 trillion, we'll have to give Bush a certain amount of credit for that, too.
But they certainly didn't -- certainly wasn't the Osama administration that, at least, allowed
policy that created the greatest financial crisis and required an appropriate stimulus on
the part of the government.
But, in the end, I find it totally unproductive and that fellow at 86 probably is -- should have
founded it out by now to discuss politics with people. I mean, you're to have roughly half
agreed with you and half disagree. So if you look at this the trouble is, Charlie and I, even
though he's a Republican, I'm a Democrat, we really don't disagree as much as you might
think based on that. Otherwise, I could say you could just take your pick here and vote for
one of us and ignore the other one, and we would offer a little something for everyone.
The amount of deficit spending in the last four years, the amount of stimulus provided -fiscal stimulus provided I think has been quite appropriate in relation to the threat to the
economy that was posed by the greatest panic in my lifetime.
I mean, you literally had a situation where Berkshire Hathaway was getting a phone call
because General Electric needed money, and we were the last stop.
That is quite a situation. It's quite a situation when Freddie and Fannie go into
conservatorship and Wampum and Wachovia fail, and where money market funds have
5% drained out of them in three days, and with a panic underway.
So I -- we needed fiscal stimulus in this country.
Now, the real question is, how do you get off of that? And that is a problem, but it's a
lesser problem than we would've had if we'd decided to follow some austerity program,

in my view, at least, starting in 2008.
How do you feel about that, Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

FINAL

I agree with you completely. And, by the way, so did George W. Bush.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

That was bipartisan. We were in so much trouble, that on both sides of the aisle, we finally
got together and supported these extreme interventions.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

George Bush issued, probably, the ten greatest words of economic thought in history.
Most people don't give him credit for that.

Bloomberg Transcript

They think of Adam Smith and comparative advantage and Keynes and Animal spirits and
all those guys. But George Bush went out there in September of 2008 and said, If money
doesn't loosen up, this sucker could go down. I mean, that is a man that knew how to get
to the point. And I give him great credit for it, enormous credit.
And plenty of members of his party did not agree with what he was doing, but we owe
him a lot, in that respect. And, we -- our leaders, generally speaking, in both parties, once
they were in the terrible trouble, I think they behaved, or came up with policies that, in
general, were very useful in avoiding something far worse than what we experienced. And
they weren't easy to do. I mean, it took some guts.
So, I am disturbed by a national debt that grows in respect to GDP. In fact, I wrote an
article in The New York Times, an op-ed piece, in -- I think maybe 2009 or 2010 -- talking
about this very problem.
But, we came out of World War II with a debt higher -- a gross or net debt higher in
relation to GDP than we have now, and people were predicting terrible things at that time
because of that situation, and the country has done sensationally.
The real danger is that it just continues to grow, and it gets easier to print money than
exercise some discipline. But we've encountered far worse problems than we face now. I
mean, this is not our country's toughest hour, by a huge margin.
And I think we will do fine, but with a lot of bickering, and kind of nonsense that will bother
you when you read about it day to day. But when you look at it from a viewpoint of history
10 or 20 years from now, you will not be that disturbed. Charlie?

Well, I agree with you about George W. Bush, and I like these non-partisan episodes when

confusing. In fact, if you aren't confused, I don't think you understand it very well.

FINAL

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

That sort of immunizes you from everything. How bothered are you by the level of debt in
relation to GDP?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, I don't think there's any one fixed ratio that is written in the stars. As a matter of fact,
most of the debt, as I conceive it, is not even counted in what you call debt. The off-thebooks debt of the United States is bigger than the on-the-books debt, all the present
value of future promises that are unfounded.

A - Warren E. Buffett

That can be changed, however.

A - Charlie Munger

A - Warren E. Buffett

Well, we shouldn't.

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

I don't think it's very likely.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

No, no. But Social Security is not a killer, actually, in terms -- if you have a GDP that rises a
couple percent in real terms --

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Of course -- that's the great problem. All of our problems are trivial, if GDP will just rise at
2% per annum, per capita. All these problems that the Republicans are screaming about
fade into insignificance if we can do that. But you've got to have policies that enable you
to do it, and I'm not sure we always do that very well.

Q - Jonathan Brandt

{BIO 17988091 <GO>}

FINAL

I have a question about the competitive landscape in the paint business. I personally
always use Benjamin Moore, but some say that Benjamin Moore is disadvantaged
because it doesn't control its own distribution, as does Sherwin-Williams, and they note
that it has lost market share to Behr, which is sold in the home centers at lower prices.
You recently replaced management there. What changes in strategy and/or pricing, if any,
are being undertaken at that unit, and what is the outlook for that franchise?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Benjamin Moore, it's a relatively small percentage of the total paint industry, but it -at the high end, it is the best regarded paint, and we have not lost position in that
respect.

Bloomberg Transcript

But the -- when we purchased Benjamin Moore, I made a promise. I even made a video. It
had a dealer system, and people that invested their savings and passed on from
generation to generation dealerships from Benjamin Moore, and counted on the
company adhering to a dealer system, even though you could always get a huge jump in
volume, particularly in the first year, if you went with the big boxes.
So we were always approached by the big boxes, and they said, Let us take Benjamin
Moore into our stores, whether it be Home Depot or whomever. And we would've gotten
a big jump in volume when that happened and they would've loved us -- to have us -- as a
brand with that kind of identity in their stores, but it would've represented a total change
in the distribution arrangement.
I don't think it would've worked out as well over time, and I know it would have been
essentially -- particularly after my pledge, which the other -- which the management
pledged too, they would've been double-crossing a network of dealers that trusted us,
and trusted us when we bought it to continue with the policy.
A dealer policy will work with a first-class brand like Benjamin Moore. It will never get the
kind of market share as will take a Behr, which is distributed through Home Depot. We
were actually offered Behr at one time. Charlie, do you remember that one?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yes, I do.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah, yeah. But the company was actually investigating, and went on its way to
implementing, some moves that would've, in effect, gutted, or we felt would drastically
hurt the dealers and violate the pledge that I'd made to them back when we bought it.

Page 72 of 107



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2013-05-04

So, we did have a change there. And we will -- we will not follow the Sherwin-Williams
path, which is a very -- I mean, it's a very effective business strategy. I'm not knocking that
at all, but that is not our strategy. Our strategy will be a dealer strategy, focused on the
high end of the market.

FINAL

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Besides, it's worked very well.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Oh, yeah, it's worked well, and it'll continue to work well. It doesn't mean that SherwinWilliams won't do extremely well. I think they will. It doesn't mean that Behr won't do well. I
think they will.
But we are in a different segment and it's up to us to protect and really foster the dealer
distribution network, and I think we can have something, and do have something, very
special with those dealers and with the position that Benjamin Moore has.
But it will not lead to far higher market shares or anything. I think it will lead -- and it has -to very decent profitability. Benjamin Moore is a good business, and I think it will continue
to be a good business. Charlie?

Q - Analyst
Derek Foster, Ottawa, Canada. First of all, thank you, Warren, for sharing all your
information. You've changed my life. I took finance in university, couldn't understand Greek
formulas, but now I can invest reasonably well.
My question to you is, in the past you've said for an investor, you should simply -- for 99%
of investors -- you should simply stick money in an index fund and let it go and don't worry
about it. That 1% of investors, chooses your best five stocks and put a substantial amount
of money in it. I'm just wondering, how about a strategy of, perhaps, buying 20 of the
best stocks in America, Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, whatever, the
companies that have been around for centuries -- or a century or decades or whatever -and just leaving it at that.
Do you think that that would outperform an index fund over the long term? And I want
Charlie's opinion as well.

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

FINAL

Well, I don't know whether you're saying the 20 largest companies or the 20 best. You
might get different thoughts from different people on what they are. But I think you would
-- probably the 20 you would pick would virtually match the results of an index fund. Who
knows exactly which ones would be the best?
But the real distinction -- and Graham made this in his book, basically -- is between the
person who is going to spend an appreciable amount of time becoming something of an
expert on businesses, because that's what stocks are, or the person who is going to be
busy with another profession, wants to own equities, and actually will do very well in
equities. But the real problem they have is that they may tend to get excited about stocks
at the wrong time.
They, really, the idea of buying an index fund over time are not to buy stocks at the right
time or the right stocks. It's to avoid buying them at the wrong time, the wrong stocks. So
equities will do well over time, and you just have to avoid getting -- getting excited when
other people are excited, or getting excited about certain industries when other people
are, trying to behave like a professional when you aren't spending the time and bringing
what's needed to the game to be a professional.

Bloomberg Transcript

And if you're an amateur investor, there's nothing wrong with being an amateur investor,
and you just simply -- you've got a very logical, profitable course of action available to you,
and that is simply to buy into American business in a broadly diversified way and put your
money in over time.
So, I would say your group of 20 will probably match an index fund, and you'll probably do
well in that, and you will do well in an index fund. Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Q - Becky Quick

{BIO 16400962 <GO>}

This question comes from James Broadbent Harris of Columbus, Ohio. He says that your
enormously generous multibillion charitable gifts of Berkshire Hathaway stock over the
past decade have, and will continue to be, sources of salable assets for the charities
linked to the Buffett, Gates, and Munger families.
Could annual sales of billions of dollars' worth of donated stock by these charitable
foundations be a reason why shares have traded under 120% of book value, and will
announced share repurchase plans fully address this selling by the charitable funds in the
coming decade?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. I give away 4.75% of my stock, we'll say, every year, and let's say that's $2 billion
worth of stock, roughly. That's 1% -- a little less than 1% -- of the market value of Berkshire.

Bloomberg Transcript

Many companies in the New York Stock Exchange trade over 100% a year. A 1% sale
annually of the outstanding capitalization is absolutely peanuts, and you can even argue, in
some cases, that it can aid, in terms of market price, because the availability of stocks
sometimes determines whether people get interested in buying.
But a supply of 1% annually is not going to change the level at which a stock trades. I
mean, it just its insignificant compared to the volume. Berkshire -- I think Berkshire's
volume, A and B combined, is -- probably averages, what, $400 million or $500 million a

Well, we're willing to go, anyplace where we think we understand what things are -- in a
reasonable way-- what things are going to look like in five or 10 years, and where we get
our money's worth, and good management, and all of the things that we emphasize.
But -- so we don't -- we've never foreclosed anything, but we're going to find most of our
opportunities in the United States. It's just the nature of things that this is a huge, huge
market for businesses, and we're better known here. But, most of our deals will take
place here, but we find things outside the United States, particularly in terms of bolt-on
acquisitions.
In terms of current business, ever since the fall of 2009, coming on four years, we've
seen a gradual improvement. And sometimes people have gotten encouraged to think it
was speeding up quite a bit, and then they get feeling that -- they start talking about a
double-dip, which I've never believed in and hasn't happened.
What we see overall is just a slow progress in the American economy. You saw those
figures on carloadings for the first 17 weeks. And, we were up 3-and-a-fraction percent,
but the other railroads were up 4/10 of a percent, so the industry as a whole might be up
1% or thereabouts, a little over 1%.
This economy is not -- for the last four years -- it's not come roaring back in any way,
shape, or form. It's never faltered, and I wouldn't be surprised if it keeps going this way.
Now, finally, the overhang in housing ended -- it ended about a year ago -- but -- so we're
starting to get -- we're seeing some recovery in home prices, which has a big
psychological effect, and we're seeing some improvement in construction.
But we don't want to start overbuilding again. We really want to have housing starts that
more or less equal household formation. And I think we're seeing that. So if you ask me
where we're going to be when we meet here next year, I think we will have moved

Q - Analyst
Hi. Brandon from Los Angeles. I'm in my 20s and I'm starting a partnership. What advice
do you have about getting people to put in money before I have a track record as a solo
investor?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, you haven't sold me. No, I think people should be quite cautious about investing
money with other people, even when they have a track record, incidentally. There are a lot
of track records that don't mean much.
But overall, I would advise any young person that wants to manage money, and wants to
attract money later on, to start developing an audited track record as early as they can. I
mean, it was far from the sole reason, far from the sole reason, that we hired Todd and
Ted, but we certainly looked at their record, and we looked at a record that we both
believed and could understand, because we see a lot of records that we don't really think
mean much.
I mean, if you get -- if you have a coin flipping contest, as I wrote, some years ago, and
you get 310 million orangutans out there and they all flip coins and they flip them 10 times,
you will -- instead of having 300 million left, you'll have 300,000, roughly, left that'll flip
ten times in a row successfully. And those orangutans will probably go around trying to
attract a lot of money to back them in future coin flipping contests.

some people thought I was running a Ponzi scheme, probably, there. And other people
may not have thought it, but it was to their advantage to sort of scare people because
they were selling investments in Omaha.
But you -- to attract money, you should deserve money, and you should develop a record
over time that -- and then you should be able to explain to people why that record is a
product of sound thinking rather than simply being in tune with a trend or simply just being
lucky.
Charlie? You're starting today and you're 25 years old. How do you attract money?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

I think most people start with friends and family, or people whose trust they've already
earned in some other way. So it's hard to do when you're young, and that's why people
start so small.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

And a relatively few will be successful.

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

That's right, too.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Some of them -- a great many will be successful and make -- I mean, you know, we have
the hedge fund record here. And during that time, the hedge fund managers have
probably made a very considerable amount of money.
As I pointed out, Todd and Ted, working under a 2 and 20 arrangement, if they put the
money in a hole in the ground, would make $120 million each this year. So it's not exactly
an arrangement that you don't want to think about a little bit before you engage in it.

Okay. At Berkshire, there is a unique dynamic that exists between your recognition of
Ajit's special skills and Ajit's special skills. You comment often about how unique Ajit's skills
are. So just tell us, is Ajit your successor? And if not, what happens to Ajit's businesses
without Ajit?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, they won't be without Ajit for a long time. And he -- what -- he's remarkable in many
ways, but one of the ways he's particularly remarkable is that when people start copying
something he's doing and turning what was maybe quite profitable into something that
becomes something every Tom, Dick, and Harry is doing, he figures out new ways to do
business. And I noticed you started with the 'A's when you started on a possible
successor with Ajit, and you won't have any more luck when you get to the 'B's. Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, I think the basic answer is that if Ajit ever is not with us --

people, in most cases, who do not need the money that they earn working for us. They
may make substantial money. And they are doing a job for you shareholders and for me
and Charlie that you can almost say we don't deserve.
But they are having -- I think they're having -- a good time running their businesses. The
one thing we do is try and create an atmosphere where they can enjoy running the

businesses rather than spend all their time running back and forth to headquarters and
doing show-and-tell operations and that sort of thing. And it's taken a long time, though,
too. I mean, we operated Berkshire for 20 years without Ajit. If he'd come in the office in

Q - Analyst

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Analyst
Someday your son, Howard, will become Berkshire's Non-Executive Chairman. Berkshire is
a very complex business, growing more complex as the years pass. Howard has never run
a diversified business, nor is he an expert on enterprise risk management. Best as we
know, he hasn't made material stock investments, nor has he ever been engaged in
taking over a large company. Away from the accident of birth, how is Howard the most
qualified person to take on this role?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, he's not taking on the role that you described. He is taking on the role of being NonExecutive Chairman in case a mistake is made in terms of who is picked as a CEO. I don't - I think the probabilities of a mistake being made are less than 1 in 100, but they're not 0
in 100. And I've seen that mistake made in other businesses.
So it is not his job to run the business, to allocate capital, do anything else. If a mistake is
made in picking a CEO, having a Non-Executive Chairman who cares enormously about
preserving the culture and taking care of the shareholders of Berkshire, not running the
business at all, it will be far easier to then make another change. And that -- he is there as
a protector of the culture, and he has got an enormous sense of responsibility about that,
and he has no illusions about -- at all -- about running the business.
He would have no interest in running the business. He won't get paid for running the
business. He won't have to think about running the business. He'll only have to think about
whether the board and himself -- but as a member of the board -- but whether the board
may need to change the CEO. And I have seen many times, really many times, over 60Page 81 of 107

FINAL

plus years or -- well, probably 55 years as a Director -- times when a mediocre CEO,
likable, not dishonest, but not the person who should run it, needs to be changed.
And it's very, very hard to do when that person is in the Chairman's position. It's not as -it's a bit easier now that you have this procedure where the board meets at least once a
year without the Chairman present. That's a very big improvement, in my view, in
corporate America. Because it -- a board is a social institution, and it is not easy for people
to come in, we'll say, to Chicago or New York or Los Angeles once every three months,
have a few committee meetings, and maybe have some doubts about whether they've
really got the right person running it.
They may have a very nice person running it, but they could do better. But who's going to
make a change? And that's the position that the Non-Executive Chairman, in this case,
Howard, will be in. And I know of nobody that will feel that responsibility more in terms of
doing that job as it should be done than my son, Howard.

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yeah. I think the Mungers are much safer -- with Howard there. You've got to remember,
the board owns a lot of stock. We're thinking about the shareholders. We're not trying to
gum it up for the shareholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. After my death, whatever it may be in terms of value then, but it would be $50
billion worth of stock, well, over a period of time, go to help people around the world and
it makes an enormous difference, whether the company behind that stock is doing well or
not.
And both Charlie and I have seen -- we've seen some -- more than one example -- of
where a CEO who might be a six on a scale of 10, and is perfectly likable and has,
perhaps, helped select some of the directors that sit there, and continues to run the
business year after year when somebody else could do it a whole lot better.
And it can be hard to make that -- very hard to make that change if that person controls
the agenda and, keeps everybody busy when they come into town for a little while.

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

You can have a CEO that's nine out of 10 on everything but with deep flaws, too.

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

The example I've used in the past, I mean, that -- that blessed are the meek for they shall
inherit the earth, but after they inherit the earth, will they stay meek? Well, that could be
the problem, if somebody got named CEO of Berkshire. It could be a position where
people might want to throw their weight around in various ways.
You may have noticed that in the annual report, in terms of our newspapers, I said, I am
not going to be telling them who to endorse for president. Ten of them endorsed
Romney and two endorsed Obama. I voted for Obama, but I'm not going to change that.
But when I write that sort of thing, I'm trying to box in my successor, to some degree, too,
and we do not want somebody using Berkshire Hathaway as a power base in the future.
We want them to be thinking about the shareholders. It's that simple.

Hi. I'm Brad Johnston from Minneapolis, Minnesota. And my question is within the context
of a very low interest rate environment that may be sustained for some time and the
challenge that insurance companies are facing in that environment with respect to
managing their capital, as well as managing their risk and uncertainty when they have
future liabilities and potentially the need for liquidity.
And maybe you could transcend that down to the individual, as well, who is dealing with a
low interest rate environment, trying to manage uncertainty and yet still get some cash
return from investments. I appreciate your concept of selling, some of your shares
periodically and being better off to do that rather than take dividends, but many people

FINAL

The problem faced by people who have stayed in cash, or cash equivalents, or short-term
Treasurys, or whatever, I mean, it is brutal.
The loss -- if they live off their income -- the loss of purchasing power, it's just staggering
when you get into these low interest rates. They are the huge victims of a low-interest
policy and a dramatically low-interest policy.
Basically, I've written -- I wrote back in 2008 to own equities. I mean, it was -- equities
were cheap.

Bloomberg Transcript

And you were almost certain to get killed, in terms of -- for at least a while -- we had a
promise that the Fed was going to hold rates very low, so it was a great time to own
equities. And I feel sorry for people that have clung to fixed-dollar investments,
particularly short-term ones, during a period like this, and I don't know what I would do if I
were in that position.
Imagine having, some sum that seemed like a very large amount of money in the past
but, a quarter of a percent on $1 million is $2,500 a year, and that is not what people
anticipated when they were saving over the years. So I -- well, anybody I've advised, I've
always felt that owning businesses certainly made sense -- more sense -- than fixed
dollars, under most circumstances.
Not every time in my life, but probably 90% of the time in my life, it's made more sense
than owning fixed-dollar investments. And it's certainly made dramatic sense a few years
ago when equities were marked down to where they were, terrific buys, and where you
could see the prospect that fixed-dollar investments were going to pay very little for a
considerable period of time.
And I didn't anticipate that we would see the kind of rates for the extended period that
we have already, and I don't know how long it will go on. But it's a real dilemma for
people. I get letters -- I get a lot of letters -- from people that say, I've got $300,000, and
they say, What should I do?
So it's -- the fallout from low interest rates has hit millions of people in a very harsh way.
And you don't read much about it and they don't have much of a voice, but it's been a
good argument for owning productive assets rather than dollars during a period like this.

IBM.

A - Warren E. Buffett

Oh, IBM. Well, I would say that I do not understand the moat around an IBM as well as I

feel I would have more conviction about the moat around a Coca-Cola, or a Wrigley or a
Heinz, for that matter, than an IBM.
But I feel good enough about IBM that we've put a considerable amount of money in it.
And there's nothing that precludes both Microsoft, which you mentioned, and IBM being
successful. In fact, I hope they both are.
We -- I've got enough conviction about IBM's position that we took a very large position. I
like their financial policies. I think the odds are good that their position is maintained in a
strong way over time, but I don't feel the same degree of conviction about that as I do

FINAL

They, incidentally, have a very large pension obligation. Now, they have a large pension
fund, too, but you're talking $75 billion or $80 billion of assets and liabilities that, is a big -it is a big annuity company on the side.
And you can have -- balls can take funny bounces in the annuity field. I would rather they
didn't have that, but that is a fact that I take into consideration when I buy. They show the
assets and liabilities of being roughly equal, but the liabilities are a lot more certain than
the assets over time. Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, at least the IBM pension plan has the resources of IBM. Suppose you're a big
life insurance company now. All over the world, the life insurance companies have started
to suffer the tortures of hell.
In Japan, they agreed to pay 3% interest, and, of course, there was no way to earn 3%
interest once the Japanese policies had been in place a long time. A whole lot of once
revered, secure places look unsecure now.

Bloomberg Transcript

And around Berkshire, you'll notice the life operations are -- where we have our own
policies as distinguished from reinsurance -- are pretty small, right?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. We do not like giving options in this world, and people tend to -- well, particularly
they've got a sales force pushing them on, as you have in the life insurance industry. They
have tended to give people options that have, in certain cases, cost them huge amounts
of money.
It's -- you always want to accept an option; you never want to give an option. But the life
business is in just the reverse side of that. Actually, the mortgage business -- I mean,
Charlie and I were in the savings and loan business. The idea of giving somebody a 30year mortgage where they can -- if it's a good deal for you -- they can call it off tomorrow,
and if it's a good deal for them, they keep it for 30 years.
Those are terrible instruments. They're good for you if you're buying a house, and I
recommend that you -- I recommend everybody in this room get a 30-year mortgage
immediately on a house for all they can.
If it's a bad deal and rates go to 1%, you can refund it. If rates go to 6% or 7%, maybe you
can buy it back for $0.70 on the dollar or something of the sort. So the life companies
have engaged in that big time -- big, big time -- in the last few decades, and a lot of them
are paying the price, and some of them haven't even realized exactly quite what the
problems are.

I'm a young investor, this is my question for the both of you: how was your investment
strategy different when you were still accumulating money as opposed to managing
billions? Did you focus on specific industries, small cap, large cap, et cetera? Thank you.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, managing a million dollars is an entirely different game than running Berkshire
Hathaway, or running some $20 billion or $50 billion fund of money.
And if Charlie and I were running a million dollars now or 100,000 or -- we would be
looking in some -- we'd be looking at some -- probably some very small things. We would
be looking for small discrepancies in certain situations. And the opportunities are out
there, and periodically, they're extraordinary.
But that's something we really don't think about anymore because our problem is
handling $12 billion or $14 billion, or whatever it might be, coming in every year, and that
means we have to be looking for very big deals and forget about what we used to do
when we were very young. Charlie?

Hi, Warren and Charlie. This is Andy Ling from Shanghai, China. Thank you very much for
what you have said and what you have done. People around the globe have benefited a
lot from your philosophies, so you have fans -- even a lot of fans -- even in China.
My question is: how did you see investments in emerging markets where Berkshire is
spend its investments in places like China? If yes, what kind of industries and companies
you are interested in? Thank you.

A - Warren E. Buffett

Yeah. We don't really start out looking to either emerging markets or specific countries or
anything of the sort. We may find things, as we go around, but it isn't like Charlie and I talk

better at selling than at investing.
It's just such an easy way -- I mean, it's what people expect to hear when -- when

Hello, Mr.Buffett, and Mr.Munger. My name is Brandt Hooker from Los Angeles. I want to
thank you both, first of all, for all the years of advice and your financial philanthropy, as well
as your education and/or knowledge philanthropy you've given to so many investors
around the world.
And my question is: the U.S. government was seemingly complicit in enticing the American
public to buy a home, and, therefore, a mortgage, at any cost. Do you think our legislators
are doing the same thing now, and are we creating a bubble?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

FINAL

No. I don't think we're remotely near a bubble, in terms of housing, now.
And I certainly think that your statement is accurate but not complete, in terms of what
went on before. I mean, the whole country, almost, every -- really kind of went crazy in
terms of housing. And the government was a very big part of it because they're a very big
part of the financing of it. And it's certainly true that plenty of legislators were encouraging
Freddie and Fannie to be doing things that they shouldn't have been doing, not just in
retrospect. I mean, if you looked at it at the time, you could come to that conclusion.
But there were an awful lot of people doing the same thing. I mean, it was coming from all
sources. And it had that aspect to it, which bubbles do, where year after year for three or
four or five years, whatever it might be, that the skeptics looked like idiots and that the
people who jumped on the bandwagon were the ones that were refinancing their houses
at ever higher prices and people who were speculating on other houses.
So, it just looked all so wonderful. And people are really susceptible to that sort of
bandwagon effect where they see their neighbors making easy money, everybody's
making easy money but them, and they finally succumb.

Bloomberg Transcript

It's just -- it's the nature of things. And it doesn't mean the people at Freddie or Fannie
were necessarily evil -- a few of them were -- or that legislators, necessarily, were evil,
although, again, a few of them probably were. But overwhelmingly, I think most people
just get caught up in a grand illusion.
And, it's happened many times in history, it'll happen again, and you can use that very
much to your profit. We're not in that kind of a period now on housing. You've got very,
very low interest rates, which support, in many cases, the purchase of houses, because it
brings down the payments, obviously.
But I personally, about a year ago, I mean, I recommended to people that they buy
houses, and I certainly recommend to people that they finance them now. And most
places I would recommend if you find a -- if you're going to live in the community for
some time and you find a house that fits your needs, I think it's probably a very good time
to buy it, in part because the financing is so unbelievably attractive.
Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Well, the main problem was that as things got crazier and crazier, the government
could've intervened by pulling away the punch bowl before everybody was totally drunk,
and instead, the government increased the proof. And this was not a good idea. But you - it's hard to get governments in a democracy to be pulling away the punch bowl from
voters who want to get drunk.

A - Warren E. Buffett

Yeah. You'll see it again, not necessarily in housing, but you will see it. And humans will
continue to make the same mistakes that they have made in the past.

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean, they get fearful when other people are fearful. I mean, that's -- you saw it in those
money market funds when 175 billion, flowed out in three days. I mean, everybody gets -when people get scared, they -- it's very, very pervasive.
I've often thought that, if I owned a bank in a two-bank town, I'd -- if I were inclined to -- I
might hire a whole bunch of Hollywood extras to form a line in front of the other guy's
bank. The hell of it is that they -- you know, as soon as they got through forming a line
there, they'd start forming a line at my bank because they -- people really get -- they get
fearful en masse. Confidence comes back sort of one at a time, but when they get
greedy, they get greedy en masse, too.
I mean, it just -- it's just the way the humans are constructed. That's where Charlie and I
have an edge. We don't have an edge, particularly, in many other ways. But we are able, I
think, perhaps better than most, to not really get caught up with what other people are
doing. And, I don't know whether we learned that over time or what.
But when we see falling prices, we think it's an opportunity to buy, and it doesn't bother
us. Now, we don't own things on margin or, we don't get ourselves in a position where
somebody else can pull the rug out from under us. That's enormously important in life.
You never want to, get out on a limb. And, of course, leverage gets very tempting when
things are going up. And leverage was what was introduced into housing in a huge, huge
way. I mean, people just felt that you were an idiot if you didn't keep borrowing more on
your house, and using that to buy more houses, or using it to live on, or whatever, and
then finally the roof fell in. Charlie?

Hi, Warren. Hi, Charlie. My name is George Islets from Cologne. Do you see investment
opportunities in the eurozone? For example, extending your stake in Munich Re? Do you
trust in the policy of the ECB to bring the things together? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, we're perfectly willing to look at business opportunity in the eurozone, and we
bought a couple of bolt-on acquisitions, one for a couple hundred million in the farm
equipment area. And we'll be happy if we find a business in any one of the 17 countries
tied to the euro. There might be a few of them we may be a little less inclined than
others.
But it may create opportunities for us to buy businesses. We'd be happy to. Europe is not
going to go away. But the European monetary union was, had a major flaw, and they're
grappling with a way to correct that flaw. And with 17 political bodies and a lot of diverse
cultures, it's really tough for them to do so.
They'll do it in time, in my view. But essentially they synchronized a currency without
synchronizing much else. And nature finds the fatal flaw always, and so does economics,
and they found it fairly quickly, in terms of the euro. And the structure that was put in place
will not work, and they'll have to find something that does work. And they will, eventually,
but they may go through a fair amount of pain in the process.

Hi. I'm David Yarus from Miami Beach, Florida. On behalf of the internet, welcome to
Twitter. And my question is: how has social media impacted your business and any
Berkshire companies, and what impact do you see it having on the world in the short and
long term?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Probably half the people or more in this audience could answer that question better than I
can. It has -- certainly in a place like GEICO, we are -- it makes a difference, and over time
will make a huge difference in marketing, just as the internet made a change.
I mean, GEICO was founded in 1936 and it had a great business idea of going direct, but
it did it entirely by mail, initially, and it worked very well. And then it progressed to -- as the
world changed, it, you know, went to TV advertising and phone numbers and that sort of
thing, and then it went to the internet, and now it goes on to social media.
So, you know, we have to listen to our customers in all our businesses. Some of them it's
much more dramatic than others. And I've been amazed, at how fast the world has
changed. I thought the internet, for example, in terms of GEICO, would affect younger
people very quickly, in terms of their buying habits.
But the truth that it spread across the entire age range very, very quickly, a huge change.
And you have to respond to that. And I am not the best person, by miles, to do that, but
we have people that are very good at it at our businesses, and they're thinking about it
plenty, and they'll continue to think about it. But it would be a terrible mistake to put me in

Q - Analyst
Hello. My name is Stuart Kaye and I work in Stamford, Connecticut. Earlier in the meeting,
you said when reading over financial statements, you identified companies you were
virtually certain were frauds. What was it in those financial statements that you saw that
made you be so certain they were frauds?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, it varies just enormously over the years, but there are -- we can't identify 100% of
the frauds, or 90%, or 80%, but there are certain ones that jump out to you, just -- people
give themselves away a lot, too.
I mean, in poker they talk about tells. And Charlie and I have bought a lot of businesses,
and it's very important, when we buy those businesses that we assess the individuals that
we're buying from with some degree of accuracy. Because, they hand us the stock

Page 94 of 107



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity

certificate and we hand them a lot of money, and then we count on them to run the
business with as much enthusiasm after they have the money as they did before.

FINAL

And so we are assessing people. And we don't think we can assess everyone accurately.
We just have to be right about the ones where we make an affirmative decision. And
those decisions have not always been perfect, but they've been pretty good. And I would
say they've probably gotten a little bit better, even, as the years have passed.
Similarly, in looking at financial statements -- for example, in the insurance field, we've
seen some frauds, and they're -- you can see things being done with loss reserves
occasionally. We saw it back in -- I won't name any names. Unlike Charlie, I don't -- we'll call
them Company As and Bs instead of naming names.
But you would see companies that, when they were offering stock to the public, the year
or two before that, the reserves would be down very suspiciously, and -- then -- or even
when they were selling them to other insurance companies, if they were buying in stock
they might be building the reserves.

Bloomberg Transcript

But there's a million different ways. And I don't claim I know all the ways, obviously, but I
have seen enough situations over the years, and I've seen how promoters act. And you
can spot certain people who you know are, one way or another, playing games with the
numbers. They give themselves away. But I can't give you a checklist of 40 items or
something of the sort that you look for in the balance sheet or the income account or the
footnotes. Charlie, can you help?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

Sometimes it's pretty obvious. I once was introduced by Warren, of all people, by
accident, to a man who wanted to sell us a fire insurance company. One of the first things
he said, with a thick accent, from Eastern Europe, I think --

A - Warren E. Buffett

write fire insurance on concrete structures that are underwater. And I figured out instantly
that it was probably fraudulent.

And financial institutions are particularly, probably, prone to it. And there's been plenty of
it in insurance.

Yeah. People like to hire them as salesmen. If you've got doubts, forget it. There's
probably some reason you -It's interesting. The accounting -- they worked harder and harder and harder at coming up
with disclosures in accounting. And I'm not sure I find present financial statements more
useful or, in some cases, as useful as I found them 30 years or 40 years ago. Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

auditing two different companies that are on the opposite side of a derivative transaction
and attesting to different values to the same contract. And Charlie found one mistake at
Salomon on a derivative contract. What was it, 20 million?

I became the interim Chairman of -- interim CEO of Salomon in 1991, and, fortunately, I
testified to both the House and Senate committee before I found this out. And, generally
speaking, incidentally, Salomon wanted to have conservative accounting. I think that would
be a fair statement. And in many cases did.

But they did come in to me one day and they said, Warren, you probably should know that
we have this item -- and I think it was around 180 million or something like that -- with a
capital base of 4 billion, maybe -- but 180 million. And they said, this is a plug number, and
we've been plugging it ever since Phibro merged with Salomon in -- I guess, 1981.
For ten years, this number moved around every day. And as I remember, Phibro or some - one of them was on a trade date system, and that was on a settlement date system.
And in ten years, with Arthur Andersen as their accountant, paying a lot of money in
auditing fees, they just never figured out how the hell to get the thing to balance, so they
just stuck a number in every day.
And they literally plugged it for ten years, and I couldn't figure out how to unplug it myself.

Well, I might not know enough to do it myself, but I think -- and I wouldn't rule -- if it was
attractive enough and I thought I understood the nature of the business, I would probably
get some advice from some other people. And I might not end up doing it, but I wouldn't
totally preclude it.

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

I saw that done. The University of Michigan hired an investment manager in London who
specialized in sub-Saharan Africa. And I thought, My God, how are they doing this? What
they did is the little banks would trade in the pink sheets in Africa, and the first thing
people would want was not to have the money under their pillow, and they just bought all
the little banks in Africa, and they made a lot of money. So it is possible, if you know what
you're doing, to go into very unlikely places. I would say we're not very good at it.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

No, that isn't our specialty, but it can be done. And if we were poor enough, we might
even be thinking about doing it, right, Charlie?

Hello. I'm Marvin Blum from Fort Worth, Texas, the home to four of your companies.

FINAL

Absolutely. We love Fort Worth.

Q - Analyst
Thank you. We love you, too, and your presence in our community. I'm an estate planning
lawyer, and it's interesting as we wrap up today to ponder that the Baby Boomer
generation is about to pass along the greatest transfer of wealth in history.
I can design plans that eliminate estate tax and pass down great amounts of wealth to the
next generation, but many of my clients come to me and say they want a plan like Warren
Buffett's, leaving their kids enough so they can do anything, but not so much that they can
do nothing. Now they ask me, and I'm asking you, how much is that, and how do you keep
from ruining your kids?

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Yeah. Well.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think more kids are ruined by the behavior of their parents than by the amount of the
inheritance. Your children are learning about the world through you, and more through
your actions than through your words, from the moment they're born. You're their natural
teacher, and it's a very important and serious job.
And I don't think -- I don't actually think -- that the amount of money that a rich person
leaves to their children is the determining factor, at all, in terms of how those children turn
out. But I think that the atmosphere, and what they see about them, and how their
parents behave, is enormously important. I would say this: I've loosened up a little bit as I
go along.
Every time I rewrite my will, my kids are happy because they know I'm not reducing the
amount, anyway. And I do something else that -- I find that -- which I think is an obvious
thing, but it's amazing to me how many don't do it.
I think that your children are going to read the will someday -- that's assuming you're a
wealthy person -- your children are going the read the will someday. It's crazy to have
them read it after you're dead, for the first time. I mean, you're not in a position to answer
questions then unless the Ouija board really works or something of the sort.
So, if they're going to have questions about how to carry out your wishes, or why you did
this or that, you know, why leave them endlessly wondering after you die? So in my own
case, I always have my children -- I rewrite a will every five or six years or something like
that -- and I have them read it.

FINAL

They're the executors under it. They should understand how to carry out their obligations
that are embodied in the will, and they should -- also, if they feel there's anything unfair
about it, they should express themselves before I sign that will, and we should talk it over,
and we should figure out whether they're right or I'm right, or someplace in between.
So I do think it's very important in wealthy families, once the kids are of a certain age. I
mean, I don't advise doing this with your 14-year-old or something, but when they get -certainly by the time they're in the mid-30s or thereabouts -- I think they should be
participants in the will. And I do think that if you get to be very wealthy that the idea of
trying to pass on, create a dynasty of sorts, it just sort of runs against the grain, as far as
I'm concerned.
And the money has far more utility -- the last hundreds of millions or billions have far more
utility to society than they would have to make -- create a situation -- where your kids
don't have to do anything in life except call a trust officer once a year and tell them how
much money they want. Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

I don't think I want to go into this one.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

And I'm absolutely sure you don't want to discuss your will with your children if you're
going to treat them unequally.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

No.

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

That is poison.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

But there -- one of the problems you have -- I mean, and what you want to discuss just for
that very situation is there may be circumstances where one child will have much more of
an interest in one type of asset than others, or something of the sort.
And you want to make sure that your definition of equality, in terms of handling different
kinds of assets, meshes, or at least is understood, by the children so that they don't think
the fact that you may gave one a farm and another a house or something of the sort
resulted in inequality when you thought it was equality. Charlie, you got anything?

Q - Analyst
Mr.Buffett, Mr.Munger, thanks for everything that you do for us, including advice that you
give us, and also for -- as an individual investor -- for the things that you've done for me.
I have a question. You've long been against stock splits, but as you think about the
Berkshire A share and one day can -- if you don't split it -- it can get to a million dollars, is
the board thinking about how to deal with that, in terms of getting new stock owners, the
ownership structure, and so on?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

Well, I -- we actually -- I think we've got a pretty good arrangement now. It evolved,
originally, through some people that were going to try and make a lot of money off of our
shareholders by creating their own split shares, so we created the B shares.
And then when the BNSF acquisition came along, we wanted to be sure that people that
wanted to have a stock-free exchange, or that wanted to get shares, would not prohibit it
simply because they had a small amount of BNSF, and, therefore, our B shares were too
expensive. So I think now with one stock, you know, in the $100 range, people can split the
-- people that own the A stock can split their stock anytime they wish.
And we've always pledged that there won't ever be this situation, but if there was some
corporate transaction or anything like that, we will -- the A and B will get treated identically.
And so I really see no reason to change the present situation. Charlie?

A - Charlie Munger

{BIO 1406508 <GO>}

I would not hold your breath until we change.

A - Warren E. Buffett

{BIO 1387055 <GO>}

That may apply to almost anything in our lives. Okay, I think we'll take about a five minute
or so recess, and then we'll get on to the business part of the meeting. And I thank you all

Good afternoon. Mr.Buffett, Mr.Munger. Ladies and gentlemen, my name is -- I am a
student of economics and finance at Wartburg College in nearby Iowa. I hail from Kenya
and I'm here with a group of fellow students, all of whom very much appreciate the
opportunity to take part in this celebrated event. I stand on behalf of voice of Seattle to
move item number 2 on Page 12 of the proxy. A proposal the Berkshire established goals
for greenhouse gas reduction at its energy holdings.
We applaud MidAmerican energy for having the largest renewable energy portfolio in the
entire USA. However, it is also true that MidAmerican generates close to half of its power
by burning coal. Is a huge emitter of greenhouse gases. Given this fact why doesn't
MidAmerican have a plan. 66 of all the U.S. electric utilities have greenhouse gas reduction
goals, 66%. But MidAmerican is not among them despite publicly proclaiming that on its
website and I will quote we will set challenging goals and assess our ability to continually
improve our environmental performance.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you're aware climate disruption creates, profound financial risk for the global economy
as well as for Berkshire. The investor network, and climate risk, whose members managed
more than $11 trillion and the carbon disclosure project whose members manage more
than -- who would represent more than $80 trillion in assets globally, have called on
companies to disclose risks related to climate change, as well as to take steps to reduce
that risk.
In 2010, the SEC announced that climate risks are financially material and they must be
disclosed. This is because high carbon path creates risk, whereby the low-carbon path is a
lower risk more secure, way into the future without planning and a step a forward-looking
goals neither management, nor investors can know where they stand. In addition
Berkshire I have seen has been particularly vulnerable to climate disruption, why? Because
many of because many of the most negative financial impacts of climate assumption are
borne by insurance companies.
For example, GEICO took its largest single loss in history from Superstorm Sandy a $490
million loss to claims on more than 46,000 flooded vehicles Berkshires reinsurance
business is likely to be at significant risk from the clear trends towards increasingly
extreme weather. Well, some portion of this may be pushed towards clients in the form of
higher premiums, it is really fair or a good long-term strategy to saddle customers with a
cost of poor planning.
I'd like to conclude by recapping some of the major points hundreds of the world's largest
institutional investors representing trillions of dollars of in investment assets have called
on companies to set greenhouse gas reduction goals, such goals are key tools for
managing the profound business risk created by climate disruption more than two-thirds
of utilities have already established, such goals, and institutional proxy advisory firms,
repeatedly recommend voting for goal setting and disclosure of this sort. Therefore, I
urge you all to, please join us in voting for this common-sense proposal, that avoids risks,
preserves profits and treats our customers fairly. Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr.Herbert.
