Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Storebrand Third Quarterly
Conference Call. My name is Ann, and I will be your coordinator for today's conference.
For the duration of the call, you will be on listening only. However, at the end of the
presentation, you will have opportunity to ask questions.
I will now hand you over to Trond Finn Eriksen to begin today's conference. Thank you.

{BIO 17132188 <GO>}

Good afternoon, and welcome to Storebrand's Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. My
name is Trond Finn Eriksen, Head of Investor Relations at Storebrand. Together with me, I
have Group CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad; and Group CFO, Lars Løddesøl.
In the presentation today, Odd will give an overall view of the development in Q3. And
Lars will give some more details on some elements in the results. The slides will be similar
to the analyst presentation released this morning, and are available on our Web page.
After the presentation, operator will open up for questions. To be able to ask questions,
you will need to dial into the conference call.
I will leave the ﬂoor to Storebrand's CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad, who will start the
presentation on slide number 2.

FINAL

Thank you, Trond. Start on slide number 2, the highlights. Storebrand delivered a group
result of NOK 632 million for the third quarter, and NOK 2,110 million year-to-date. The
result is marked by growth in income and results from our main focus area, savings. The
result growth is 64% year-to-date. There is an ongoing forceful shift in the earnings mix
where savings increased, while guaranteed income is decreasing according to plan.
In addition, we have brought down costs with 3.9% nominally year to date, in line with our
cost program. The balance sheet has been strengthened during the year, and in the
quarter. The Solvency I ratio is now 182%. And reserves for increased longevity are
increased by NOK 2.7 billion, whereof NOK 0.4 billion in this quarter. Falling interest rates
has led to buﬀer building in the hold-to-maturity bond portfolio. An excess of balance
sheet values in this portfolio is now above NOK 10 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving to slide number 4, Lars will go through the result in more detail, so I skip this slide
number 3, and go directly to slide number 4. We have been working with a strategy to
adapt and reduce our guaranteed back book for a while. At the same time, we are
growing our non-guaranteed occupational pension business and our private ﬁnancial
products to our 1.9 billion (02:58) pension customers.
Let me give you a quick update on both parts of our strategy, and start with turning to
slide number 5; managing the balance sheet. Let me give some comments on our
implemented measures in the third quarter. When it comes to capital and product
optimization, we have continued to build on capital-intensive products, with NOK 5 billion
moved out of the balance sheet this quarter.
This is mainly public sector deﬁned beneﬁt plans in Norway. And added together, it sums
up to NOK 12.8 billion year-to-date, and NOK 27 billion for the last two-and-a-half years.
And this is before we opened up transferring paid-up policies into investment choice.
At the same time, we have success with our closed pension fund solutions to the public
sector. We have now sold our administration and asset management solutions for NOK 9
billion, after winning a new large contract in this area in the third quarter.
The work on risk management is proceeding with full force. Targeted segmentation of
portfolios to better adapt to longevity reservation's strengthening and Solvency II are
under full implementation. The cost reductions are, as you see, according to plan, and
amounts now to NOK 349 million year-to-date. And I am conﬁdent that we will reach our
NOK 400 million target at year-end.
Let's then turn to slide number 6, longevity. It is well known that Storebrand has a need to
strengthen its longevity reserves with a total of NOK 12.4 billion within seven years,
starting in 2014. As of the third quarter, the reserves amount to NOK 6.3 billion, which is
based on the earlier reserves and at NOK 2.7 billion in excess above the guaranteed rate
of equity contribution year-to-date.

I would like to emphasize that all contracts have been calculated in accordance with the
FSA's no solidarity principle, and that previous reserves now have been reduced by NOK
0.5 billion, as we have earlier noticed you to.

FINAL

Other buﬀer capital has strengthened during the quarter. The market value adjustment
reserves are now NOK 3.8 billion. And as mentioned, the surplus value of bonds at
amortized costs are now amounting to a total NOK of 10.1 billion.
Then, let's turn to slide number 7. During the third quarter, we had an important
regulatory clariﬁcation. At the 8th of September, the Norwegian FSA proposed
permanent and transitional measures for Solvency II. The proposal is in line with the
proposal from the European Union and in line with the industry recommendations from
Finance Norway.
We are satisﬁed with the suggestions of transition rules, which help secure a robust
transition to Solvency II. At the same time, it's important to emphasize that there's no
excuse to reduce the activities in transition our business model and the business mix.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let me then turn to slide number 8. October the 15th, we launched a product of system
solution for replacing the guaranteed paid-up policies with paid-up policies with
investment choice. This will, for many, generate higher expected return on their policies.
On Monday, one-and-a-half week after the solution were implemented, 700 customers,
amounting to NOK 160 million, in reserves have transferred their funds to paid-up policies
with investment choice. Half of these transfers are done using our Internet solutions only.
Then, Lars will go into the results in a bit more depth before we open up for questions.
Lars?

Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Thank you. I'd like you to turn to page 10, where we look at the key ﬁgures. And you see in
that result development, that result before proﬁt sharing and loan losses, the stable
contributor to earnings here, continues to deliver more than NOK 600 million per quarter.
Earnings per share is down compared to last year, and that is primarily – this is earnings
per share after-tax, and the main diﬀerence between the numbers last year and this year is
that we have a normalized tax level of 19% year-to-date and 23% in the quarter, while last
year we did not have any signiﬁcant tax payments or tax cost due to the fact that we sold
some properties with tax-deductible losses. I would also like to make sure that – or to
emphasize that we're not actually paying any taxes yet; that we still have tax carry loss
forward from previous years.
On the solvency ratio, you see that the solvency ratio is up to 182% under the Solvency I
rules. The falling interest rate in Sweden has been a negative contributor to the

Page 3 of 19

Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2014-10-29

development since last quarter, while result – withheld result and created result in the
period has contributed positively.

FINAL

Solidity capital has continued to build, and that's all the capital protecting all the
shareholders and is now up to almost NOK 62 billion. And if you look at the customer
buﬀers, they remain at a healthy level. And the main diﬀerence between the Norwegian
and Swedish market is diﬀerent product rules in the two countries.
Moving over to page number 11, we see the results broken down by type and by business
line. And let's start by type. Fee and administration income is slightly up year-on-year, but
it's nicely up in the third quarter after a slightly weaker second quarter.
If we take away the corporate bank, as well as the municipality pension business, which
are both actively run down, the underlying growth in fee and administration income is 5%,
despite the fact that we are transferring from deﬁned beneﬁt schemes to deﬁned
contribution schemes with lower margins.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking at the operational cost line, I – like Odd Arild was saying a moment ago, the cost
continues to go down; and down nominally 3.9%. The ﬁnancial result is signiﬁcantly up
from last year, and strong in the third quarter as well.
The result – or the strong results from the ﬁnancial result line comes as a consequence of
good returns and policy now in company portfolios; as well as in the quarter, we have a
one-oﬀ hedging eﬀect positive of NOK 20 million. So basically, we've hedged a euro loan
into Norwegian kroner. And the way this is accounted for, we get a NOK 20 million proﬁt
in the quarter.
The net proﬁt sharing and loan losses is very strong year-to-date, primarily from the
Swedish business, where they have booked returns of between 10% and 12%, which gives
a proﬁt split in those portfolios, in addition to the indexation fee that we take when these
portfolios have a reasonable consolidation.
Going over to the next box on result per line of business, we see there's a very signiﬁcant
growth in earnings from savings, non-guaranteed, which is up 65% quarter-on-quarter,
and 64% year-on-year. That shows the strong growth in both – or that's based on strong
growth both in assets under management and premiums and proﬁtability from this
business line. In reality, we're able to take on new funds with very low marginal cost. So,
despite the fact that we have margin pressure in this business, we're able to grow in a
proﬁtable way – in a very proﬁtable way, I should say.
On the insurance business, we have seen some big ﬁres in the third quarter, as well as a
slight increase in disability, both in Norway and in Sweden. As a consequence of the
slightly higher disability experience, we have decided to strengthen disability reserves by
a total of approximately NOK 100 million across diﬀerent business lines.

In guaranteed pensions, the proﬁtability is still rather strong, despite the fact that we are
in this line, setting aside NOK 90 million per quarter, NOK 270 million year-to-date in nonlife (12:43) provisions for the cost of the shareholders. And in the line Other, we have
decreasing costs in the ASA – sorry, in the holding company, and also good returns in the
company portfolios.

FINAL

So that concludes a general overview of the numbers. And do you want to...

Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yes, I'd like to then go to slide number 19, actually, and show you also that we have done
some changes in our pension scheme for our own employees in Storebrand. Yesterday,
the board decided to change the pension plan for all Storebrand employees in Norway
over to a DC plan from January 1, 2015. And I'd like to show your attention to note number
six in the third quarter report, to also have some guidelines on what this means for
ﬁnancial eﬀects in the fourth quarter. And they are positive, of course.
Then, I'd like to move to slide number 20 to sum up, before I open up for questions. The
sum-up is that there is a strong increase in fee and administration income in savings, and
compensates the reduction in the guaranteed pension area; 64% increase in the result
from savings year-to-date, and the cost control is strong, 3.9% nominal cost reduction
year-to-date. Thank you.

{BIO 17132188 <GO>}

Thank you, Odd Arild. The operator will now open up for questions.

Q&A
Operator
The ﬁrst question comes from Peter Eliot from Berenberg. Please go ahead. Your line is
now open.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you. I'll try and limit myself to three at this stage. Thank you very much. The ﬁrst
question, in-force DB reserves have fallen pretty signiﬁcantly, but I guess the more
problematic paid-up reserves are still increasing at sort of NOK 2 billion to NOK 3 billion
per quarter. I'm just wondering whether you could give us a view on – so going forwards,
whether you think you might be able to sort of combat that rate with transfers out, or
whether we should expect the paid-up reserves to continue increasing for the next couple
of years.
The second question was just on the disability reserve strengthening. I think we've seen
there's a bit of volatility in those over the last couple of years, and so both directions. But
I'm just wondering, perhaps if you could say sort of how comfortable you are with the sort
Page 5 of 19



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2014-10-29

of positions now, and what we might expect in terms of the risk proﬁts from there going
forwards.

FINAL

And then, perhaps, the third question on unit linked. We saw a very strong increase in fee
income, much more than the growth in assets under management. At the same time,
costs also took a big drop. I'm just wondering how sustainable the very strong margins
we've seen are, both sides of that equation. Thank you very much.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
With respect to the paid up policy growth in assets under management, I think you've
seen the experienced development in that portfolio as a consequence of the guaranteed
return, as well as the creation of new paid-up policies coming out of deﬁned beneﬁt plan.
It's too diﬃcult for us to – no, sorry, it's too early for us to say anything about the trend of
paid-up policies with investment choice. We've only been open for a week-and-a-half. But
my guess is that you would still see some growth in this portfolio in terms of assets under
management. But the exact size of that growth, we really need to see some more trend
ﬁgures on the paid-up policy with investment choice before we can give any ﬁrm
guidance on that.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the second question, disability reserve strengthening, the actuarials try to measure the
actual level of disability and reactivation, i.e., how many disabled people are returning to
active duty where they work on an ongoing basis. This happens in Norway and in Sweden.
It happens in the deﬁned beneﬁt portfolios, and the deﬁned contribution portfolios.
And I wish I could steer them to be more stable, but there will be always somewhat
adjustment of reserves here. But obviously, we don't expect any big changes as we go
forward. This is an ongoing adjustment to experience that we see in the market.
And in terms of unit linked fee income and cost level, the fee income, there are certain
one-oﬀs that strengthen the quarterly result. And there are certain cost elements that are
beneﬁting positively in this quarter.
The underlying trend you see in the year-to-date numbers, I would say, is a good
indication as to how this develops going forward. And in any one quarter, you will have –
around the trend line, there will be some ups and some downs around that trend line. I
think the trend line is quite clear. However, this quarter was exceptionally good, both on
cost and income, for certain smaller items.

The next question comes from Daniel Do-Thoi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line
is now open.

FINAL

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. I just have a couple of question around paid-up, and then one on the
corporate bank. In terms of paid-ups, you mentioned NOK 160 million relating to 700
customers. And – I mean, from the (19:01) that you've disclosed, I guess I can see that
you've managed to convert quite sizeable accounts, and by that, I mean larger than the
average on the back book; and secondly, that they appear to be fully or at least very well
reserved for longevity, given – while no obvious – no visible P&L impact. So I was just
wondering whether, ﬁrstly, if that was the case; whether you could conﬁrm that.
Secondly, if you could maybe give us a bit more – I know it's only been two weeks, if you
could give us a bit more detail on the characteristics of those early convertors, I mean,
even if just qualitatively.

Bloomberg Transcript

And thirdly, I mean, do you expect this – how do you expect this run rate to change over
time because I mean, are we just seeing sort of low-hanging fruits and shall we see sort of
smaller contracts and more costly conversions going forward? Or should we expect the
pace to be sustainable, even pick up, as more customers build up longevity reserves from
which you can then target customers? That was on paid-ups.
And the second one was on the corporate bank, where you've had another quarter of
very large transfers of loans to the life company. Can you just comment, maybe on a net
basis, how you expect that to impact the running yield going forward, given that yields
have come down quite a bit over the course of the quarter and also, what the net impact
of that is on capital requirements? Thank you.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Thank you. Let's start on the paid-up policies. We had NOK 160 million in transfer based
on 700 customers for the ﬁrst one-and-a-half week. And you are right, they are larger
accounts than in the average, say, in that transfer. And you will see that our sales force, of
course, targets customers that has a very good value proposition, that is large accounts,
and that also has quite a good situation when it comes to reservation for longevity. And
that is one part of the transfer.
Another part of the transfer is that is what is done through Internet directly. And half of
this transfer is done by people directly, without the help from our advisors. And obviously,
that is more early adaptors. That is they understand the ﬁnancials very well. They are very
well aware of what they have in paid-up policies and have been waiting to do this transfer.
We have not been very massively out in the market yet. There has been limited activities
from our side. So this is really people that has picked up that we have opened up and
starting to move their assets as soon as possible.
But we see, on a daily basis, that there is ﬂow of people that really changed their paid-up
policies into investment choice on a daily basis. So this is not something started over
Page 7 of 19



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2014-10-29

(22:13) the ﬁrst days and then leveled (22:15) out again. It seems to be a quite stable
transfer going forward. And you are right also that there is quite a limited need for
longevity reservation in these contracts. I think it's somewhat around 3% in top-up that is
needed, something like that, to get these transfers going.

FINAL

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

But you won't see that in the third quarter numbers, obviously, because this is happening
in the fourth quarter.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Yes. And it's also taking account for that in the NOK 90 million – part of that for the NOK
90 million we already use as a run rate on the equity charge in the life insurance company.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yes, and on your question on the corporate bank, there has been NOK 1.9 billion worth of
corporate loans sold to Storebrand Life in the third quarter. And if you look at that in the
context of a portfolio of almost NOK 200 billion, obviously, that's a fairly small amount. So
the exact impact on the yield is negligible, but it's one of many things that we do to
enhance the yield and to use our capital in a more eﬃcient way. So it's diﬃcult to give an
exact number, but it's going to be negligible in the big picture.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay, thanks. And just one follow-up, on the paid-up policies, what was roughly the split
of the NOK 160 million between self-service and targeted?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

The split between?

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Self-service converters and targeted converters, i.e., those that you actively targeted
through your sales force.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I think I have it on the number of people that have transferred. And half of it is transferred
directly on Internet, and half of the numbers are transferred through help with our
advisors.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
But I think also that you should assume that the average contract, by itself, is somewhat
smaller than the advised ones.

FINAL

The next question comes from David Andrich from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Your line is now open.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. First of all, I think you mentioned
that you've strengthened the disability reserves by about NOK 100 million across the
diﬀerent business lines. Could you kind of give a breakdown between I guess the DC and
DB, how that was split? And just as a follow-up to that, just wondering if you – what impact
you anticipate the new disability cover that's expected in 2015 to have? And then, just to
follow up on the earlier question around unit linked margins and the one-oﬀs coming
through in the quarter supporting that, just wondering if you could maybe quantify what
the net impact was. Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Can you repeat the last question?

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. You mentioned that there were some – that the unit linked margin was beneﬁting
from both some one-oﬀs in terms of revenue as well as cost beneﬁts in the quarter, and I
was just wondering if maybe you could quantify what that impact was.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Well, David, on the disability reserve strengthening, I think very roughly, you can divide
the NOK 50 million that hits the risk results in the guaranteed pension and NOK 50
million which hits the insurance segment, as such. However, you should be aware that in
the insurance segment, you have also some releases in the Swedish business, which
compensates, to a large extent, the reserve strengthening.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And with respect to new disability rules in Norway, that's the publicly ﬁnanced disability
support, which basically removes the need for disability insurance for low paid people. So
that is expected to reduce the level of premiums and coverage for basically the blue
collar part of the population. But on the other hand, there is no – it's basically a ﬁxed
amount in disability coverage, which means that the need for disability coverage for white
collar and well-paid people is increasing.

Page 9 of 19



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2014-10-29

As it seems right now, the rules are a bit delayed, so we don't know exactly when they will
come about. And there will be a transition period, most likely, of some years. So that, in
itself, it should reduce premiums within disability, and especially for blue collar, low-paid
people.

FINAL

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Okay. And that's related to the DC plan, right?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

No, that's the public sector, what we get from the public – for disability in Norway,
regardless of what kind of occupational pension plan you have.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And with respect to your last question, there are many moving parts in the result. And
there was one fee that is – has been generated within unit link for basically when you send
out invoices by paper, that we were able to include this quarter; and also, with a periodic –
that we also charged in the second quarter. But that wasn't included in the second
quarter, so that gives us a positive one-oﬀ of a couple of a few million for this quarter.
On the cost side, there was, within asset management, certain bonus reserves that were
not used for the program of – with the restructuring program that were released; that
decreased cost a few millions again in the quarter.
So it's not the unit linked margins as such, but it's certain one-oﬀs that hit – or that, well,
impacted the income line, as well as the cost line, in a positive way in the quarter. But I
repeat my guidance comment that these things tend to go up and down on a quarterly
basis. And the underlying strength in the earnings from savings is quite good, although
they were – they got a positive impact from these single eﬀects in the quarter.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

The next questions come from Gianandrea Roberti from Carnegie. Please go ahead. Your
line is now open.

A - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon from me as well. I have three quick questions. The ﬁrst one, it's on
this new academic contract that you disclose here in this presentation. I'm not sure if I dial
in a bit too late, but I just – I'm trying to understand what the ﬁnancial impact of this. Is it

FINAL

correctly, I assume, these are mostly DC schemes? How much are reserves and how
should we model it going forward?
Then, my second question will be on this transfer possibility that you open up a few days
ago for you. I spoke brieﬂy to DNB Investor Relations team this morning, and the numbers
that they are giving me out are very, very, very low compared to the 700 clients and the
NOK 160 million that you mentioned. I'm just trying to ﬁgure out if – of course, this is a key
area for you, and it's probably less of a key area for them, but I'm just trying to understand
if there are two very diﬀerent strategy around this, or if they are being too cautious. I'm
not sure how much you can add because you have already spoken a bit about this, but
any input would be useful.
The ﬁnal question, it's on your insurance segment, I appreciate you split it in three. And
the most growth is coming from the PC segment. But if I look at forward, leaving aside the
2014, wouldn't be fair to assume that, I mean, if I look at the insurance segment as a
whole, premiums are probably growing 5% or so? Thanks. That would be very helpful.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank you. I'll start with the academic and also the paid-up policies. Well, academic
is a very important agreement we have made with some trade unions in Norway. It's 11 –
umbrella of 11 diﬀerent organizations, and they have more than 110,000 employees that
are highly skilled, high education, and is in a very attractive area for us to give insurance
products to.
And we have made a deal that this corporate pension, this corporate insurance product,
will be moved into Storebrand by January 1, 2015. And that is approximately NOK 220
million in annual premiums. And then, it's also a lot of individual products here, individual
insurance products, a whole range of them. They will be individually contacted by us to
make an oﬀer to transfer from today's provider, DNB, into Storebrand for all of these
insurance products. So that is the potential we are seeing. And altogether, it's the same
level I think on the individual (32:29) potential that will be transferred to us.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And if I can just add on that, Gianandrea, there you already have 5%, 6%, 7% growth in the
insurance premiums going into next year.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
So that was the academic. Now, when it comes to paid-up policies, I think it's fair to say
that we have a diﬀerent strategy, the diﬀerent providers in Norway. We have been very
clear that we open up to all our paid-up policyholders an opportunity to move into
investment choice. And that means that you can go into our net solutions and do your
process by yourself, while most of our competitors has a more targeted process. And
some of them just go also to the contract that is truly reserved before the transfer into
investment choice. And of course, that diﬀerent attitude towards these clients also lead to
very diﬀerent results when it comes to transfer from paid-up policies to investment choice.

The next questions come from Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please go ahead. Your
line is now open.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. It's Matti from Danske here. Two questions, if I may. Firstly, more of a
kind of a philosophical one, and regarding the buﬀer capital and the guaranteed basis,
obviously, we're at very high levels at the moment, partly because of the declining bond
yields. But how should we look at the buﬀer capital going forward? Any kind of target
levels and what should one think about this overall? Second question is if you could give
me an update on how much was the – how many of the current paid-up policies are fully
reserved for longevity. Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Yes, maybe start on the philosophic one then. Well, as you say, when we have declining
interest rates, that leads in our balance sheet to increase in buﬀers for policy – for our
held-to-maturity bond portfolio. And that is a very direct and a good match towards our
guaranteed portfolio.
A large part of our guaranteed portfolio today has an asset mix with around 50% of this
kind of held-to-maturity of products. And it's an important, of course, part of our risk
management strategy, as we see that the guaranteed products will have a run-up phase,
that we will have lower guarantees over time, and that we are able to match that run-oﬀ of
our guaranteed products with also a large part of healthy maturity bond portfolio, with a
high annual running yield. And that is a direct match between, of course, the interest rates
and the surplus values in this portfolio. And there is no targeted level on that.
Then, of course, it's also important for us to have as much a high level of value adjusted –
market value adjustment reserves. And that is the most ﬂexible buﬀer we have. It can be
used on a rainy day, if we fall below the guarantee level in some portfolios to realize some
gains. And it's also a very important buﬀer for us to utilize, if needed, when it comes to the
longevity reservation as an additional buﬀer. And it's on a high level today. And of course,
we hope for good markets and opportunity to build that even further, going forward.

Is it fair to assume that the market value adjustment is probably going to be lower in this
quarter than in Q3, providing that the markets stay where they are?

FINAL

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Providing that the equity markets falls, then we will automatically use some of the market
value adjustment reserve. On the other hand, as some of – some other elements on the
credit spreads (37:14) are moving, we wait and see. But the automatic way this work is that
when equity markets fall, well, then the market value adjustment reserves falls. But as the
markets grows, then these reserves also grows.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
It is also a fact that they have quite a limited asset mix when it comes to shares into our
guaranteed portfolio. It was even reduce that end of the third quarter. So, the direct
impact on our guaranteed products from preparations in equity is very limited to what it
used to be some years ago.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And with respect to the paid-up policies being fully reserved, I think it was NOK 5 billion
that we announced last quarter that was fully reserved. And at the same time, we said that
there was a high – or a good value proposition to move into better policies with
investment choice for approximately NOK 30 billion worth of paid-up policies.

The next question comes from Blair Stewart from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go
ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you very much and good afternoon. I've got a couple of smaller questions. The ﬁrst
one is just on fee and admin income in a couple of the segments. The ﬁrst one is in the
Norwegian DB book, where I think the fee and admin income ﬁgure was NOK 270 million.
Now, that's higher than it was in Q1 and Q2, despite the fact that you've got signiﬁcantly
lower reserves, so just wondering what's going on there. Is there anything one-oﬀ?
And I'm sorry to return to this, Lars, but just a question on the fee and admin income in
the unit linked book in Norway. It was NOK 118 million in Q3. And I realize that there is
some volatility, but NOK 118 million is about 40% higher than it's been averaging the last
six quarters before that, so it's an outlier. I know you've talked about a few millions here
and there, but it wouldn't quite explain why it's so high. So, apologies for going back to
that, but I wonder if you can think again if there's another answer you can give.

The second question is on the performance fees in asset management. From time to time,
you do give an indication of what has been accrued but not yet booked by way of
performance fees and asset management for Q4. I wonder if you've got anything to say
there.
And ﬁnally, just a small point. You talked about in the insurance business, obviously you
had the disability reserves, but you also talked about higher-than-expected ﬁre costs. And
I wonder if you could put a number on the ﬁre costs. Thanks.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

If I can start with the performance fee in the asset management, I think it's in the interim
report as well. There, it's recognized but not booked NOK 51 million as of Q3.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

NOK 51 million? Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

When it comes to the fee and admin income on the unit linked business in Norway, I just
can conﬁrm what Lars has said. It's really a smaller item, but where you get two quarters of
approximately NOK 5 million a quarter into this quarter. So the run rate in itself will be
higher. Due to that, you should expect approximately NOK 5 million additional revenues
every quarter. But this quarter, you got an additional NOK 5 million on top of that, so
that's why this seems maybe a bit higher than what it used to be.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
And with respect to fee and administration income in the deﬁned beneﬁt book, you are
quite right, that the charge that we have booked, or the fee that we have booked for the
interest rate guarantee and risk margin is up in the quarter, which also surprised me a little
bit when I saw it the ﬁrst time due to the fact – it's exactly as you say, that this business is
run down and also the public sector and the municipalities are moving out.
However, that is due to two things. One thing is that we booked slightly too little risk
margin in the ﬁrst half, which is made up for now. And the second is that because of salary
increases, you have one-oﬀ premiums on the people still in deﬁned beneﬁt plans, which
also carries an interest rate guarantee and a risk margin. And those were booked in the
third quarter – or a larger proportion than normal was booked in the third quarter. So
salary increase and deﬁned beneﬁt books, as well as a periodic eﬀect on risk margins
(42:22) between ﬁrst half and the third quarter.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay, great. And the ﬁre loss?

compared to that.

The next question comes from Peter Eliot from Berenberg. Please go ahead. Your line is
now open.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you for the opportunity to follow-up. I just want to focus quickly, ﬁrst of all, on your
answer – one of your answers to Gianandrea's question on the transfers. It sounded like
anybody who wanted to transfer into paid-up with investment choice could do so online.
I'm just wondering whether there are, in fact, sort of controls in place for policies that are
not well-reserved for longevity. Perhaps, you could just clarify whether there is any risk of
literally anybody transferring.
And then, perhaps, if I could come back with two more quick questions of my own. You
mentioned in the report some competition emerging in the health insurance space. And I
note that your underwriting results in 2014 have been sort of signiﬁcantly worse than the
last couple of years. I'm just wondering, perhaps, if you could sort of talk about your view
of the underwriting results there, going forward, and whether that's a sort of 2014
phenomenon.
And then, sorry, perhaps, I could also just ask on the cost development. And I note your
chart on slide 5 shows those costs sort of ﬂattening out in line with your plan. But I'm just
trying to square that with the sort of 4% reduction that you're reporting, and also sort of
going forwards, with the sort of NOK 50 million run rate you expect to get sort of by the

end of the year. Just to clarify whether that should come through – whether we should see
that in Q4 earnings? Thank you. Sorry, that was a bit more than a couple of short ones.

FINAL

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

That's ﬁne. Starting on paid-up policies, you're absolutely right. We have made it clear
that we are open for everyone that likes to move from today's paid-up policies into
investment choice; although we of course monitor this on a daily basis. And we very well
know what kind of clients (45:18) that is moving from paid-up policies into investment
choice. And we also use our own multi-channel sales force on targeted groups, based on
of course a very green situation when it comes to value creation by moving, but also
taking into account the level of longevity reservation in the contract.
Altogether, so far, we see that this moves in a very good direction with good control. But
we have the opportunity, of course, if we see that this is moving into a wrong direction, to
put some boundaries on that. We don't see any reason why we should do those, so as we
speak, but we monitor it and follow it tight. And it's a very important value proposition for
our clients, and we also stand out as a very customer-friendly company in Norway by
oﬀering this opportunity for everyone that wants to move from a low guaranteed into an
opportunity to free choice when it comes to investments.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
With respect to the health insurance margin and competition, I don't have any speciﬁc
answer to your question. There is no strategic change in the market, as such. We continue
to have a healthy market, which is growing, and we continue to have a healthy
development in that business. There was some strengthening of the reserves earlier on
also that had some impact on top margin, and we expect healthy margins on health
insurance going forward.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And on the cost program, we initiated the cost program with many hundred diﬀerent
initiatives. And some of those initiatives did not conclude within the period that we said,
but we are not closing them despite that. So they will continue into the fourth quarter and
into next year, with a full year eﬀect in 2015 and even in 2016. But what we are saying is
that the – where we haven't been able to conclude one initiative, we have found another
initiative that will be concluded in time. So, overall, the cost program that we put in place,
having NOK 400 million nominally, will be delivered by the end of this quarter. However,
the aftereﬀects or the tail of that is going to positively impact the cost level in 2015 and
2016.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
And I think that's also the reason why you see the picture on slide 5 being ﬂat. Although
you see in our accounts that the costs are continuing down, because what we have
implemented so far gives full eﬀect in the Q3, while there are still some more eﬀects to be
implemented in Q4.

And the last question comes from Daniel Do-Thoi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your
line is now open.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks. Just got two more questions. The ﬁrst one is on DB scheme closures. And the
second one on the ﬁnancial result. I'll start with the DB.
You mentioned that you'll be switching your employees over to DB schemes at beginning
of next year. But I just want to hear from you what your sense is in discussion with
customers of the level of urgency in doing similar (48:53) because one of your peers
estimated a decline in their DB funds by about a third or so by 2016. Just wondered if
that's sort of in line with your expectations or your thinking.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then, on the ﬁnancial result, I know that you received an uplift this quarter from falling
yields and from tightening credit spreads. But what should we expect to be a normal level
here? And to what extent can you improve that, given you're able to reﬁnance your debt
at a lower cost? Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Okay. I can start on the ﬁrst question. You're absolutely right. We close our own DB
schemes starting oﬀ this year, schemes from January 1, 2015. And there are some, of
course, quarter-by-quarter, companies that are doing that. I don't see a trend shift in the
market. It's still the same mechanisms as I've talked about earlier.
You see typically that the companies with a large portion of their employees in DB book
have a better opportunity to move into deﬁned contribution. And you also saw signiﬁcant
higher savings rate in diﬀerent contribution, as we are doing when we move into the DC
scheme; while companies that have done their soft close a while ago will then have also
to give a large uplift in savings rate from the ones that has been coming into the company
for maybe the last ﬁve, six, seven, eight years.
So there is individual views in every company. While they are doing soft closes or hard
closes, there is individual discussion based on a lot of elements. So, there is no clear trend
shift in that, as I view it then. The level we have now of transfer from deﬁned beneﬁt into
deﬁned contribution, it's a one-way train, of course, but it's not a massive change in the
activities, as we view it in the market.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
The last question, can you repeat that, please?

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

FINAL

The last question was just on the ﬁnancial result. So basically, my question was what do
you see as a normalized level, given that you received a beneﬁt or a tailwind from tighter
spreads, falling yields, et cetera, this quarter? What should we expect on this line going
forward in 2015? And also, what's the opportunity to further reduce that, given you can
reﬁnance at lower yields?

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
We don't have a ﬁnancial results, as such, in the guaranteed pension, and not to the
owners, if you look at the graph. But are you talking about the running yield on the
guaranteed portfolios?

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

No. So just in your summary P&L, the ﬁnancial result, which, if I understand correct, is the
return on your corporate portfolio, your interest expense and your return on your...

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
(52:08)

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
In the third quarter, there was a one-oﬀ eﬀect (52:18) approximately NOK 20 million. I
think if you subtracted that from the result, I think you're pretty close to the underlying
(52:31). You're not – they're probably somewhat too strong in the insurance this quarter as
well. So if you deduct roughly NOK 30 million or so, then you start to – it really depends a
lot on how you are viewing – or talking into next year is somewhat diﬃcult.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

What we can say about next year is that, ﬁrst of all, we have had good returns due to
falling interest rates. So there's a short-term bond portfolio there, which has given more
than normalized returns this year. Next year, we have a very expensive loan in the
Storebrand Life company, which is running at LIBOR plus 775 basis points, which was
reﬁnanced back in 2008 – in the summer of 2008, which we will repay. And obviously, we
can borrow much cheaper than that now. So that should reduce borrowing expense,
which will impact positively the net ﬁgure in this line.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay, that's clear. Thank you.
