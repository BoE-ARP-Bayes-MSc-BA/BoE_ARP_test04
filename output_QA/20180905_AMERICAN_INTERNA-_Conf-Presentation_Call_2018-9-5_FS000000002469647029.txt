Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. I think we're on. Good morning everyone. With me now we've got Brian
Duperreault, CEO of AIG. For those of you who don't know me, significantly less important
member of this panel, Meyer Shields, KBW Equity Research.
I want to kick off with the sort of a broad question. And our hope for this session is to have
significant interaction with people in the room. So, if you've got a question, we do have a
centralized microphone stand. We'll also be taking the microphone around. So, if you've
got a question then by all means just signal and we'll get the mic to you to make sure that
everyone can hear the question.

Q&A
Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

But let me start off with the big one and that is, so you've been at AIG for a while now.
What's been done? How do you see things panning out? Any surprises over the past year
plus?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, yeah, it is. I can't talk about it in days or weeks or months now, it's year, right? So, I've
been there a year and three months something like that. And well, I think it's panning out
pretty well. I think the biggest indication I think of where we are is the kind of people
who've come to the company. And that was one of the things I was probably the most
concerned about was could we attract talent back into the company. The company had
been losing people.
So, it was a net loser of talent for a number of years. And so would we reverse that trend
and boy, I'd tell you we've got – you just got a great team, match them against anybody
the people we've been able to put together. So, I think that alone is probably the prime
indicator of what's going to happen because you put great people in an situation at AIG
where we have an enormous capability, still great – still very, very, very good relationships
with our clients and brokers, and so it's – and it's got capabilities second to none. You put
great people together with that. So, that's good. So, that's moving well.

I think look at some of the other indicators, the reserves have been relatively stable. So, I
think that's another indication of kind of getting to a point of building a base that you can
grow from. But it's volatile business and we still suffer from some of that. But we're trying
to fix the volatility and the problem with the volatility is if you've got a good book of
business and it's volatile, the movement is just, it's the predictability becomes more
difficult, right, because you've got big (00:02:45), even if it's good book of business. If it's
not a good book of business then you've got and you are taking on large limits, it's even
worse, right? We haven't had a lot of great business. So, we have a lot of great
businesses. But you look at our underwriting results, they had been very good, and so the
volatility just adds to it.
So, we had to dampen that down, get that down, so that there's – you can actually see
what's going on because was it, you get 10 large losses was that bad underwriting, was
that just the luck of the draw, you wouldn't have seen them in the past because they are
reinsured away. So, trying to get that stability back has been an important part of what
we're doing. And I think to some degree making purchases that reduce the volatility
means you got premium going out the door, if you buy, it's just a loss. It's like when you
buy insurance, nothing happens. Did I get ripped off ? Well, you bought protection. So, it
comes at a cost. So, some of that's flowing through the business. Any surprises like I told
you, I was surprised that we were able to get the people. I was surprised at the reaction
of the customers, but it was a positive reaction.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We know who you are?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

You know who I am. So, what I mean by that is, when I first showed up, it was – we have
been going through a re-underwriting process and that's been happening, and so we
said, we would like – we like this one day, then we say, we don't like it the next day, and
actually sometimes we say, look, look, we were wrong about that, we actually do like it,
and we're confusing the hell out of the market.
And so, I was concerned that the market would just say, I'll just go find somebody else.
But they couldn't or they wouldn't. So, we had – I spent a lot of time with the customers,
particularly in the early days, and I was universally, not astounded, but surprised at the
positive reaction. They wanted AIG back. They wanted to do business with us. The
brokers, who are representing them feel the same way, leaning in, so that was again a
very positive surprise.
To name a surprise was the organization structure, which in no sense, and we weren't
organized to win. And so, we had to sort that all out and sorting it all out took some time,
but it also delayed to some extent getting the talent in because we didn't know where to
put them, you got crazy structure. Come in, I did that for a few people like Peter, they
come in, I'll sort it out. But we didn't want to make that the mantra. So, we said, look, let's
sort out the organizational structure. We say, look, when you come in, this is what you're
going to do. This is your – this is the plan. This is your mission, you're out – your place in
the sun and so if that was a bit of a surprise, that the organizational structure was as odd
Page 2 of 22



Company N ame: American I nternational Group I nc
Company Ticker: AI G US Equity
Date: 2018-09-05

as it was. But we sorted that out. So, maybe that's a long-winded answer, but there you
go.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

FINAL

No, that's not we're looking for.

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Okay.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

So, where are we now in terms of having structure reset, having the right people always
going to be some sort of attrition or change, but the difference between fixing something
that needed to be repaired and just typical...

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, well, I think its execution now. We were in the execution phase, so structure's right,
getting the right people. And I mean, there's still – they are adding. So, you bring good
people in and senior levels now, and now that's next level down, next level down, so
that's still building. We're still building there. But it's execution, getting our expense levels
where they need to be. We've got to do that, that's execution. We got to continue to look
at the way we not only take business in, but layoff, so we're still looking at our reinsurance
structure because I think there's still some more work to be done there so, but that's
execution.
It's getting the rates when you need rates or reducing the limits or finding the right
attachment point for this particular risk, all that is work in progress, but we're getting
there, that's why I said, I believe we will cross the line. I've said it. Certainly by year-end,
we'll be in an underwriting profit position, which is a milestone. It is not the goal, it is a way
point. But it is an indication of movement and that's why, put that market down.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Right? So, there are two comments that came out on the second quarter call that I
wanted to dig into a little more. The first is as you said underwriting profit by year end.

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

The second is maybe a little caution on loss trends. Now, if you're underwriting profit by
the end of the year, underwriting profit by the end of the year, then I think we're fine. But I
was hoping you could talk a little bit more about those two aspects of what you're seeing
as milestones?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

The aspects being loss trends versus underwriting profit?

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

Yeah.

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, that's the constant battle in our business, isn't it? You're constantly trying to, I mean,
we're predicting the future for heaven's sake, who can do that precisely, right? So, you've
got some reasonable expectation of what you think is going to happen loss trends, et
cetera. And you've got to keep always – you got to stay on top of it. So, if you take your
eye off of that then you lose ground because then you've got to make it up by getting
more rate, necessarily than you would have – if you've done it in a steadier way. Anyway, I
think Peter did talk about loss trends on the call. And, look, there is certainly, I think he said
with the exception of comp, we don't make exceptions to comp anymore, I don't know.
But there is some price movement too, right? So, you've got loss trends. So the question
is, are you keeping above the loss trends with our rates, and that's what we were trying to
get across is there are some that are little higher than others, and don't ask me about all
that stuff. But you have to go by line of business. If it's excess, it's more extreme. You get
to be more rate conscious, but you also have to be conscious about where you are
attaching because sometimes if you're not attaching high enough, it's like catching a
falling knife. There's not enough rate in the world, right? So, you got to keep above it.
That's equivalent of a rate, but you're staying above the loss activity. If you stay within the
loss activity, your rate requirements are very, very high, right? So, you got to pick your
spots. So, there's a lot of ways to construct a portfolio.
But the long story short is we are doing the right thing there, whether it's attachment
point or getting rate above loss trend, I think we're confident that we're moving in the
right direction. So, that would again give me the reason to say that we'll get the loss ratios
to where they need to be, and we also need to get the expense ratios where they need
to be. And that's a very important part of getting to a profitable position. If I look at our
loss ratios versus our expense ratios, the expense ratios are more out of line with the
industry than our loss ratios.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. And I would look at it from a – in sort of a price takers perspective, and that is – that
means that that's where you need to have most of the attention done, and I believe it's
not going to dramatically change the industry's pricing levels.

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Right.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Page 4 of 22

So, it's an expense issue, which is something that you focused on, on the second quarter
call.

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

FINAL

Right? And it's not a rate – I don't need to get rate. I need to fix the expenses.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

You know what I mean?

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So, it takes less pressure off. The nicest thing about it from my point of view is I've got
more degrees of freedom than maybe my counterparts do because I'm in more extreme
positions. Expense ratio is too high. I can work on that. I don't have to get my underwriters
to go crazy about price and risk. They can stay in the market and we can still make an
improvement, that's what's interesting.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Right? Again, I want to point out that we're welcoming questions from the floor as much
as possible. So, we'll get the mic to Josh (00:11:24).

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Hands are going up.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. Brian, I think you're doing a good job with remaking the business for the long
term, doing it the right way. I think some investors are frustrated with the perceived lack of
progress in terms of getting the combined ratio down. I think you talked about some
things that were working against that...

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

...in terms of reducing volatility that cost money, the Swiss Re deal falling off, changing the
mix. All those things are sort of headwinds, not necessarily – reduced volatility is a good
thing, but it's masking underlying improvement in the loss ratio. Is it possible for you to
Page 5 of 22



Company N ame: American I nternational Group I nc
Company Ticker: AI G US Equity
Date: 2018-09-05

FINAL

give us a sense for the magnitude of some of these volatility-reducing efforts? And how
much of a headwind that has been and it's sort of offsetting the underlying improvement
that you're seeing? And does any of that stuff go away? You're changing your reinsurance.
Is this a permanent thing, or can you write smaller risks where you wouldn't need as much
reinsurance going forward?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, it looks like smaller risk, well, I wouldn't need as much reinsurance. But that's a whole
new segment of business. So, let's see if I can answer this question. Yeah. Can I quantify
the actual effect of reducing the volatility in terms of the cost to the company? That's a
little bit harder to do. We've given you some indication like the cat program that we've put
in place for this year. Last year, we had $4 billion worth of cats, and we had no – basically
no recovery, right? So, now I go out and I buy – we go out and buy reinsurance of
significance. And I think we said it moved a couple of points in the – a couple of points,
right, in the expected levels of cat.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, that's an indication, right? So, that's a cost-out. If we didn't do it, you would see maybe
a couple of points improvement, but you left your company bare to having years where
you could take $4 billion out of your book value, which is crazy. So, that's one indication.
Some of the others would be proportionally the same, but the book of business wouldn't
be as large like the excess of loss program in Europe. That cost is, percentage-wise, a
decent piece of the business, but it's not a big – it's kind of loss and rounding error in
terms of the whole, but these are pockets of it.
The volatility is interesting. We also have – you look at our investment income, it can be
quite volatile, more volatile than I think I've been used to or others. Now, these – all these
investments have been good. They've been good book value builders, but they can swing
around a little bit.
And then the other thing I'd say about masking or improvement, it depends on the line of
business, how soon those improvements show up and you can feel confident in them.
Okay, now, I can believe all day long, we're doing the right thing and I do. But I'm not
going to wishfully think my loss ratio down until there's clear evidence that it's occurring.
So, in casualty business, you have an excess of loss book, the worst one in the world and
the best one in the world looks the same. At the end of the first year, you're writing that
business. It takes a while.
So, I can go fix it, but we have to say, okay, here's been the trends, here's what we've
looked at, the actual – heard the story too many times and they're going to say okay, I
hear you, let's see it all play out. If you're right, you're right? So, you're still going to put
loss picks up there and reserve levels to be prudent, you have to be, because it's volatile
business, right? And you could have – you can do all the right things and have just a year in
the extreme, because it's a range, right.
So, you're not going to see the casualty business emerging quickly. It just doesn't happen
that way. It's going to take us – let us – let us see how it builds. And it'll bleed out. The
difference between say where we are and some of the peers is they've – if they've got a
Page 6 of 22

FINAL

better book of business, they were conservative five years ago that stuff tends to get
released. So, you're putting it up this year and releasing it from the back year, and if you
do that every time, kind of balances out.
I'm building up. I got nothing to release. So, you're not going to see that until couple of
years play out and that's another – I can't – I'm not going to rush, I'm not going to rush
that, and I'm not going to – I don't want to be in a position where we got to pick reserves
again because we declared victory too soon. But I firmly believe we're doing that, and
we'll see if it happens.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. There is a question.
Hi, thanks. Brian, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on the comments
about the expense ratio. As far as – maybe give us some examples or some detail of
where specifically – you're too high on expenses, is it too many underwriters relative to
premium, is it an inefficient claims organization, is it too many middle managers or is it like
blocking and tackling, purchasing and real estate type stuff. And if the answer is, it's all of
them then maybe you get to highlight the one or two that are the biggest issues?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, we've been adding to underwriting. And so, I wouldn't put a finger there. I'm
not sure we had an efficient process around the underwriter. So, I don't think we were
allowing them to operate properly because we had checkers – check and checkers, but
we had a lot of overlay control.
If you have problems with your underwriting, the first thing to fix is the underwriting. You
don't fix it by putting people above them to control them. And so we have a lot of that.
We had inefficient processes, we still do, where things just have lots of manual
intervention and you get to a point where you, yes, you can take 5% off, 10% off. But if you
do it across the board, you haven't fixed the problem. So, what we're trying to do now is
be much more specific about do you really need this. You can build up, you can justify it in
a – the company hasn't been well-run, so we need all these things and you're not
addressing the right problem.
So, I wouldn't call the underwriters. That's not a problem. Claims are okay. I'm not sure.
And by the way the claims expenses show up in the loss side anyway and we're
addressing that. I think we're probably, we do more work with our legal cost, that will show
up in a different part of the loss – that will show up in the loss ratio. But it's much more
around the administrative process of getting the business on the books, not necessary –
and some degree, but not much the decision making around should I write this risk or not.
It's all about how it – it's the process around it, and it's been that way for a long, long time.
It's been that way for a long, long time. And I said – I have said this in my town halls, it's
not my – my legacy will not be, I leave this place kind of the way it was when I left, right?
It's going to be – we have to move ourselves into the modern world of how you do
business in our industry much more efficient. I hope that helps you.

FINAL

And by the way, so – so it always involves people, doesn't it? It is lot – expenses tend to
be people. And so, we announced our restructuring charge. It takes a while for that to play
out, right? It's going to play out for the next several months, and so there's no instant
gratification. It's not going to like fall couple of points immediately. It stretches out. But
we'll get there before the end of the year.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Hi, on the Q2 call, you said you are quite pleased. You said you're quite pleased with
where reserves were, how much further along are you on the review, and would you say
you are still quite pleased?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, I think we did 20%, so we're doing the next cadre of them. And I always like to
emphasize, it's not like we don't look at the other 80%. If you look – you look at all the
reserves every quarter, but there's one that get intense work and you look at the others
and if there's something wrong, apparently wrong with part of that 80%, it would have
been moved up. So, that's one indication. Work's on-going. Wait till the end of the quarter.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

So, I'm taking that as (00:21:01) from Q2. Is that the right way to think?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

I said I was pleased with the process. I think the way we go about it is the right way. And
you're constantly addressing emerging information, some positive, some negative and
you blend it all, but I think the process is good. I think there's a conservatism now in place
in the reserving process, which I was talking about earlier about not declaring victory too
soon. And so, I am not signaling any problem.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Okay.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

I've another one just on regarding S&P. How would you characterize your interactions with
them, and if you can speak in terms of runway to achieve results that would maybe cause
them to rethink how they look at your credit?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, they are – and I don't think they're unique. But they want to see is an improvement
taking place in the portfolio, which – what's the trend, you're getting better, you're getting
worse. You never stand still, right? And so, the relationships we have with S&P are all
Page 8 of 22



Company N ame: American I nternational Group I nc
Company Ticker: AI G US Equity
Date: 2018-09-05

about where are we with that, how are we doing. And I think we have a good relationship.
I think they feel good about where we are as a company and the progress, the kind of
changes we've made. They love the fact we take volatility out, buy more reinsurance,
they're all happy with all that stuff.

FINAL

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

(00:22:44)?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, I guess if you – if we start to go backwards, right, if all the changes that we said we
were making didn't bear fruit then they wouldn't be happy, right? But you wouldn't be
happy and they wouldn't be happy. I don't think they're – they're not going to have
something different than you would have in terms of what would make them unhappy.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Yeah, hi. Thank you. Brian, you said when you arrived the organizational structure made no
sense, I believe is what you said earlier. Could you talk about why, what did you see, why
did it not make sense? And how have you changed it? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, it was you know – one of the things, I'll start with one state and then that is I always
say I left an international company with U.S. operations and I came back to a U.S. company
with international operations. So, it became much to U.S. centric, and therefore, the
international wasn't emphasized very much. We had countries divided between Life and
Retirement and Personal – Personal Lines, which was a general insurance book, was over
with the life, even though there's no sales compatibility – that's over there.
And so we had countries that we reported up to the Life and Retirement group and other
countries who reported up to General Insurance, but it was all General Insurance. Life and
Retirement is basically U.S. operation. So, I had – look at – the Personal Lines belongs over
here. International should stand on its own two feet. It's a unique thing. We had our large
account business. I'll give you another example, so that's one weird thing I found, a large
account business.
This is the business that the Fortune 500 companies basically do where they keep a lot of
the risk themselves. So, stuff goes and the captives, our retentions, it's done as a
package life, I mean, worker's comp, GL/Auto, all come together, there's a lot of credit
with it, you are – as an underwriter, there's a lot that's retained and your basic exposure's
excess, but it's broad and as a unit. I said okay, who's run – I want to talk to guy running it,
but we don't have nobody, we don't have anybody running that. Maybe I'm not speaking
English, I want to talk to the guy running the large account business. So – I cannot believe, I
don't even know how he did it. So, it would come in, the broker would bring it in, here is
the deal. And then we get parceled out like the workers' comp guy would do the workers'
comp and auto lady would do the auto, and then it would somehow magically come
together. It was not, I mean, I still can't explain it.

FINAL

I brought these guys that I've known for years that worked with me at – prior AIG and then
at ACE and they came back in and we constructed this thing, and it's going to be great.
They got a great track record. But sorting that out, I mean, the guy came in, it was like five
pages of – you can't believe this. We don't do this and we don't do that. If you don't have
a unit, you're not keeping up with your rates. It was – the whole thing was crazy. So, that's
just another example. I had to put a whole large account unit back together again.
Lexington; Lexington is a surplus lines company. For you guys that maybe you know the
stuff and maybe you don't, but this is where it's not admitted. So, the regular market says,
no to this book. This particular risk and then it shows up in the Lexington or other nonadmitted companies, and it's pretty quick stuff. You're going to make a quick decision,
because it's been hanging around. And the broker – the guy needs us now. This is almost
renewal, it's almost expiration date.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, we had it blended with guys that do normal regular standard business and it would go
through this review process and would go up the line and down the line. Well, so, okay,
we'll do it three days too late. If it's still around three days later, it's no good. So, we're
adversely selecting ourselves. So, you got to put a specialist group in and plus we are
upsetting the brokers because surplus lines brokers are very powerful these days, and
they don't like the admitted guys and vice versa. And so you better recognize who is
bringing you the business and don't stick your finger in their eye by saying well – because
they think we are trading against them. So, it's a little crazy. Nobody – how would you
organize that way because you don't understand the business? So, anyway, that's three
examples, I'll stop boring myself now.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

I think it's less boring. I like the way I wrote this, so I'm going to read this from here.

We talk about self-graded exams all the time. So superficial hypothesis. You have the right
people and underwriting processes in place by year end 2018. So, 2019 risk selection
should be as good as anyone else's, which means 2020 underwriting results should be as
good as anyone else's. Setting aside what you mentioned before about past year's
(00:28:35) other companies, do that make sense? Is that how we can expect things to
play out?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, it's a very interesting hypothesis. And how do I argue against that one, it's kind of
hard to. But you do mention a very important thing. So, this is accident year paid and put
up, right.

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Versus calendar year, which is a blend of stuff going in and stuff going out. So, yeah, I
would say there where would that not – where would we not match our peers, okay? And
it's a little bit like the statement about the reserve releases because I may still feel that
our loss picks from a pricing point of view should remain more conservative until we can
prove they are not. So, we may still put loss picks out for accident year 2019 that might be
above our peers, even though we believe we're matching them just because the track
record here is such that you don't want to rush that one too fast.

Bloomberg Transcript

So your argument's right, but I think in practical circumstances, I said, okay, you can
underwrite it, I said, okay, look at I know, Brian, that the results are not good. I know that,
but look at this. We've made all these changes. We don't do any of those dumb things
anymore. We don't write that bad stuff. I don't have those lousy accounts and you go,
okay, that's great. Then the year comes and it's like there's no change because they did
something new that was dumb. They didn't do the old dumb thing. They just did
something new that was dumb, right?
So now, we're putting really good people in and I trust them. But I'm telling you, it just –
you let it play out. You've got to let it play out. That portfolio has – if you are in a changing
portfolio structure, right, so you say we had – this is the portfolio of the past, here is the
portfolio of the current. Obviously, there are some changes in it, right? So the prediction
of it versus that gets a little more complicated because you've got rid of risks and you
raised rates and you did these other things, you raised limits. And so I'm just saying, yes,
you're right technically in practice maybe (00:31:05) will be a little bit more conservative
because we want to have that portfolio play out a little bit more before again we think it's
obviously right, but it will be better than the previous years. That's what I am saying, so
the loss ratio movements I am seeing are sufficient for me to believe that we'll continue
to show better underwriting results over time, so you will get to right to our peer levels
where we think we're matching them, give me a little time (00:31:23).

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Fair enough. And as always, there are questions. Please.
Yes, you started out talking about, you want to reduce volatility of the business, but best I
understand Validus is a pretty volatile company, so can you comment on how the
acquisition will reduce volatility of your business and results, how are you achieving that
goal?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

That's good. That's good.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

It's good opportunity to talk about the cat.

FINAL

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Good opportunity. Well, look, by the way, Validus, they had an underwriting profit last year
in the cat. So they reduced volatility. They were using the retro market. They're very good
at what they do. Look, I like businesses that have some extreme to them provided you
get paid for that, provided you get paid for the extreme. You guys don't like it because
it's volatile, but it builds book value over time. So if you have 1 bad year, 10 great years,
life is good, right? So Validus has proven, its track record is excellent in being able to play
in that game brilliantly, right, where they continue to do to look so. That's why I want them
in.
Now, we have other businesses where I was not convinced that we were getting paid for
the volatility, you go, like, if you have a large property, right, and you're saying, okay, well, I
do $100 million and maybe well I do $500 million, I do $1 billion. The $500 million, extra
$500 million, did you get price for that? Did you get value for that? I know you're getting
volatility as the pricing there. So at some point, maybe the risk/reward isn't there. And so
it's selective attack on the volatility where we don't think we're getting the price for it.
That cleared up?

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, I'm sort of. I mean, just for me, I don't think the highs of the non-cat years, the ROE
was high enough. I mean, I think Validus' highs were 15%, 16%, then we go to years that
you break even. Are the highs high enough for return over the cycle given what's going on
in reinsurance, but that's an opinion, I guess.

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean I thought they did a good job in terms of the returns over time. So we're
entitled to our own opinion, right.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

I want to jump in on that just really quickly before you go to your question and that is
another element that Validus brings to AIG is AlphaCat.

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Ability to assign different capital to parts of the volatility within AIG. Can you talk about that
a little?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, I think there is huge potential for the whole ILS market within our portfolio. And I
guess somebody else has made the same decision, right?

It seems like.

FINAL

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

So when you think of an underwriting, underwriting is – at its essence it's looking at this risk
and matching it with capital. And this gives us just another capital to use to match it and
we're risk originator. So you can kind of leap a little bit ahead into the future to say, there
should be ways where we can actually construct business which would be immediately
matched with the ILS market. So, that says the cost of capital – you're using it to your
advantage because you're saying as underwriters, I can find a cost of capital and match
risk with that, cost to capital, match with that; it gives you much more flexibly. So over
time, I think this can be quite a useful tool. It does reduce volatility. And I think Validus has
done a very, very good job of using their market presence, a piece of business comes in.
And for them, it benefits the ILS market than their own. Well, they may – so that's where it
will go. So I think it's a good tool and I think you're going to see more of it, not less.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

You mean at AIG or...

A - Brian Duperreault

AIG. And I think this other – I think it's indication of others who see the same thing.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. I'm sorry. I got in your way.
No problem. I am wondering how the valuation of your stock impacts at all your thinking in
terms of timing of M&A. You've been very clear with the Street that there are things that
you – or capabilities you're looking for for AIG. I'm just wondering given where the
valuation is today, how that can impact that timing.

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, it's a limiting factor. I'd like to have a currency I could use in addition to cash. So it's a
limiting factor. It doesn't completely shut me down, depending on what might be there,
but you have to recognize it as a limiting factor. We know we bought Validus with cash. I
mean there are certain things that we can do that will fill in the portfolio and don't have to
be massive because it's usually something large where I'm going to use the stock anyway,
right? So it's limiting, but it hasn't stopped us from pursuing acquisitions and we'll see
where it goes. I like this – you know the currency gets up, it gives me more degrees of
freedom. But it won't stop me from looking.

Q - Meyer Shields

Brian, how do you think about the investment portfolio today? And what is it that you're
really looking for to achieve and just what are some of your thoughts about it?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, I think you've seen and I didn't initiate this, we reduced the hedge fund components
of our investments. And remember, we've got two different animals to deal with here.
We've got the life and that's a spread business in many ways, and you got to think about
your investments along the lines of what you're taking in and what you're promising and
then you get the general insurance, which – investments is an important part of it, but it
doesn't turn on investments very much.
In other words, I'm not sure, I get credit for outsized earnings in investments in the
general insurance. Everything – the focus is all on combined ratios. And so I have to look at
how we do the general insurance a little differently than we do the life. And I'm still looking
through that because we do have a volatile investment, it's a good business, don't get
me wrong, builds value. So horses for courses, I guess, is the way to put it.
You do want to match your assets and liabilities. In gen, it's a little less important, relatively
short duration. So it's a little less important. And so you think about more about stability
and consistency and predictability on the general insurance side. Does that answer the
question?

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Yeah.
Okay. So we've talked a lot about internal issues. Obviously, one of the levers, one of the
aspects of the AIG story is the distribution and I would imagine you've got some goodwill
with one in particular. What role do broker relationships play as AIG continues on the path
of improvement?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, our book, particularly the commercial book is really driven by brokers. We do have
some smaller brokerage business, but predominantly it's larger – into the larger players,

FINAL

and I think having been on the other side, there are – you want to be a market by the way
– you want to be a market that they need you, not just you are there as the commodity
play, right? So you want to be in a position where they need to go to you that if there is an
RFP, two brokers competing against each other and bidding up markets, you want to be
one that they're fighting over.
So I got to have AIG because I don't want to be frozen out and not get AIG and have
them steal the march. So we're in that position which is interesting. We are a market
where the broker really feels they need to be part of us. It's a very interesting business
because it's still very, very personal, particularly large account business, very personal.
There are relationships. The brokers are obviously not working for me, they are working
for the client as they should, but they're also trying to get stuff done and working with
somebody that they trust that will not waste their time. There's a certainty to it. They're
effective. That's a big deal to a broker because a broker needs to get it done and they
just can't like hang their hat on you and then you disappoint them because you stretch it
out and then you say no, you said yes, then you say no, you waffle, so this relationship
thing, it's a three-way relationship – the client, the broker, us.
Peter Zaffino says, he just – he goes see clients now and he says they like me. When I was
working for them, they just treated me one way. Now I'm the carrier, they like me so much
more. So it's a very interesting three-way kind of relationship that occurs. We've got great
– again, I didn't know if I mentioned this, but the brokers were really surprising again when
we're talking about early days of really wanting to weigh in and they need a company that
can get it done. If you got a problem, they need a problem solver because anybody can
place all the other stuff. It's that problem that they got to solve because they got to solve
it, the client is expecting them to get whatever issue we fix. And AIG has been that
company for decades and they want that company back and they're doing everything
they can to help us.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Just want to see if there are questions in the room.
One aspect of fixing the casualty book, I know your predecessors worked a lot on
isolating the 5% of the casualty book that maybe was responsible for the bulk of the
reserve development. I wondered if that's the process that's ongoing or if it's something
that maybe is not that simple when you're talking about these large accounts that have
several product lines while one line might not be profitable, the other lines more than
make up for it?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Yeah, I think there's a little bit of that in that large account book that I mentioned in that
product where they have comp GL or auto. They tend to be driven by comp at the end of
the day. So how do I answer that? I think the casualty book, and that – it was just as much a
property by the way, picking the right guys. It wasn't just casualty. In fact, I think the
casualty guys might have been a little better than the property actually fixing the portfolio.
But I characterize it this way, okay. This is classic portfolio management. You guys portfolio
managers, you're always looking at adding and subtracting, things change, right?
Page 15 of 22

FINAL

Companies look good one year, they don't look good the next. That's a constant thing in
portfolio management. We have the same issue.
I have always believed that the most important thing in the portfolio was the risk itself and
less important was the price. You got a market-driven pricing process. You're not just
going to beat the market by 10 points. I mean the market gets to a certain price. So the
question is, are you putting the right business in the books, particularly where it's volatile.
So if you can select businesses that are above average, loss costs are lower, but they're
getting average rates, you win, right, and the other way around.
When I looked at what they were doing, I felt that they were spending too much time on
the price and not enough time on who they were pricing. And so, that 5% may look good.
It could have actually been completely opposite. It had a high price because it deserved
an even higher price. And another one could have had a low price, but it was actually
priced by the market because it was a good risk and it was sought after. So if you don't
put those two together, you can make a lot of mistakes. And I felt we were getting
adversely selective.

Bloomberg Transcript

So portfolio management is portfolio management. It's just what's your philosophy around
how to construct it. And I have always felt the risk itself drives it first, first and foremost.
You shouldn't write bad business. I don't care what the price is. There is an adage, every
risk is writable, it's just a question of price. I don't believe that. I don't believe that at all.
There're businesses I don't want on the books. There's not a price in the world that to
justify putting them on the books. So we've changed the philosophy.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

It's an interesting development over the course of the year. I'll back up a little bit, we were
in Bermuda in May and it seemed like the one really hard line of business at the time was
run-off. So we look at AIG because we look at these and you say badaboom, you've got a
run-off insurer that now looks like it's going to be competing for business in – if we're right
about inflecting loss cost, this should be a really hard line for the next couple of years.
How are you thinking about that? What's the opportunity?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

That's interesting. I have to say I have never really sought, call it, legacy here, right, run off
as a market opportunity. To me, it was probably the dregs of the past, all isolated. It's
hard to say, oh, that looks good, you know.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

(00:46:50)

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Why is it they're in the first place. So, no, my thought process wasn't around, let's get into
the legacy business. But we got – we had legacy and we wanted to create a legacy
company in Bermuda where we would get really good capital advantages because it's
Page 16 of 22

composite company. And it gave us optionality. But I didn't put it up to actually get in the
business. What happened was as soon as we announced it, we had all these unsolicited
offers to acquire parts of it, right, or all of it and we decided to get together with Carlyle
(00:47:36) because I think we have similar philosophies about the business. So we need
to stand it up if it's going to actually be in operation and taking new business, it's going to
have to be stood up. So it's going to have to have its own processes. They should be
separated from the processes of the life and the gen. So we're working on that. So, that's
going to take us some time. You saw the announcement.
Once that occurs, let's look at the market then. Is it still a good market? I don't know. If it
is, I guess I'd have to consider it as another leg to a stool. If it has – look, I can tell you one
thing it's like debt and taxes, legacy is predictable. New business today is the next
generation's legacy because it just – this isn't as good as you thought it was. And so
there's always legacy being produced in our business, so I do think it has legs in that
regard. Do we want to get in that business? I don't know. But it gives us the option.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Want to spend a little bit of time talking about stuff that's working at AIG.

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Yeah, let's do that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Personal line, life and retirement. So how do those lines look? How those businesses look?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, I think the one thing that really focus on with life and retirement is the diversity of our
annuity capabilities. And so there are – if you pick different kinds of annuities, there may
be a company larger than us, but no one has the spread of capabilities, which then allows
us to be in the one market that actually is favorable and reduce activities in the one that's
losing favor where you're just not as comfortable with the pricing.
So, that I think is – and being very conservative and I – these guys are quite conservative. I
think it's a very nicely balanced portfolio. And we do have some life, we do have a little bit
of international life, but that portfolio of annuities I think is something that needs to be
focused on. And we've done a couple of meetings where we bring people in to explain it,
because I don't – all of the dialogue is about general insurance and probably should be
given that's where the turnaround needs to take place. But it's sort of unfair to them,
because they do a great job. So, it's nice to put them in the spotlight.

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

FINAL

True that. So, in the same general topic, in Europe, there are a lot of companies that – a
lot of insurance companies that are life and non-life. In the U.S., fewer essentially now that
Hartford is fully divested. What are the upsides and downsides of having life and non-life?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

I've been in Europe – a product of your education and training, and so it never really was
even a question when I joined AIG. We had life and we had non-life, we had international
and domestic. And I wouldn't say it was all love and roses, there were some fights
between the life and the gen in certain countries, but the benefits of it were very clear. In
capital management, diversification, investments, the capabilities that you would have as
having life can bleed over into gen, and gen into life. So, you get great capital
management. We actually get a great benefit from a tax point of view, too. But more
importantly is the capital management that you get in the diversification of earnings.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, you can do the life and do it badly, I don't think it's more complicated and I got to tell
you, I've got a guy, Kevin is just terrific as a leader of the Life and Retirement business. We
probably should call it retirement and life, because it's more retirement than life. And by
the way, the demographics of the world are definitely in our favor. If you think about your
strong suit is retirement, not just here, but all over the world. So, it's business – it's got
legs, it's got profitability, it's good balance, good return on its equity, why wouldn't you
want to part of the company. But I don't – I never even thought about it.

FINAL

Given that you have the two sides kind of working differently, some going well, some of
them more rehab and idiosyncratic to what it need to do. Kind of going back to question
around M&A, how do we think about the next priority for M&A in terms of the different
businesses? Do you want to spend more time fixing what needs to be fixed internally
versus doing really well, let it stand on its own two legs and continue or grow that more
inorganically?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, I think you have to think growth and there are times when you grow inorganically and
times when you can grow organically, and you have to – I think you got to be able to have
the ability in both, right? So, let's just start with that. We're fixing the gen. It is a work-inprogress. It's execution time. I wouldn't do an acquisition that got in the way of that. It
could be a great company, but if it creates kind of dislocations, we got to reorganize or
we got two of this and two of that, and we only need one and all that. I mean, that I would
not do that. So, that kind of limits what I would do. So, a large commercial, I probably
wouldn't do it right now, not until we have a solid base.
I don't like financial acquisitions anyway, so I don't want to acquire a company I've got to
fix. So, because that's just all it does is suck your resources away from either people doing
really well over there and you suck them away, and then they take their eye off the ball on
the stuff that was working. So, I hate financial acquisitions. I don't like acquisitions justified
on synergies, where you just got to fire a bunch of people to make it worth, it better be
more than that to the acquisition story. So, just continuing along these themes, if you look
at AIG, we're global, we're in a lot of places, we do a lot of things and yet there's very
large pockets of business and then it drops off. So, we are very big in Japan. We've got a
large UK operation. We do large commercial in the U.S. We've got a large life operation in
the U.S. We don't have life and retirement basically other than a little bit in the UK
anywhere else in the world, that's – and I said the demographics globally in our favor.
So, I would look if I could, but it's not easy to find. But if I could, I'd try to diversify the life
business and make it a little bit more international. Validus was a good example of
businesses that we didn't have and it didn't disrupt the commercial business we win and
we win in Lloyd's. We didn't have a reinsurance operation. We didn't have an ILS operation.
We didn't have a crop business. And so, I could add those to the general insurance
without having any disruption. They stayed as – they stayed in their own place doing their
thing. So, those are kind of my rules, if they're better, make you better. Any acquisition
better, make you better, and it either makes you better, because you're not doing what
they do or they've got better people or they've got better systems. So, they got
something better. You can't do – I don't do acquisitions where I got to make them better.

Yeah. Well, the Blackboard is in construction, right? So, we still got the in construction sign
on it, but what is the premise. So, the premise is that we can be better users of data and
the analytics around it without completely replacing the underwriter, okay. So, there is this
thing, the machine is going to do everything. Well, that's not the case, because our
business is idiosyncratic. Each risk is a little different. And so, you might think there's some
average price, but then you still got a triage. So, underwriters, they're information house,
they try to get us much information as they possibly can to make a good decision. So,
you're constantly trying to get insight, particularly in how good the company is, are they
good managers, are they worried about their own business and they worry about the risk
around their own business, then they'll be a better insurance.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, data is – there's so much data out there that we're not using a lot of the stuff that we
could use to make better decisions. And then the second thing is there are still decisions
to be made, right? So, you still need underwriters to make the call, but do they need to
make the call on 100% of the analysis. So, Blackwood says, no, they probably only need to
be in play about 10% of the stuff. So, can we make the underwriter 10x, can we make the
underwriter 10 times more efficient? By triaging, by taking all the stuff that comes in and
saying, okay, you don't have to worry about this, here's the price, you don't have to worry
about that, here's the price, just these would be all be fine. But here is the thing you need
to concentrate on. This is what makes this risk different than the others, spend time on it,
get it right and the rest of it, don't worry about it.
Whereas the underwriter today will spend time on a lot of things, because you have to,
that we could do better for them by giving them the answers and pointing them in the
right direction. So, that's Blackwood, and it involves – it's an interesting thing, because it
involves a different intake of data, it involves a different relationship with the producer,
and it involves a different organization structure within the company to do it right? So,
we're working on it, and I believe that it's going to be very successful. Seraina is an
extremely good executive. She really is good. And one of the concerns that I had with
Seraina, did she really want to do something this experimental, because she has been
used to running large organization, she has been in a number of companies and she is
very good at that. But she loves this because she loves the innovation side of it. And the
other thing is we've got a very good partner in Two Sigma, who's quite an investment
company that knows how to use data brilliantly to make good decisions. And I said, okay, I
want to take your genius and match it with our genius and can we come up with a real
interesting hybrid of an insurance company, that's where we're going. So far so good,
that's all I can tell you.

Okay. I'll take it. And before I throw my last question, I just want to see if there is anything
in the room. And I intentionally left it for last, because...

As a last question.

...it's not a bad question, it's just about pricing. But I don't want it to be seen as the priority.

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

So, what do you think of pricing?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, I think I talked a little bit about it before. So, we do look at loss trends and our ability
to get price against that, and I'd say we're confident right now that we're getting price
above trend just about everywhere, but not everywhere, but just about everywhere. And
so, that's good. But the second thing is the turnaround in our business is going to be at
least as much affected by improvements on our expense ratio as it is about the pricing.
So, I'm just not as dependent on the pricing for the turnaround, because we've got
further to go than the other guys.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Right.
