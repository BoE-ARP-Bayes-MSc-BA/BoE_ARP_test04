Bloomberg Transcript

[abrupt start] Good morning from Munich. This is Johanna Weber speaking. Welcome to
our telephone conference. As usual, the conference will be broadcast live from
munichre.com.de and will be available later on. And as an audio webcast, you will also get
the English simultaneous interpretation.
Jörg Schneider, CFO of the group, will now present the figures and the report on the
renewals, and afterwards, we're looking forward to these figures. Mr. Schneider?

Jörg Schneider
Thank you very much, Ms. Weber. Ladies and gentlemen, it was a good result for 2014.
€3.2 billion is a good annual profit, a high profit, and therefore, we can increase our
dividend significantly. The fourth quarter was influenced by countervailing one-off effects,
and amongst them a goodwill write-off in the one end to the negative direction and the
high tax credits that was positive – unusually high tax credits.
Our shareholders' equity in 2014 rose significantly by more than €4 billion to €30.3 billion.
This strong capital position is also under all the points of view that we can take. If we look
at the economic capital position, for example, we're very solid. When we look at the
rating, we're above AA rating level. And we also have to look for our local accounting
situation and especially the situation of the parent company of the group, the Münchener
Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft, which will be responsible for the large payouts. And if you
take all these points of view, the capital base under – capital position under all these
points of view is very solid.
Let me now come to the investment result on page 3 of our presentation. The regular
income decreased slightly than or has decreased slightly. This is a trend that will continue

because the reinvestment of any available funds will be taken at the lower average yield
than the ones in our portfolio. Therefore, the regular income at 3.2% or at €7.2 billion was
quite satisfying, but nevertheless lower than in the previous year. In addition to this, we
had significant income from this total gains and losses and from the derivative result,
which led to an overall investment result of €8 billion, which amounts to yield on our
investment of 3.6%.
Now, let me talk about the different segments, our fields of business, first of all ERGO on
page 4. You can see that the gross premiums written have remained pretty much
unchanged. The net result in the segment was halved, but only at the group level
because, at the group level, we have a higher write-off on goodwill impairment which
we've taken due to a new segmentation of the individual fields of business of ERGO. And
for technical reasons, we were then forced to test the goodwill and to enter into a new
allocation of goodwill, and that led to a burden on ERGO internationally of around €450
million.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the other hand, ERGO had high positive effects from a new evaluation of tax reserves
for the past. And after the policyholder participation, that led to a positive impact of €150
million net. And adjusted for both these factors, ERGO has achieved its annual target of
around €400 million with €450 million. They've reached the target comfortably. And on
the group level, the segment result of ERGO is at around €600 million. That was driven in
part by a slight decrease and the decrease in this case, of course, is positive of the
combined ratio both in Germany and on an international level.
On slide 4, there is also some additional information about our new business in primary
insurance and life insurance. And here, there is unfortunately an error that we're talking
here about the decrease, but that is a decrease that does exist in Germany where we
have difficult situation because of the low interest rate environment. But this is more than
set up by positive growth in other countries, especially in Poland. And therefore, the right
figures on slide 4 at the bottom right should read new business in life €2.3 billion.
And all the other points mentioned here are right and that the absolute figures fit. But
there should be – but instead of an increase, there should be a decrease and the other
way around. So, overall, we had a positive result growth of 17% overall, so not minus but
plus 17%. Sorry about this mistake, but nobody is perfect.
Now, Munich Health on the next page. Munich Health has reached its target, but had a
strong decrease of gross premiums written that was due to currency effects, due to a
reduced share of large-volume deals, and this is also due to the effect of the sale of
Windsor Health Group, our primary health insurer in the United States.
Now, talking about reinsurance, there were some mixed results. First of all, we had a slight
decrease of the gross premiums written for several reasons, currency effects amongst
them, because at the beginning of the year, the euro – beginning of the year 2014, the
euro had been quite strong before it collapsed towards the end of the year or went
down. The net result was fantastic again with €2.9 billion, and the combined ratio in P&C

FINAL

developed positively overall in the fourth quarter especially and was pretty much on the
level of the previous year.
Now, large losses. Large losses were lower than we had expected, only 7.2 percentage
points referring to the gross premiums earned instead of 12% which we had expected.
And that, of course, supports our results and it also led to the release of reserves for
earlier underwriting years to the tune of around 7%. And if you take into account that a
part of this effect is then reflected in higher commissions for the primary insurance
companies who brought the business to us, then the effect that we adjusted for this, the
effect is around 5.3% of net premiums earned. In life reinsurance, we have some burdens
from the Australian feasibility business.

Bloomberg Transcript

And that leads me to the renewal, the renewal of reinsurance contracts for the year 2015.
And we're talking about the January renewals, so the 1st of January. And this renewal
makes up – out of our property-casualty book, so including the business that we are
underwriting for specialized units and the specialized primary insurers which are being led
on the reinsurance. So, out of this, it makes up 57% of our property-casualty business.
That is a broad mixture around the globe basically taken – except for some Asian markets
where the 1st of April is the most important renewal date. And what's important, the
amount of net cat coverage is relatively low with only 11% of the premium volume.
Now, how has the volume developed? Well, we talked about a renewal volume of close to
€9.5 billion, out of which 13% were not renewed for several reasons, either because the
business was withdrawn by the customer from the market or because we didn't come up
with an agreement price-wise that was – the effect of that was €1.2 billion. We had a
renewal of 86% or 87% and that was a reduction of close to €500 million in new business
and we also had – of renewed business rather. And we had new business of around €900
million. And all that adds up to volume for 2015 of €8.5 billion. That is a decrease of
around €900 million or 9.5% of the business up for renewal.
Out of these 9.5%, the price movement is responsible for around 1.3%. So, to sum that
up, the result of that is – to sum up the result of the renewal round, and in view of the
difficult market situation and the strong competition we have there, the low interest rate
environment and the fact that new competitors coming to the market are being driven
into the market against the spectrum, we're quite satisfied with the renewal round
because we've shown once again that we're taking a consistent cycle management, that
we're at the side of our customers, but not at any price, and that overall we've had a price
change of minus 1.3%. That is something we'll live with.
And now, looking forward, we can expect that our strict cycle management, our strict
profit orientation will be kept because the quality of our portfolio is the most important
point for us and we're not just looking at larger volumes.
With this, I would like to hand back to Ms. Weber, and I'm looking forward to your
questions.

Okay then, we'll get started with the question round now.

Q&A

FINAL

Operator
We'll now take our first question. Sir, please go ahead. (12:04). Go ahead. Your line is
open.

Q - Johanna Weber

{BIO 16192902 <GO>}

Sorry. Good morning. I didn't hear my name. Good morning, everybody. Mr. Schneider,
could you maybe tell us about the different quarters? Can you compare it to the previous
years' quarters, to the €700 million? I wasn't quite sure about that, about the plus/minus
factors which have to be taken into account. Can you give us some further explanation
about that?

A - Jörg Schneider

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, if you compare to the previous years, a bit difficult, but the most important influential
factors, I can stress them for you. That was a result, like we would have expected for a
quarter, €2.8 billion times four. And that's where we stand right now roughly. However, as
you have said, there were some major influences there.
Well, starting with the fact that at ERGO, we had a quite pronounced goodwill impairment
amounting to €450 million. There's no tax effect here. So, that means this is now real
money here. This was not paid in cash. So then we had the positive tax effects amounting
to €900 million. This was the effect of a re-evaluation of the previous years. However,
what you have to subtract here is €350 million for the insurance holders of ERGO because
a substantial part of the $900 million amounted at ERGO. And in the operating results, this
is included for the insurance holders with RFP, so that the net effect is only about €550
million in the fourth quarter, yes, in the fourth quarter.

Q - Johanna Weber

{BIO 16192902 <GO>}

And in the previous year's quarter, did you also have a positive tax effect? I'm not quite
sure about that.

A - Jörg Schneider
Okay. First of all, let me take a look at the last quarter of 2014. Let me take an isolated
view at that and then it will be easier to understand. And then we have the life
reinsurance. We have the major influence of the disability insurance in Australia that
amounted to €100 million. And then in PC Re, we had also some reserves which
amounted to about €100 million – reserve releases of about €100 million. So, if you add all
of these effects, then you will receive more or less the result which we have been
showing at the end.

Well, thank you, (14:59)

Operator
And the next question is by Andreas Grüner (15:05)

Q - Johanna Weber

{BIO 16192902 <GO>}

Yes. I have three questions. Hello. Well, first of all, in the Analyst Call this morning, you said
that the earnings this year will be lower than in 2014. Maybe you can give us the central
reasons or main reasons for that. And also maybe give us some idea what the future will
hold. You said €3 billion will not be achievable. Should we assume it will be around €2
billion?
And then the second question about the share buyback. Well, the last share buyback
program runs until the AGM. Most analysts expect a new share buyback program. Maybe if
you could elaborate on that. Currently, you have a lot of money which you don't know
what to do with in this market.

Bloomberg Transcript

And last but not least, I have an additional question about ERGO. The write-offs, is that a
technical thing or is ERGO worth less than it used to be in the books at least?

A - Jörg Schneider
Well, Mr. Grüner (16:11) let's get started with the last part of your question. Well, ERGO is
suffering because of the lower interest rate environment like the whole insurance industry.
So, that means under more normal circumstances then, of course, their business would
be more profitable in the long run. However, something has changed in our reality.
However, this write-off is for technical reasons.
We had a common goodwill for the whole of ERGO in the past, which was allocated on
the parent company. That really has to do with the accounting details. And we now are
allocating the goodwill to the individual segments. And the smaller the unit you use to look
at a goodwill, of course, the more you're likely to have write-offs. Because, here at ERGO,
and it gets me back to the overall view about the sustainability of the value of ERGO, of
course, we have had a lot of reserves in the property-casualty business which is showing a
good performance. And then we have some burdens because of the low interest rate
environment in life insurance.
In Health, things are looking brighter again. And ERGO International, these were
purchases which were done shortly before the financial crisis back in 2008, 2009. And
here, we had some problems, especially in Turkey, also in Italy as well as in other markets.
And we have that – we're managing that quite well. And, of course, when you look at it
from today's point of view, the prices we paid at the time are seen differently.

FINAL

However, let's go back to the share buyback. We haven't decided that yet. However, we
have a very solid capital basis. And for many years, we have been able to show and we
have said that the share buyback, apart from a high dividend, is a normal means of doing
business. And you can draw your conclusions from that, but I cannot give you anything
substantial at this point.
And then your question about the profits for 2015. Well, the profits for 2014 was
influenced by very many different one-off effects which went in two directions. But
adjusted for all of that, we're slightly below €3 billion, depending on what you would take
into account – what you think you need to take into account in terms of adjustments.
Well, now, looking forward, we have a slight decrease for our investments, and that has to
do with the fact that every new investment means we are getting lower interest rates
compared to the amount of money we invested 10 years, 15 years ago. So, that means,
per year, we're losing about 0.2 percentage points in yield, and that's what we're losing.

Bloomberg Transcript

And now, since we have sinking interest rates, nevertheless – despite sinking interest
rates, we have earnings from shares which we have sold. What the effect will be in 2015? I
cannot say. But that will compensate for that, that we can actually earn money from
divestments.
And then, we have the – and then each percentage point in the combined ratio has an
effect of €120 million, each single point. And then, we have also a very strong balance
sheet. We have also made provisions for years in the past. And now, when you go through
the balance sheet, sometimes it leads to dissolving some reserves. The same might be
true for tax reserves.
So it's a huge potpourri of different aspects. And adjusted for each effect of the previous
year, we're seeing a slight decrease and that is partially but, however, not fully
compensated by positive effects because of divestments. And then, you mentioned the
figure €2 billion, which is definitely too low from my point of view. €2 billion is definitely too
low.
Thank you, Mr. Grüner (20:46).

Operator
And we have the next question by Mr. (20:51).

Q - Johanna Weber

{BIO 16192902 <GO>}

Good morning. The split-up of the ERGO segments, if you could tell us more about that?
Why you are splitting that up? Do you want to sell off some parts? And then, high dividend
despite – the earnings are not so great. Is that necessary in order to keep your
shareholders interested? Do you want to keep the share price high?

Page 6 of 18



Company N ame: M uenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG in M uenchen
Company Ticker: M UV2 GR Equity
Date: 2015-02-05

And then, something about the 1.3%, you also mentioned another figure, the risk
exposure where you said minus 8%. So does that have to do that you have taken more
risks for the same money or does that mean you have, well, fewer risks in the books?

FINAL

And then the last question, your investment results, €2.6 billion, it was €1.7 billion the year
before, and was in 2012 €600 million. So, you quadrupled that in the course of three
years. So it doesn't you will agree live up its substance?

A - Jörg Schneider
So, thank you, Mr. (22:06). Good morning. Well, first of all, about goodwill. Well, the
splitting up the goodwill into the individual parts of ERGO, we have done that because of
the new segmentation, and that again we have done because ERGO International has
become increasingly a sustainable card. We have waited for quite some time and we have
then adjusted it to our internal accounting because ERGO International did not have an
easy start, as I said earlier.

Bloomberg Transcript

Currently, or in the meantime, we're on a good path and ERGO International is actually
gaining weight within the ERGO group. And that's why we have said we're now going to
look at it as its own segment. In the past, the foreign life insurance was part of our life
ERGO and that property-casualty from abroad was also part of property-casualty. And
now, we have now a clear segmentation and we don't have any plans to sell anything off
here.
Well, increasing the dividend despite our overall earnings getting under pressure. Well, we
have looked at what we have earned during the course of the past year. And here, we are
paying out – based on our IFRS results, we're only paying out 41%. So, that is not
something you could call aggressive. And then, looking back at the business year 2010 for
example, let's take a look at the last four years, and then the dividend have increased by
about 5 percentage points per year, whereas our earnings have increased by about 7%
per year during the same timeframe of the past four years. So we're actually just trying to
keep up with that.
And then, as you know, we don't increase the dividend so that we cannot maintain it if the
markets were to develop in a negative fashion. We're actually quite confident that we will
be able to pay that out in the future as well. And we have a very sound capital basis. So
why should we keep more of our earnings, if the growth opportunities due to the bad
price level, organic growth is not really possible and also we don't have very many
opportunities in terms of M&A?
So there's a bundle of reasons why we're saying, well, let's have our shareholders
participate to a great extent and let's do what we have done in the previous years as well,
meaning we're paying out substantial dividend.
About the price changes, 1.3% minus and the risk exposure, what we're trying to do is a
very difficult task for ourselves. What we're trying to do is we're trying to measure how
much do we take on in terms of risks in order to then split up the decrease in volume in a
price element and in an exposure element. Because in some cases, the conditions of a
Page 7 of 18

FINAL

treaty change or the rules change for the (25:30). But we just want to give you some idea.
This is not absolutely correct down to the smallest detail. But we just wanted to explain
how much was the decrease in terms of price and in terms risk, and significantly less
decrease in risk.
And then you asked about the divestment results. Of course, they have increased. But
actually, our evaluation reserves have actually gone through the roof. Through the absurd
low interest rate environment, the market values of our fixed interest rates, capital
investments and everything you touched leads to great divestment results, which we
don't always like.
Sometimes, even if we just want to make some changes, we don't want to see these
results, but it is a side effect of the lower interest rate environment. And despite the
increase which you have mentioned, it is not part of our targeted policy. And it's not that
we live off of our results of the past because our (26:51) and that is something we can
show also in March when we look at our currency reserves.

Q - Johanna Weber

{BIO 16192902 <GO>}

And I have an additional question. The property-casualty rate in reinsurance of 92.7% here
because of the interest rate environment. What did you get in terms of divestments here?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jörg Schneider
Well, inflation plays an important role here, because when you look at the reserves time
and again and re-evaluate them, then inflation is an important input parameter. We're
looking at 6.9% of the earned net premiums, and then you have to subtract 1.6
percentage points for the commissions which we have to pay to the (27:47), the insurance
companies which brought this business to us. That is included here. So, net, we're talking
about 5.3% effect in net terms.
And in the previous year, I think it was slightly more – hang on a second. No, it was 5.2%
and the effect of the commission was 0.8%. So it amounted to 4.4% in the previous year.
So it was slightly more. And let me stress, at this point, we have still a very strong
confidence level. So, that means we're maintaining the conservative level and that has
stayed the same as in the previous years. So we're not taking things off the shelf here.

Q - Johanna Weber

{BIO 16192902 <GO>}

Thank you.

Operator
We'll take the next question by (28:47).

Q - Johanna Weber

{BIO 16192902 <GO>}

Good morning. First of all, I have a question of understanding the dividend raise.
Historically speaking, is that a record dividend of Munich Re? And then I would like to know
Page 8 of 18



Company N ame: M uenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG in M uenchen
Company Ticker: M UV2 GR Equity
Date: 2015-02-05

FINAL

how high is the surplus economic capital at the – or how high was it at the end of the year
2014 and then your profit outlook for 2015? I didn't fully understand that because you
were talking about the adjustments, the effect adjusted for everything. And if you take
this out, then the result should remain more or less unchanged at €3 billion if you adjust
for all this. I didn't fully understand that.
And then another point regarding profit pressure. It was mentioned in the nine-month
figures regarding the net CAD risks for 2015 that they might increase. So I haven't heard
anything about this from you, Mr. Schneider. Has that been reduced again, your risk
models? Or what does it look like?

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you very much, Mr. (30:03). It is indeed record dividends. And then the economic
surplus capital, we'll report this in March. But to give you a ballpark figure, we had 150% in
our capital base regarding the economic risk capital. That is the Munich Re figure, which is
about 75% higher than the solvency minimum. That's a little complicated.

Bloomberg Transcript

But to give you a ballpark figure, €10 billion, that was the surplus size and we're still at
approximately that level. So, quite a bit of leeway from an economic point of view, but it
gives us the opportunity to grow and it also explains why we can do what we do with the
dividend.
Now the profit for 2015 will decrease. Well, I can't promise that to you because, of course,
there can be positive one-off effects, but it is highly likely that we will see a profit
decrease. If you just look at the premium decrease in reinsurance plus the lower
reinvestment yields, those are major factors that you can't easily balance out and it would
be unrealistic to assume that we can fully replace that. So, the €3 billion I think we can only
reach due to one-off effects, but there will not be any kind of dramatic decrease.
Now, natural catastrophe risks for 2015, our exposure hasn't really changed. Over the
long-term, the number of natural catastrophes will grow due to climate change. That is
something we're seeing, which is good in a way for insurance and reinsurance companies
because it increases the volume that can be increased and then you have the high value
concentration in some areas, especially in the developing world. So we have a lot of
growth potential without even going into cyber risks, but it needs to be mobilized more
than in the past.
Thank you very much, Mr. (32:29).

Q - Johanna Weber

{BIO 16192902 <GO>}

I have one follow-up, if you permit.

A - Jörg Schneider
Please go ahead.

Q - Johanna Weber

{BIO 16192902 <GO>}

And that is the price decrease. So you mentioned minus 1.3% in the renewal round at the
beginning of the year and you said you could, well, live with that. So which kind of a price
decrease would be difficult for Munich Re, from which figure on?

FINAL

A - Jörg Schneider
Well, as the CFO, as the financial head of the group, I can only say that this is the absolute
maximum. I'm not being serious. But, nevertheless, we have capital costs and we have
some minimum earnings on the capital that we invest, that we want to see, and in many
areas, we're close to the limit. So there is not much leeway there.
And then we would have to decrease our volume again and also we need to create new
business. That's the most important point. That is what everyone is looking for in the
company, and we're mobilizing anything to generate business in areas that haven't been
insured at all or are underinsured that we improve our offer there so that we don't have
more of the same, but really enter into new business potentials.
Thank you very much, Mr. (33:56).

Our next question is by (34:02).

Q - Johanna Weber

{BIO 16192902 <GO>}

Good morning. My colleagues have basically asked all the questions I wanted to ask, so
there's nothing left here. All the best to you.

A - Jörg Schneider
Oh. Thank you. And you can get praise if you want to.

Q - Johanna Weber

{BIO 16192902 <GO>}

Thanks.

A - Jörg Schneider
Okay. Then we can ask the next question.

Operator
The next question is by Oliver Suess of Bloomberg.

Q - Oliver Suess

{BIO 6259296 <GO>}

Good morning. Two questions. Still without me having to go into giving you praise, but first
question about ERGO, can you say something about the new life insurance product? How
Page 10 of 18

they've developed over the course of the year and what amount they make up of the
overall new business?

FINAL

And the second question regarding derivatives for inflation hedging, they were quite
expensive over the course of the last year. Now, assuming that there won't be any major
change in the basic data, can we expect something of the same nature for next year?

A - Jörg Schneider
Yeah. Thank you very much, Mr. Suess. First of all, regarding ERGO, we have a share of
approximately two-thirds of the supported old-age provision with the new product offer.
And we're highly satisfied with this because we think it is a product that offers the
customers opportunities and also offers a better risk and opportunity profile for the
company. That is why we want to support these kinds of products and want to also
introduce them for occupational old-age provision.

Bloomberg Transcript

And the second point then, indeed inflation has been worth quite expensive and we'll
continue to do that because we have an economic control in our business. So we tried to
measure the inflation sensitivity of our reserve portfolio and, therefore – I mean, we
cannot fully use the derivative but to a certain degree just as real assets as a kind of
hedging tool. And if inflation is as low as it currently is, then the room for any downward
movement is quite restricted.
I mean, we've seen significant losses of value. But for the overall portfolio, that is well
balanced through positive income effects for our loss reserves which were not fully
recognized. That is to say, the economic control with the balance following accounting
rules that is quite a challenge to a certain degree.
Thank you very much, Mr. Suess.

Now our next question by (37:09).

adjusted value of the net result for 2014 so that we can see from which point on it will go
up and down or rather down, probably, regarding profit. And then the next question,
regarding the high amount of shareholders' equity went up significantly compared to the
previous year. So you could come up with a much larger share buyback or an even larger
dividend increase. So, if it continues that way, where do you see – how can you save
yourself from the large flood of money coming in?

A - Jörg Schneider
Well, first of all, about the adjusted result, I don't want to give any official version because
the question what needs to be adjusted and what doesn't, that is, well, a ballpark figure
of €3 billion, maybe a little less I'd say. So, that is at least something I could well justify.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then shareholder equity or strength in shareholders' equity, that's right, we are
strong, but we don't have a huge problem with this. I mean, we have a very solid capital
position, which is what our customers are expecting from us. We can pay out a dividend.
We increased our dividend in a managed way over time.
And in addition, we have this second option of share buybacks to have the shareholders
participate even more and to reduce our capital position. So you can rely on the fact that
we'll only do this to an extent that reflects the special quality strength of Munich Re and
that's our capital – our strong capital position. Therefore, we will always take a prudent
approach here and have a certain kind of balance.
So I can't give you any more precise statements at this point and we're also in a large
change regarding regulatory requirements. And we'll all have to learn to live with the new
instruments, with new tools. We've come far in our preparations, but the first official
round, we'll only have them on the 31 of December, 2015. And up to this point, I think we
will have to monitor all this, and in our case, increase the payouts.

Q - Johanna Weber

{BIO 16192902 <GO>}

Okay then, one follow-up question. Now looking at the business volume, if you want to
reduce this towards the end of the year because there's not enough profitable business
in P&C? And then, surplus capital, so the capital you don't really need and that you can't
use that much should grow even more so that you will have even more room to
maneuver?

A - Jörg Schneider
Well, regarding the renewal round, if you take an isolated view of that, that's right. But on
the other hand, we, for example, have a very weak euro currently. That is to say, that our

foreign currency risks have increased and we have the low interest rate environment,
which also increases our risk, and that more than compensates the result of the renewal
round.

Now, our next question is by Manuela Dollinger (41:47) of Münchner Merkur.

Q - Manuela Dollinger
Good morning, Mr. Schneider. There is one question that's remained for me regarding
ERGO. You mentioned that the life insurance business in Germany, which had decreased
but was more than balanced by foreign countries. Could you tell me which countries you
have with especially good business?

A - Jörg Schneider
Well, Ms. Dollinger, that was, first of all, Poland; and to a lower extent, Belgium; and
significantly lower also, Italy.

Q - Johanna Weber

{BIO 16192902 <GO>}

I have some follow-up questions, and it's good that my colleagues just asked the page 4
where you had the correction. I didn't fully understand it. It says new business in life €1.9
billion minus 17%. What does it have to say here, correctly?

A - Jörg Schneider
Well, okay, I'll read this out to you. We have the – we confused two columns. Sorry about
that. And €2.3 billion – new business in life should read €2.3 billion, and then in brackets,
plus 17% versus 2013. Then increased single premiums, plus 22.8%, so not declining, but
increasing single premiums, plus 22.8%. That's especially Poland where we have a lot of
single premium business. And then decrease of regular premiums minus 2.6%.

Q - Johanna Weber

{BIO 16192902 <GO>}

And could you tell me how much of that went to Germany? What about the business in
Germany?

A - Jörg Schneider
Well, I have that looked up. Let me see whether we can get the answer immediately. Let
me check this. So, 4.6% decrease. I don't have the absolute figure, so these are all
preliminary figures, but we can hand them over to you later on.

Q - Johanna Weber

{BIO 16192902 <GO>}

And two additional follow-ups. You mentioned the value for the new products in the
unsupported old-age provision business. If you take into account all the other business
occupational old-age provision and the one supported by the state, what's the amount of
the new policies compared to this?

A - Jörg Schneider
I don't have the figure with me, Mr. (44:31). It's significantly lower, of course, because now
there is a product and not company pensions, but we'll have this back to you as soon as
we get the figure.

Q - Johanna Weber

{BIO 16192902 <GO>}

Okay. My last question is the renewal in April. It's a large expense due to net cap business
and the new capital is especially present in this field. So do you expect the lower price
decrease in the 1.3% that we have?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jörg Schneider
Well, last year, the prices went down quite significantly in Japan and Korea, which is
important for the April renewal. So personally I wouldn't believe that we will see a
repetition of the decreases of last year. And the alternative capacities by the way are still
located above all in the United States because the risks there are have been highly
transparently modeled and I mean it has an effect on other markets but far enough with
the same intensity. So I don't believe the pressure will be that large, but that remains to
be seen in the end and it's too early now.

And the next question is by Jonathan Gould from Thomson Reuters.

Q - Jonathan Gould

{BIO 20134933 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. I have a follow-up question about the shareholders' equity and
also your payout ratio, which I have calculated, which amounts to about 42%, if I corrected
Page 14 of 18

it – if I calculated it correctly.

A - Jörg Schneider

FINAL

Yes, that's about right, Mr. Gould.

Q - Jonathan Gould

{BIO 20134933 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Well, the question is how do you see the market? Do you expect this to
be a temporary situation? You're paying out a lot of capital through dividends or share
buybacks. And when do you expect the market to change, where you would be paying
less to the shareholders so that means you could increase your business again, or do you
– or when – is that going to be a lasting change for the market, or are you saying, well,
maybe we need to adjust our business model just so it makes sense? I don't know
whether my question is very clear.

A - Jörg Schneider

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, I can hear what you're saying. Well, we don't hope for anything first of all. Well, to sit
and wait and hope is not our policy. We're trying to design things. We expect that we will
be able to work a lot of innovative solutions. We're hoping that we can increase the range
of the insured risks which then will provide a growth impetus for the whole insurance
industry.
The negative effect of the low interest rate environment, we don't speculate on anything
here. But our capital investments were in such a position that in every scenario, we're not
going to be the major winners. However, there's also no other scenario where we're
going to experience major troubles. So we have a very balanced mixture between real
capital investments and also fixed interest rate investments, and actually it proved its
worth just recently.
Well, about our capital needs. What we're doing right now is the money which we're
earning to a substantial amount we're paying that to our shareholders, when you look at
the dividend payments as well as the share buybacks. But we're not weakening our equity
and our equity is definitely significantly above what we need. So, taking into account the
current equity, including the effects of the payouts, that still leaves us with enough money
for potential growth. And we will not regret that any day. We're earning a lot of money
and we're paying that out to our shareholders. That's the simple formula right now.
And while the analysts, they keep saying time and again, they expect you that you should
increase this ratio and you could be doing that without endangering your business model.
Well, what we could be doing is we could pay out more in terms of dividend and then
decrease our share buyback program. And that is true to the fact that the Munich Re AG is
paying out. The Munich Re AG also has to have large provisions and can only pay out a
certain amount which we're making use of mostly.
So there is a certain limit here because of the fluctuation reserves and these fluctuation
reserves that also means stabilization for the future. That means when we are going
through a bad year or a year with very many natural catastrophes like back in 2011, then
Page 15 of 18

these nat cats are balanced out by the fluctuation reserves in our local accounting. But
that is the restrictions we have for the amount of money we pay out in terms of dividend.

Q - Johanna Weber

{BIO 16192902 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. I have a question about a huge player in the capital market. And isn't there
a huge bomb ticking right now which might blow up in a few years because of the low
interest rate environment policy? I mean, when we look at the figures and what also we
have heard what you said before, I mean, you have some – you can make some
adjustments through certain facts. I mean, you have a lower average interest rate and also
divestments you cannot do endlessly. So what are the scenarios for the years to come in
order to face these dangers, in order – actually, I have to imagine – I have to say, I like
imagination here.

A - Jörg Schneider
Well, Mr. (51:50), we share your worries. First of all, about (51:53). Well, since we have not
consistently turned around our capital investments, we have high valuation reserves. Even
if the interest rate stays where it is or continues to stay where it is, we still have a huge
buffer of reserves which will become smaller over the course of time, obviously. And then,
on the other hand, we have a strong operating business where we are active in markets
where our competitors are being confronted with the same phenomenon.
So, where no interest rate can be earned anymore on capital investments, it has to be the
technical result, and that means the prices will change, too. However, if we think it's huge
plan, the capital market or large investor, well, we are also in the same situation with the
people who have savings. They're all affected by the same phenomenon.
The old-age provisions are substantially jeopardized because the markets are being
flooded with liquidity and the interest rate is close to zero. It gives us a lot of reason to
worry. And for the insurance industry, let me just add. Also, when you look at the
governmental regulations, which we have to adhere to, additional elements have been
put into place which are giving the wrong impetus or incentives, mainly that the
investments and government funds are not being supported by risk capital.
Here, the insurance industry and also therefore the insurance holders, they're being
forced to buy government bonds, despite the huge risks. So there are major wrong
Page 16 of 18

Date: 2015-02-05

decisions and we try to stay away from that to a certain extent and we try to pursue our
own risk policy and internally within our internal model, government bonds do have risks in
our internal models.

FINAL

Q - Johanna Weber

{BIO 16192902 <GO>}

Let me go back to – let me just ask how much time do you have until there will be a
culmination?

A - Jörg Schneider
Well, that is hard to say. Well, today's problems are being solved by pushing it on towards
tomorrow. That gives us a lot of reason to worry. There is some hope that with the drug of
the low interest rates and the quantitative easing, it will lead to a stimulation of the
economy and then it can be carefully readjusted. However, we don't believe that the right
incentives are being given because that would call for structural reforms which would
allow again for economic growth. And we don't see that, at least not to the extent they
would be necessary.
