Presentation
Tony Jackson

{BIO 1729093 <GO>}

We might get underway. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to QBE's 2016
annual result briefing. My name is Tony Jackson; I'm head of investor relations at QBE. This
morning's briefing, the formal side of the presentation from Pat and John will run for
approximately 30 to 35 minutes, which should leave quite a lot of time, plenty of time for
questions and answers afterwards.
Before I hand over to the Group CEO John Neal, if I could just ask everyone to mute their
phones, please. And without any further ado, John.

John Neal

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

Thank you, Tony and morning, everyone. Pat Regan, our Group CFO and I are delighted to
present QBE's 2016 full year results this morning.
There's a fair amount to review with the result. And I wanted to use this slide to pull out a
few clear highlights. If we look at the slide left to right, our discount rate adjusted
combined operating ratio of 93.2% is the best underwriting result we've presented for six

FINAL

years. And for the first time in a long while, we're showing some modest growth in the
top line, 1% up for gross written premium and 2% up for net earned premium on a
constant currency basis.
Significantly, our North American operations achieved underlying growth for the first time
in many years and we continue to see growth from our franchise in the emerging
economies of the world. Growth in our European operations division was muted as we
maintained underwriting discipline in very difficult trading conditions. And of course, across
the Group we continue to pursue our strategic imperative to improve business retention
rates by at least 1% each and every year.
The middle bar graphs point to important components of the combined operating ratio.
Despite a deterioration in the Australia and New Zealand attritional claims ratio, notably in
the first half of 2016. And some FX impact in Europe, our claims ratio actually improved by
2.6% due to a very pleasing level of positive prior accident year claims development,
some of which actually reflects the early benefits from our strategic claims initiatives.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the right hand side of the slide we're pleased to be presenting an insurance profit
margin of 9.7%, which is at the top end of our target range and as a result of two factors,
being the improved combined operating ratio, as mentioned, coupled with a higher
investment return which benefited from foreign exchange gains.
We can report that in 2016 all key performance measures improved on the prior year.
Excluding the impact of discount rate movements, the combined operating ratio
improved to 93.2% from 94.3% in 2015. Our insurance profit margin improved to 9.7%
from 9.0% in 2015 and towards the upper end of our 8.5% to 10% target range and
pleasingly, the return on equity increased to 8.1%, up from 7.5% this time last year.
We've made really solid progress on our operational areas of activity. Pat and his team
have developed a comprehensive remediation plan in Australia and New Zealand where
the successful execution of this is evident in the 340bps improvement in the attritional
claims ratio in the second half of 2016.
So whilst insurance portfolio remediation takes time, a combination of price increases,
underwriting discipline and claims focus should see the attritional claims ratio return to
acceptable levels by the end of this year, being 2017.
The turnaround in performance in North America, initiated by Dave Duclos has continued
under Russ Johnston's leadership, with the division's underwriting profit more than
doubling in 2016. Despite underwriting losses in commercial auto, a second consecutive
strong crop performance and continued profitable growth in our specialty business
contributed to a very pleasing 2% improvement in the combine operating ratio.
We have completed two reinsurance transactions to sell roughly a quarter of our
outstanding claims liabilities in North America at book value. And this includes our
problematical program runoff reserves. This improves the quality of the balance sheet in

North America and removes substantial uncertainty from our reserve position in this
division.

FINAL

We met our 2016 cost savings targets of $150 million and planning is well underway to
deliver a further $150 million in savings by 2018. And whilst growth is challenging in today's
market conditions, we are making solid progress in each of the six strategic areas of focus
we discussed with the market at our investor update in May 2016.
The profit uplift we're reporting today, coupled with strong cash flow generation, has
allowed the Board to both increase the final dividend by 10% to AUD0.33 as well as
announce an on-market buyback of up to AUD1 billion over a three-year period.
So this slide provides the results of the Company by operating divisions. And in summary.
In a moment, Pat will provide a more detailed update on the progress we've made in
North America and in Australia and New Zealand. So I will keep my comments brief in
respect of these two divisions.

Bloomberg Transcript

North America, the 2% growth in top line largely came from the development of our
specialty businesses. And as I mentioned earlier, our underwriting profit nearly doubled
that of 2015, which of course is evidenced in the 2% improvement in the combined
operating ratio.
Our European business, under Richard Pryce's leadership, continues to present strong
underwriting profits and in the most challenging of marketplaces. So once again, a 90.2%
combined operating ratio is supported by a strong contribution of positive prior year
claims development and equally importantly. And on a constant FX basis, our attritional
claims ratio in Europe is flat at 45.4%.
Gross written premium is down by 3%, reflecting the tough pricing conditions. And you will
recall we completed a further reinsurance transaction in the first half of the year to
continue our move of selling claims reserves where we think it is beneficial to the
shareholder and the P&L to do so.
In Australia and New Zealand, gross written premium is up by 5% and whilst a combined
operating ratio of 92.4% is 1.3% worse than the prior year, we are pleased to present a
significant improvement in the second half attritional claims ratio, with a much improved
performance from our trade credit and surety business. And the New South Wales
compulsory third party portfolio following rate in increases in-year of around 18%.
David Fried and the emerging markets team provided growth of 10% on a constant
currency basis in 2016. And all this was achieved with a stable combined operating ratio.
The division retains a strong focus on profitable growth across specialty, commercial, SME
and personal lines via strategic partners and all this is supported by a single strategy
across the division to drive and improve productivity, efficiency with some cost reduction
initiatives.

FINAL

Whilst we have more work to do to improve performance, most notably in Latin America,
we're well positioned to benefit as the favorable long-term economic outlook for
emerging markets leads to additional trade and investment in infrastructure.
Equator RE plays a critical role in assisting all of our operating divisions to manage their
balance sheets and capital requirements through the provision of excess of loss
reinsurance and some proportional covers. 2016 was another successful year for Equator,
with an improved combined operating ratio of 78.9% and where positive prior accident
year claims development was a significant contributor to the result.
There are a number of important features in our 2016 result that for us point to our ability
to continue to provide predictable and improving returns into 2017 and beyond. We are
presenting a fifth consecutive period of positive prior year accident year claims
development and we believe this pattern can continue into 2017. This result has been
achieved while simultaneously strengthening our balance sheet. And in a period where
we've seen our probability of adequacy increase by 0.5% to 89.5%.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are maintaining or improving our underwriting performance in each division, even in
the most challenging of market conditions. And most notably in North America where the
division continues its trajectory to a mid-90%s combined operating ratio by 2018.
Equally importantly, we continue to position all components of our balance sheet
conservatively and this includes the manner in which we elect to buy reinsurance. And
notably, to protect ourselves against the frequency of large individual risk and catastrophe
claims. We have consciously sought to eliminate unpredictability for this category of claim.
And the evidence of this action can be seen notably where the gross cost of large
individual risk and catastrophe claims actually increased appreciably in 2016 but the net
cost is essentially unchanged from 2015.
Similar protections are already in place, not only for 2017 but also for 2018 and will ensure
that the cost of such claims is locked in at around 9.5% of net earned premium.
We are encouraged by our expense and cost reduction initiatives in 2016 and can confirm
that plans and activities are already in place to generate a further $150 million reduction in
costs across 2017 and 2018 as previously communicated to the market.
Now I'd like to hand over to Pat to discuss our results in further detail and in particular, to
add some progress and some color to the story in Australia and New Zealand and North
America. Pat.

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Thanks' John. Good morning everybody. As John said, in addition to my usual run through
the Group results, I'm going to give you a little bit more detail in what we've been up to in
Australia.

FINAL

Starting with the Group results first of all, the Group reported a net profit after tax of $844
million for the year, up some 5% versus our adjusted net profit after tax for 2015. On a
constant currency basis, that was a 16% increase versus 2015. That improvement was due
to higher investment income and improved underwriting result offset by a discount rate
movement and a lower tax rate in 2016 as well.
Cash profit after tax was $898 million which was up some 12% on a constant currency
basis. GWP on a constant currency basis was up 1%. Emerging markets grew by 10%,
largely driven by Brazil and Argentina. Australia and New Zealand grew by some 5%
through a combination of both starting writing South Australian CTP and by our rate
increases in the second half of the year. And that offset the small decline in our European
operations as we focused very much on margin versus volumes there.

Bloomberg Transcript

Excluding discount rate impacts, the combined was 93.2% and interestingly, we said to
you a few times before that we expect the second half combined to be lower than our
first half combined. In fact we'd expect that again in 2017 and our second half combined
for 2016 was 92.5%, reflecting another half year of positive prior year development, a
good crop result and a decently improved attritional claims ratio in Australia. Also worth
noting in the second half we increased the POA from 89% at the half year to 89.5% at the
full year.
The significantly adverse discount rate movements for the half year largely but not
completely reversed in the second half and we recorded an $80 million pre-tax negative
impact for the full year. Notwithstanding some pretty volatile investment markets in 2016,
our investment return overall came out at 2.4%. And all of that meant our insurance
margin, even after the adverse discount rate movement, came in at 9.7% towards the
upper end of our 8.5% to 10% range.
The volatility of FX rates particularly around the Brexit vote combined with our usual
hedging programs gave us a larger than usual FX gain in the second half and finally, our
full year tax rate at 21% was lower than 2015, primarily now because we're generating
profits in the US, we're using tax losses there.
I'm now going to give you a little bit more detail on what we've been up to in Australia
and New Zealand and where I spent most of my time since we got together at the half
year. What we've been doing is designing and implementing a remediation plan. Overall,
I've been really pleased with the progress we've made so far.
To give you a little bit of color about how we've gone about that, we've subdivided the
business into just under 50 sub-business units, or as we call them, cells. To give you an
example of that -- direct motor would be a cell, direct household would be a cell, travel
would be a cell, commercial packages would be a cell, et cetera. Each of the cells has a
clear business owner and each of the cells now has a customized remediation plan.
In the early days, we spent all of our time really making sure we understand any root
causes or deterioration in performance on a cell by cell basis and then making sure we
constructed the right plan to make it better again. As you'd expect, the actions do vary on
Page 5 of 21

FINAL

a cell by cell basis. But to give you a sense of the main actions we've put in place,
obviously premium rate increase. I'll come back to that in a minute. Revised and tightened
underwriting selection -- so for example the type of property risks we're writing or the
type of trade credit business we're underwriting.
Tight in delegated authorities for our teams, our underwriters in the field. Change in
terms and conditions -- so that might be deductible levels. Particularly tighter practices
and governance around our claims processes. So that could be better use of our
approved suppliers, enhanced recovery processes or better fraud prevention techniques.
Then we've monitored all of those actions on an actual versus expected basis each month
for each of our 44 cells.
I'm pleased to say after all of that, that we actually did see some improvements in the
second half of 2016 when the claims ratio improved -- or attritional claims ratio improved
from 62% in the first half to 58.6% for the second half standalone and that improvement
as you would expect was particularly evident in the Fourth Quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

By picking out a couple of the cells, New South Wales CTP -- over the last 12 months of so,
we've increased rates by some 18% and that flowed through to an improved attritional
ratio in the second half.
On trade credit, we really focused on different risk selection and underwriting practices.
So the type of business, the industry types that we were providing trade credit to and that
really paid dividends with a much improved attritional claims ratio in the second half. As
well as CTP and trade credit, we also made good progress in things like commercial
packages, public liability, household and travel.
On the premium rate increases as you can see on this slide, we ended 2015 down some
2% or 3%, started this year with a negative and I'm pleased to say we that to 4.5%
increases in the Fourth Quarter.
In January we managed a 5.5% increase for the month of January. Despite this, we were
pleased to see the retention held pretty stable, above 80% for most of the year and
even in the Fourth Quarter still roughly at an 80% -- at a policy level. We also saw
continued positive prior year development with $64 million of positive prior year
development in the second half and given our long track record of positive claims
developments in ANZO, I'm confident that we're reserving our current accident year picks
[ph] conservatively.
Overall, while we've put together a good set of plans and our remediation activities to
date are encouraging, there remains quite a bit of work still to do. We need to continue to
improve the ANZO results into 2017. But I'm confident that we'll do so.
I just wanted to talk for a couple of minutes on LMI. Broadly what I'm going to say is that
the trends we're seeing are much in line with what we discussed with you at investor day.
So on the top line as you recall, we expected a decline in premium primarily due to tighter

Page 6 of 21

Date: 2017-02-26

FINAL

lending conditions and we've seen a 22% drop in GWP but just a 5% drop in NEP, partly
due to the long earning patterns in LMI, partly due to reinsurance savings.
On our claims -- worth remembering that 85% of the portfolio is owner occupied, just
under 15% is investors, just 3% is low doc [ph] loans and just 1% of the portfolio is in
mining areas. That said, broadly as we expected, we did see an uptick in the trip arrears
levels as we went through the year, primarily in Western Australia. But overall, claims levels
were actually flat in 2016 versus 2015.
Notwithstanding that, we did take the opportunity to book our loss ratio and combined
ratio a bit more cautiously at the end of 2016, more into line with our long term average
there and we've actually assumed a further slight increase in the claims ratio in our plan
for 2017.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to North America. And the team there delivered a further improvement in 2016,
doubling the underwriting profit from 2015. That was despite significantly higher both CAT
[ph] and large risk loss but also a problematic commercial auto book. Profitability
improved on the back of a lower expense ratio a market leading crop result and strong
growth in our specialty franchise.
The crop business had another excellent year and while it was a good year for the crop
industry overall, the benefits from our data analytics driven farm by farm selection was
evident in the standout loss ratio and the market leading combined ratio. Expenses North
America down $127 million from 2015 due to both the continued expense reduction efforts
there and the sale of the expense heavy mortgage and lender services business. That
gave an expense ratio decrease of some 190 basis points. As John mentioned, we would
expect further expense savings in both dollars and expense ratio into 2017 in North
America.
Perhaps most importantly they also did two significant pieces of risk reduction or portfolio
change. Firstly, we terminated a number of loss making commercial auto programs,
including one major standalone program, all of which together lost us about $100 million in
North America in 2016. By the way, the outstanding claims reserves for those commercial
auto programs to tidy things up, we reinsured those into Equita.
Secondly we also successfully reinsured all of that old program runoff book to a third party
at book value, thereby eliminating the risk of any adverse development and what's a
potentially volatile set of liabilities there. Those two transactions gave a onetime reduction
in NEP in North America of about $600 million.
On investment performance -- and it was certainly an interesting year to be managing
investments, with the geopolitical events, Brexit, US election, yield moves, FX rates. We
took the decision early in the year to stay defensively positioned and our growth assets
stayed less -- decently less than 10% for most of the year and we decided only to extend
our duration as and when yields increased. In this context, our annualized investment
return of 2.4% was a sound outcome.

Page 7 of 21



Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity

FINAL

Our blended asset -- blended growth asset return was just under 5% for the year and we
did increase our growth assets to 10% at year end and a little more than that since year
end. Similarly, when yields increased, we did extend duration up to 1.5 years at year end
and again, we've extended that a bit further since year end. We think that what this means
now is we can reasonably comfortable generate investment income for 2017 in excess of
2.75%.
Notwithstanding those volatile markets and economics, we enhanced our already strong
capital position in 2016. We now have capital equivalent to more than 1.3 times the capital
needed for an S&P A rating and our PCA multiple at 1.79 times is right at the top of our 1.6
to 1.8 range.
The other key metric for a global business like us is the cash remittances you get from the
business units to the center and that was up some 55% to $1.1 billion. Obviously that's an
important measure of coverage of our external dividend and we had cash coverage there
of just under two times.
All of this gave the Board confidence to both increase our final dividend by 10% to
AUD0.33 per share, representing an 8% increase in our full year dividend and to establish
a three year on market share buyback facility of up to AUD1 billion. Back to John.

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

Thanks Pat. So turning to our outlook, QBE's built on the strength of our underwriting
performance. And this will always remain our overarching focus. And we are far from
complacent. We've more work to do execute on the remediation plans in Australia and
New Zealand, as Pat's discussed, we have more work to do to continue the improvement
in our North American property and casualty lines. We need to be robust in the actions we
take in developing our emerging markets business, particularly in Latin America.
So whilst the competitive environment did not support significant growth in 2016, our
cross cycle of gross written premium target remains unchanged at 3%. In renegotiating
our reinsurance treaties for 2017, savings of more than $350 million were achieved. Those
savings are split roughly equally between the excess of loss reinsurance contracts and the
proportional treaties. But let's be very clear that in so doing we have not added more risk
to the portfolio.
So our 2016 expense savings target of $150 million was met. And as I mentioned earlier,
our planning is well advanced to deliver a further $150 million of expense savings by the
end of 2018. Some of these further savings will be reinvested in technology. So this should
result in a further 1% reduction in our expense ratio by 2018. We anticipate that half of our
2018 target of $200 million in claims savings will be achieved by the end of this year in
2017.
Initiatives to combat claims fraud, being smarter in the way in which we achieve claims
recoveries and in our optimization of the claims supply chain are all giving encouraging
early results. At the same time we're looking at our IT strategy and technology to ensure
Page 8 of 21



Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2017-02-26

that the Company is set for the long term. And after establishing our data and analytics
capability as a global function in 2016 -- including the development of our offshore
support in India, our focus I'm 2017 will be directed towards projects that support portfolio
remediation, claims initiatives and customer analysis.

FINAL

For the first time in 2017 we will be investing a minimum of $50 million in partnering with
insurtech companies. But those that have a particular focus in the data and analytics field.
The Group shared service centers in the Philippines continue to give us significant
flexibility in the way in which we manage and balance onshore and offshore operational
support in a cost effective and efficient manner.
Our dividend policy is designed to ensure that we reward shareholders relative to cash
profit as well as maintain efficient capital for further investment and growth in our
business. Our 2016 performance has supported a further increase in all of our key capital
metrics. In recognizing both the quality of our balance sheet. And importantly the
confidence of our forward plans, the Board has not only looked to increase dividend
payments. But also to establish a three year cumulative AUD1 billion on market share
buyback facility.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we anticipate that the market backdrop will remain challenging in 2017, although there
are indications of some modest improvement, particularly where the rate of decline in
global insurance premium pricing is easing. There will always be variations market by
market. And whilst we believe price increases in Australia will be maintained, elsewhere
we expect pricing to be broadly flat.
In light of this competitive backdrop and some exchange rate volatility, we're anticipating
gross written premium will similarly be broadly flat in 2017. Albeit the reinsurance savings
achieved should support a modest uptick in net earned premium.
So whilst our base case combined operating ratio expectation for 2017 allows for only a
modest level of prior accident year claims development, a higher level of positive
development could contribute towards a combined operating ratio at the better end of
our target range.
Some of you may have seen our UK and global peers make reference to Ogden table
changes in the UK in their results in the past fortnight. The timing is unfortunate but we
expect the UK Ministry of Justice will announce a downward revision in discount rates for
UK personal injury claims tonight our time in Sydney. Sadly any change has zero benefit for
claimants. But necessarily will require an increase in claims reserves and therefore a hike in
price to the detriment of the UK customer.
While we've allowed for a 1% reduction in the discount rate -- or roughly a $33 million
impact in our risk margins as at December 31, 2016, should the UK Ministry of Justice
announce a bigger reduction in the discount rate then the impact on QBE will obviously be
greater. If you have a look on page 24 of the Annual Report, we've provided sensitivities
for potential outcomes. Depending on where the discount rate lands, we would be
Page 9 of 21

Date: 2017-02-26

FINAL

inclined to take the whole impact through the P&L at the 2017 half year result and maintain
our probability of adequacy at 89.5%. Please note that the P&L impact related to this
regulatory issue is not currently allowed for in our 2017 target combined operating ratio
range.
So looking at the investment markets, we're targeting an investment yield of between
2.5% and 3% for 2017. So please bear in mind the numbers on the slide are of the
investment yield, not the contribution to margin. So if you multiple that number by 1.35,
roughly you get the contribution to the margin. But based on our early year performance
we are actually hopeful of getting closer to the upper end of this range.
So this slide actually repeats the investor thesis we presented in May last year. And
remains as valid today as it was then. Our targets out to 2018, including an ability to
exceed a return on equity of 10%, are unchanged. Through the second half of 2014 into
2015. And now in 2016, we have executed effectively to our targets and plans. And are
confident in our ability to meet the performance targets we've set out in the market
today for 2017. And importantly our ability to continue to improve our business through the
medium term.

Bloomberg Transcript

2016 represents our best underwriting performance in a long time. And our balance sheet
stands comparison to any of our global peers. We continue to buy reinsurance protections
with the downside risk of running an insurance company in mind. Our claims provisions
have shown consistent improvement for five consecutive reporting periods. The Board's
confidence in our plans is reflected in both a healthy increase in dividend payments and
the announcement of an on market share buyback facility.
So thank you very much. And now Pat and I will be very happy to take questions.

Questions And Answers
Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

Hi John and Pat. It's Nigel Pittaway here from Citi. First question, just in the pack in terms
of guidance, you have sort of reiterated the 93% combined target for FY2018. Previously
though you said that was pre-reserve releases, whereas this time there's no mention of
prior year releases. So can you just clarify what you're exactly saying in respect of that?

A - John Neal

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

Yes, I think as I said in my closing remarks, it includes an anticipation of a modest level of
prior accident release in 2017 and 2018.

Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Okay, next question on crop. Although the result was obviously very
good, one noticeable thing was that the premium split was 57% first half, 43% second
half, which is quite a reversal from what it's been in prior years. Can you sort of explain

Page 10 of 21



Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2017-02-26

whether or not that's an ongoing feature, or is it particular due to factors that existed this
year?

FINAL

A - John Neal

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

Good spot, Nigel. It was an unusual feature for this year because the combined was very
good, you actually end up ceding part of the premium back to the government. That
happens right at the top end of the range and right at the bottom. So it meant that,
actually slightly unexpectedly, we ceded premium -- net earned premium to the US
federal government. And that reduced earned premium in the second half. But you
wouldn't expect that to happen each year.

Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

Okay. Then maybe just one on LMI. I think obviously you had a figure combined of 34.9%
for the full year, that was already sort of high 20%s in the first half. So it obviously
deteriorated quite a bit in the second half. If you do look at the sort of claims ratio picture
you had on the strategy day it does suggest that the claims ratios run a bit higher than
that. So is all that are you saying conservative booking, or have you really seen a
deterioration in those trends where WA was in fact worse --

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Neal

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

Yes, I mean it's an increasing question. We have seen higher arrears in WA. But not really a
lot more than we were expecting -- a little bit more. Whether you look at house prices,
whether you look at unemployment rates, whether you look at the individual arrears in
individually affected areas, none of it is kind of wildly different from what we expected. So
we just booked it a little bit more conservatively at the year end.

Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Q - Daniel Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Thanks, Daniel Toohey from Morgan Stanley, just a few questions. The first one is just a
follow-up from Nigel's. I think in FY2016 you talked about modest reserve releases at a
magnitude of around 1% to 2%. Clearly you've come in well above that. We don't have the
hang-over from the US commercial auto in the outlook. So does modest imply 1% to 2%,
or is it?

A - John Neal

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

Modest implies less than 1%.

Q - Daniel Toohey

Less than 1%, thank you. Second question just on the New South Wales CTP, you've had
obviously some pricing benefit come through helping on the attritional line. Can you
comment whether you would expect to be a beneficiary under the proposed Risk
Equalization Scheme reform, or a payer?

I think we'll be broadly neutral. So I think we were following the spirit of what was intended
out of the way CTP pricing work. So I don't expect it to be greatly altering how we do
things either way.

Q - Daniel Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Just finally, on the cash remittances to Group, how much of that is coming through from
the LMI business?

A - John Neal

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

So I think we mentioned before, I think we mentioned it at investor day, that we're still a
little bit lumpy with it; we'd like to be a little bit more even. So we're still slightly over
reliant on Australia and Equator. And within the two of those you captured the LMI
element of it. North America is coming back on stream now. And we're still a little bit
underrepresented in Europe. So we'd have benefited by a couple of hundred from LMI in
2016. Equally as I say, we're kind of underweight in what we would consider our normal
dividend from Europe at this stage.

Q - Daniel Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

All right. Thank you.

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

Kieren Chidgey UBS. Just a question on the impact of the reinsurance savings coming
through this year, you've called out $350 million-plus. I think you said half is in the excess
of loss. So if we called that $175 million. I also note on slide 33, your retention is up around
$100 million on the aggregate next year. So should we view the net benefit that drop
through to the P&L as about $75 million around that excess. Is that the way to think about
it?

A - John Neal

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

I mean sadly it's a big more complicated than that. You're right. So half's excess a loss. So
the actual P&L benefit that will come through from that, we would estimate at about $20
million to $25 million. The balance is really through a restructuring of the crop quota share
contracts predominately. So that's the second part of the saving.
When you get to the slide that's on -- the final slide in the deck slide 33, yes you're seeing
some increase in the risk retention and some increase in the first retention for CAT
significantly reduced the second. But all of that is captured in the aggregate. So any
increase in retentions falls to that aggregate treaty at the back end. So if you follow the
math’s through of increased retention and capturing the aggregate the net position for us
is broadly unchanged at around 9.5% of net owned premium for large risk and CAT claims.
So a little bit of P&L benefit, $20 million to $25 million. But actually the restructure gives us
net/net no increase in exposure.

Q - Daniel Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Maybe just tying that back to the investor day I've thought you were talking a number in
the order of $50 million to $100 million P&L benefit.

FINAL

A - John Neal

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

Yes I think the second component really depends on crop. If the crop business continues
to perform as we would expect it to in 2017 then yes you'd see a further benefit come
through from that crop quota share. So in effect we've retained $200 million more of net
earned premium in crop in 2017. So if that performs in line with expectations that's the
balance of the number you're looking for.

Q - Daniel Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Are you still seeing 92% as the target combined ratio for crop or has that come down?

A - John Neal

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

It's the number we've reflected in our plans. We think it's a little too early to assume that it
could be better. But the indications of the use of data analytics and the selection criteria
that Pat spoke about gently tends us to assume that it's a better business than that.

Q - Daniel Toohey

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks.

Q - James Coghill

{BIO 14006200 <GO>}

James Coghill, UBS. Just a couple of questions on the underlying trends in the business
for the attritional loss ratio. So the first one is on Europe. You have called out that there
was a 90 basis point drag from the mismatch between the earned premium coming
through and any claims costs from the Sterling's devaluation. So I guess there are two
parts to this questions. Perhaps you can just explain why that mismatch is there and why
underlying claims don't also change.
Secondly just comment on the trajectory for that drag into next year. Is there still
something we have to think about for the first half ? Because I think it is.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes there will be a little bit more of that come through into the first half of 2017 but less
than we saw in the back half of 2016. It's to do with the rate that the unearned premium
earns through versus the claims earns through. Again it's a feature of the Lloyd's business
where you're writing so many different types of business in different currencies. Without
making it sound more complicated than that -- that's basically the explanation. So there is
as you would imagine a little bit more flow through of that into the first half of 2017 but to
a lesser extent.

FINAL

Okay the second one just turning closer to home Pat. And probably one of the most
remarkable and speedy turnarounds in the insurance business that I've ever witnessed
given that you didn't even know that it had blown up in May last year. But perhaps more
seriously could you just take us through your thinking around how much of that attritional
loss ratio reduction in the first half you think will ultimately reverse into financial 2017?
I'm referring to the 6.6% reduction in the first half. I think you mentioned a 1% drag so that
was -- call it 8% of which 340 [ph] -- 3.4% that's turned in the second half. How should we
be thinking about that turn into financial 2017?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes, good question James. I don't think I'd want you to draw a straight line from picking a
point in the first half, picking a point in the second half and through. You remember we
defined attritional as $2.5 million. So a little bit more in Aussie dollars. You get -- some of it
will depend on the amount of claims you get of that, just under that kind of size.

Bloomberg Transcript

But if your question is, are we made some sustainable changes then it feels like it yes.
Then obviously rates a big indicator of that. We'll get more of that earning through in 2017.
We've only picked up really the early parts of that in 2016 whether it be CTP, commercial
motor, trade credit.
The British election is definitely a factor in it. I mean that's -- obviously in something like
Trade Credit that's been a big -- we saw a big improvement in the attritional in the
second half there. Claims is the other big one where -- that just to your average claims
payment does tend to jump around a little bit more albeit we've seen lower levels clearly
in the second half of 2016 than we saw in the first half of 2016.
So John said we'd expect to see more improvement in 2017 partly because we're just
earning through the rates increases. We're still carrying a little bit more rate in the early
part of 2017 than we did in the latter part of 2016.

A - John Neal

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

Without wanting to make it more complicated. And you've heard me say this before -- an
actual year lives for two years so at the half year you're a quarter of the way through the
life of the year. So I think when we spoke here in August we felt very confident in our
ability to be able to recapture that attritional claims ratio movement. I think the team have
done a nice job in promoting change in price, change in deductibles. Some portfolios you
can fix quite quickly, which is what's happened with Trade Credit maturity.
The rates increases that Pat and the team have put through on the balance of the
portfolio, we need to see how that performs through this year. But it encourages us.
The other factor I'd say is that -- don't underestimate the value of those re-insurance
treaties. So in November we get a very difficult earthquake in New Zealand. The net
impact on our P&L is nil. This is the way in which we've elected to buy our insurances. So

Page 14 of 21

that helps as well when you're looking through the performance in Australia and New
Zealand.

Q - Toby Langley

{BIO 15924432 <GO>}

Hi, it's Toby Langley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. On your capital position you're
knocking on the top end of your range. You've taken a lot of actions to restructure the
business, de-risk, sold stuff, et cetera, et cetera. How do you feel about the interplay and
where that capital position is now sitting in your PCA target range?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

I mean we've talked about before a lot of the things that we've done worked better on
the more risk adjusted measures whether that be our own internal capital model or S&P.
So it was actually nice to see the PCA also respond and grow in the period.
So they're both sort of right at the top end of our range and hence really the Board's
decision to both grow the dividend and take the opportunity to announce the buyback. So
I think it was good to see them both respond. They're both right at the top end of where
we want them.

Q - Toby Langley

{BIO 15924432 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

But that's probably not going to be corrected if you limit yourself to $333 million and the
dividend you've got today, that PCA is still going to be knocking at that level?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. We're still going to be capital strong as we go forward. I think that -- you know, it's
good to be capital strong.

Q - Toby Langley

{BIO 15924432 <GO>}

With regard to your actions in Australia Pat, is that project just about restoring businesses
that you have or are you leaving other options on the table, i.e., would you consider
disposing sales or injecting to beef up parts of the business that maybe could do with
being bigger?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

No it's much the former. It is about improving what we've got. Actually it's an interesting -the business has got great market positions in most of what it does. I've been lucky to
inherit those. So you know, a lot of what we're going we've got very good strong
distribution partnerships. We've got a very strong position in the market. Therefore that's
allowed us to make some of the changes maybe a little bit quicker than I thought we
could do.
So no, it's very much more about making a change as you said. And actually growing
where we can. Some of the portfolios are performing well and where we can growing as
well.

Q - Ross Curran

{BIO 17605313 <GO>}

Hi gents. It's Ross Curran from Deutsche Bank. Two quick questions. Circling back to
James' question on attritional losses in Australia. Pat you mentioned that much of the
remediation happened later in the half. Is there much difference on a quarterly basis? Is
the Fourth Quarter attritional performance dramatically different from the second half
attritional performance as well?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

It's better. Yes. So now I'll refrain from giving you attritionals on a quarter by quarter or
month by month basis because it does jump around a little bit. But yes, the Fourth Quarter
is better than the Third Quarter or the second half alone each year.

Q - Ross Curran

{BIO 17605313 <GO>}

Can I get a comment on the exit rate, on attritional losses into the year?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll repeat my earlier one -- I'll refrain from giving you month by month or quarter by
quarter.

Q - Ross Curran

{BIO 17605313 <GO>}

Sure. Then can we get a comment on the amount of capital in the Australian LMI business
and how much the capital lift from that over the next three to four years helps underwrite
that buyback?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Oh I mean --we've talked a bit about having just over AUD1 billion in the LMI business. But
actually as Toby said we're very capital strong anyway. The two things -- what our overall
group capital looks like. Is it fungible enough? Are we getting good capital flows? Actually
in both -- we're strong on both sides. Any capital release in LMI is sort of icing on the cake
in that sense.

Q - Ross Curran

{BIO 17605313 <GO>}

So you're not dependent on capital coming out of LMI to fund the buyback?

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

No.

Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td

Pat, Brad Le Mesurier from Velocity Trade. A question on your deferred reinsurance costs.
They fell from about $1 billion at the end of 2015 to about $600 million end of 2016. Do
you recall the reason for that?

FINAL

A - John Neal

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

Because we buy our aggregate reinsurance treaties on a two year basis. You book the
cost of the two years up front and earn it over the two year period. So that's the reason
for fall.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

So last year was unusual rather than this year being unusual based on that sense.

Q - Brad Le Mesurier
So there's not much in that deferred reinsurance costs for business not yet written I
presume.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

No, as John said -- so last year we would have actually -- essentially written if you like two
years' worth of the deferred reinsurance costs. So you end up with -- I think it's $1 billion
versus $600 million or $500 million, something like that the delta is in that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Brad Le Mesurier
Yes. But in the half -- last year you had, I think it was $200 million relating to business not
yet written.

A - John Neal

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

If you book it up from -- so if we buy a treaty for two years the accounting standard
requires us to book the premium in full up front, even though in the year in question we
will only write half of the business we would expect to. So that's why you end up with
deferred cost. Then obviously in year 2 you earn that cost through against the business
that you're writing. It's as simple as that.

Q - Brad Le Mesurier
So that would have reduced that figure?

A - John Neal

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

Correct. You'll see the same again in 2017 because in effect we bought the same treaty
for two years. You'll see the same pattern of earnings.

Q - Unidentified Participant
John and Pat this is (inaudible) from JP Morgan. A couple of questions if I can. Firstly just on
the premium rates environment. Can you just comment on how premium rates are

Page 17 of 21



Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2017-02-26

tracking in your various regions against inflation? Is there any pressure in any region of the
combined ratios?

FINAL

A - John Neal

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

Yes good question against inflation. If I turn the question around, if there's one thing that
we're keeping a close eye on it is just that. It is inflation. We saw it as you know in Australia
for the first time in a long while through the early part of last year. We're alert to it in the
UK. An output of Brexit you would think would result in inflation coming through the claims
line.
We are actually only seeing it on motor at the moment. We're not seeing it more broadly.
Claims inflation on motor is running about 8% to 9%. So you won't be surprised to hear
that the level of rate increase is in excess of that.
I think when the Ogden changes go through goodness knows what the level of rate
increase will be on motor in the UK. Not seeing any unexpected inflation in the US actually
as yet. But again we're looking for it. Natural output of the new administration's policy is
positive in the main but you would think inflationary. So that's the view on inflation.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of rates obviously as Pat referred to here, a nice level of rate increase knocking
through the 5%s [ph] in the early part of the year.
As we came through our one/one [ph] renewals in Europe, I actually am reasonably
encouraged, it was a relative comment, reinsurance pricing was off by less than 1%,
property and casualty pricing was literally flat. The same was true in the US macro, albeit
our rates in the US were up by just over 1% on one/one [ph] renewals. So hence our
assessment is broadly flat pricing ex-Australia and on the inflation point, we're keeping a
weathered eye on inflation.

Q - Unidentified Participant
So basically no margin pressures and arguably some benefits coming from Australia.

A - John Neal

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

No, correct.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Great, thank you. Then maybe it ties into my second question which is just around your
guidance which you've given on the combined ratio. When I look at your attritional ratio, it
seems to deteriorate at about 2.5 points ex-crop in the preceding year. But your guidance
is actually improved on the combined ratio versus what you gave for 2016.
So maybe it is that you're seeing a better environment. But I'm just trying to marry up
those two trends. Should we take it that you're more conservative last year?

Page 18 of 21

A - John Neal

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

FINAL

I think yes, if you look at it this year, because I said in closing remarks, we're very confident
in our ability to execute on plan. The only watch I've got on the combined ratio is the prior
question, what's actually happening with market conditions, does that put us under a bit
of undue pressure.
At the better end, we've got two or three areas of the business we have to improve still.
I'm very happy with the trajectory in Australia, very happy with the degree of improvement
in North America. So those are all positive factors in terms of performance.
Per Nigel's earlier question, it's right for us to assume some prior accident year
development positively. But I think again we've been reasonably cautious in what that
might be. So there is a challenge, market conditions aren't great, we're not seeing price
increases everywhere. But there is some opportunity for upside.

Q - Tim Lawson

{BIO 3280691 <GO>}

Tim Lawson, Macquarie Securities. Just in terms of the buyback, just in any internal and
external considerations around a three year timeframe into long period?

A - John Neal

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

Sorry, I missed that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Tim Lawson

{BIO 3280691 <GO>}

So the timeframe to put out a three year buyback announcement over that period? So
why not just do a one year and follow it up? What are you thinking about for a three year
period in terms of the business operating conditions and what the external environment
might look like over that period?

A - John Neal

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

We're just trying to balance the best means of returning capital for shareholders. The
reality is that as our business performs in line with expectations across the geographies,
our franking credits in Australia reduce. So historically we've had franking credits of around
50%, they will naturally fall to 30%. So just simply increasing dividend is not necessarily the
best answer for the shareholder, hence the ability to buy back shares.
Our view on that is that in almost all circumstances, any form of buyback is ROE accretive.
But clearly we're going to be sensitive to the share price and ensure that we get the
balance between buyback and dividend right for the shareholder. So there's no absolute
view on how much buyback we conduct in any one year. But I think if you were to assume
it evenly over the three years, that's probably appropriate.

Q - Tim Lawson

{BIO 3280691 <GO>}

And an overall payout ratio, is that including dividends and buyback?

Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td

FINAL

I think we have a question on the telephone, David Spotswood.

Q - David Spotswood

{BIO 17576616 <GO>}

Thanks for that, just a couple of quick questions. The interest cost of $294 million, that's a
bit of a jump from last year, is the $294 million a reasonable number to assume going
forward? The tax rate you called out was 21%, will that revert to something higher, 24% or
should we assume 21% going forward? Just a comment on the interest rate sensitivity, if
interest rates -- discount rates go up 1% across the board, the flow through to the P&L on
that. Thanks.

A - Pat Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Thanks David. On the first one, the $294 million was a little bit higher. I think I mentioned
we exited a number of our commercial auto programs in the US and we had a one-off
payment to exit those. So our run rate of interest costs is closer to around $250 million
which is a bit more similar to what it was in 2015.

Bloomberg Transcript

The tax rate, because we've got profits coming through in the US and we're using the tax
losses, you would expect the 2016 rate to be more for the long term go forward, if
anything it might even be slightly lower than that.
Then the impact of discount rates movements, well 1% movement in discount rate has an
impact on liability of what, about $350 million pre-tax. I guess the new news is, because
we now have a longer duration of our assets, that would be largely but not completely
offset on the asset side. So we're closer to that being offset. There would still be a
mismatch. But to a much lower extend than we've had in the past.

Q - David Spotswood

{BIO 17576616 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - John Neal

{BIO 15681439 <GO>}

Okay, if there are no further questions, thanks everyone, we'll close there. Thanks for
