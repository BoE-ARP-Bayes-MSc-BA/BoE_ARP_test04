Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you for joining us this morning. Once again, our outstanding underwriting
capabilities and consistent execution on strategic initiatives becomes increasingly evident
with each quarterly earnings report and reinforces my confidence about the future for The
Hartford. In the third quarter, we reported core earnings of $442 million or $1.26 per
diluted share, 8% growth in year-over-year diluted book value per share excluding AOCI
and a trailing 12 month core earnings ROE of 12.5%.
We returned $634 million to shareholders in the quarter from share repurchases and
common dividends, and $1.6 billion for the 9 months ended September 30th. The
confidence we have in our business is also evidenced by the announcement that we have
increased our share repurchase program by $500 million, bringing the total authorization
to $3 billion through the end of 2022 and we increased our quarterly dividend by 10%,
payable in January of 2022.
With strong cash flow generation, we will continue to have a balanced capital deployment
approach to support growth and investments in the businesses with capital return to
shareholders. Looking through to the underlying results, the positive momentum
continued with written premium growth, margin expansion, operating efficiencies, and a
significant return on alternative investments.
However, results were impacted by Hurricane Ida, higher pandemic related excess
mortality in Group Benefits, and The Boy Scouts of America settlement. Commercial Lines
reported stellar margins with an industry-leading 87.2 underlying combined ratio and
another double-digit top line growth, reflecting higher new business levels, continued
strong retention, and solid renewal price increases. Our teams continue to execute
exceptionally well. In Personal Lines, we are in the midst of a transformation to provide a
more contemporary experience in product. Through a modernized platform in partnership
with ARP, one of the largest affinity groups in America, we see the opportunity to

capitalize on the growth in the mature market segment as this demographic is expected
to grow three times as fast as the rest of the US population over the next decade.
I am pleased with the progress being made with the introduction of the new platform and
Doug will provide more commentary. Additionally, in the quarter we entered into a new
agreement in principle with The Boy Scouts of America. This agreement now includes not
only the BSA, but local councils and representatives of the majority of sexual abuse
claimants who have now been asked to officially vote on the BSA bankruptcy plan.
The Hartford settlement becomes final upon the occurrence of certain conditions, which
we expect to occur in early 2022. Now turning to Group Benefits core earnings for the
quarter were $19 million reflecting elevated life in short-term disability claims, partially
offset by strong investment returns improved long-term disability results and earned
premium growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

Throughout the year we have been reporting earned premium growth over prior year and
this quarter's positive trends continues. Fully insured ongoing premium is up 4%, this
reflects growth in our in-force book and continued strong sales and persistency.
Persistency was above 90% and increased approximately one point over prior year.
The Group Life industry has been impacted by excess mortality over the past six quarters.
During our July earnings calls, we were optimistic that trends would lead to an
improvement in COVID related mortality. Our optimism was short-lived as the number of
US deaths started increasing in August due to the delta variant and continued through
September. As of this week, US Covid deaths for the third quarter now exceed 112,000
and this number is likely to continue to increase in the weeks ahead due to reporting lags
in the data.
The rapid increase in COVID deaths in the third quarter drove elevated mortality in our
book of business and across the industry. Additionally, the mortality experience from the
Delta surge has a higher percentage impact on the under 65 population compared to
prior periods. Approximately 40% of US reported COVID deaths in August and
September were of individuals under age 65, compared to approximately 20% of with us
in December of 2020 in January of 2021
Since younger age cohorts tend to carry higher face amount the combination of increased
deaths and higher amounts of insured values, resulted in a significant increase in total
dollar levels of mortality claims. In addition we experienced higher levels of non-COVID
excess mortality during the quarter, representing approximately 30% of reported excess
mortality loss. This is directionally consistent with the broader US trends that saw elevated
non-mortality in the third quarter.
As we look to the fourth quarter, forecasting excess mortality is a challenge. What we do
know is that vaccinations are saving lives, and higher levels of vaccination rates should
help mitigate mortality claims. Bottom line, the fundamentals across the Group Benefits
business remains solid and we are confident and optimistic about our performance in the
future.

Turning to the economic backdrop. While there are conflicting signals, I remain
encouraged on the 2022 macro economic outlook and believe the environment will be
one in which The Hartford's businesses performed well. Headline inflation remains
elevated, but core inflation is on the decline. I do not expect inflationary pressures to go
away overnight. The focus of global governments in the private sector on supply chain
solutions, as well as the normalization of hard hit pandemic sectors causes me to believe
inflationary pressure will begin to ease in the second half of 2022. While employment
gains stalled in the last couple of months as the US was impacted by the delta surge,
vaccination rates, therapeutics, and growing levels of natural immunity provide confidence
that COVID will become less of a deterrent for individuals to seek employment and return
to the workforce.

Bloomberg Transcript

Unemployment is expected to continue a downward trend as borders increasingly reopen
and pandemic related benefits fully roll off. This bodes well for the Hartford's business
mix. As I reflect on my tenure with the Hartford. I am extremely proud of the progress
we've made over the years, we fixed core businesses, exited underperforming or noncore segments, successfully integrated the new operations we added, positioning the
company to capture even more opportunities in the marketplace going forward. This is a
direct result of our performance-driven culture and a significant investments we have
made to transform the organization into one with exceptional underwriting tools and
expertise, expanded product depth and breadth, and industry-leading digital capabilities
complemented by a talented and dedicated employee base.
However, the journey is not complete, we will continue investing for the long term to
become an even more differentiated competitor in the customer experience, all while
producing superior financial results. At our November 16th Investor Conference, I look
forward to sharing how the business is positioned for continued outperformance and
highlighting the talented senior leadership team.
With a high quality franchise, growing revenues, strong margins, prudent capital
management, I'm very confident that the Hartford has never been better positioned to
continue to deliver on our financial objectives and enhanced value for all stakeholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Beth.

Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Thank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter of $442 million or $1.26 per diluted share
reflect excellent investment results with a 14% annualized return on limited partnership
investments and continued strong underlying results offset by $300 million of catastrophe
losses of $200 million from Hurricane Ida and excess mortality of $212 million in Group
Benefits. In P&C, the underlying combined ratio of 88.3 improved 2.3 points from the third
quarter of 2020, highlighted by excellent performance in our Commercial Lines segment
In Commercial Lines, we produced an underlying combined ratio of 87.2, a 6.5 point
improvement from the third quarter of 2020 and 15% written premium growth for the
socket consecutive quarter. In Personal Lines, an underlying combined ratio of 98

FINAL

compared to 81.4 in the prior year quarter, which reflects higher auto claim frequency
from increased miles driven and higher severity,
Doug will provide more detail on these results in commercial and personal lines in a
moment. P&C prior accident year reserve development was in core earnings was a net
unfavorable $62 million driven by the new Settlement Agreement with BSA, partially offset
by reserve reductions of $75 million including decreases and workers' compensation,
personal auto liability, package business, and bonds. In the quarter, we ceded an
additional $28 million of Navigators reserves to the adverse development cover primarily
related to wholesale construction.

Bloomberg Transcript

Although these losses are economically ceded, the reserve development resulted in a
deferred gain representing a charge against net income in the quarter. Group Benefits
core earnings of $19 million, decrease from $116 million in third quarter 2020, largely
driven by higher excess mortality losses in Group Life, partially offset by increase in net
investment income. All cause excess mortality in the quarter was $212 million before tax,
which includes $233 million for third quarter deaths, offset by $21 million of net favorable
development from prior periods predominantly from the second quarter of 2021
The percentage of excess mortality not specifically attributed to a COVID-19 cause of loss
is more significant this quarter than it has been in the past and represents approximately
30% of the total. Excluding losses from short-term disability related to COVID 19 and
excess mortality, the core earnings margin was 12.6%. The underlying trends in disability
remain positive with lower long-term disability claim incidence and stronger recoveries
related to prior year reserves. The disability loss ratio in this year's quarter was 3.1 points
higher as the prior year loss ratio benefited from favorable short-term disability claim
frequency due to fewer elective medical procedures during the early stages for
pandemic.
As Chris commented the incidence and excess mortality claims going forward is hard to
predict as it is dependent on a number of factors including the vaccination rate, the
potential spread of new COVID variants, the percentage of those infected who are in the
workforce, and the strain on the healthcare system impact in the treatment of non-COVID
related chronic illnesses.
Improving operating efficiencies and a lower expense ratio from Hartford next have
contributed to margin expansion. The program delivered $6 million in pre-tax expense
savings in the nine months ended September 30th, 2021, compared to the same period
in 2019. We continue to expect full-year pre-tax savings of approximately $540 million in
2022 and $625 million in 2023. Turning to Hartford Funds core earnings for the quarter
were $58 million, compared with $40 million for the prior-year period, reflecting the
impact of daily average AUM increasing 27%.
Total AUM at September 30th was $152 billion. Mutual fund net inflows were
approximately $300 million, compared with net outflows of $1.3 billion in third quarter
2020. Hartford Funds continues to produce excellent returns with growth in assets under

management, driven by net inflows and market appreciation. As a low capital business, its
return on equity has been outstanding, consistently over 45% since 2018.
The corporate core loss was lower at $47 million compared to a loss of $57 million in the
prior year quarter, primarily due to a $21million before tax loss in third quarter 2020 from
the equity interest in Talcott resolution, which was sold earlier in 2021. Turning to
investments, our investment portfolio delivered another outstanding quarter of results.
Net investment income was $650 million, up 32% from the prior year quarter benefiting
from very strong annualized limited partnership returns of 40%, driven by higher
valuations and cash distributions within private equity funds, and sales of underlying
investments in real estate. Limited partnership returns continue to exceed expectations.
We continue to manage the investment portfolio with a focus on high quality public
investments while leveraging our capabilities to take advantage of attractive private
market opportunity. The total annualized portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships,
was 3% before tax compared to 3.8% in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting the lower
interest rate environment. We expect pressure on the portfolio yield to continue in the
fourth quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

The portfolio credit quality remained strong with no credit losses on fixed maturities in the
quarter. Net unrealized gains on fixed maturities before tax were $2.5 billion at September
30th, down from $2.8 billion at June 30th due to higher interest rates and wider credit
spreads. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, rose 8% since September 30th,
2022 to $49.64, and our trailing 12 month core earnings ROE was 12.5%.
During the quarter, The Hartford returned $634 million to shareholders, including $511
million of share repurchases and a $123 million in common dividends paid. Yesterday the
Board approved a 10% increase in the current dividend and increase our share repurchase
authorization by $500 million. With this increase and the $1.2 billion of repurchases
completed through September 30th, There remains $1.8 billion of share repurchase
authorization in effect through 2022. From October 1st through October 27th, we
repurchased approximately 1.5 million common shares for $108 million.
Cash and investments at the holding company were $2.1 billion as of September 30th,
which includes the proceeds from the September issuance of $600 million of 2.9% senior
notes. These proceeds will be used to repay our $600 million, 7.875 % junior subordinated
debentures which are redeemable at par on or after April 15, 2022.
During the third quarter, we received $443 million in dividends from subsidiaries and
expect approximately $445 million in the fourth quarter. With top line growth improving
underlying margins, operating efficiencies, strong cash flow, and ongoing capital
management, we are positioned to consistently generate market-leading returns and
enhance value creation for shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Doug.

Thanks, Beth and good morning everyone. Across property and casualty, I continue to be
extremely pleased with our execution and performance. In the quarter, the underlying
combined ratio was an outstanding 88.3 Commercial Lines achieved double-digit written
premium growth for the second consecutive quarter. Written pricing remains strong,
largely consistent with second quarter and our new personal lines product launch is
accelerating with five new states rolled out in October. As Beth mentioned, commercial
lines produced a terrific underlying combined ratio of 87.2 with over five points of
improvement coming from the loss ratio and another point from expenses. I've been
doing these calls for a long time and this is one of the stronger underlying quarters I have
presented.
Before providing more color on commercial pricing and loss trends, let me spend a few
minutes detailing another quarter of exceptional topline performance. Small Commercial
written premium of just over $1 billion was a third quarter record, increasing 14% over prior
year. Policy count retention was strong at 84% and in-force policies grew 6% versus prior
year.

Bloomberg Transcript

As anticipated, we continue to benefit from an improved economy with increases in
payroll and wages contributing to the quarter's top line result. Small Commercial new
business of $165 million was up 28%, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit
growth. Our workers' compensation and market leading BOP product spectrum
contributed equally to the result. I'm particularly pleased with the growth we're achieving
across each of our small Commercial distribution channels.
New business from agents, payroll programs, alliances and direct, all delivered doubledigit growth and will meaningfully contribute to continued topline performance. The
breadth and depth of this distribution balance is unmatched by competitors. In Middle &
Large Commercial, we produce a second consecutive excellent quarter with written
premium growth of 18%. Middle market, new business of $139 million was up 6% in the
quarter, driven in large part by our industry verticals
Policy retention increased 8% or 8 points to 87%, one of the strongest retention quarters
in quite some time. We continue to balance the rate and retention trade off while
maintaining disciplined risk underwriting and leveraging our segmentation tools to drive
profitable growth. Global Specialty produced another strong quarter with written premium
growth of 14%. New business growth of 26% was equally impressive and retention
remained strong in the mid 80s. In the quarter, the breadth of our written premium
growth was led by 14% in wholesale and 19% in US financial lines.
Global Reinsurance also had an excellent quarter with written premium growth of 39%.
Execution to fully leverage our expanded product portfolio these past few years has been
excellent. Across our franchise, we continue to further develop our operating routines with
broader risk solutions to meet customer needs. As a proof point, third quarter cross sell
new business premium between Global Specialty and Middle & Large Commercial was
$15 million. With this result, we have now exceeded our initial transaction goal of $200
million more than a year early.

After years of development, our product portfolio has become a competitive strength
and our execution will only get stronger. Let's move to pricing metrics. US Standard
Commercial Lines pricing excluding workers' compensation was 6.5% consistent with the
second quarter. Middle market ex workers' compensation price change of 8.1% was
essentially flat to quarter two and continues to exceed loss cost trend. In Standard
Commercial workers' compensation where no written pricing was in line with quarter two
at 1.2%. Global Specialty renewal written price remained strong in the US at 10% and
international at 17%
Turning to commercial loss trends, our casualty current accident year loss ratios are in line
with expectations. It was a pretty quiet non-cat weather quarter in Small Commercial
Property. In addition, we continue to monitor the adverse impacts of supply chain
disruptions on loss costs and expect property severity trends to be elevated for the rest
of the year and into 2022. Current pricing is still exceeding loss trends within most lines
and we remain confident in our full-year 2021 loss ratio expectations.

Bloomberg Transcript

Before I move to Personal Lines, let me comment on the commercial pricing environment
over the past two to three years. There is no question we've experienced a healthy
pricing environment and in several lines, one of the hardest markets I've experienced. The
combination of these rate actions and disciplined underwriting decisions, are central
drivers of our strong performance. Continued pressure from weather, supply chain and
inflation lead me to believe that the current pricing environment will remain healthy well
into 2022.
Moving to Personal Lines, the third quarter underlying combined ratio rose 10.4% points to
91.8%. Auto frequency is up with increasing vehicle trips and miles traveled, but still
modestly below pre-pandemic levels. Auto severity is elevated driven in part by the rising
cost of used cars, parts and labor. These inflationary factors will continue to be an industry
headwind as we expect them to persist into 2022.
In home, we continue to experience favorable frequency versus our initial expectations,
more than offsetting higher claim severity from elevated building material and labor costs.
Turning to the top line, written premium declined 2%. Policy retention was relatively stable
at 84% and new business premium was up 6% in the quarter. This new business uptick
occurred despite JD Power survey results concluding that auto insurance shopping rates
among the 50 plus age segment remain 6% below a year ago. Our new business growth
was driven by higher marketing spend and improved conversion rates. I'm pleased with
this quarter's momentum.
We're also encouraged by the early results from the launch of our new contemporary
Personal Lines auto and home product, Prevail. Through the third quarter, written
premium, responses, and issue counts are exceeding expectations, both products are
now available in seven states. With our latest launch in early October, we also enhanced
our auto and home bundling and telematics capabilities. On the latter, we're excited to be
partnering with the industry leader Cambridge mobile telematics.

This is an important change as we continue to augment our models based on driving
behavior. The Prevail product will and will be in two more states over the next 90 days.
Before turning the call back to Susan for Q&A, let me conclude with a few final thoughts.
Property and Casualty had an incredible quarter our commercial topline produced a
second consecutive quarter of superior performance. Strong pricing is earning into the
book driving lower current accident year loss ratios. Global Specialty is delivering strong
execution and underwriting performance and we continue to be excited about the launch
of Prevail in Personal Lines.
We're clearly seeing the positive results of our multi-year roadmap with deeper and
broader products, improve risk selection, and outstanding execution. This quarter is
another demonstration of those capabilities. Our technology invest agenda has been
significant and the results are clear and sustainable, I'm thrilled with our continued
progress and look forward to sharing more details with our business heads in November
at Investor Day. Let me now turn the call back over to Susan.

Questions And Answers

Bloomberg Transcript

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first
question will come from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, thanks, good morning. My first question is on the incremental (inaudible) of buyback. I
know the two year capital plan, so is that expected to come this year or next year? And
then is that being funded just with higher dividend, the Holdco or are you holding a little
bit less of a buffer, maybe a combination of both?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah Elyse. I'll start and then I'll ask Beth to add her commentary. So yes, as we sit here
today, it's a sign of obviously increased confidence in our business performance, our cash
generation capabilities coming out of our OpCo's that it will eventually flow to the holding
company. We haven't relaxed any of our standards as far as the HoldCo liquidity, we still
want to hold generally one times interest in, future interest and dividends, but it's more as
we sit here today and look at the performance of our businesses here in 2021 heading
into 2022, we're highly confident in their performance and we took the action we did, but
Beth what would you add?

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Yeah. So what I would add is, if you think about the timing of the share repurchases, if you
recall, under the $2.5 billion authorization. We had said that we anticipated a $1.5 billion in
Page 9 of 22



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2021-10-29

FINAL

'21 with $1 billion in 2022, so increasing by $500 million gives us the opportunity in 2022 to
be relatively consistent with 2021. So, not looking to significantly change the timing of what
we had already laid out for 2021. But again, as Chris said, as we look at underlying
business performance and levels of capital at the holding company, we felt this was the
appropriate action.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Thanks. And then my second question, within your accident year underlying loss ratio
improvement within Commercial, how much paid from rate over trend within your
commercial book? And then can you update us on what you're assuming for loss trend
across your commercial book and has that changed recently?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Sure. Elyse, let me start and Beth will sell around the edges, for sure. So as I mentioned
over 5 points of commercial loss improvement, you've got to adjust for COVID right? So
COVID is 1.5points of that change year-over-year, but then across our core lines
essentially all of our lines are earning in positive rate and so as I think about that, the
adjustments and the variables that drive those changes are all coming from that positive
earn rate change. So I think it's sustainable. As we look into the fourth quarter, we had a
little bit of good news on non-cat weather, property primarily, in Small Commercial. But
the other lines, comp GL, our specialty lines, it's basically earn rate driving the
improvement.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, thanks for the color.

Operator
Our next question will come from Derek Han with KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Derek Han

{BIO 22149332 <GO>}

Good morning. Thanks. My first question is on workers' comp, one of your competitors
talked about the competitive environment kind of driving rates to now really inflect until
year end 2022. Can you just talk about what kind of frequency and severity trends that
you're seeing with wage inflation and the potential for medical inflation to pick up as well.

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah, few pieces to that question. I'd start by saying that the competitive environment to
us in Quarter Three into Four, not a lot different than what we saw earlier parts of the
year, so I think a fairly consistent competitive environment. The comment about the 2022
extension towards the end of the year, I think is a fair comment that we see based on the
filings that are moving through state regulatory bodies now. Do you think we're looking
toward the end of 2022 to see a turn toward that positive sign that people have been
expecting now for a couple of years. I remind you that our performance in these lines

Page 10 of 22

Date: 2021-10-29

FINAL

across our businesses, particularly small excellent, so workers' comp performance
continues to perform.
And then relative to trends, yes, the long-term trend of frequency favorable variances. We
expect long term to continue, we had a little bit of a a period that will be unlike any other
period prior because of pandemic. And yes, medical inflation has been rather tame the
last couple of years, but our long-term expectations have not gone up, right? Which are in
that 5 plus range for medical inflation, we see that long term and we've not adjusted our
fix because of that expectation.

Q - Derek Han

{BIO 22149332 <GO>}

Okay, and that's s really helped before. And then my second question is on the reserves.
How are you feeling about the Navigators reserves, given that you're a quarter away from
maybe going through the top of the adverse cover and then it looks like you had $400
million in adverse over the last few years.

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Derek, I'll start and just to remind you that we purchased that adverse loss to a
cover for a reason. And it was part of our views of how we're going to finance the
acquisition that again I think turns out to be absolute home run as you heard from Doug.
The improvements in our combined ratios, the improvement in product, the ability to
cross-sell, all those additional capabilities that are now in the House, I think is tremendous.
So again, it was, it was part of how we view that we were going to finance it and obviously
take some tail risk off, Beth what would you add?

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Yeah, so as I mentioned the changes that we made this quarter were in wholesale
construction and really just increase some of the tail factors that we had in that book. And
overall, when I think about the Navigators reserves and even think of the action that we
took this quarter, with or without the ADC, relatively small movement when you think
about the overall balance sheet and reserves that we have.

Q - Derek Han

{BIO 22149332 <GO>}

Got it. I appreciate all the color.

Our next question will come from Gary Ransom with Dowling and Partners. Please go
ahead.

Q - Gary Ransom

{BIO 3446828 <GO>}

Good morning. Regarding the aggregate Cat reinsurance cover. I was wondering if you
could help us understand where you are in terms of reaching the attachment point and
how that might affect fourth quarter or the next.

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

FINAL

So, great question. So yes, we do have an aggregate cover that kicks in when with losses
that get ceded that cover exceed $700 million, it provides $200 million of protection, and
so when you look at the Cat losses that we've had through September 30th, we probably
have about a little less than $50 million to go before we would start to hit that $700

{BIO 3446828 <GO>}

All right, thank you very much. And then I believe this is probably for Doug. On the tone of
the market and how rates are less stabilizing. If I compare how I was thinking about it,
maybe even you were thinking about it earlier in the year. We will see a deceleration of
those rates, it's actually it seems to have leveled out a bit more and there may be a lot of
different factors involved in that, but do you have a view on what is causing that? And I
assume that's part of the reason you think it's going into 2022 deeper into 2022

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Gary, I agree with you. Right. So for looking at the core of our guarantee cost nonspecialty book. I would describe Q3 is very stable compared to earlier in the year and
within our expectations for the reasons you suggest. We look at property drivers and the
weather, we think about the inflation risk, supply chain, I mentioned them in my script, I
think that those types of factors we'll will be further drivers to make sure that we as
underwriters are covering our cost of risk, and so that would be my commentary around
the core guarantee cost non-specialty book.
And then in the specialty area, where we're seeing rather dramatic changes in the pricing
for the last couple of years, dramatic in the sense of positive. Yes, there's been some
moderation, but I think as correlating to improve price adequacy in those books of
business in those particular lines. So I think in total, not major surprises, but I do think these
threat factors relative to, particularly weather in the property area, and supply chain and
others will keep prices kind of where they are. We see a steady as you go for a period of
time now.

FINAL

Thank you very much. So, I'm looking at the growth rate in Global Res and in international,
we know when you talk about the Navigators acquisition, you want to increase your shelf
space for a lot of your producing agents and whatnot, but international and Global Re kind
of fall out of the firewall, having a complete shelf of products. What are the strategy in
those 2 sub-segments? What do you hope to achieve, and how they fit in with your
business model?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

I'd start with Global Re. It's really a niche segment for us, it's a small group of very
seasoned thoughtful underwriters, selective in their portfolio matching. It's, this is a
smaller quarter for them, for the 39 you have to put in context. But it's been a successful
group they have added to our risk expertise here within the place and we're very pleased
about their approach in their success.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I see them very much a part of our strategy, but a little bit separate from our primary
focus on Global Re. And then relative to international, our stated mission the first couple
of years was absolutely to regain our contribution to shareholder success. If you are right,
we had a very disappointing, couple of years of performance internationally, not unlike
others in the Lloyd's marketplace, and so we've worked hard at that and now feel much
better about our financial performance and as we look forward we're exploring and
debating amongst ourselves about how we grow that portfolio.
So I'm bullish about the future really pleased that we have the past behind us and I think
we have a very solid platform to work from. And obviously it is a specialty platform, not
unlike most of our competitors in the Lloyd's but we were talking across our product
families about what we can do there and I think an area that we'll talk more to you about
over time.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 21718992 <GO>}

All right. And then on Personal Lines, obviously it's a real tough period for auto right now
with the reopening in used car prices, how should I think about the loss ratio constant on
new business being written under the new underwriting model where we're not stuck with
the business compared to the previous relationship with ARP where you kind of had to be
sure in order to pickup of customer? Should the new business, have a lower loss ratio than
the, than the Legacy business or a higher loss ratio.

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Well, I would start by answering your question, saying we have spent a lot of time with our
pricing approach state by state as we launch these new products and probably slightly
different answers by state based on where we are and what we see as the opportunities
in the given states. So I would not jump to the fact that we see and expect lower loss
ratios in the new than we do in our current book.
We have a very solid season book that continues to season out and over time that is has
been and will continue to be a significant contributor to our earnings, but we're excited
about what we can do with this new product platform, it is much more contemporary. It's
Page 13 of 22



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The

got features as underwriters. We like a lot. And obviously, I've talked to you about what
we're doing with the auto space with our telematics program. So as I think about the new
launch of prevail in time, that will continue to be a key driver of our profits, that will be
increasing as we roll through the rest of the country and 2022 with rollouts.

FINAL

At the moment it's rather immature and we're watching the early states. And so I think it's
too early to call, but excited about early progress.
(Multiple Speakers)

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah. Again, Doug described it. Well, I would just add, remember part of the inherent
strategy there is to serve more ARP members in the 50s, strictly in the 50 to 65-year-old.
So our base plan, our base rates in the various states that we will do expect a broader
population set to to underwrite. But again, given the flexibility we have with six month
policies, no lifetime continuity agreements, meaning they're not guaranteed renewable. It
does give us I think added flexibility to experiment and various states

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 21718992 <GO>}

And is the new product direct or multi-channel

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Doug Elliot

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 22348763 <GO>}

Great. Happy Friday. Good morning. I guess just sticking out as a follow-up to Josh's
question, since your portfolio mix is still, is a little different than many of the peers we
follow in terms of demographics and your results in Auto are still good. Just curious, are
you, are you looking to push a lot more rate there or is it given kind of the inflationary
trends? Or just how should we kind of think about in a rate versus potential loss trend
over the coming year or so I think I think in your commentary, it sounds like we should be
kind of baking in some continued pressure

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Mike, that's fair. Right. I would say that we are satisfied with our financial return in that
business very solid rate adequacy basically strong across the board, but we're not

immune from the risks and supply chain and used auto prices et cetera, that the industry
is facing. So we are active on the pricing front, we are working state by state across the
country, have more flexibility as Chris enumerated relative to Prevail, but even in our
current product construct, I would say it's an active product area upstairs working what we
think are the supply chain issues that we're going to be facing into 2022 as we work
through that year. So yes, active on the actuarial front.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 22348763 <GO>}

Ok great. So, the forest for the trees a bit, so some investors and focused on some of
the soft pricing environment for a while, which might be improving but these workers'
comp results have really been excellent. It looks like a much better than expected for
years now, despite the hike in pricing. Maybe you can kind of talk to what what's been
driving the loss cost trends. What specifically has been much better than expected over
the recent years, especially for some of the older vintages.

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right. We have a very sophisticated series of pricing modules across our markets. I think
we work workers' compensation and think about strategy and thinking about
segmentation and in deep geographic cells, industry cells, et cetera. So what we do down
in the bowels of our business, really strong fundamentals relative to workers'
compensation. I will share with you and you know as well, that the trends have been rather
moderate over the past five to six years, right? So understanding that as we talked
before, medical severity has been pretty moderate these last three to five years,
generally a long-term frequency numbers are in good shape.
But our performance has, I would say exceeded those tailwinds and when I think about
our execution on the front lines and the combination of our data science, data analytics
inside this company, the use of third party data, there just a lot of competitive strength
that we think drive our success in workers' comp and I think those are here for the long
term and getting better every quarter.

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Doug again, I know we talk about it internally. I would just add Mike, our other forms of
distributions to interact with us on a easier basis with great data, fast turnaround time. So,
the competitive advantage as Doug talked about from the analytical side, I think is equally
matched with our go-to-market digital capabilities

Thank you and good morning, how your underlying margin expansion in Commercial Lines

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

FINAL

So, Tracy. Let me start our when we think about current accident year picks and maybe I'll
just refer you to the supplement because we've got a year to date in the supplement our
numbers underlying on the loss side are really strong. So if you look at nine months of
2021 versus nine months of 2020. I think they are very healthy, and that really does guide
back to the thoughts of definitely shared a bit of ago about stronger pricing as a result of
written pricing in 2020 and 2021. So we're encouraged.

A - Chris Swif t

The other thing we have not talked about on the call this morning's there's still a number
of actions we're taking relative to segmentation and industry focus across our businesses
that are contributing to that number. So I know in our Middle Large Commercial book
more Tucker and his team have a number of initiatives that are also drivers of improving
performance so lots happening in the core underwriting, but some of those drivers are in
addition to what I would describe very positive pricing trends I would add just to Tracy
comment there is nothing fundamentally that has changed in our philosophy of how we'd
like to be thoughtful, predictable, consistent, with loss picks, with anything related to our
business. So, Tracy. I mean we have a great deal of pride and being very consistent and
predictable. So that's the only color I would add.

A - Doug Elliot

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Yeah. I would agree with that Chris. And maybe just as a closer, in two weeks when we're
together on Investor Day. One of the initiatives of that day is to take you inside and to
give you a sense of how different our (inaudible) today than it was five years ago. And
there are a lot of things we've done organically, which we will highlight on the 16th and
there are things that we've been able to do with the addition of some more product on
the specialty side. So it's hard, I know we go quarter-to-quarter with you folks we're going
to attempt to spend some time on the 16th to look back and give you a sense of why our
optimism is a strong it is this with our company going forward.

Q - Tracy

{BIO 16649104 <GO>}

Yeah. Looking forward to seeing that journey and Investor Day. I also will follow-up on the
auto pricing front comment, I guess in those efforts with refiling, I just wanted to get a
better sense when you think earn rate we'll be meeting higher loss trend in those efforts?
Would we see that inflection point next year in 2022 or 2023?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Tracy. Well, Doug. Thanks.
Is that a commercial or personal Lines comment?

Q - Tracy

{BIO 16649104 <GO>}

Personal auto. Yeah, because I just understand there is a delay, with some regulator in
actually getting those filings since it wasn't that long ago they were thinking about
rebates. So just that process of getting the refilings, approved in the meantime, you just
Page 16 of 22

have accumulation of logs trend. So I just want to know when you think that will all come
together.

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah, so the exact date is going to be hard to predict, but let me just start with where we
were 15 months ago.
One of the things we did not do was to tinker with our new business pricing in the second
quarter of 2020. So when we return money to customers, we did that based on kind of
and enforce rate of return and did not change our appetite for our pricing on new going
forward.
I think that has provided a much more stable, profitable base that is has not changed. We,
obviously because of driving habits changing radically in the second quarter 2020 we
return money appropriately given that. But I'd start with the premise that is that, to answer
that question. You have to talk about and predict the supply chain dynamic and that is very
difficult to do. Climate et cetera are all feeding into this we think those trends will continue
2022. I hope they will ease as we get into the middle part of 2022, but that is an ongoing
component.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then lastly really is a state by state dynamic. So it's so hard for me to suggest, we
look across our states where some states that we're filing in the next 30 days or some
states we have filed in the last 100 days that we won't be filing for another three, six
months.
So it is a very active process and we do think supply chain will ease a bit, but we don't
think that will happen in the short term. So we expect to kind of live on through the current
conditions as we see them and as we move into the latter half of 2022 will get to a better
spot

go but also curious with the M&A environment, are you seeing any opportunities and
areas where you'd like to get bigger HMH could that eventually preclude some of this

What are you thinking about M&A and how that might play out over the next 2 years?

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

FINAL

Andrew, thanks for the question.
Yeah. We've I think been pretty consistent of late, but it's just a low priority principally
because I think our portfolio of capabilities products is robust and we want to mature that,
grow it organically and focus on the activities more from an organic mindset as opposed
to M&A, so I just consistently shared with you and others. It's just a low priority.
So, and that's why, again, we're, we feel it appropriate to make a repurchase
commitment through the end of 2002 with that $500 million increase.

Q - Andrew Kligerman

{BIO 1551668 <GO>}

Thanks, Chris. And then, just moving over to the Group Benefits business, it looks like you
had a real solid on premiums growth of 4% in the third quarter, it seems to be steadily
moving up what's, what products are driving that you seeing movement in voluntary
products and can you sustain that growth rate? Because it's very compelling if we could
just kind of get out of the COVID and just continue to see these really nice underlying
benefits ratios.

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, I believe we can Andrew. We, I think demonstrated that consistently during the year
as, we have been recovering from COVID.
So I think the opportunity, particularly as more people come back into full-time
employment or part-time employment with a little wage inflation that's occurring in most
industries, I think that sets up well, and that's what I was trying to say in my commentary
that the environment for Group Benefits broadly defined is very healthy. Our highest
growing product line is our voluntary product set that we've built over the last 5 years, so
really pleased with all the critical illness hospital sub products that we have at our disposal
now, so that is a deep growth area.
And then I would just give you one last point. Andrew, I think people's attitudes meaning
employees attitudes to benefits has changed. I think they're more focused on it. Given
what we're living through. I think they're more thoughtful about thinking about risk and
protection they needed for themselves or their families. So I think there is a broad
weakening of benefit type products and voluntary products that is occurring across
America.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi, there. I had a couple of questions, both on workers' comp and I think first on pricing in
workers' comp everyone sort of been expecting prices to go up next year for the last
couple of years, but hasn't happened yet, so. And wondering if you could comment on is
that because of competitor behavior? Or is it because the pushback from the states? And
what gives you the confidence that things might actually turn at some point in 2022?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Jimmy, so I'll start by saying that the overall performance line is pretty solid and that would
be my, place to start. Secondly, you now have but COVID year entering its way into most
states a 3-year experience periods. So Accident Year 20 is now becoming part of the
experience period and Accident Year 20 has a period of time relative to frequency where
people were home and frequency rates were very favorable.
So with that entry into the experience period. We're going to see some downward
pressure on pricing. That is why the later in 2022 through the end of the year into 2023,
we're going to feel those headwinds in workers' comp and I think others have talked
about it, but it's just where the market is right now and why I'm so pleased that our
performance continues to be strong and we will make sure that we're working the levers
that we have here to be thoughtful about our underwriting and risk taking throughout
2022.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Okay. And then as you think about margins in workers' comp, I think in the past, there
have been cases when the economy is running pretty hot, you see a pickup in losses
sometimes, it doesn't seem like that's happened this time around. But if you could
comment on what you've seen in that respect and whether that's a concern, as you're
looking at the economy overall.

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

We're certainly watching that carefully. We're watching frequency because just as you
described sometimes when you see a pickup in the economy, you'll have less
experienced workers on the job that may lead to injuries, and injuries obviously are a
driver and workers' compensation. So, as I reflected both in the second quarter and third
quarter, our frequencies are in healthy shape but it is a high watch item for us. And if we
see something we will, we will share that with you and deal with that in our numbers, but
right now, fairly quiet.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Okay. And just lastly on the group business on the non-COVID mortality being high, if you
could talk about whether you think that's more of an anomaly or could that be a trend,
given that more younger people are being affected overall which obviously affects your
book more so than was the case initially

A - Chris Swif t

Page 19 of 22



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The

Date: 2021-10-29

FINAL

Yeah, Jimmy. The non-COVID mortality has been very balance sheet over the last six
quarters. So I don't, I don't see a trend per se, just given what we've seen in the data.
I think the anecdotal view is during COVID, particularly the early days there might have
been lack of people seeing their health care providers for routine healthcare. Whether it
be in your physicals, normal checks and screenings, so we have seen particularly in this
quarter with that elevated non-causing mortality, a little bit more a heart, stroke, cancer,
causes of death that seem to indicate maybe a second order effect with COVID and
people not taking care of themselves. But beyond that, it's been very bouncy that's all I'll
say. So I don't think it's trendable at this point.

ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Hi, thanks, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And later in the call I'll go a little
longer. I wanted to also just ask about the Group Benefits, the adverse mortality this
quarter, I was wondering if you could just give a breakdown, how much of it was IBNR
versus actual reported deaths in the third quarter, and then relatedly, and I know there is a
lot of uncertainty here, it's hard to predict, but as of now the IHME estimates that total
COVID mortality will remain near 100,000 deaths in the fourth quarter. If it does in fact
stay that high, would you expect similar sensitivity as in 3Q or I guess how should we think
about the puts and takes there?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah, happy to take your question, David. It's important to get you and some of answers
so I mean, just to be a context on sort of mortality here. How we approach it is obviously
we have a great deal of data in history in this area that sort of complete our lag studies to
make an estimate sort of incurred, but not reported deaths during the quarter. Obviously
with the COVID happening, we've overlaid CDC data into our analysis to obviously see
their trends both on a COVID and non-COVID factor.
So that's the blending of those two came up in essence with our conclusions for this
quarter. At the end of the quarter, I would share with you, July was fairly developed,
meaning you could, you could have a higher degree of confidence on the ultimate that we
see in July, a little less so in August and September is sort of the fresh month and that's
the one that's the most challenged to sort of predict the future when you put it all
together though for the quarter, of the incurred losses that we have 53% of it is still held
in IBNR.

Page 20 of 22



FINAL

Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2021-10-29

So if that's the data point you're looking for. I think the other point that you referenced is I
would share with you the more deaths in under 65 year-olds is really driving up our
severity. If you look at severity on a nine month basis this year compared to nine month
basis last year our severity is there up 40% which tells us again younger age cohorts,
higher insured value, active lives at work. When we look at sort of regions is the region
that sort of stands out for us is the Southeast. They are experiencing the most elevated A
to E from a historical expectation side. So, as you say that the fourth quarter and for me,
it's got some data out there, there is a lot of data out there, I would just share with you in
all my years in the life business. It's been most difficult to get our arms around a model
that really effectively predict this.
Some models are high, some are low, you've seen our experience, even this year we're
first quarter we were significantly overestimated on our IBNR. So I'm going to refrain from
making any predictions both on frequency and severity because there is a wide range of
outcomes. What I would share though is that we do have some FT-friendly events coming
up in December and will provide our analyst and investors a view of where we see fourth
quarter mortality going. You might even ask about 2022? 2022 is even harder to predict.
So when we're back together in February we'll give you our best thinking. But as we sit
here today, I think these next two quarters, you could still have some lingering COVID that
will emerge in everyone's numbers.

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks, Chris. I appreciate that detail. And totally understand
there is a lot of uncertainty and you're not alone in terms of predicting the impact,
obviously. So, if I could just switch gears and sneak one more in for Doug, I just wanted to
ask you know it look like in Small Commercial. You talked about underlying loss ratios ex
COVID actually improving. Could you talk about the drivers there? Because I had thought
that was a place where pricing was under a little bit more pressure. So, is that more a
benefit of just wage inflation coming through or something else?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Yeah, I think about small Commercial year-over-year in the quarter. I mentioned we had a
pretty good non-cat quarter, weather quarter. So we have some good news in loss ratio
there. And then, yes, to your question on workers' comp. Our experience has been
favorable there, we're slightly outperforming our expectations around pricing in small so
that's against our where we thought we would be through the third quarter, obviously,
that's in the books right now. But in general still feel good about our calls, we've not come
off our severity calls, indemnity calls, and encouraged by what we see in the performance
of the line. So, I don't think there's a major story there, but it's just another really solid
performance by our Small Commercial Com team
