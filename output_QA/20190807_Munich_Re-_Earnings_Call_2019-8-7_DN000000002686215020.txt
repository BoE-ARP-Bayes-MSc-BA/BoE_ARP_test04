{BIO 19080254 <GO>}

Thank you, Mary, for the introduction. Good afternoon to everyone listening into our call
on the occasion of our Q2 Financial Earnings 2019. I have the pleasure to be here with
Joachim Wenning, our CEO; and our CFO, Christoph Jurecka. Procedure is relatively
simple and straightforward. This afternoon Joachim will kick it off with his opening remarks
and Christoph will continue with just a few explanations on our Q2 earnings. And
afterwards, we will go right into Q&A. Joachim, please

{BIO 16273429 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Christian, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It's Christoph
Jurecka and my pleasure today to report Munich Re's half year 2019 figures and to also
share our view on the outlook for the full year 2019 and the further outlook into 2020 with
you. As you know, we are in the midst of, I would call, it a three years race to increasing

FINAL

the Munich Re group result to EUR 2.3 billion last year 2.5 billion euro this year, and finally
to reach EUR 2.8 billion in 2020.
And I'd like to anticipate the following: Munich Re is fully on track and I would like to add,
businesses are not only running smoothly, they are evolving quite dynamically and they
are growing profitably, which is very important for us. And it's unfortunate if you like, but it
is, what it is, the big quarter two news have already been out practically with our adhoc
communication, disclosing the quarter two result of EUR 1 billion. That was three weeks
ago. So since then naturally not too much reading you has happened.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, in any case, I'd like to give you some more details if you want to have a look at slide
three. This highlights that it was almost exclusively the reinsurance business, which has
contributed to the extraordinarily positive first half year result 2019, and for the full year,
we expect to earn EUR 2.5 billion there off EUR 2.1 billion from reinsurance and EUR 0.4
billion from ERGO. That has not changed; however, I'd like to emphasize that our
confidence level with regard to reaching the EUR 2.5 billion this year is clearly higher now
after six months than it was at the beginning of this year.
From slide four, you can take, if you wish, some concrete milestones that we have
achieved on the reinsurance side and on the ERGO side, to meet our mid-term target. I
think on the reinsurance side, it's worthwhile mentioning that it is very crucial for the
earnings increase that the reinsurers are successfully growing into the target lines of
business and target regions. And this is nothing new to you, we have reported on this
many times. So, conceptually strategically everything as is, however, it is important for you
to see. And for me, I'm happy to confirm that execution and progress in targeted
profitable growth in reinsurance is fully, fully satisfying for us.
And also important for the reinsurance has been our so-called transformation program,
meaning to grow traditional business with less resources and show to increase the
funding potential for creating new business models. And with regard to new business
models, we have already reported in the last quarters that this is running quite smoothly
and that there is roughly a handful of such business models already productive, so really
producing premium income and also results, but still at low scale, they are now scaling up
and it will take some years realistically to really report what the full business and earnings
potential of these business models will be.
ERGO, on the right hand side of that slide, you can see has finished or completed very
successfully and very quickly, it's so called divestment program in its international
organization divesting from mainly sub-critical businesses of marginal relevance and what
ERGO has instead achieved is they have strengthened very materially their market
positioning in the Indian market. So, via our purchasing 51% of Apollo Munich Health
Insurance, HDFC now is also the partner of ERGO in the private health insurers' arena and
if you look into a probable second step of this evolution. So, after emerge of these two
carriers, then the combined carrier would stand for 8.2% market share in private health
insurance in India, reflecting number two market position and number three overall, if we
also include the P&C business or health plus P&C, reflecting a 6% -- 6.4% market share.
That's very, very interesting.

FINAL

Otherwise, the group focus on transforming, digitizing, and growing business profitably is
paying off fully and delivering increased earnings and at half-time of our three years
program, we have fully met our expectations so far. And thanks to the -- I would call it, the
new business and the earnings momentum that has been established in the last two
years, our confidence level into 2019, but also beyond into 2020 of delivering even further
increasing results is higher now, again, then it was at the beginning of the program.
This is something that doesn't easily translate into vendors, but the confidence level is
higher. And our ambition is to compare with our international reinsurance peers and our
international Europe-based primary insurance peers such that we are among the top
three, when it comes to total shareholder return comparison.
And when you look at slide six of the presentation, then you can see since the 1st of
January 2018 since we look at these numbers and since we have committed to this, we
are in the top three position. And I admit that this time period is a very short one, what is
18 month, but I will have to hide these numbers for another five years to 10 years. To show
you longer time periods, I thought, from now on we're going to show it to you. And as it
stands, it looks nice.
With regard to our outlook 2019, we have kept everything unchanged. And with this
introduction, I'd like to hand over to Christoph, who is going to give you more details.
Thank you.

Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Thank you, Joachim, and, well, good afternoon from my side as well. As usual, I will only
give some personnel opening remarks and I will not lead you through the presentation,
before we go to Q&A. As Joachim already mentioned, after six months Munich Re is well
underway to meet its targets for the full year 2019. We did pre-release already a few
weeks ago our strong consolidated result of EUR993 million in Q2, which was helped by
low major losses and by high reserve releases in reinsurance. On top of that, I'd like to
underline that also ERGO achieved a very pleasing result.
Now, let's look into the details. Starting with the investment result in Q2, the ROI amounts
to a solid 3.1% and support our guidance for the full year, very, very nicely. On top of that,
our unrealized gains increased significantly, not only in the fixed income area, but also on
equities. We'd use our cash position and continue to actively manage the low interest rate
environment and thereby achieved a reinvestment yield of 2.2%, which increased even
slightly compared to the first quarter. Nevertheless, we still think that the ROI for 2019,
achieving the target ROI for 2019 continues to be challenging. And we also think that it's
more likely that we will have to round up to achieve the forecast of 3% and to round
down. This is, of course, due to the falling interest rates, but more importantly, also due to
the -- our current expectations regarding the realization of valuation reserves and also our
expectations with respect to the net balance of derivatives.
Now, let's go to life and health reinsurance, in Q2 actually life and health re, we had a
weak quarter in terms of the technical result. The ongoing negative experience in our

Page 3 of 22

FINAL

Australian business includes debt write off due to the recently introduced protect your
super legislation, which has been implemented more widely than we originally assumed
when we, for the first time, took a hit on our debt already in Q4 last year. Now, we do not
expect any further debt write down from this change legislation for the rest of the year,
unless the legislation changes again.
Still in Australia, we continue to observe heavy claims experience in disability business.
Our priority remains to work with our clients to rehabilitate the existing portfolio. But for
the coming quarters, we must expect an ongoing higher earnings volatility. In Canada, on
the other hand, the reduction in technical earnings is caused by the shortening of our
duration in the asset portfolio. And this has been now largely accomplished. The
mentioned reduction in the technical earnings was more than compensated for by a
positive impact on the investment result. So here we are more speaking about the shift of
result then of an actual reduction.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now looking at Life Re overall, Life and Health Re overall. Depending on the experience in
the remainder of the year and obviously also on the outcome of the annual reserve
review, we see a substantial risk that we will fall short of our 500 million guidance for the
technical result plus fee income in 2019. This risk is less pronounced for the operating and
net income due to the mentioned beneficial effect of the Canadian duration, shortening
on the investment result in the first half.
Now looking at P&C reinsurance we recorded a very good combined ratio of 87.7
percentage points in and also the result has been really very good. This was as
mentioned already mainly due a combination of very low -- large nut-cut and also the low
man-made claims totaling 4.1 percentage points only in the combined ratio. But
furthermore, there was also a range of effects which I think in a high release of basic loss
reserve of 7.3 percentage points.
On the one hand, we successfully disposed of non-core books which we had
conservatively reserved for. And on the other hand, for the actual versus expected loss
development, in some lines of business are so favorable that we felt it would be justified
or even necessary to release some of the conservativism into the P&L already now,
without and that's important without compromising our reserve strength.
On a normalized basis, the combined ratio amounted to 98.9%, once more driven by
adverse claims development in our North American Risk Solutions business and by
seasonality effects. Also, this is still above our expectations. This is an improvement
compared to Q1, so there is a positive trend. And then we see the underlying profitability
of our growth initiatives remaining sound. We still consider a level closer to 98% to be a
realistic ambition for the full year 2019.
Now looking at the renewals to -- it for the July 2019, the recent market recovery
continued. In particular, there was a significant improvement in prices for reinsurance
cover in markets affected by natural catastrophes. However, and as you know, the
calculation of price changes as we do it, takes into the consideration increases in loss

FINAL

expectations, in all the markets across the globe where we do expect some higher losses
in the future.
And it also includes stable renewals in unaffected regions and markets. So overall prices
rose in July by 0.5% and the premium volume was up by 9%. Looking at these figures, we
are very happy that we continue to grow into this hardening market. Now coming to
ERGO, with net earnings of EUR135 million in Q2 ERGO posted a strong result above the
expected quarterly run rate.
The profit of 220 million for the first six month is fully in line with the ERGO ambition of
400 million net result for the full year. In life and health, Germany, the net result benefited
from good investment result, as well as from a higher shareholder profit participation. In
P&C, Germany, the segment amounted to a very good 80.6% combined ratio, and large
losses remained below average expectations in the top of that -- and that's something
which is even more important in my view will be benefited a lot from the overall favorable
claims experience across more or less all of our books.

Bloomberg Transcript

On top of that, we have the usual seasonal fluctuations in premiums in the first half of the
year, which regularly leads to a negative impact in Q1 and a positive effect in Q2. And this
progress, I think that now in Q2 with net earned premiums now being having increased
over proportionally.
Finally, the international business of ERGO also delivered the combined ratio fully in line
with our ambitions of 95% for Q2, and as announced earlier, the sale of our entity in
Turkey resulted in a double-digit or concretely 39 million negative impact on the
segment's net income. For the half year, ERGO overcompensated by more than 60
million of negative impact from the now finalized portfolio optimization of ERGO
International, which even more shows how strong the 220 million result for the half year of
ERGO is.
Now I come back to the outlook. As stated by you Joachim, the outlook for the remainder
of the year is unchanged, so we stick to the figures we had in the Annual Report 2018 and
more confident to achieve this target now after the first half year then at the beginning of
the year, given that we already achieved 1.6 billion at half year.
With that, I'd like to conclude my opening remarks and I'm of course very happy to take
your questions in our upcoming Q&A.

Unidentified Speaker
Yeah. Thank you, gentlemen. We can then go into Q&A right away. As always, my usual
remark, please limit the number of your questions to two per person in order to give
everybody a fair chance to ask questions on this call.

Questions And Answers

FINAL

(Operator Instructions) We will now take our first question from Vikram Gandhi of Societe
Generale. Please go ahead.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon everybody. Couple of questions from my side. Firstly, it's really
pleasing to see you feel confident about the 2020 net income target despite the sharp
falling yields. My question would be, what level of interest rates, in your view, would start
putting pressure on that target? So that's question number one. Secondly, I appreciate
that the results of ERGO International were impacted by the loss on sale of the Turkish
business, but it still appears that this is undershooting its target run rate. So it would be
great if you can share what good and what would really change going forward on that
business?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Vikram, Thank you very much for the questions. The interest rate level, obviously, did
reduce a lot. And on the very long run, clearly, this is a concern. On the short and midterm,
though, and that's -- I think what I already emphasized before as well. We have other
levers, which much more influence on our net income compared to the reinvestment
yields we can achieve in the current market environment. This would be, for example,
assumptions, how much gains are we able to realize how much unrealized gains are we
able to transfer into realized gains and then also the result on our derivatives. If you look
at our Q2 figures, you will see that, for example, on equities, be nearly benefited at all
from the positive market development in the half year because we did not realize the
gains, but recorded the losses on the derivatives completely in our results. So if you want
the wavered our income in the first half of the year was very conservative.
On the other hand, this means that if we would realize a little bit more. Of course, we
would be able to compensate lower reinvestment yields on the short and mid-term as
just what I said. And therefore, I'm very optimistic that our target for this year, but also for
next year will be unaffected by the actual interest rate environment. The second question
on ERGO International. I'm not sure if I completely understood the question. So I mean,
Turkey, we are close to closing this chapter. And then on top of that, we are really very
optimistic to continue with profitability, like what we currently have. This is, of course,
depending on the market cycle. We are -- and specifically, in Poland, we see some signs
that the cycle might deteriorate going forward. But other than that, and that's also
something you could see if you -- what you see looking into our presentation on the Q2
figures, you will see that the cost of Altior international books are all showing combined
ratio still below 100 of them even below 90. So that's a very stable and profitable
environment we are in.

Sorry, if I can just come back, my question really was, even after accounting for the loss on
the sale of Turkish business in Q2, it appears that the business is still achieving below the
target run rate on a quarterly basis. So my question really was even netting out for this
one-off, it appears as if there's still more to do and more to come, most likely from this
business? And what could do it I mean, this results already include the ready to combined
ratios that you highlighted. So that was my question.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Now the 95% is completely in the target. When I look at the combined
ratio. And if you look at net income, you have to keep in mind that it's not only EUR 9
billion on Turkey, but also already in Q1, we had a EUR 22 million negative one-off due to
the sale of other operations in the course of the portfolio optimization. So the negative
one-off is EUR 60 million roughly, which ERGO International had to bear in the first half of
the year. If you would adapt the figures for that effect, ERGO International would be
clearly in line with our expectations or even a little bit ahead.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Okay, thanks very much.

We will now take our next question from Andrew Ritchie of Autonomous. Please go
ahead.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi, there. One easy one and one hard one, I think, the easy one, what is the risk-adjusted
price change. So you've given us the risk-adjusted renewals rate change, what would be
the nominal rate change before taking in account of higher loss costs for July and year-todate, if possible? On ERGO Life, I guess, where the situation now, presumably, where
there could be quite a big divergence in the direction of economic earnings, which are
clearly under pressure versus nominal IFRS earnings, is it actually the case that your IFRS
earnings may -- earnings power of that business may be going higher because you're
having to realize more games now to continue, I think, to state appreciate as I said our
addition is lessened by the new corridor approach, but as interest rates fall, that goes up
again. So I guess, maybe just some help on the IFRS profit generation of the life business.
And I think it's the case of the run rate maybe higher, which obviously feels
counterintuitive, given where the interest rate environment is going to help us there
would be helpful. Thanks.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yes, any I would completely concur with you. The first one is the easy one, the second is
the difficult one. On the easy one, I'm sorry, I cannot give you an answer. We only have in
our system, these claims adjusted risk-adjusted figures. And we would have to go back
into each single treaty to find out what the cost price increase would have been. And
that's not something we regularly do. So actually, we don't know, and I'm not able to give
you that figure. But you can see how deeply in our DNA, this is risk-adjusted steering and
Page 7 of 22

Company Ticker: M UV2 GR Equity
Date: 2019-08-07

FINAL

pricing is incorporated, but we would not even know the nominal price increase. So maybe
this gives you an indication how we look at things. Now coming to evolve ERGO Life,
ERGO Life, indeed, there is a disconnect between economic earnings and IFRS.
And that is one of the reasons I will looking forward to get IFRS '17 because the disconnect
can only be can only be smaller. I'm not sure if it would be fully closed, but at least, it can
be only smaller. What happened actually is that we got a new methodology for the
calculation of the sets that our last year, which is called the corridor method. And this
change in methodology, independently of the interest rate level, led to the effect that we
now have to build only roughly 1/3 of the amount, which we would have to have built given
the old methodology. And this effect is much bigger than the change in interest rate.

Bloomberg Transcript

Therefore, we now will realize for our life books in tendency less than in the past. Now
you'll ask why it has resulted higher than that? Well, some of the reason is that we did our
homework. And in the course of the process, when we discussed, if you were to dispose
of our life books or not. And I think we commented on that already some times, we
deeply analyzed how we could improve the in force management, improve the way we
manage the book overall, we separated it from the new business.
All those activities we implemented came along also with an in depth analysis, how we
can increase the shareholder return out of these books for and as a result, some of the
shareholder ratios could be increased. And we did some of that last year already. And this
was done in Q3 last year. So it's not fully earned full yet. So if you compare our figures
now compared to prior year, there's still effect from that. On top of that, in Life & Health,
we had a kind of one-off. I'm not sure if one of us will be wide work here because we also
increased the shareholder share on our health business in Germany. And this is not
because some sense accounting methodology because what's happening there is that
we more and more are focusing our business not on supplementary health insurance,
where the rules are not as tight as for the competitor we cover in Germany, which gives
you more levy to give the shareholder higher benefits from the overall earnings amount
you're making in that business.
And we now over in a situation that we were -- given the development, which is ongoing
for many years already, but it has been so pronounced that we now have to also change
the IFRS assumptions according to the shift in business mix. And therefore, an effect of
roughly EUR 30 million now in Q2 is maybe kind of one-off due to has changed
assumption in health. So overall, yes, Life & Health continues to be complex. Also the
difference is due to economic earnings are indeed, not easy to explain, not easy to
understand. And as such we can only get better with IFRS 17.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Sorry, just to be a, you wouldn't anticipate the shareholder participation ratios is coming

appears to be 12 months only on the total target?

We will now take our next question from James Shuck of Citi. Please go ahead.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, good afternoon. First question around the new money yield, please? So the Q2
reinvestment rate, 2.2%. What is the current reinvestment rate, please? And can you just
shed a little bit light on what you're buying and whether you would consider buying
negative yielding assets in the current environment? Just looking out to 2020 as well,
should we sort of expect a return on investment of around 3%. Obviously, the current
yield will trend down, but would you look to supplement that with realized gains to
maintain it broadly while the high 2s or close to 3 kind of level? That's the first question.
Secondly, on the nat cat exposure. If I look at your P&Ls, at least through 2018, there's
been quite a big increase in U.S. hurricane in relation to your tangible book value. When I
look at the renewals, it doesn't seem as if it's already coming through in the PC Re
premium, at least when I look at the nat cat premium as a percent of the PC Re level. So
could you just add a little bit of light in terms of what's happening around the U.S.
hurricane exposure, what incremental capital have you actually deployed in that area yearto-date, that would be very helpful. Thank you.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yes. Well, the most recent reinvestment figure we have, actually, is the 2.2% for the
healthy quarter two. What did we do to achieve that? First of all, I think it's important to
notice that we really do not reinvest a lot of our money short-term because the duration is
far along, which clearly helped. Our investment activities are concentrated on
diversification. We try to go more into illiquid titles as we did in the past. We have some
geographic diversification, having some more corporate bonds also. So diversify a little bit
more into the investment universe, wherever it makes sense. And thereby, we were able
to achieve this 2.2. You also should not forget that we are reinvesting to a certain extent,
outside of the Jerusalem, to large extent, also outside the Jerusalem wherever interest
rates are also higher.
Also given our U.S. investments. So that this is basically what's happening there. And going
forward, we'll continue to make the best out of a really poor market situation, but I'd like
to highlight again what I already said before, don't overestimate the impact of
reinvestment on our -- on a short-term meaning 1 or 2-year basis. Now to -- coming to nat
cat and specifically the hurricane exposure as a relation to the renewals. I can confirm that
we somewhat increased our hurricane exposure although magnitude would not be big,
maybe 5%, something like that so not a game changer at all. But where we were able to
generate very good and interesting rates. We were open to increase our proportion of
Page 9 of 22

Date: 2019-08-07

FINAL

our stake in the business. Now your question was, why don't you see more of that in the
renewal figures and the price change of 0.5%.
Well, you have to be aware of the fact that in this July renewal, the U.S. business is, of
course, included. But by far not the largest part, we have roughly 30%, even a little bit
lower of different newlin the U.S. And then even in the U.S., it's casualty, its properties. It's
different business lines. Some of them are proportional other IXL. And therefore, adding
all these different pieces up there is a relatively large dilution effect. If you compare what
we are seeing on nat cat with what you hear from other players, I can confirm you that we
see absolutely the same development in the market. So as we've been commenting
before, price increases in loss-affected business, this is something we absolutely see as
well. But then looking at our overall portfolio, the figure gets diluted, as I said.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Can I just very quickly just circle back on the new money yield, EUR 2.2 million in Q2, it must
be around 1.5 or so now, what one would think. Are you actually buying negative yielding
assets, single a covered bonds, these sorts of things, or are you starting to think about
alternative asset classes, trying to diversify out of that or indeed changing the risk profile?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

So overall, our risk profile has been stable and whether Q4, I've been commenting that
we feel very comfortable with your one risk profile. So we have no plans of changing our
risk profile overall. Does this I mean, does this mean that we are not at all looking for one
of the other security with a total waiting or something. No, we would be looking into this,
of course, but the overall risk appetite is unchanged. And yes, of course, we also bisect
negative yield because in this environment is unavoidable. And the overall mix will not
change so much. As I said, the reinvestment volume is rather limited, and that's what
gives us a certain leeway, how to cope with this overall not so pleasing situation.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi there, Just two for me, please. One on P&C Re and one on Life and Health. So P&C Re,
it's the usual question about the normalized combined ratio of rate. So you've not missed
that guidance over the last 10 quarters. And I appreciate that the normalized combined
ratio is clearly simplistic and that you often encourage is not to place too much emphasis
on this ratio. But given this is now a clear and prolonged trend. At what point does this
become a concern fee, meaning that you feel the need to take more action, particularly
around the North America risk book? And then secondly, on Life and Health Re, is the
action that you're going to take on the Australian disability book through the rest of this

year aimed at bringing you back to sort of run rate of EUR 500 million technical result, or
is it to bring it to a higher level?

FINAL

A - Christoph Jurecka

I'll start with P&C Re, the famous normalized combined ratio. I mean, first of all, what
you're saying, like the trend continued. I'm not even sure what trend did you actually mean
because at least we have a trend that the normalized come ratio goes down, admittedly,
not down to the level we were expecting before. We are now in Q2 at 98.9, but at least
already, that's at 98, which is better than where we were Q1 is there of any concern for us.
Basically, that has been your question. And in a sense that we are implementing measures
in that sense, it clearly is a concern and has already been for some time already last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

So actions have been taken. And this is the reason why we are still positive that we will get
closer to the 98% until the end of the year. Now what has been the actions it's different
things. If I look at on the reinsurance side, which clearly is also depicted in the normalized
combined ratio. There are various effects, we, of course, have the price changes from the
last couple of renewals, we have also growth which will help by diluting the cost base
we're having. We have cost measures, as you know, having been implemented. This all
should then help us get normalized combined ratio go down going forward. And then we
have the West Solutions business in the U.S. And here again, also rate increases, we have
been working on rate increases quite some time.
As you might be aware, there has to be a filing for rate increases in some of the U.S.
states at least. So it takes some time and you get the approval, and then it takes some
time until you re-underwrite the portfolio. All these measures are underway, but it will take
time until they fully take effect in the specific book we are talking about. On top of that,
we have also some growth in that area of our business. And then in some portfolios, we
also took corrective measures in the sense, cleaning the portfolio, we are underwriting
and various measures of that kind. All in all, this should lead us, as I said, to a combined
ratio, much closer to the 98 million. And I'm as curious as you to see in Q3 and then in Q4,
how close we can get to the 98.

A - Joachim Wenning

{BIO 16273429 <GO>}

Okay. This is Joachim. Let me take the Australia question on Life Book. I think our actions
that we are taking, now they are primarily targeted at keeping the gap between actual
losses and expected losses, very limited. So to manage the downside of this. This is an
exercise that is ongoing. And I think, purely financially, and from a pure accounting
perspective between now and the year-end valuation, we want to have the best possible
understanding of what the most recent legislation would probably or possibly mean in
terms of future loss expectations. Now that will then be taken into account in 2019,
beyond 2019 then in 2020, '21, '22 and so on. The Australian, the Australian run rate
should be unaffected by the 2019 one-off. And even before the contribution of the
Australian Life book to the total EUR 500 million of Life and Health was immaterial. That
means once 2019 has cleaned the surface, the effects beyond 2019 should be very
limited, and the underlying trend in the Life business outside Australia is a positive one,
like EUR 500 million and then increasing over time.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. Just maybe sticking on Australia for a little while,
was there anything new in this quarter in terms of changes to your actual best estimate
view of the situation and the claims development there? Was there any impact on, I
guess, on the summer's two position or the economic position of that business? I mean,
also, would you be able to tell us actually how much to track from Australia and what the
technical result would look without it? Number one. and then number two, slightly bigger
picture question. You talked about increasing productivity in the traditional P&C
reinsurance business. Could you just elaborate a little bit on that? Is that just -- are you just
referring to the cost measures that you're taking there, or are there some other actions
as well, but you're taking. I don't think you report the admin expense ratio anymore
separately. Could you just give an update on how you're progressing there?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Joachim Wenning

{BIO 16273429 <GO>}

Thank you. I'm happy to take both questions. So what's new in Australia Life. Let me start
making care what's not new. So you know that we have a legacy book, which has -- back in
2011 for the first time and then another time in 2013 caused some issues, which we then
reflected due to via reserve strengthenings. So that legacy book is still there and is in runoff, if you want. And that runoff now this year has seen higher-than-expected losses.
That's not fundamentally new, but it's, if you like, an adverse development in that current
year 2019, and that is one part of the deterioration. What's really new is legislation, and
legislation, which in a nutshell is facilitating adverse lapsation of policyholders and to take
that into account and to try to quantify of how much of this will impact the future losses or
reduced the embedded value of the remaining portfolio. That's a very difficult exercise,
frankly, with quite some uncertainty into it. And that is exactly the exercise that is
outstanding that we want to finish between now and year-end evaluation. So at this point,
we cannot possibly give you a quantification of its impact. Otherwise, we would have
done so. Your second question.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Again, can I just follow up on the first one, just to clarify, so you're actually -- you're actually
looking at changing the best estimate numbers. This is not just the usual sort of issue that
you get sometimes in Life and Health reinsurance, where you get the actual versus
expected, that's adverse and ongoing?

A - Joachim Wenning

We are reviewing our best estimates, correct?

To your second question, which is P&C related and production and productivity related. So
production means like how is it evolving? How is top line evolving? How is business growth
going? And the business growth is there. So the business is growing, and more
importantly than just growing, it's growing exactly in the targeted regions and in the
targeted lines of business. That is so important to us because growing just broadly is not
an art, the art is to very selectively grow into the areas where you believe that the return
for the risk that you take is attractive. So that is nice, that is production increase.
Productivity is with regard to our resource reductions. So the growing business doesn't
require increasing resources on the country, we have been able to reduce resources while
we were growing, and this is what we mean by productivity or efficiency gains. Okay. I
could quantify them. We did that. I think last year, when we said between 2018 and 2020,
we wanted to take out more than EUR 200 million of admin expenses.

We will now take our next question from Kamran Hossain of RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi, two questions. First one is just on the risk solutions, your commentary in your
presentation talks about adverse claims development. Could you maybe give us a little bit
more color on the quantum of impact on what sounds like it is reserved to serration
hundred quantum? And then will it involve? The second question, just to come back to the
normalized combined ratio. At what point do we start to adjust it to increase a level of
reserve releases, which is above 4%. It sounds from, again, from your commentary, your
baking in plenty of surplus and the level has been above 4% through to 2011. So that, to
me, is a pretty long-term trend. So any indications or ideas around that would be helpful.
Thank you.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Thank you, Kamran. Risk Solutions, I would say there's 3 aspects we have to keep in mind.
First of all, there's the usual seasonality, which is not critical at all. And that's something we
always, for example, in Q2, some time others. So that this is completely in line with our
expectations. And clearly, also no measures to necessary there. Then we have larger
losses, but below our threshold of EUR 10 million. And some of them are at bit luck now
but now after so many quarters, we clearly also and some time ago, when we start to
look into the underwriting and about the business mix. And if collective measure needs to
be taken there.

That's the second aspect. And then we have some limited books, where also the core
profitability is not high enough so that repricing or re-underwriting exercises are underway
there. So it's a little bit a mix of various topics. But as I said, measures have all been taken
and we should get closer to the EUR 98 million as already said before. Now your second
question on the normalization of the 4%. I actually love that question, I must say. I mean,
we had a lot of discussions around this normalization in because in the last couple of
quarters. And then also in meeting with you guys, 1 or the other, at least, also were
regularly, we did have discussions. And my commentary also was that this normalization
we are doing is by far to simple to be really meaningful in a sense.
But on the other hand, it's transparent enough because all the parameters also simple to
crap. It's really easy. And the answer I got for many of you and also from other people I've
been talking to is please stick to the simple world, because it's much more transparent
and easier to explain anyway and we anyway will add our judgment on top of the
normalization you're doing. And as the 4% is something, which is an integral part of this
normalization exercise, I do not have it all. Independency to change this 4% right now
because you will anyway make out of it, whatever do you think is appropriate. And talking
to you, I think many of you already have quite a good understanding what the 4% mean?

We will now take our next question from Farooq Hanif of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. Good afternoon. You commented on the areas that you're releasing
reserves and because you just thought they were far too good and you still remain well
reserved after releasing. Can you give us some idea of which business areas they are?
And whether you now feel you're in the right position or there could be depending on
experience some more part as it were to reduce? And then coming back to the question
about your P&C Re growing in the right areas. You seem to also suggest that this
reduction in resources in the traditional business is being reinvested into new business
areas. So clearly, we're talking here presumably about partnerships or fiber. Can you give
us a sense of the growth there and the proportion of your business and kind of a
trajectory that you see -- at what stage are you going to be talking about this much more
meaningfully. Thank you.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

So I'll take the first question on reserving. Actually, I don't think I can give you a clear
answer, which books are effectively because there's not a pattern or anything at all to be
to be visible here. As part of our usual quarterly closing process, we go over all of our
books, and we have a very intensive actual versus expected controlling with respect to
claims payments and we're looking into all our books. And at this time, the outcome of
this exercise was just that in some of these books, we had to take measures already
earlier. So we did that. Now going forward, our current assumption is, as always, 4% for
the quarters to come. But can I rule out that we will have similar observations like we in Q2
now in the other quarters as well, though I cannot rule that out. But clearly, the assumption

Page 14 of 22



Company N ame: M uenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG in M uenchen

for the rest of the year is 4%. As the assumption for the full year was already 4%, so
nothing has changed there.

FINAL

A - Joachim Wenning

{BIO 16273429 <GO>}

Yes. With regard to your second question of limiting or saving resources on the one hand
and investing into new business models and the other so first of all, what is important is
it's not that exactly the amount that we are saving resources on the traditional side, is
exactly the amount that we are investing into new business models. It is just
philosophically, on the one hand side, we are divesting, on the other side, we are
investing. That is the meaning of the transformation program. To be even clearer if we
didn't saw any good investment opportunity, we would also be happy only to resource
reduce -- resources on one hand side and not make any investment or if we saw 10x
more and higher investment opportunities, we will be willing to make these investments
for the sake of good new business.

Bloomberg Transcript

So just to make clear, it's not an exact one side equals the other. You asked for what type
of investments are we undertaking. Well, first of all, the size of the investments per annum
they happen to be around EUR 100 million per annum or above that. So it's not EUR 500
million, it's not EUR 10 million either. It's EUR 100 million plus, I would say, for the time
being. And part of that money has been going into building an IT infrastructure, data
infrastructure, which we didn't need for traditional, but which we need for new business
models. That's one side. And the other is for self Building value propositions, which we
then offer distribution or primary risk areas to enable their businesses. Or in partnering
with start-up companies, where we just plug our risk area, value proposition into their
distribution platforms. Broadly, I think that's it.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

And any sort of sense of the kind of the -- these partnerships, for example?

A - Joachim Wenning

{BIO 16273429 <GO>}

You mean -- you said the Cyber?

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

The Cyber and also the size of the -- and the volume of revenue that you're getting from
these partnerships, for example.

A - Joachim Wenning

{BIO 16273429 <GO>}

Okay. So if you -- let me give you rounded figures. So in Cyber insurance/reinsurance, we
have roughly a 10% market share worldwide, and that is a little less than EUR 0.5 billion of
premium income per annum. That is where we are standing. And we are pretty much
growing with the market roughly with a market share of 10%. It's a little less than EUR 0.5
billion, but let's round this figure. And the -- and some of the other new business models,
which are the partnership models they are roughly producing another EUR 0.5 billion of
our a little less at this point in time. So if you want to take the sum of all of that, then
roughly EUR 1 billion comes from new risks, new business models, top line.

We will now take our next question from Ivan Bokhmat of Barclays. Please go ahead.

Q - Ivan Bokhmat

{BIO 15378004 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon. I've got a question on the P&C re and the pricing outlook. What a lot
of your peers have indicated that the price momentum has been accelerating through the
year. For you, the July renewals showed a bit smaller price increases. And in fact, if I apply
the price increases you've gotten that January, April and July for 2019. I think the blended
increase is smaller than you got last year. So I'm just wondering how you think in that view
of the 2020 combined ratio improvement? And what should be driving that? And then
secondly, perhaps just a follow-up on the first question asked. In terms of the riskadjusted price increase? Maybe you could give kind of a qualitative argument or Ultivo and
what regions and lines of business, did your view of risk change most.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yes, pricing outlook. Actually, I don't think we see a totally different market out there than
our options to -- we see a slight upward trend in pricing, generally. And given that we have
the biggest booking that we are ever were more or less. You see some dilution effects.
And this is kind of natural, so no problem at all. And of course, we enjoy the positive
tailwind from that price increase. What happened is that we have various reasons why we
think this tailwind will continue also in the upcoming months, that has a lot to do with the
U.S. business, also with the primary business is there, then the claims experience, we
were seeing in that market, specifically the last two years. The continued loss creep we
have in the Japanese market, for example, all these things some limitations on is on retail,
where capital is still there, but some of it might be locked in all these kind of things all
together make a market environment, which we think is slightly more positive than it has
been a year ago or two years ago.
But then again, we have a big book. There's a lot of proportional cover in it as well. It's not
all XL. And then by really having significant increases in some markets, especially the lossaffected ones, we end up with a figure, which is 0.5% of your overall book. And of course,
the good point in that is that the resilience when market would go down again, it's also
higher. But on the other hand, being the largest player. It takes much more time. And for
us to show a higher price increase rates than what we're currently doing. So no concern
from our side. And actually, our qualitative assessment is that this renewal has been a very
good one. So your second question was with regard to where has our risk view changed.
Interesting question. Difficult question. I would say, broadly, it has broadly, it has not
changed. And the risk view has not changed. What is, of course, constantly evolving is our
view on how attractive or sufficient or the rates being paid for certain risks. And there is a
few areas where this has evolved over time. But frankly, I will feel very, very unhappy to
talk about that in this broad audience because this is of quite some competitive
relevance.

We will now take our next question from Frank Koffinger of Deutsche Bank. Please go
ahead.

Q - Frank Koffinger
Good afternoon, everybody. I have two questions. My first question is also coming on
apologies on the normalized combined ratio. So when you originally introduced your
combined ratio targets. I think you did not factor in price increases. Now that we saw
some price increases. Last year, we see some this year, you also initiated some cost
initiatives in are insurance operations. However, your normalized level is still close to the
99% level. And the simple question is how happy can you overall give with this
development? And where are really the drivers going forward to push the combined ratio
down. And then secondly, on your German Life & Health business, I was surprised to see a
negative currency effect there. So it's a German business, which was quite substantial with
EUR 45 million. Can you comment on where this is coming from?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Frank, I'll take both of them. To answer the first question, my
personal happiness depends much more on our net income than on a normalized
combined ratio. So your question was how happy can we be with a normalized combined
ratio, I think we can. But anyway, our happiness is not so much relying on the normalized
combined ratio. The concept in itself as it flows, as you know. And topics like reserve
movement and so on are only to some limited extent, really correctly captured in that. On
top of that, when we took defined targets. We always said that the combined ratio has
not the same relevance like the net income but at the same time of quest, you're right,
we did not incorporate any price increases back then when we did the calculation, but as
always, there are many moving parts, when you make a multi-year plan for a company.
We also did not incorporate interest rate movements or equity market development. So
there are many moving parts. And I think we can be very happy where the net income
currently stands. And in the normalized combined ratio, also the trend starts lower figures.
So the trend here is also trending so overall, I think we are making good progress here.
Life & Health, the currency effect, our ITest German business, so it can only have to do it
has only to do with the investment results, these companies are delivering. You know that
a major part of our assets is allocated to these 2 segments, and they have some
investments outside of the European Union outside of the Eurozone, and therefore, they
are affected by currency movements.
Now the floor we have in the way we do the accounting here is that this currency effect is
not shown as part of the investment without what should have been shown, but very low
on the single line in the P&L and what you also have to keep in mind that the absolute
figure looks very big. But if immediately, if you would look on the local GAAP basis into
these books. The policyholder share would they are a major part of the currency losses

only the way we have to show it under IFRS is somewhat a little bit strange.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you. Several topics have been addressed. Just
one topic, overall, if I can now ask is this -- and you mentioned that the one reason why
you have confidence for 2020, despite low rates or interest petite use of the balance
sheet. Now there is the reserves, there are the underlying gains, but these come at some
kind of a cost Esentai man, if you, for example, realize too many games, then you get
lower future investment income. So as a management team, how comfortable or how do
you view these things? And the reason I ask is about in the past, I remember
conversations have been different, have been more like a uniquely, why don't you realize
all games as so many of them there? And is -- how do you view this balance sheet levers
in order of importance in order of strategic importance or do you think that they are
already unnecessary? Just any commentary to help us understand how you view these
would be very appreciated.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Thank you, Vinit. That's something we could talk about for hours, probably a very
interesting question. We won't -- I can promise. Well, I mean, first of all, I think we never
that we were going to use our balance sheet for achieving our target next year. Because
you also have to keep in mind, we are looking at a steady state here. So we are also
refilling our P&C reserves as we speak and that you release some out of it. And I have
been highlighting already before that the reserve strength overall is unchanged this
quarter, like it was at year-end. Therefore, I would also this quarter not speak of a use of
the balance sheet, and I would continue to say so also going forward.
The -- yes, the second question, the -- we -- the reserves we have on the balance sheet. I
mean, I talked about P&C a little we also have, of course, plenty of them on the asset
side. And if you want now in Q2, we did even built them up further because we could have
realized much more gains in equities than we did. But we took only the loss on the
derivatives on equities, which we hold to hedge the equity exposure, but we did not
realize the same amount of equity. So if you want, we didn't even build up the reserves on
our balance sheet. So it is the opposite of using it. We did not use it. But we will build it up
in Q2. And I understand your question in a sense like how much buffer do we want to build
up. And I mean, I don't think that the release is a very simple answer to that.
But looking at the volatility we have at the equity market at this stage. And then the
discussion we had before on the ROI and the potential implication on the return on

investment. Going forward, now that the fact that we have negative input rates in so many
geographies already. I feel kind of confident that also on the asset side, we have been
not as pushy as we could have been in realizing gains. And I mean, to having the privilege
to show already very good result and excellent result and at the same time, having built
up reserves on the balance sheet. I mean, there could be any better place for CFO to be
at. And therefore, my happiness to come back to that very much live with having a good
result and at the same at the same time, a strengthened balance sheet.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Can I just ask one more but I did have to -- two, sorry. In the P&C, so we saw very strong
growth in 2018, and we talked about it the U.S. initiative on regional growth over the last
year, for example. But this year, the growth has kind of it mellowed and they could be
because of the base effect, but then renewals are still 6, 7 may YTD that kind of range,
8% maybe 7% on YTD volume. When shall we expect this to come in with towards the end
of the year in the P&C Re growth please? Hello.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Vinit? I'm not sure if I'll answer the question correctly, but I think your point was that growth
was a little bit more limited this year compared to last year. And this might have been true
that we have been more selective, but we never said that we would just take ever piece
of business, we could potentially take. And therefore, I think that there's nothing specific
to comment on here. As I said, with the renewal and plus 9% of premiums, we are very
happy. And on top of that, last year was maybe also augmented to certain amount by
some large deals, but nothing really to be observed here.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. No, my point was the renewals have been running higher this year than the growth
we have seen this year in the GWB of P&C Re. So maybe there is -- maybe will come in
later or?

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

I'm not what sure what will come later?

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

2% premium growth now, so we see them next year maybe?

A - Christoph Jurecka

Yes, there's always kind of a delay. So yes, you are right. But also the premium level will be
up. So that's a certain delay of course, yes.

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Okay, thank you for taking my questions. A couple of things. I just wondered if you could
quantify on low rates. I know we've sort of danced around this topic. But can you tell us
what the current yield to maturity is on the fixed income portfolio? And if rates stay where
they are today, what is the sort of year-on-year headwind that you face for your
investment income all else constant. And the second question is sort of linked to low
rates, thinking about it more as an opportunity, obviously, you have quite significant debt
capacity. I wonder if with rates where they are today, does it make you any more likely to
think about acquisitions or maybe using some of that debt capacity on your balance sheet
to enhance ROE a little bit?

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, thank you very much for the questions. I think the first question was the attrition if the
investment yields would stay where they are, how much or how I would potentially go
down then. And clearly, there's not a single-tool answer because of the various effects to
be to be kept in mind here. So as I said before, the result on derivatives, the realization.
We are going to have anyway because the high amount of unrealized gains we now have
result in just higher realization due to the fact that you cannot touch any single security
we're having without realizing gains because all of them are carrying unrealized gains now.
But in a very simple terms, our duration is around 8 9, 10 depending on the books we are
looking at and then the difference currently between our in-force asset book and the
investment yield, maybe it's 0.8 maybe 1 percentage point, that order of magnitude. So
by doing the simple back-of-the-envelope calculation, you come to an attrition of maybe
10 basis points per year. But which, as I said, will be offset by countering measures like
also higher investments and illiquid investments like other topics we are looking into
currently and then as I said, the higher realizations. So overall, as I said, short term, a very
limited effect. And on the long term, it will have higher impact. Second question is the
debt capacity. We have capacity for more debt, that's not new. It's got cheaper now, even
cheaper than it was already a year ago.
On the other hand, as you know we have restrictions on local GAAP equalization reserves
and so forth. So, therefore, it's not straightforward to change the financing structure we
are currently having. I would be happy to have more debt in case these restrictions would
not have been here, but they are. And then I cannot get off the hook from them.
Therefore, at this stage, I don't think we'll -- there's room for any other action. What
continues to be true is that we think we have enough room for strategic opportunities.
And if opportunity might come up, then we would be very happy to take them. But that's
more or less independently of the interest rate because that was already the case
before.

We will now take our next question from Michael Haid of Commerzbank. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I have two questions. First question -- sorry, I have
to come back to the P&C reserve releases, you kind of made me believe that you actually
were forced to release redundant reserves. Normally, I would rather believe you have a
lot more discretion to decide to keep reserve buffers on the book and put this into
whatever IBNR reserves. Is it fair to assume that on a broader basis, these reserve
releases were actually runoff profits. So from claims, which were actually settled, or is this
a wrong assumption, asked differently, why did you not try to maintain the reserve -- to
keep the reserve buffers on the book? Second question, the combined ratio in Germany
is very simple, it was excellent at an excellent level. Any one-offs there? Anything
unexpected because that combined ratio is just extraordinary, extraordinarily good.

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Well, Michael, thank you for the question. First of all, as always, looking at reserves, it's
various effects, and each book is different in its nature. And then the development is
different. So that's not a single-tool answer, but what is correct, that we felt quite under
pressure to do something and that we felt it was adequate to react right now, not wait for
the end of the year because the indication was so clear and you're right, there's a lot of
discretion. But sometimes, you come to the very end of how far you can go with you this
question. And that's all I will tell you about that. About Germany, you're right, the
combined ratio in Q2 was exceptionally good, and it was the best combined ratio, i.e. so
as far as I remember, over Germany. Reasons, first of all, low large losses.
Which is, of course, given that we had some storms in Germany in the first half of the year
has something to do with luck. But what has less to do with luck is that we have a very
sound profitability across various books at a Germany where also the attritional part of the
claims development developed very positively. And then thirdly, you know that we have
the seasonal shift of premiums between Q1 and Q2 at average Germany, which meant
that we had higher premiums in Q2 and lower premiums in Q1. So the higher earned
premiums in Q2 also supported this exceptionally good combined ratio.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

So what is then the expectation going forward for the combined ratio in Germany.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

The year-end guidance is 93%, our run rate after 6 months is 91.9%. So we are clearly
below that, but still 6 months to go so we would not change the outlook now.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Okay, thank you very much.
