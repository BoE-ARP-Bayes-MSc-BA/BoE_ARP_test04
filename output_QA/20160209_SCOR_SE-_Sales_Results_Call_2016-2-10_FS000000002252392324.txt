MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Bertrand Bougon

{BIO 18934799 <GO>}

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on this call. Before starting the call, please
consider the disclaimer on page two, as usual. And with that, we can now start the call and
the presentation and I will leave the floor to Victor Peignet, the CEO of SCOR Global P&C.

Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Good morning. In the business environment in which we operate, the results of the
January renewals for us are good. Basically, the renewals went as we anticipated them to
go, and as we've indicated will likely to go following Monte Carlo and Baden Baden, they
were late and they gave rights to lengthy and heavy negotiations as the buyers wanted to
explore all possible options and to make sure that they have listen to and considered all
available views.
Therefore, it took a long time to bring them to conclusions, but at the end of the day,
none of the trends by market and by line of business led to drastic changes. Big
challenges for reinsurers, insurers and brokers continue to be the same and they all boil
down to one major challenge, which is the gap between insurance current growth rates,
and the often blamed reinsurance capacities such as searching for premium volume with
limited underwriting work done, which is typical over the soft market, and over the soft
market that is proceed as getting close to reaching the bottom if not as having already

reached bottom in certain classes and markets, even if there was a like a spike of
competitions when the competition regains some momentum at the very end of 2015.

FINAL

Fourth quarter results that are currently released by both insurers and reinsurers are for a
number of them, containing the ingredients of the recipe for market term, on our side, we
have been and we continue to be very attentive to maintaining the quality of the technical
earnings under presence of the reserving.
Since there was no real surprise and there is (02:06) renewals for us, all the preparation
that we had done was proven to be relevant and helped us a lot during the renewals to
stay focused on our two main objectives to maintain both the expected profitability and
the franchise, and with regard to the franchise to continue to enhance it in the U.S.
This was achieved, thanks to the extensive well done on client segmentation and the
targeted approach, with the in depth knowledge of our clients by our teams and the
capabilities we've developed to manage the relationship with them globally, and to steal
the total portfolios in the real-time including at the level of the entire division.

Bloomberg Transcript

In such a business environment, the quality and the history of the relationship with the
clients and of the services rendered (02:50) over time to business partners, makes a real
difference and do positively distinguish us as a reinsurer that has a track record of
consistency and continuity that is willing to negotiate and that adds value over and above
the provision of capacity.
From this standpoint, the timing of our alternative solution initiatives and the approach
we've followed to implement it, that is to say in total synergy with our traditional P&C
treaty reinsurance activity, did very well for us. And our responsiveness to the pipeline of
request for proposal has been beneficial to our overall reinsurance relationships with the
interested clients.
The main drivers for these renewals have been the following. For the EMEA region an
increased selectivity in response to a further increase fragmentation by market, clear work
away points, and portfolio management and optimization, including a real-time arbitration
by reallocating capital away from the region in the course of the renewals whenever other
region like the U.S. offers more attractive perspectives. For the APAC region, priority given
to the defense of the technical margins in mature markets, and the leverage on the
strategic partnerships to maintain the competitive positions in the developing and
emerging markets.
For the Americas, in the U.S., the productive development of the client-focused initiative
with clients being very receptive to the global approach of the relationship that we are
proposing. The good progression that we see in the U.S. and that is well-balanced
between property, casualty, professional liability, regional, and program is also due to our
ability to see if the opportunity offers for us to enter into new programs that result from
the movement of consolidation of programs previously organized by business units or by
lines of business like in casualty between general and specialty casualty.

FINAL

Figures are there to show that the teams did perform well at the 1/1 renewals. The
increase of the overall expected gross underwriting ratio is marginal at 0.3 percentage
points. It includes a positive effect of the portfolio management actions, share variations,
cancellations and new business that is estimated to 0.7 percentage points. It also includes
a decrease by 0.3 percentage points of the overall expected gross loss ratio.
In a nutshell, a good combination between profitable new business and well management
of commissions during the negotiation. It means that thanks to the further improved
efficiencies simultaneously achieved at the 1/1 renewal of the retrocession program. The
net combined ratio is expected to stay close to 94% for 2016 under normal loss
experience.
The expected return on risk adjusted capital allocated to the business booked at 11%
(05:59), puts the division on the right tracks to bring its required contribution for the
growth to be at its target of 1,000 basis point above the risk-free rate.

Bloomberg Transcript

The overall decrease in risk adjusted pricing has been contained at minus 1%. The division
recalls a 2% overall premium growth at constant exchange rates. Many thanks to the
efficient development and deployment of its client focus initiative in the U.S., and
generally to the preferred signing it has benefited from the clients. It's worthwhile
mentioning that the new business return with existing and new clients has had a positive
effect of 0.3 percentage point on the overall expected gross underwriting ratio.
I won't enter into the detail by market and by land business, but you have them all in the
presentation. Based on the outcome of the January renewals and on the currency
exchange rates, the forecast of the division total gross premium returned for 2016 stands
at €6 billion.
At this point, I hand over to for introducing the Q&A session. Thank you.

Bertrand Bougon

{BIO 18934799 <GO>}

We can start the Q&A session.

Q&A
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now move to the Q&A session. Now we come to our first
question for today, and it's from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Please go ahead sir.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi, there. Two quick questions. First of all, Victor, you talked about walk away points, in
your opening commentary. Is your walk away points, where the RAV on a normalized loss
basis is below a 1,000 basis points or are you prepared to take business below that as
your walk away point more on some business, just a technical price of the point at which is
Page 3 of 15



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2016-02-09

a technical loss. Maybe just clarify, what you mean, when you said disciplined walk away
point.

FINAL

And the second question, I'm a little confused on the impact of your retro, and what
you've done. Maybe you could just clarify as your retro meant that you expect the 7 point
normalized loss load to be a bit lower or is it benefiting the net combined ratio and just
clarify exactly how the retro changes are benefiting you? Thanks.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

The walk away points is, but it is not a straight application of the minimum required as per
the target we're at an underwriting ratio. It's a bit more settled than that. But it's very
serious for a reinsurance company to walk away from a given client, or even for from a
given program. So I think what I wanted to highlight this because I think the challenge
between the past and today is that lead reinsurers like ourselves, but we are not the only
ones, are reaching a point where while there are limits beyond which we are not ready to
go and I think that, that is clear indication in my opinion that to some extent, we are
reaching kind of an end of how softening the market can be.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I guess, the reason I asked is one of your competitors is prepared to write catastrophe
business, which could be loss making on a normalized loss basis because they expect
normalized losses to any occur one year after 10 (09:58) is that something you would be
happy to do?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

I don't know who that competitor is. No. I think we are – I said we have clear management
referrals. The business is priced technically according to our targets and if the deviation
from that targets exceed certain thresholds, then it gets referred to different levels of the
management and then we are taking views whether or not. There is a merit to give a
derogation (10:37), so we've been pretty strict on that. I think it is important for me that to
keep coherence to our lead market while you cannot do in one area what you refuse to
do in another one to be very careful market-by-market and between segments of clients
to be coherent and consistent. So I think that's what we have been doing.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. On the retro?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

On the retro, well, I think the retro, there are two ways of improving your retro. You can
improve by the structure of the program, you can improve by the cost of the program.
While I think we achieved both. We have improved on the cost of the program, the cost
being basically what it costs you and net of the expected recoveries, that is more efficient.
And we have improved the structure by continuing the move towards aggregate
coverage (11:29) and also have better differentiation between peak barriers and non-peak

Page 4 of 15



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2016-02-09

barriers (11:35) I mean having a better cover for abnormal frequency of midsize natural
catastrophes being local ones such as one light flash floods, hail, tornado, and the likes.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

FINAL

But this wouldn't change your 7 point loading?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

This will change probably our 7 point loading, we already indicated in the last quarters that
it was probably more towards 6.5 point and we are looking it at the moment, I think, it's
somewhere between 6 point and 6.5 point.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks very much.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

And it contributes to our indication of our capability to maintain the combined ratio of
close to 94%.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from William Hawkins from KBW.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hey, Victor. Thank you very much. Hopefully, two quick questions. In your introduction
remarks in Asia, you talked about, defending the margin, but maintaining key strategic
relationships. There could be an argument of those two points are somewhat
inconsistent. So, could you just discuss, how you maintain the margin and keep your major
clients sweet?
And then secondly, you're focusing on growing in the U.S. this is part of the strategy that
you've talked about and executed for a long time, but there remains a concern in my
mind that this middle market business you're winning, you are effectively still getting from
somebody else, and if they're willing to lose the business, there must be something that
they know about it, but you sort of don't? So, can you just remind us, how you can be
comfortable, that if you're capturing market share in the U.S. you're doing so in the right
way? Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

So, let me quote what I said, I said for APAC, the priority given to the defense (13:33) of
technical margin into mature markets, and the leverage on the strategic partnership to
Page 5 of 15

FINAL

maintain the competitive positions in the developing and emerging markets. To me, there
cannot be a contradiction between the two, because they don't apply to the same
markets. So to be clear, I mean in Asia-Pac, we've renewed China, which is an emerging or
developing market. We've renewed Korea, which is a mature market. In Korea, we gave
the priority to the margin and while we reduced our business because the market was too
competitive. In China, we give priority to the strategic partnerships that we have with a
certain number of Chinese companies.
Regarding the U.S., well, first of all, our focus is not just on regional, I mean our U.S. client
initiatives was very much going into so far regional and EMS (14:27) companies. So I think
that's, the way we – we've gone into it, we – it's the result of several years of
segmentation of the market. We are not line underwriters in the U.S. We have not line
underwriters in general, we are client underwriters, and we underwrite clients.
Our U.S. portfolio of existing clients and prospects target is about 200 companies. I
believe myself that with the quality of the team we have in the U.S., I mean a portfolio of
200 clients and prospects altogether is quite manageable. So I trust the teams. I think
we've good professionals and we are doing we price (15:15) all the business we write.
There are a number of offers that we did not consider this year, because we did not have
the resources, so the triage (15:25) at the entry of the business to our team is the work of
the management. That's the priority to do a triage (15:31) so that you only look at business
that you have the time and the competence to look at, which means that already half of
the business offers get out of the door, not because we would not like to look at them,
but because we think we are not ready to do that. So I think we are extremely organized,
extremely prudent, but also very determined to develop with the clients with whom we
feel that there is a kind of profile fit. And I think that's the way we operate. And I think
while we trust that we have the capabilities to underwrite, that each and every piece of
business is unwritten, priced (16:12) by the team, and clients in the U.S. as you know, are
inviting their reinsurers to edit portfolios – portfolio reviews during the year, not only on
the underwriting, but also on the claims and we are doing it. And I think I'm comfortable
myself, totally comfortable with the way we grow in the U.S. By the way, I mean the 24%
increase, we are showing here is about €100 million of premium. You have to put that in
relative terms.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

That's great. Thank you, Victor.

From Goldman Sachs, we got In-Yong Hwang on the line. Please go ahead.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Two questions from me. Firstly, on the – your guidance for the 94%, just
clarifying what the phrase kind of close to 94% means, I mean slightly different from kind
of the illustration (17:08) you gave in the last year's renews, so does that suggest that
you're perhaps thinking it could be, it's more likely to be kind of higher than 94% than the
kind of around 94%, so just some clarification on that?
Page 6 of 15



Company N ame: SCOR SE

Date: 2016-02-09

FINAL

And secondly, on the kind of the portfolio management actions that reduced growth
underwriting ratio by 0.7%. Could you give us kind of compared – comparable figures of
last year and whether you except (17:36) any business last year, sorry, this year, that you
would've not written last year, so kind of any potential changes to kind of the approach
you had into renewals? Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

I'll take the first one, and then I'll ask you to repeat the second one, because I didn't really
catch what you wanted to address. Well, first of all, the 94% is nothing really new, I mean
we've been talking about that for a quite while, you can find out in the IR Day and you can
find it in most of our communications.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Yeah. Sorry, my question is more around the phrase kind of close to is different to just kind
of straight registration (18:20) you gave last year. So wondering whether that was signaling
you think maybe it could go – is more likely to be higher than 94%?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

I know how picky and choosy you are (18:31) it's close to.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

But I mean let me be clear on the sort of breakdown. We are looking at the breakdown of
that combined ratio that would be roughly the following to be very clear, 56% of that
rationale (18:52), between 6% and 7% – 6.5% of debt (18:58) between 6.5% and 7% of
cost expenses; and between to 24.5% and 25% of commission. I mean that's the
indication. But it's totally consistent with what we said. One thing I said during the
presentation is that, the loss ratio, if we look at the renewals, the gross loss ratio has
reduced. So we have an underwriting ratio, which is loss ratio plus commission ratio, that is
increasing by 0.3 percentage points, right.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

But we have an expected gross loss ratio that decreases by about 0.3 percentage points,
so it means that – as I alluded to you in the presentation, lot of the renewals especially on
the proportional of course has been on the commission though, which is why in the
guidance or in the indication of combined ratio, I'm putting the commission at 24.5%, 25%
because if you combine the fact that, we are increasing at Lloyd's and the fact, there has
been a number of negotiation on commission, we are getting probably towards (20:11)
25% on the commission.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Sure.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

FINAL

And we cannot (20:13) balance between the loss ratio and the commission ratio.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Sure. My second question was on the slide four in the footnote, as a reference to positive
effect of portfolio management actions of an 0.7 percentage points. It's only if we could
add comparative figure for last year and where the approach that you took into this
around the renewals as kind of more conservative perhaps than the previous trend or
there was any change at all (20:45)

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, I think we are – while the information is not totally aligned year-on-year, but we are
trying to give you as much quality information as we can. So this year what we are saying
basically but we are even giving you more granularity. So, the gross underwriting ratio is
increasing by 0.3. Well, this increase is after a positive effect of three things, which is
basically portfolio management driven, valuation of shares, consolidation and (21:22) And
in that, basically the new business itself is accounting for 0.3. So I think that's the – that's
how it breaks down.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Not really fundamentally different from last year because last year we communicated on
portfolio management only, which is share valuations and consolidations. This year, we've
communicated a bit more because we have given you not only this, but the new business
with the breakdown of the new business. It was important for me to give you the new
business because I wanted you to be totally convinced, that our new business is quality
new business that has got expected performance totally in line with the rest of the
portfolio. But to respond to the second or the third question, I mean we are not buying
new business. We're underwriting new business with expected performance levels, which
are commensurate or totally compliant and even a bit better on the existing portfolio that
we are renewing.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Okay. Great, thank you.

FINAL

Hi, morning. Two questions. First one, I always ask this every year, but could you just give
us an idea of how much of the business that you wrote (22:43) in January that you lease?
As from memory last year the percentage was 34%. So I was just interested in how that
developed?
And the second question is just on the slide 23, I just wanted to clarify a couple of things.
So if I compare the percentage of business that you've kind of put into the buckets of
very attractive, attractive, adequate, et cetera. It seems like there's been a net move
towards this actually getting positive, though the level of very attractive business has
gone up slightly. The level of attractive business has gone up slightly and the level of
inadequate business has only gone up by 2%. So actually some net positive there. Could
you just talk us through that? And also I mean, if I compare that slide from your Investor
Day in September to the one that you issued this morning, it seems like Western
European and German (23:37). From memory, a lot of the European renewals seems to
be a little bit worsened our expectations (23:43)? So could you just talk me through kind
of how that's working out (23:47)? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

We were at 34%, we're now at 32%. I would think that is one-third and that makes it
branded, that we did. I think what is very important is not only to lead, but also to be within
the panel of the pricers, and I think that's what we're looking for to be in the panel of the
pricers for all the clients and the business we're targeting. And I think we're there now. I
would think that the area where we need to still progress is again the U.S., but I think the
rebranding of the company is good and is progressing well. So I think gradually we're
moving up in the ranking in the U.S. but overall that's where we are.
Regarding the traffic lights, well, my regret is to have to show them to you every time, but
anyway. Well, I think this is a perception that we have of the position market-by-market
and line of business by line of business as a function of what we underwrite. So to be very
precise, the percentages are percentages in number of dots, yeah, not weighted
average of premiums or I think it's one way of showing the percentages. You need also to
take them with that caveat. They do not represent percentages of premium, they
represent the percentage of the number of dots in this table.
I would think myself that in a market where we see first sign of bottoming up, it's not
totally abnormal that while basically we have the stabilization and we do not continue to
see the number of inadequate increasing. And I would add that, well, as I was mentioning
in my introduction speech, the number of profitable earnings that we see now are coming
out of the Q4, which is far higher than what we had already noticed in Q3, and that goes
throughout the panel of insurance and reinsurance companies and informed the largest to
some very specialized.
While that also covers a variety of lines of business, but for us that is indicating that well,
this has got to be followed by underwriting measures, though we believe that those are
the indicators that we are reaching the end to some extent gradually of course, but we
are reaching the end. So we hope that we will see the consequences of that in the

From HSBC, we got Thomas Fossard on the line.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Yes. Good morning. We got two questions on my side. The first question will be related
to terms and conditions. Obviously, you're pointing to maybe higher level of referral this
year compared to last year. I just wanted to better understand what was the request from
your clients in terms of terms and conditions, and potentially what has been the level of
acceptance into the retail process (27:39).
And the second question would be related to your initial comments on the return on
allocated capital of your division. I think that now you are pointing to the (27:56) rating
more or less in line – just in line with the targeted returns, while obviously last year you
were still writing with the margin; all that of course taking into account also the level of
interest rate environment. So just wanted to confirm that my understanding is right and
that obviously you're writing now the business only on the target and obviously in the
context – in the (28:30) environment both underwriting and financial. Obviously, the
margin are starting to be a bit less significant than in the past. Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, on the second question, last year, we – remember, we indicated last year that we
had already had to withdraw the buffer, though we were writing at the target last year and
we continue to be writing on the target this year. So that's the second year in a row that
we basically underwrite at the target return on capital.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

And just on (29:17) right, okay. So do you (29:19) meaning that obviously you would not
expect on average, say, business you expect to write on a full-year basis to be more
capital intensive than it has been last year basically?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, I mean there is a slight variation year-on-year of the capital, and there may be – I
mean, if the market is softening, you tend to manage the portfolio, and well, I don't want
to enter into all the details, but it's obvious that if you manage the portfolio, you may have
to go into layers and participation that are slightly more capital intensive. Look at that
(30:00) business for instance, if you don't want to write the bottom layers anymore,
because they're too competitive, you look at excess (30:06) or maybe the same, so I
think because of the soft market condition, there is a trend to go for slightly higher capital,
Page 10 of 15



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2016-02-09

FINAL

but you are talking of a few percentage points of capital intensity that increases. While if
that capital intensity increases, well, it has got to be remunerated which is the case. But
there is a slight increase, while a handful of a percentage point of capital intensity, but I
mean this is being remunerated.
On the terms and conditions, I think that the things of last year which were very much on
the aggregation of events, our close and things like that. They were still present to some
extent, but I mean a lot of it had been that we dealt with last year. So it was more clients
that did not really pursue that last year to realign what had been achieved or what had
been conceded, I don't know last year. So I think that was not such a hot topic this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think that basically when you reach a point where, well, the margin to play with the prices
becomes pretty minimal, while you try to manage your bit on the extent and the scope of
cover, so the attempts were basically to expand a bit the scope of cover whether it is in
property or in casualty or in the specialty lines by throwing in additional exposure, hoping
that this could be swallowed at no additional premium. So all the discussions were on. I
think that's where underwriting management comes into play, that's where underwriting
also comes into place for the underwriters to know pretty well the scope of the treaties
and to reanalyze in the propositions of the client to reanalyze what additional covers,
ancillary coverages, additional guarantees are being thrown in, then see whether those
are acceptable or not and if they are, well, talk with the actuaries regarding what sort of
pricing impact it should have.
So I think nothing really massive but here and there, attempt to broaden the cover. Cyber
has not been as much of a hot topic as we thought it would be, well the good reason
being that the take up of cyber coverage is still pretty low outside of the U.S. So I think
even though they are cyber covers for the moment, the exposure to cyber covers outside
of the U.S. is quite low.

Our next question comes from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

And then, if I may, I had one point on this. I think one of the line that has been and it's not
surprising, this is soft markets sort of reputation. One line of business that is the most
affected by these attempts to throwing additional cover is marine. And you remember
back in the 1990s the idea that marine was accepting additional war, marine was
accepting terror, some onshore energy was thrown in the marine & energy treaties, well
we have a bit of a repetition of that, which again is a sign of the submarket.

And we come to our next question from Vinit Malhotra.

FINAL

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hello. Hi, good morning. Thank you. I'm just curious that if you could just comment a bit
about the one product which seems to be – seems strong or reasonably good price
increases more the non-prop, is it just one-offs because of what's happening in Spain, if
you highlight or if you could just comment on that that would be very interesting for me.
Secondly, if it's just the SBS slide, which I think you have provided some new information
on signing ratios on slide 19. And I just can't help but notice the offshore energy where at
least two years ago, it seems there was a lot of more competition maybe from the slide
where you got less than you wanted to sign, but then the last year has been flattish. Is it – I
mean, is it if you could comment on that.
And there is one small clarification I need if I'm allowed that second half question, just to
confirm that you mentioned that the gross loss ratio is actually even improving by 30 basis
points because of low commissions or retrocession just to clarify, sorry. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Start by the last one because we need to be very clear on it. In our expected
performance, we are communicating on underwriting ratio. Underwriting ratio is the
addition of loss ratio and commission ratio. So what I'm saying is that our underwriting
ratio, the addition of the two, is increasing by 0.3 basis points. It means that business is a
bit less profitable at the moment, but within that evolution basically, the loss ratio itself,
the expected gross loss ratio, so there is no retro in there. We are all pricing our business,
gross, it will be for retro. So the loss ratio, gross expected, is reducing while 0.3 basis
points. What does it mean? It means that the deterioration in bracket of the underwriting
ratio is coming from the commission and this is not again surprising. I think our underlying
business, and you see that in the attrition of loss ratio, our underlying business is behaving
pretty well. I think our underlying portfolio is very solid, but a lot of the negotiations are on
the commission revenue.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. Fair enough.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

On the motor non-prop, while this is very different market-by-market, I mean it's obvious
that in Spain, the system has been changed, so the indemnities are going to be – are
changing. So, as all the system of indemnity is changing, you re-price the business. And in
the [Technical Difficulty] (36:30) and in UK and France, well I think the market in France has
been to our point of view too competitive for the last three years at least. And while
again, I mean, we are probably here reaching a kind of a bottom and there is a need to
consider that the volatility in particular and the inflation and the very large severe losses
needs to be remunerated.

So I think it's – I would not think that that is it, we shouldn't make too much out of it, but I
mean on the line of business, per line of business, yes, I mean UK, France and Spain have
seen changes, which are not linked to exactly the same reasons, but (37:23) and
regarding business solution, well, I think maybe Benjamin you're on the line.

FINAL

A - Benjamin Gentsch

{BIO 5633839 <GO>}

Yes, I'm on the line.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Okay. You want to take this one?

A - Benjamin Gentsch

{BIO 5633839 <GO>}

Well, if you look at those two charts on slide 19, I think it's obvious that offshore energy
has seen a significant pricing pressure, but nevertheless they are all resources (37:49) that
we like to underwrite because they're still at (37:51) price. And then it's I think not
surprising that on such better risk, you see that at least the preferential signings actually
that depresses and the signing ratio down to add it something like 80%, 85%. So I don't
think it's contradictory to see negative price trends there and then not so good signings
meaning we would like to underwrite more of the risks that we're on, but because they're
reasonably well priced, obviously there is more than enough capacity for that.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes, Benjamin, I will just – sorry, if you can follow. Just wondering that this hasn't moved in
the last year.

A - Benjamin Gentsch

{BIO 5633839 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

It's not surprising that it's fairy in 2014, but it seems to be stable at this level. So, if that is
what it is (38:38)

A - Benjamin Gentsch

{BIO 5633839 <GO>}

Stable at the low level. I mean we tried to defend the business as much as we can. So we
would hope that the signings do not fall further.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay. All right. Thank you, Benjamin.

Now we take our next question from Frank Kopfinger from Deutsche Bank.

FINAL

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, everybody. I have two questions. My first question is on your gross
and your (39:15) on the 24% and can you break this down into the two drivers property
and casualty, and also on the casualty side, you seem to become more and more positive
on this, and if this is the case, then what is your outlook then in terms of the prospect for
this business? And my second question is on your reductions – on your volume reductions
in marine and aviation, obviously this was driven by the weak pricing, but my question
would be what kept you there from cutting the volumes even more?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, in the U.S. as I said, it's pretty spread sort of progression, and if I give you the
percentages, the new premium is 34% property, 27% casualty, 18% professional liability,
12% regional business, 9% program business, so it's pretty distributed, which is what we
want. I mean we have segmented the market and we want to progress in the different
segments.
The property, casualty and specialty casualty is then again resulting from this global
approach of clients where we are looking at the client in all the classes of business
including specialty lines and surety (40:40) for instance can be one in which we are
present in the U.S., though we want to consider the client globally, and that's what we
have been doing.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the marine aviation, well again, I mean, as Benjamin is on the line, maybe you can
comment on this one, Benjamin.

A - Benjamin Gentsch

{BIO 5633839 <GO>}

Let's start with aviation. In aviation, we are really concentrating our portfolio on that, very
largest most influential players, and I would like to remind you that as we have talked
about as many times, aviation is not just only airlines business. The airlines are the most
under pressure, but GA products, airports, et cetera, are still relatively better priced. So in
this leading – the leading players in the market retain a portfolio that from our point of
view is very flat to be underwriting. Of course, there is no excess margin in there, but we
want to concentrate the portfolio on those basically four key players in the market.
Therefore, there should not be an expectation of much through reduction than what we
have shown in the 1st of January renewal.
And in marine, I think a 6% reduction is already quite a significant one. Marine is a portfolio
line of business which is very important also for our composite clients. So it quite
technically also forms a part of an overall relationship. Nevertheless, of course, also the
marine business has just to satisfy our profit requirements. But this is done in the context
of the overall client relationship that we have. So we have reduced because a lot of the
business has not satisfied the profitability requirements, but the business that we have
underwritten still makes sense to be underwritten.

But would you expect to cut it even further in marine? In aviation, I understood that this
would be probably the level?

FINAL

A - Benjamin Gentsch

{BIO 5633839 <GO>}

Well, if you give me the crystal ball and tell me what marine rating will do in the next
couple of quarters and I could give you the answer. So if rates are further reducing, but
this is the need (42:55), we heard before about Victor and I fully joined this view about
Victor's view and expression about the market leveling out. I think if the market levels out,
then we will not reduce our portfolio anymore in the marine. However, if the rates would
reduce significantly, then you would have to see further portfolio management actions
there. But let's wait and see how the market reacts, I think the signs that the market is
leveling out, those signs are actually increasing day-by-day.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Okay, thanks.
