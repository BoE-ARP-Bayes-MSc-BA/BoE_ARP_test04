Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Thank you, Willem and good morning to everybody. I am pleased to report this morning a
solid set of results for the Q4. This quarter completes a good year for Aegon and
provides clear evidence that we are delivering on our objective of growing our business
profitably. We achieved again a strong set of underlying earnings, sales and value of new
business. Capital levels and cash flows also remain strong, and we will be proposing a
final dividend of EUR0.11 per share in line with our stated objective of sustainable dividend
growth.
I am now turning to slide 3, which provides you with a good summary of how we are
performing against our key performance indicators. As you can see, 2013 was a year
during which we have made considerable progress. Underlying earnings rose 5% or 8% at
constant currencies. A third of our earnings came from fee business, normalized cash
flows were strong and we increased our returns. Writing profitable new business and
addressing our low-return businesses will contribute to higher returns going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's now turn to slide 4, to the highlights of the strategic action we've taken in 2013.
During the last year we've made solid progress on the four strategic objectives we are
pursuing throughout our organization to achieve our ambition to become a leader in all of
our chosen markets.
We began the year by simplifying our capital structure with the successful transaction that
eliminated the preferred shares owned by the Aegon Association. And throughout the
year we made add-on acquisitions including in Central and Eastern Europe, and
successfully completed the transformation of our business in Spain, which enabled us to
upstream a net amount of EUR800 million to the holding. And we are now offering
products through Santander's extensive branch network in Spain and early results of this
new joint venture are positive.
At the same time all our businesses stepped up their efforts to strengthen customer
engagement by improving service levels and by simplifying products and by enhancing
their online presence through the use of technology. 2013 saw us launch major new digital
platforms and propositions in most of our markets worldwide. These new propositions
have been received very positively and many of them have been recognized for their
innovation and customer centricity. I am therefore confident that our focus on creating a
positive customer experience will continue to support the growth we are achieving in our
business.
Turning to slide 5, in 2013 we continued to see strong sales as highlighted on this slide.
Total sales for the year increased 6% to EUR7.2 billion driven primarily by variable
annuities, pensions and asset management businesses. Gross deposits increased 15% to

FINAL

EUR11 billion during the Fourth Quarter while net deposits more than doubled to EUR2b. I
will address our deposits in more detail on the next slide.
New life sales were strong but somewhat below the level we experienced in an
exceptionally strong quarter last year. In the UK we successfully launched our platform with
now more than GBP1.3 billion of assets under management. Accident and health and
general insurance sales were slightly lower compared to the Fourth Quarter of last year
mainly due to adverse currency effects and lower production in the Netherlands as a
result of our focus on improving profitability.
And, as you can see we, continue to experience strong customer demand for our core
products and services, a clear reflection of the strength of our franchise, the depth of our
distribution and our focus on offering the right products to our customers.

Bloomberg Transcript

Here on slide six we provide an overview of our deposits. Let me start with the Americas.
The increase in deposits was mainly driven by variable annuities and pensions. This was an
exceptional year for our variable annuity business with sales of $8.5b. And although we do
see competitive pressure slowly increasing in the variable annuity market, the addition of
new partners such as Edward Jones and Voya Financial during the year has further
strengthened our position, and we continue to expect healthy flows going forward.
Our US pension business also had another very successful year adding deposits of more
than $21b. The rise was driven by planned takeovers, this particularly in the education and
health segments as well as the successful focus on retirement revenues to grow
participation and contribution rates. Our strong proposition is supported by a fully scalable
platform that enables us to continue to grow and write profitable business.
Our new markets deposits of $3.2 billion for the quarter mainly reflect the significant
growth of our third-party asset management business. But also our joint venture in Japan
is experiencing a strong increase of variable annuity production, driven by expansion of
our distribution network of regional banks.
Turning to slide 7, we are committed to offering products and services that provide value
to both our customers and to the Company. This commitment is clearly reflected in the
significant increase in the market consistent the value of new business achieved this
quarter and over the year.
In the Americas variable annuities were a key driver of this increase as a result of higher
volumes and higher margins supported by increasing interest rates. The improvement in
the US life business is the result of actively pricing and the withdrawal of products that did
not meet our profitability standards.
In the Netherlands the market-consistent value of new business was lower compared to
the Fourth Quarter of last year due mainly to lower margins on mortgage production.
Contribution from our pension business was stable; a strong margin improvement fully
offset lower sales.

As the slide indicates, market-consistent value of new business in the UK was impacted by
lower margins and volumes in annuities and lower pension volumes.

FINAL

And the MCVNB in new markets benefited from the strong sales in Asia. This, however,
was offset by the impact of divestments in Spain and lower sales in Poland.
In addition to increasing sales, our profitability supported by cost efficiencies across all our
businesses and we continue to seek ways to further improve these efficiencies.
Here on slide eight I want to highlight the successful shift we've made towards
rebalancing our business. Today a third of our earnings are generated by fee businesses.
This has been achieved by growing our revenue-generating investments by over 7% per
year since 2008 to EUR475b. And, as you can see on the slide this has been driven by
growth in investments for the account of policyholders and off-balance-sheet investments
for third parties.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now on the other hand our spread-based businesses have been significantly reduced
over the same period. Institutional spread-based balances are down $28 billion and fixed
annuity balances are down almost $20b. This reduction in balances over the last five years
has reduced market risk and freed up substantial capital.
I'm now turning to slide 9. 2013, we executed on significant cost-reduction programs
across the Company. And you are aware of the extensive business-transformation
program in the UK and the significant cost reductions in the Netherlands. We are also
improving efficiency in the Americas with the creation of a shared service center. This is a
new group within the US which will provide services to the whole of our US organization
and it will result in significant cost savings going forward.
The savings realized allowed us to invest in growth and to make strategic investments in
technology to better connect and engage with our customers. We have already online
direct sales channels in all our markets. And in the UK we are preparing to launch a new
direct-to-consumer proposition during the quarter that gives individuals without a financial
advisor access to our platform, providing them a full service capability. This is a significant
and fast-growing segment of the market. The investments we are making are needed to
ensure that our proposition remains strong, compelling and differentiated.
I will now turn it over to Darryl for more insight on our earnings and financial position.
Darryl.

Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Thank you, Alex. Here on slide 10 I would like to take a closer look at underlying earnings,
which, despite negative currencies impact, rose by 7% in the Fourth Quarter to EUR491m.
In the Americas earnings declined to EUR327m, which was mainly due to adverse
persistency in the life and protection and a weaker US dollar, partly offset by higher
Page 4 of 27

pension earnings.

FINAL

Underlying earnings in the Netherlands increased to EUR110 million as observed mortality
was better than expected. As we have announced, beginning January 1, 2014 we have
moved to prospective tables, bringing our IFRS reporting in line with our statutory and
economic frameworks.
In the UK underlying earnings decreased to EUR21 million as we invested in the
development of our new direct to consumer proposition, as Alex mentioned earlier.
Earnings from new markets amounted to EUR49m. Higher earnings in Asia were more
than offset by the negative impact of divestments in Spain and a recently introduced
insurance tax in Hungary.
Holding results improved by EUR40m, mainly the result of lower interest expenses
following debt redemptions, reduced operating expenses and a one-time gain of EUR18
million related to interest on taxes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net income was down for the quarter and for the year. Here on slide 11 you can see that
our strong underlying earnings for the quarter were mitigated by fair value results. Higher
equity markets and interest rates impacted our hedges, which I will address on the next
slide.
Realized gains were mainly driven by further adjustments to our general account
investment portfolio in the Netherlands to bring it better in line with the new regulatory
yield curve.
Impairments were very low this quarter as a result of the current benign credit
environment. The little impairments we had were offset mostly by recoveries on
investments in sub-prime RMBS in the US.
Other charges were mainly related to restructuring in the Americas and the UK. In addition
the new pension legislation approved by the Polish parliament was more adverse than
anticipated and as a result we have impaired the remaining EUR10 million of intangibles
related to this business.
By now you will be familiar with the way we address the results of fair value items, as
shown on slide 12. The results from fair value investments were again positive for the
quarter, mainly driven by returns on alternative investments and credit derivatives.
Fair value hedging programs where we largely have an accounting match were effective.
However, there was a negative impact from the movement in our own credit spread in
addition to model refinements in the Netherlands. Fair value hedging without an
accounting match resulted in a loss of EUR123 million following strong equity market
performance in the Fourth Quarter. As a result we saw losses again on both the equity

FINAL

collar hedge as well as on the macro hedge in the US. These hedges have now been
restructured as outlined on the next slide.
Slide 13. We have replaced the US macro hedge and the collar hedge with one single new
hedge program. The goal of the hedge program remains to protect the capital position
and dividend-paying ability of our US business. Given the strong equity market
performance in 2013, higher interest rates and lower market volatility, we were able to put
in place a new hedging program that will achieve the same level of capital protection but
at a reduced expected cost and lower market sensitivities.
Assuming a total equity market return of 2% per quarter, the new hedge will have an
expected cost of $60 million per quarter, and will vary by plus or minus a further $60
million if the actual market returns vary by plus or minus 10%. The source of the volatility
from this program continues to be the accounting mismatch that exists between the
insurance treatment of the liabilities versus the fair value treatment of the hedging
instruments.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning now to Aegon's capital position at the end of the Fourth Quarter, here on slide 14,
our Group IGD ratio of 212% reflects the continued strong regulatory capital positions of
our business units. This slide illustrates our capital management framework in practice.
In the US and the Netherlands the improvement in the capitalization as a result of
operational free cash flows allowed for a dividend payment to the holding during the year.
In the UK we have reset our target and buffer capital levels based on Pillar 1 at 145% and
165% now including the with-profit fund. In the Fourth Quarter we contributed another
GBP150 million of capital and we are now comfortable with the level of capital in the UK.
Each of our major business units is now capitalized within the target range.
The next slide covers the consolidated operational free cash flows and excess capital with
the holding, slide 15. Operational free cash flows were EUR228 million in the Fourth
Quarter. Excluding market impacts and one-time items, operational free cash flows
amounted to EUR304 million for the quarter and EUR1.3 billion for the year.
We ended the year with EUR2.2 billion of excess capital in the holding, reflecting EUR1.5
billion of dividend upstreamed by our business units. As previously communicated,
EUR900 million of this capital will be used during 2014 to further reduce leverage. At the
end of 2013 our gross leverage ratio was 30.1% and our fixed charge coverage was 5.1
times. With the further deleveraging later this year we expect to be within our target
ranges.
Slide 16. Given our strong capital position and solid cash flows, as Alex mentioned in the
introduction, we will be proposing at the annual general meeting of shareholders in May a
dividend of EUR0.11 per share covering the second half of 2013. This results in a full year
dividend over 2013 of EUR0.22 per share. As shown on the slide, the cash allocated to
common dividend has increased substantially over the past few years, our aim is to grow
the dividend in a sustainable way, taking into account our capital position and our cash
flows.

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Thank you, Darryl and before taking your questions allow me to summarize you. We are
pleased with our financial results over 2013 and the Fourth Quarter was again a strong
quarter. And looking ahead we are confident that our strong financial position, combined
with the continued execution of our strategy, will enable us to take advantage of the many
opportunities we see in all our markets and to create value for both our customers and
our shareholders.
We're happy to take now your questions, thank you.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Farquhar Murray, Autonomous.

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Morning gentlemen. Just a couple of questions actually around the cash flows on slide 15,
if I may. If we look at the EUR1,335 million normalized figure for the full year I just
wondered if you could outline the contributions coming from the US, the run-off book, and
the drag coming from the UK securitization.
And then specifically with regards to the US component, I just wonder if you could help us
in terms of how much that figure might be stressed by the absence of financing solutions
this year, and presumably at what stage we might see some of that come back? Thanks.

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes Farquhar. It's Darryl. Let me just give you a feel for the cash flows. They're actually
pretty close in line with where we had highlighted in my June presentation on the
expected cash flows for the year. So obviously the bulk of that is coming from the US,
about EUR900m. The Netherlands about EUR250m. The UK is actually contributing about
zero right now from an operational free cash flow perspective and, as we've signaled in
the past, we expect that to come up as we go into 2015 as we complete the
transformation in that part of the business. And the rest of it is really coming from the rest
of the organization.

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Okay. And the run-off book and the UK securitization component?

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes, the securitization components in the UK it was about a little less than EUR50 million in
2013 that's going to drop down to about EUR25 million in 2014 and largely be gone in
Page 7 of 27

FINAL

2015. And that's down from over EUR100 million in 2012 so that's been a trajectory on the
way down. In terms of from the run-off books in the US, the incremental impact from yearover-year basis is pretty small, less than EUR100 million change on the delta, and I think
that's the number that you're after there. And that would include the fixed annuity
portfolio in there as well.

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Okay. Brilliant. Thanks very much indeed for that.

Q - Michael van Wegen

{BIO 6435238 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, morning guys. Michael van Wegen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. One question
actually. I think looking at these results it becomes increasingly clear that some of the
operations that you restructured are doing well and some I guess are not doing so well. I
think things in the US look nowadays quite good on the core business and the
Netherlands is not doing too bad either.
I guess two areas where things still remain tough is the UK and Canada. Darryl in January
talked about a portfolio review. Can you talk a little bit more about that and can you talk us
through your idea behind Canada and the UK, why you are confident that you can turn
them around and when are you willing to take steps given that you've worked on this now
for the past five year? Thank you.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Michael, thank you for your question. At least that you recognize that where we have
taken a lot of actions we're seeing really good results. The US is a good example in terms
of making choices in what businesses we want to stay and what businesses we don't want
to stay.
We still have there a run-off portfolio. It's clearly a portfolio of businesses where we said
they are not core to our business. And we've said, and Darryl has repeated that in
January, that obviously we are looking at all the options we have in order to deal with
them, but in a way that we do not destroy unnecessarily shareholders' value. So we will
continue to put emphasis on it, the run-off portfolio, probably taking into account
somewhat more favorable market conditions.
You talk about the UK and Canada, clearly a challenged market environment. Let me start
with the UK. Two years ago we said we had done a strategic review of all the options we
have in the UK. And when I meant all the options I really mean all the options, effectively
Page 8 of 27

FINAL

putting in a run-off, running it or selling it. We have come to the conclusion at that point in
time that the best way for us to protect shareholder value was for us to take the actions
which we needed to take.
And that means starting by taking out costs very significantly. You see that 25% we
promised in terms of cost reduction, we execute on it. We have been very clear that we
will have further cost reductions needed in the UK. While at the same time we are also
positioning ourselves for the future in the new platform world. That will take time, but I am
confident that we are on the right track and that we will see the results emerging.
But Canada is a different situation where we have had the business for a long time in a
market that clearly is not an easy market. And Canada clearly is one of those operations
where we still see that we need to take more actions. And we will be doing that and
hopefully be able to share more with you later this year.

Q - Michael van Wegen

{BIO 6435238 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank you. And can I have a follow up on what you said on the UK please? I
appreciate that indeed a couple of years ago you'd done the strategic review and you
decided to go the fix-it route, let's call it that way.
Do you agree with me that since then the situation has deteriorated in the sense that
you've cut the cost that you targeted and profitability is still not anywhere near where it's
supposed to be, cash flows are still not anywhere near where they are supposed to be
with the zero for 2013? And you had to inject capital in the past year, significantly ahead of
what you expected. So isn't it the situation now that despite the decision that you made a
couple of years ago things have deteriorated only further and perhaps conclusions might
need to be drawn again?

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Well, Michael, when you take a decision, you have to be consistent with your decision.
That doesn't mean that you don't change the way you look at things, but once you take a
decision you have a management that's committed to execute on the plan. And we are
executing on the plan. We are taking our expenses down. We will continue to take further
expenses down. We have developed I think a great capability, well recognized by the
market in terms of platforms, and we should see the benefits of it emerging.
Now on the cash flow you're making a valid point; the cash flow is zero. But that was as
planned because it has the impact of securitizations, as Darryl just mentioned, and Darryl
also gave you the trajectory going forward. So we will continue to take the actions in the
UK that are needed to fix this business and we will do that ourselves.

Q - Michael van Wegen

Thank you.

Benoit Petrarque, Kepler.

FINAL

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

Hi, yes. Good morning. It's Benoit Petrarque from Kepler Cheuvreux. The first question is
on the dividend. I would like to come back on the decision to put a full year at EUR0.22.
What has been your thinking process behind that? I just note that you have a strong
excess capital at holding. Excluding deleveraging it's still EUR1.3 billion ahead of your
EUR600 million flow. And how do you see your dividend yield currently? I think it's about
3.2% on the EUR0.22. So how do you view dividend yield versus the sector?
Second question will be on the fixed annuity. I know it's on the run-off but rate are rising
up higher in the US, so how do you see this business going in the next two years? Do you
see opportunities? And I've seen the crediting rate actually on the new business going up
by 20 bps quarter on quarter so is that a kind of sign that you are a bit more aggressive
commercially on the fixed annuity or you're still out there?
And then just finally on the variable annuity business, you just mentioned during the
presentation some more, a little bit more competition on that, so how do you see that
moving in 2014? Do you expect still healthy margins and good volumes in 2014? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Benoit, thanks. Yes, on the dividend I think we've been very consistent. We have a
dividend policy. The dividend policy is based on the strength of our balance sheet and
based on the cash flow generation. What is really important here is that we want to have a
dividend that is growing sustainably in the future. So looking back at this year's full-year
dividend, it's a 5% decrease over the previous year.
Now in terms of yields we are positioned somewhere between the US sector. We are
higher in terms of yields than the US sector and a bit lower than the European sector,
probably not surprising in view of the profile we have where we have nearly 60% of our
businesses in the US.
I'll take your last question so that Darryl can give you more insight on your question on
fixed annuities. On variable annuity competition, you see what we are seeing now is now
is the result of a lot of hard work which has taken place in previous years to develop
distribution. You see the sales coming from new distribution channels. I just mentioned the
two, Edward Jones, Voya Financial. And I think that that is what is now emerging and that is
also the reason that we feel pretty comfortable that the positive trend will continue.
Now we've had good margins, very good margins, and you could say these margins have
been in the 20s or at margins which we do not believe will be sustainable going forward,
but they don't need to be sustainable going forward. So we probably expect a little bit
more competition and pressure on the margins, but still very healthy margins and a great
momentum in the distribution.
Darryl, do you want to answer the question, respond on the fixed annuities?

FINAL

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes, I can be very short on the fixed annuities. I would not signal that I see the fixed
annuity for us picking up any time soon. We've said in the past that interest rates need to
be significantly higher than where they are now. Obviously they started to get -- started to
jump up at the end of the Fourth Quarter and have come back down here again as we sit
here today. But we're really not really ready to run the credit risk that would be required to
make the spreads work in today's rate environment. So we need rates to be a lot higher
than they are and a steeper curve. I just don't see that in the near-term forecast so I
would take expectations down on that front.

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question or questions. I just wanted to follow
up on the earlier question regarding captives in the US and what the drag it's been
creating on US free cash flow. I just wondered if you could just give a bit more comments
on that in terms of the 4Q results and then also going forward what you expect to
happen.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Darryl?

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes, David, I'll take that one. The drag, it's been running about EUR40 million per quarter.
That's what it was in the Third Quarter. We've had several quarters where we have not
financed the redundant reserves of the XXX/AXXX issue in the US. We're actually looking
at that for 2014 and I actually expect us to execute some financing of that in 2014 which
will bring back some of that strain into operational free cash flow somewhere in the next
couple of quarters.

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Okay. And that will impact the operational free cash flow so we should, well, we would
hope to expect about a EUR40 million increase in that going forward 2014?

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes, we've had a EUR30 million to EUR40 million strain in our numbers each quarter for
the last four or five quarters as we've held off on financing so we'll be able to get some
of that back when we catch back up yes.

Nick Holmes, Soc Gen.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hi there. Just a couple of quick questions. The first one is, coming back on the portfolio
optimization review, wondered if you can tell us whether the rise in the US rates last year
is going to help you to accelerate finding solutions for the run-off book.
And then the second question is again coming back on the dividend. If you measure this
as a payout of net underlying earnings then I think it comes to something like 30%. And
that seems a little bit low. And I just wondered whether you would agree with that and
whether you think that there is scope for it to rise on that basis. Thank you.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Nick, on your question of portfolio review, yes, I did say that the rising interest rate
environment, the improvement in general of market conditions, investors looking for yield,
clearly all of that is hopefully, Nick, going to make it now easier and more executable, if
that's a better word that easier, to deal with pieces of the run-off portfolio.
And I think we've been very clear all along that it is our objective, and that's why we put
them separately in a run-off bracket, it is our objective to address these, but again in a
way that we do not destroy unnecessarily shareholder value. So it has clearly our attention
and the market conditions improving will make things easier.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Can you give us a little bit more color on the solutions that you think might be possible?

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

I don't think it would be a good idea for me to speculate on that right now. All I'm saying
to you Nick is that we are looking at all options available there to effectively accelerate the
run-off in what we now see improved market conditions.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

In terms of your dividend, what I said just in response to the previous question, what's
important for us is that we have a dividend that is growing sustainably over time. And
that's part of our strategy where we said we wanted to take our risk down, improve our

risk profile, be more predictable and that also applies here to the dividend. And we
believe that the EUR0.22, which represents a 5% growth over the previous year, is a good
basis for growth going forward.

FINAL

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay. You don't think that there is a structural issue with the dividend that it's structurally
low perhaps because of the legacy situation that you still have to some extent?

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Again, Nick, I can only repeat what I said. For us, the objective is clearly a steadily growing
dividend and we've grown it now 5% over the previous year. That brings us with a
dividend yield, by the way, in excess of our US peers and I would admit a bit lower than
our European peers. Not surprising if you look at the portfolio composition of Aegon
being for a big part US-based.

Hi. Good morning, everyone and thank you. Sorry to come back again on the same point
on your run-off business. I know you have been trying to give some answer, but some
thoughts on that. Assuming interest rates start picking up, now what would you think your
book will look like? Would you start looking for some potential disposals or would you still
be thinking from a run-off perspective of that book, assuming interest rate pick up
significantly from here on? I know you have mentioned that you definitely look for
shareholder value creation thing, but at least if you can give a bit more color it would be
great.
Secondly, on the impairments, it looks like the impairments went down significantly in this
quarter. Is it a real improvement in the RMBS market that is just driving that or is it across
the book which is going forward? How should we think about it going forward, would be
great? Thank you.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Ashik, what I said on the run-off is that we obviously are looking at ways to accelerate the
run-off and of course if we are able to find a buyer for these blocks of business in the runoff business we would certainly do that because it would accelerate the run-off. Difficult
for me to give you more color right now. But I can say to you, what I can say, we are
engaged in conversations, we are looking at options and I hope that over the course of
the year I can give you more.

If you look across the whole portfolio, credit is pretty benign everywhere right now so
we're just really not seeing much in the way of gross impairments in any of our portfolios
right now. And then it's further enhanced by we're actually getting some recoveries back
in the US RMBS portfolio. So that's really, those two things together are causing a big --

So should we expect it going forward as well or is it just a one-off kind of an event?

No. I think in the near term I don't see anything -- we're not seeing anything on our side

Thank you. Good morning everybody. A couple of questions. First of all, just following up
on Farquhar's question, within the US cash generation for 2013, was that $100 million of
that $900 million you mentioned coming from the run-off businesses? I'm just not sure I
understood the answer correctly.
And secondly, within the US business I just wondered do you have any meaningful
exposure to long-term care products? I understand there have been some reserving
issues there and just where you stand on that.

FINAL

And then finally I was wondering if you could help me with the UK business, really trying to
understand what the potential earnings power of the pensions business is going into
2014/2015. And the way I was thinking about it was looking at the Fourth Quarter pensions
earnings with a GBP9 million loss, adding back all the negatives that you've mentioned,
which takes me to plus GBP4m. And really if you can give me a sense of how much of the
IT expenses and persistency may or may not recur as negative charges plus any other
dynamics I should be bearing in mind when I'm thinking about my forecast.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Yes, would you like to take the question on the run-off business?

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes, I will. Sorry, William, there was a lot of questions. We were trying to get those all
jotted down there. No, the $100 million was not the actual capital release from the run-off
businesses. It was more of the delta effect, if you will, that we're seeing coming from
those on a period-over-period basis. I actually don't have the actual capital that was
released from those run-off businesses and I'm going to have to ask IR to follow back up
with you on that.
On the second question, I think was long-term-care-related.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Yes, it was long-term-care-related, Darryl. I think you know, William, we have some
exposure to long-term care. It's limited exposure and we're comfortable with the
reserves and provisions we have.
In terms of the UK business, clearly this has been a quarter where we have a number of
exceptionals. The exceptionals were related to persistency, as we highlighted, but also to
a number of investments which we are making to make our business more ready for
today's environment. As you know, we're making significant investments in our platform
capability. We're also, as we announced, as I announced, making an investment in a
proposition, which is a proposition which is going to focus on the end consumer directly,
which is a very different model and a new model in our business. So a lot of these
investments effectively are impacted -- are impacting this quarter.

Q - William Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Sorry, could I just come back on that? From the UK side, are those investments likely to
continue into 2014 or is that basically done for the time being?

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

I think it's fair to say, William, that you can expect that these investments will continue in a
similar range in terms of run rate going forwards.

And then just, sorry, finally again on the UK, I was under the impression that you had been
paying out cash commissions which had dragged into 2013. Will that now stop going into
2014? And what is the order of magnitude in terms of potential earnings uplift, if indeed
that perception was correct?

FINAL

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

We are certainly benefiting from the new environment, from RDR, so for new business
which is being written after 2013, that is indeed done on a commission-free basis. But we
still have a lot of effectively trail commission on previous contracts, which we continue to
pay commission on. So the commission level has come down, which, by the way, is a very
good thing for our business going forward, but we do still have trail commissions, in
particular in our --- the workplace, so the group pensions space.

Q - William Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

I don't know if you can comment on this, but by the sound of things it's difficult for that
pensions business to be delivering much beyond low double-digit earnings for some time.
Is that fair?

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, it's clear, William, we need to increase scale and that's why we invest in the
capabilities we have, which we have I think the platform capability now for pension
business which is very much recognized. So we are now really focusing on scale indeed in
order to get our cost level on a more efficient basis, which should be driving earnings
going forward.

Q - Maarten Altena

{BIO 15898902 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning gentlemen. Three questions from my side. The first is a follow up on
the UK, the capital position in particular. As you mentioned now to be more satisfied with
the capital position, does this mean that we should expect upstreaming of dividends to
the holding as of the First Quarter 2014 already or is that still too early?
The second thing is on holding expenses because what should we expect here for a run
rate, a quarterly run rate, given that the Fourth Quarter was impacted by a one-off and
take into account the earlier-announced deleveraging measures for 2014?
And maybe on the Netherlands, would you be able to update us on what you have seen
in group pensions in the Fourth Quarter 2013 and how you see the pipeline of
competitions and maybe also the outlook for 2014? Thanks.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Darryl?

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, I'll take the first two. On the UK capital, no, I wouldn't expect a dividend here in the
First Quarter of 2014, not after just putting a contribution in, in the Fourth Quarter of 2013.
The reality is we expect a step change in the cash flow generation in the UK starting in
2015. I think 2014 is really a transformation year where we complete the investment that
Alex was mentioning in terms of the costs and the transformation costs that we're
investing in the UK. That will also complete the run rate expense reduction by the end of
2014, so not only will we stop investing, the expenses will come down.

Bloomberg Transcript

In addition to that, the securitization will run out in the UK as well in 2015. And then, as Alex
said, we're really -- the new business strain has come down substantially in the post-RDR
world, where we don't have the high-commission environment or the commission
environment. Those four things will all interact by the end of 2014 and really create 2015
being a positive cash flow year for the UK and I think a step change for the cash flow. So
you can assume that 2015 will be that transition year and we should be ready to pay
dividends in 2016 based on calendar year 2015 performance.
On the, you also asked about holdings, yes, there was an extraordinary interest on taxes
in the holding. That was EUR18 million this quarter. There was about EUR5 million of noise
that went the other way. So I think you would look at the holding run rate results to be
about EUR13 million high for this quarter.
And I think the last question was on pensions.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

On the pensions in the Netherlands, which I'm happy to answer. I think what's important to
see is that coverage ratios are improving, as you know, high equity markets, slightly higher
interest rates. So that means that it's easier now to consider transfers. As such, we have a
good pipeline.
It's important for us and we've been very consistent that we price these products in line
with our pricing policy. But I believe that not only our strong capital position, which is clearly
recognized in the Netherlands, but also the improved back-office capabilities -- we invest
a lot in improving our back-office capabilities -- will all be the basis for to see that the
pipeline which is coming will also convert into actual business.
The second element I'd like to bring maybe to your attention because I think it's an
important change going forward, you're well aware of the tax changes in the Netherlands,
so the contribution rate, effectively which is tax free, has being reduced. But probably
more important also is that there is a cap now on the amount that's pensionable, and it's
EUR100,000 now. And that means that we see a lot of opportunities effectively to offer
Page 17 of 27



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2014-02-20

FINAL

our customers that have a pension which is in a tax-efficient place to be complemented
with more capabilities in terms of saving for the future.
So we'll be focusing not only on our group pension customers and the contributors, but
also to them individually, in particular for all of those that now see a cap and need to find
different ways of replacing their retirement savings for the future. So that is an additional
capability where we are very much focusing on. And with all the efforts we're putting in
place to connecting better with our customers, those that contribute to the pension plans,
with all the digital and technology investments we're making, we believe we're well
positioned to take advantage of that new opportunity emerging as a result of the
legislative changes in, here in the Netherlands.

Hello. Thank you. Two questions please. The first one, can you update your guidance
please of what would be the impact on underlying earnings if yields stayed unchanged
where they are today?
And then secondly, can you remind me your dividend policy now with regards to interim
dividends? Are we back to the former-times policy of interim dividends being fixed at the
final dividend or do you retain flexibility for interim dividend movements? Thank you.

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes. On the interest rate sensitivities, we really haven't updated those from what we've
previously put out in the market.
So what we're seeing, I think it's -- I think the biggest thing to keep in mind is that the
book yields, particularly in the US, and this is where most of the interest rate sensitivity
comes from, the book yields are down around 5% now, maybe just a little bit below that,
and we're getting new-money investments in the low 4s now. So that differential versus
what we had two or three years ago when the book yields were 6% and we were getting
new money investment yields of 3%, so that differential has shrunk significantly.
We've also lowered our long-term interest rate assumptions back in the Third Quarter
when we took the DAC write-off and the assumption change back in the Third Quarter. So
our expectations for rising interest rates have been pushed out significantly. So that
lowers the overall sensitivity, but we haven't put any new guidance in the market and I'm
not prepared to give any here today.

Yes. Good morning everybody. This is Francois Boissin from Exane BNP Paribas. Two
questions please. The first one is on your cash flows. Basically you've reported a stronger
market value of new business over the past years. I was wondering if this could translate
into higher cash flows going forward. Basically is there room to improve your mid-term
guidance on that?
And the second point is on dividends. So just to come back on the interim dividend and
what you put in slide 16 in your presentation, is the EUR460 million a fixed amount or are
you ready to go beyond this for 2014? And basically should we assume that EUR0.11 is
what you aim to pay as an interim dividend or could you go higher than that? Thank you.

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Hi Francois. It's Darryl. I'll take those. The short answer is, yes, the MCVNB will translate
into higher operational free cash flow, higher earnings, higher ROEs going forward. That's
an important part of our story. We've been able to get all of the products reset to be very
attractive, very profitable margins in this low-rate environment. And I think that's the most
important part of the MCVNBs, is that we have the profitable new business which is going
to take our ROE, earnings and operational free cash flows and propel them forward going
forwards. So I think the answer is a definitive yes.
In terms of the interim dividend on slide 16, I wouldn't read too much into this. We've tried
to caveat with the footnotes that are there. We're not going to forecast or give guidance
on our dividend. So the footnote is simply saying that we're assuming that it's flat,
although Alex has stated very clearly that our ambition and our goal is to provide a
sustainably growing dividend going forward.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

And a sustainably growing dividend as well as buying back any scrip dividend that we pay
to those of our shareholders that elect specifically to have scrip dividends. So we want to
pay it fully in cash.

The full cash dividend.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Okay. That's very clear. Just coming back on the potential improvement in free cash flow,
basically what timeframe should we be thinking of in terms of significant improvement, in
your opinion?

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Well, in the short term you really -- obviously the new business is an accretion over time
and then so it has a horizon -- we're a long-term business and it has a long-term horizon
associated with it. It's incremental and over a long period of time. In the short term the
operational free cash flows will probably most be impacted by the step change that I
mentioned earlier in the UK, where really when we clear 2014 and head into 2015 we
expect the UK, consistent with the guidance that I showed back in the summer, we expect
the UK to come out of the zero-to-a-small-loss territory that they're in now, up into the
EUR150m, EUR200 million range by 2015.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Okay. And then for the, basically the higher-margin business being sourced in the US, this
is something that you see beyond 2016 basically?

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes, the US, the other phenomenon that we talked about in the US, obviously these
MCVNBs and the profit on the new business and the transition to the fee business is all
accelerating free cash flow generation from that part of the growth business. But we have
to offset the other issue that was raised earlier, which is the incremental impact and the
decline that's coming from the rundown of the run-off business and the spread
businesses as those get smaller.

Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2014-02-20

FINAL

Firstly, just on the discussion about capital, you've been quite clear about what you expect
in the UK. But just looking on a slightly wider perspective, you have cleared 2015 returnon-equity goals. The largest, say, obstacles it seems to getting those are realizing the runoff and getting the returns up in the UK on those large blocks of capital employed. Can
you maybe just give a sense on how you perceive the opportunity to make those goals in
2015 through these businesses as part of Aegon or think about -- give some sense of if
that is not the case whether there are opportunities to review these situations again.
And then on the variable annuity business, you talked about a potentially more
competitive market. Can you give a sense as to whether this is something you're already
seeing in new business working on now or was that just a long-term view expressed that
returns are very good and expecting it to stay that way, but that you hadn't seen any
change at this moment? Thank you.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you for your question. Yes, I think we have been again very clear that we want to
address those run-off businesses. These businesses are not part of our core businesses
and obviously if we can accelerate that through a sale we would certainly entertain that.
But again I said we want to do that in a way that we're not destroying shareholder value.
On the other side we're now seeing that there is more appetite for these type of
transactions and we're putting all our efforts in trying to get this executed.
But on the UK, I can only repeat what I repeated earlier, is we've looked at the various
options we have. We do recognize that the returns are far from where they need to be.
We have had a number of options explored. As I said, was putting it in run-off, which we
felt was not an attractive option; we would have lost an enormous amount of value.
Dealing with it ourselves, taking ourselves the measures that need to be taken, taking our
costs down very significantly, the 25% cost reduction we've had. We will have further cost
reductions. We've had also a lot or a significant reduction of employees, from over 4,500
to something around above 2,000 right now, and more will have to take place. So we've
taken these actions.
And the final one is obviously we've also considered would there be a possibility to
transact, and we've come to the conclusion us taking the measures we need to take was
really the best option at that point in time.
And we are really executing on that option. And I think we're also delivering on what we're
promising, which is important, taking our costs down, restructuring our business in the UK,
at the same time positioning it that we are able to maintain these assets which we have
on our books, in our system, from an old platform environment to a new modern
platform, which I'm very pleased also to say has been receiving quite a number of
rewards. So that is promising. We'll continue to execute on the plans in the UK.
Now in terms of the margins of the variable annuity business, yes, these margins are high
margins, in the low 20s. And it's more a reflection of the fact that these margins are high
that I made a comment that we do expect and have to expect that these margins will
Page 21 of 27



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2014-02-20

come down. But what is important is that we continue to be committed in maintaining at
all times our pricing discipline for new business, and I believe there's more than enough
room in this environment to be able to maintain that.

Q - Peter Testa

{BIO 2162867 <GO>}

FINAL

Right. Okay. Thank you. I have just one follow-up question on capital.
You make the very clear statement that you look to grow your dividend over time, which is
a good, a strong goal. To what extent do you think there's an opportunity to go beyond
delevering with the excess capital streamed up, maybe not in early 2014, but over the
medium term of the business? Because you've been delevering now for some time.
You've repaid a lot of high-yield debt. You have a strong balance sheet structure,
especially prospectively given the strong cash flow comment earlier. To what extent
should we just expect continued delevering or other capital steps in the medium term?

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

I'm pleased to hear that you recognize that we have a sound policy on dividends, stable
but growing dividend. Clearly we are also looking, and we have signaled in the past and
I'd like to reiterate it right now, that it is our intention to neutralize the effect of the dilution
which came with the transaction to cancel our preferred shares with the Aegon
Association. We've given that intention over a longer period of time and that could be one
of the ways of redeploying our capital.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Hi. It's Gordon Aitken from RBC. A couple of questions please. First on your Dutch
pensions buyout business. You mentioned you've got a good pipeline. There's a
competitor this morning reporting an acceleration of that business in the Fourth Quarter
with improved margins. So I'm wondering if you can say what the IRR on that pensions
business is for you in the Dutch market.
And the second question on the UK, you've pulled away from annuities in recent years,
but you've built a very decent drawdown capability. Now drawdown sales for the market
were down 40% in 2013. Probably got more, definitely got more to do with demographics
than anything else. But drawdown has to improve presumably as pension pot sizes
increase in the UK. Can you talk a bit about what your growth prospects are in drawdown
and how much competition there is in that market? Thank you.

Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity

FINAL

Yes, in terms of the buyout business in the Netherlands, which are effectively transferring
assets to us and us taking over the liabilities, again, here we are committed to maintaining
strict pricing discipline. We've done that all along. And that means that you see also
somewhat of a lumpiness in the sales quarter over quarter. So our pricing discipline means
we have to achieve at least returns of 10% and you can be sure that we are delivering on
that target ratio.
In terms of drawdown, Darryl?

A - Darryl Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yes, the only thing I can say is I agree with you, we agree with you, that the drawdown in
the UK is going to be an increasingly important product going forward. And so we're
actually very bullish about the prospects for enhanced drawdown products and that's
going to be something, in fact that's something we're undertaking and enhancing that on
our platform. And that's an objective over the next 18 months to enhance the product
there. So I would say we're bullish there.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Can I just come back on the first part on the Dutch pensions business? You talk -- there's a
real lack of supply. As I understand it, there's only a couple of players in this market at the
moment. So you talk about needing to maintain IRRs and -- who's keeping the pricing
tight? Is it the consultants? Because presumably the pension funds have got nowhere else
to go apart from -- there's only two people writing this business.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Gordon, you're right to say that the number of suppliers in this business has been
reduced and I would say that we as Aegon particularly I think are an attractive provider
because we have a strong capital position. And I think it's easy to understand that when a
company, a corporate, a CFO of a corporate takes a decision to transfer liabilities, and
these liabilities are liabilities over a very long period of time, it is important that they look
at a provider such as Aegon that has a strong capital position and is committed to
maintain a strong capital position.
We at the same time also want to maintain our pricing discipline and that's where we find
we're looking for the right balance. You're absolutely right; there is a flow coming. We
want to maintain our pricing discipline.
We're not in a hurry to take over all the schemes at once. Taking over a scheme, setting
up a new scheme, it requires a lot of work.
We want to make sure we do that right and that's why we invest also in our back-office
capabilities because it's important that we provide an excellent quality of service to not
only the corporate that transfers to the pension, but to each and every single contributor,
employee in the pension scheme because we believe not only the opportunity is with the
overall corporate scheme, but it's all the add-on business we can do, in particular now in

the context of the changing tax legislation, which means we'll get more access and there
will be more need to save outside of the corporate pension plan.

FINAL

So it is a business which we are clearly very much focused on, but we look at it beyond
purely a corporate pension transaction. It is about all the millions of employees which
effectively we have as part of these corporate pension schemes where we think the big
opportunity's going long and forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Good morning. I have two questions, both on the Netherlands actually. I was
wondering, so many competitors are, in the Dutch market are preparing to be sold or for
a sale and I was wondering if you see that as an advantage or a disadvantage
competitively for you this year.
My second question was, and I'm sorry if I missed it, if you can give an update on how
your talks are going with Koersplan de Weg Kwijt, and other unit-linked client, and also if
you're seeing new proceedings coming your way. You seem to be warning for that, and I
was wondering if you can comment on that. Thank you.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Well, Maud, in general on the Dutch market I think there is an absolute and broad
recognition that there is overcapacity so any form of consolidation on the longer run will
be positive for our market. Let me repeat our position here, and we said that clearly this
morning, our focus is on growing our business organically.
Now your second question is about the Stichting. We have come to an agreement with
the Stichting, as you know. And that means we've agreed to implement certain
agreements and that is an agreement with 35,000 policyholders. And our priority now is
to get this done and implemented. And we've already dealt with certain groups of that
35,000 and I hope and expect that before this summer we can have that process entirely
completed. You asked me if we had more proceedings, as you call it. For the time being
we have not seen more proceedings coming to us.

Q - Maud van Gaal
Thank you.

Archie van Riemsdijk from Dow Jones. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Archie van Riemsdijk
Yes. Good morning. This is Archie of Dow Jones. I was wondering, on the run-off
businesses that you might want to try to sell and you see increased appetite, can you give
some -- well, can you describe them a little bit and, yes, to which kind of parties would be
interested in buying them?

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Archie, you know the run-off businesses we have. They're clearly stated in all our
reporting. I think it's too early now to speculate on what pieces or what parts could
potentially be sold to what. What I did say, and happy to repeat that, is that clearly it has
our attention and we would like to be able to accelerate that run-off. And obviously if we
are able to transfer to another party that would help the run-off and accelerate the runoff.

Q - Archie van Riemsdijk
Okay. And, yes, you don't have a target or expectation that you can sell at least one of
them or something like that?

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

I've been very clear that we're working on that and that's all I can say right now.

Q - Archie van Riemsdijk
Okay. Thank you.

Q - Chris van Alem
Good morning. Chris van Alem, De Persdienst. I would like to come back on the Koersplan
discussions. I would like to know what the average compensation issue you will be paying
to these 35,000 customers you mentioned earlier.
And the second question is about the Stichting Woekerpolis process. I understood that
they're having talks with Aegon about compensation as well. Do you recognize them as a
party? Are you making progress in the talks and have you made provisions for an extra
number of clients that need to be compensated? Thank you.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Yes, in terms of average compensation, the best way I can guide you is that we have
announced a provision of EUR25 million and we have around 35 million -- 35,000, excuse

me, customers. But, again, these are all very different customers so I'm not sure that an
average tells you a lot. What is important is that we have come to an agreement with
Sticthting on how to implement the measures. And what we want to do is to make sure
that every single of those customers that were part of that Stichting gets what we've
agreed today, which should proceed before the summer. And that's really what we are
focusing on.
And second question, I said to you that our priority today is let's focus on dealing with the
35,000 members of the Stichting and we want to get this done before we start on
anything else.

Q - Chris van Alem
Okay. But at least the question about the Stichting Woekerpolis process, could you
elaborate on that?

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. We are and continue to be in discussions with them and obviously it's way too early
to share anything with you. We'll certainly share something with you when it's time, but we
are discussing consistent with what we have always said. We would like to have this whole
issue around mis-selling behind us. It is not a good thing for the industry. It's, as such, not a
good thing for Aegon. What we would like is that the customers feel the trust in the
sector, the trust in Aegon. And what we are doing is therefore executing very diligently on
the Stichting and the 35,000 customers there, which is that they get what we have
promised and they get it in a timely way.

Q - Chris van Alem
Yes. But could you tell me how many people the Stichting is representing?

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

35,000 roughly. That's the number of the Stichting.

Q - Chris van Alem
No. The Stichting Woekerpolis, I mean the Stichting Woekerpolis process.

A - Alex Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

I'm not aware of the number. I'm not aware of that number. I'd be happy to look into it and
ask Robin Boon, who is the Head of our Communication, to come back to you if that
number is available. Yes.

Q - Chris van Alem
Okay. Great. Thank you.
