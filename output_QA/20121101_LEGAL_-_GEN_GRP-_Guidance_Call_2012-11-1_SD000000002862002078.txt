Presentation
Operator
Good morning. Welcome to the Q3 IMS conference call. (Operator Instructions) I'd just like
to remind you this conference call is being recorded. And today I'm pleased to present
Kate Vennell, Head of Investor Relations. Please begin your meeting.

Kate Vennell
Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining Legal and General's Q3 update call.
Wadham Downing, Interim CFO, will chair the call this morning. And is joined by several of
our colleagues. In the room we have John Pollock, Chief Executive for Protection and
Annuities and Mark Gregory, Chief Executive for Savings. Also joining us from the US is
Mark Zinkula, Chief Executive for LGIM.
They will be delighted to answer any questions you have. But first Wadham will give a
short summary of the results.

Good morning. And thank you, everyone, for making time to join this call.

FINAL

As you'll see from this morning's press release we have delivered record Third Quarter
sales; up 28% in Q3 and up 6% year to date. Of particular mention in the quarter UK
Protection is up 30%; and US Protection up 33%; individual annuities up 13% with GBP350
million of premiums received in the quarter.
In our Savings business auto enrolment is now underway. And together with the transfers
of existing schemes, has led to net inflows in workplace pensions of GBP429 million. Mark
Gregory will tell you more about this during the call.
LGIM is making visible progress in expanding into new markets; America, Europe and Asia,
with flows from international clients of GBP5.6 billion so far this year; GBP3.3 billion in Q3
alone.
On financials, our cash performance is strong. Total operational cash at GBP702 million.
Within that our business units delivered growing operational cash, up GBP25 million from
GBP661 million to GBP686 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net cash at the business unit level was up GBP44 million from GBP556 million to GBP600
million. Total net cash for the Group is both substantial and diversified, up GBP15 million to
GPB616 million. And we remain on track to deliver our cash targets we reiterated at the
half year.
We continue to strengthen our capital position. You will see in our announcement in
September of a further tranche of US capital restructuring, improving LGA's capital
position by $200 million and our IGD surplus by GBP88 million; also worth mentioning, no
defaults in our LGPL annuity portfolio.
On outlook we remain positive. The businesses are trading strongly. We are excited about
playing a bigger part in our infrastructure investment with GBP900 million invested in
project year to date.
We are confident our businesses can continue to grow to provide more value for both our
customers and shareholders.
I'll now open the call to questions.

Can I ask three quick questions? Firstly, just an update on the pipeline on the Annuity
business, please, as usual.

FINAL

Secondly, the impact of the changes you're making on the asset side of the balance
sheet; perhaps you can talk about the impact that that's having on your expected
investment return.
And thirdly, I notice a statement from Nigel talking about accelerating earnings growth. I
would imagine that that would need to have some sort of assets under management
growth as well. That's not a particularly strong features of these results. There's a lot of
inflows. But also some outflows as well. So I wonder if you could comment around what
would be -- what would need to be in place now to see an acceleration of earnings
growth at the Company. Thank you.

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

First question, John. And maybe a bit around assets as well, in terms of annuities?

A - John Pollock

{BIO 6037447 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. The pipeline for Annuities is much as it was. It's a relatively quiet market but, as you
know, very lumpy. And we have seen some larger scheme quotes emerging in the
market; very often that's price testing. So pipeline of committed sales is always
impossible to predict. So it's not a brilliant description.
But the market seems to be reasonably active. But I think it's more about price testing
than real commitment. But we're fairly optimistic. Demand is still strong and we're fairly
optimistic over the foreseeable future.

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

You didn't say anything about assets and infrastructure and --

A - John Pollock

{BIO 6037447 <GO>}

Well yes, there has been a lot of work on the asset side of the balance sheet. We've been
-- we haven't been out there hunting yield; we've been very cautious in the management
of the business. As you indicate de-risking gives us certainty of returns.
We're blessed with having the LGIM capability and competency here, where we have
been de-risking. But without much impact on yield. So as a consequence, I don't expect
there to be much impact on our investment return.

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

On the shareholder side of assets, Blair, we highlighted at the half year a tax
proposition[ph] in cash. Since the half year we've had to reduce cash levels a little bit,
diversified our exposure away from concentrated developed markets, reflecting our
views in opportunities in more global markets.

FINAL

Then on the earnings growth, yes, we've been talking around stocks of our businesses,
not only assets under management. But premiums. And you'll see the premium growth
coming through the press release. And I think you will see us more talking around EPS
measures and earnings going forward. We're keen to show the impacts on our financials
of the growth we're seeing coming through in our businesses.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

And would it be fair to say, would you agree with that statement that to -- in order to see
an acceleration in profits growth you would need to see a pick-up in assets under
management growth? Or do you think there's more you can do on the margins?

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

Mark might want to comment a bit around the mix of -- Mark said, as it were, the mix of
businesses coming in. But yes, it'll be growth as stock across our businesses, whether
that's assets under management, premiums, or assets under administration.

A - Mark Zinkula

{BIO 16142450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

This is Mark Zinkula calling in from the US.
I would echo those comments. I think you have to look at, certainly, net inflows, which are
up considerably year over year. But we want to increase those over time. But as well as
the mix of business. So as we write more, or win more fixed income and ODI mandates,
those are higher margin mandates and, ultimately, will contribute to earnings growth as
well.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
Jon Hocking, Morgan Stanley.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

I've just got three questions, if I may. Firstly on capital, you haven't given an update on
capital in the statement, unless I've missed it. So if you could just give us some comments
on where you sit versus the first half.
Then secondly, I noticed in the statement there's a comment about you want the Solvency
II rules to incentivize you for investing in infrastructure and long-term assets. There's a
comment there about making long-term equity investments. I just wondered whether you
could give any update on where you think Solvency II is going to land, if it's got any chance
for lowering equity investment to be an advantaged asset class.

FINAL

Then, finally, just going back to Blair's question about earnings growth; given the capital
intensity of your business, surely it makes more sense to target ROE rather than EPS? I
think the -- your sector doesn't have a particularly happy track record of companies
focusing on EPS growth rather than book value growth. I wondered if you could comment
on that. Thank you.

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

Okay, certainly. Capital, as you know, we don't issue IGD numbers in Q1/Q3. We do
provide with sensitivities in our year-end accounts. So if you take your half-year GBP3.8
million you can work out where we have tracked from there. Then we also -- don't forget
our press release in September, which highlighted IGD benefit of GBP88 million.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

So there's no departure from the sensitivity application in the first half, if we do that we're
not going to come up with a wildly correct answer?

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

I don't think you'll come out with anything wildly different.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

On Solvency II, yes, we have -- we do make a big thing around infrastructure. We're very
keen to demonstrate our social purpose in terms of infrastructure. And we've
demonstrated that with GBP900 million in terms of -- in investments so far.
We do require the Solvency II rules to support us in, not only that. But also playing a wider
part. And we've highlighted equities as well there as something that we can see a
purpose for.
And on the third one, ROE as well as EPS I think you'll see coming forward. We already
have ROE within our KPIs. I think EPS you'll see coming through as well. So I think it'll be a
combination of all those.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay, excellent. Thank you.

FINAL

Three questions, if I could. The first one is on the extension and the infrastructure
investments. Now, could you possibly break-out the positive impact of investing in the
infrastructure projects and the loss that you're making on selling the Bank sub-debt?
The problem here is that, obviously, a big chunk of your annuity profits and cash flow are
coming from reinvestment on the annuity portfolio and, as you extend the spread
duration, those reinvestment profits disappear. So effectively, you could record pretty
much whatever EPS you like by moving into longer duration spread assets through
infrastructure. But obviously that's not necessarily sustainable. So it would be good to
know what's going on that side?
The other point is following on from Blair's question about asset management growth. It
seems that you're basically growing less in the IFA space, in terms of asset inflows. And
more in the EBC lower charge space. So could you give us an idea of the fee income on
the back book, versus fee income on business you've written during the first nine months?
And the third point was related to that, coming back to my favorite topic of what I
describe as a supermarket sweep, where you're mopping up a lot of these defined
benefit -- sorry, defined contribution pension schemes post auto enrolment.

Bloomberg Transcript

Aren't you going to incur a lot of sterling reserve cost, which is not reflected in IFRS and
not reflected in operating cash, as a result of writing lots of small ticket pension items,
which is a real IGD cost. But not necessarily an IFA cost -- sorry, not necessarily an IFRS
cost? And isn't your IFRS and operating cash, therefore, going to over-state the real cash
as you write these pension schemes? Thanks.

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

Okay, sure. The first one should go to John and then to Mark.

A - John Pollock

{BIO 6037447 <GO>}

Yes. It is pretty straight forward, Andy. We don't really have too much re-investment risk,
because we duration match at outset. So we'll take long duration assets and any interest
rate swaps to get to duration matching. So we're not really taking a huge amount of
reinvestment risk.
That said, what we think is quite important. And just amplifying what Wadham said, is that
this sector can aid with a recovery towards growth in the UK, if we are capable of
participating in infrastructure investments. And the government has been making some
positive noises about investment banks and infrastructure banks, which we think we may
well be able to invest in.
We already invest in things like student accommodation, which are part of the long-term
infrastructure landscape of the UK. So we think these are very suitable assets for annuity
play, as well as for playing a part in the social usefulness of our organization. So I don't
think some of your comments about profits coming from reinvestment risk and whatever
are entirely accurate.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

FINAL

So you don't see -- so when you write an annuity contract and invest in a BB bond that
goes on for seven years and you're in a high yield for seven years following that you have
to assume risk free, when you get to the end of the seven years and you reinvest that at
a higher rate than risk free that doesn't generate a profit for you.

A - John Pollock

{BIO 6037447 <GO>}

Well first off, we don't go too far down the yield search in BB, Andy. We've had pretty
clear asset disclosures and we don't do that. If we were doing that, we would have an
awful lot of money in Greek bonds, which, clearly, we don't. So your hypothesis from the
start is slightly flawed there (multiple speakers).

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Okay, no, no. I'm talking about spread duration. So okay forget --

A - John Pollock

{BIO 6037447 <GO>}

No. I understand what you're saying. But the principle of what you're saying is we'd be
accurate if we behaved in that way. But we don't. As I said at the beginning, we tend to
duration match assets and not have large uncovered mismatch risk. So whilst I understand
the logic of what you're saying, it's not how we behave in the asset portfolio
management.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

So you're saying there's no profit from extending the spread duration on the
infrastructure projects?

A - John Pollock

{BIO 6037447 <GO>}

I'm not saying there's no profit. I'm saying that the amplification that you're giving is not
quite how the overall portfolio management is working.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Move onto Mark.

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay, just to pick up on your point around it's a shift from IFAs to EBCs during the course
of this period. Clearly, there's a couple of things going on there, Andy. First and foremost,
clearly, ahead of RDR, a lot of IFAs are clearly having to adjust their operating model. So in
no sense is L&G turning its back on the IFA marketplace and, indeed, we expect that to be
-- no, to come back over as it just allied[ph] post-RDR.
But having said that and, clearly, in the short term that's coincided with a strong push in
the corporate pensions space. And we've seen the EBC volumes go up at the same time
as perhaps our retail IFA volumes have come down.
Page 7 of 20



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C
Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2012-11-01

FINAL

In terms of your question around kind of what that means in terms of fee income, I think
the way to think about it is that they are just very different shapes of business. Particularly
for an IFA, we get transactional-type business; a bond here, a pension there, etc., which
might look kind of higher gross margin. But I think when we think of our business it's much
more in a kind of net margin basis.
So again, we've invested in our corporate pension space to make sure we can handle
volume very efficiently. So -- and, again, we're just seeing that as being much lumpier,
bigger volumes of business. But coming through with efficient and scale-able systems;
meaning that's speeding through to the bottom line. So just a very different shape of
business, I think, between retail IFA business and EBC business, generally.
Then onto your subsequent question around the impact of sterling reserves on small pots
and, indeed, the floater into IFRS profits, you're quite right to say that they don't feature
in IFRS operating profit definitions. But we do include sterling reserves in our definition of
net cash. So it goes through the stray numbers. So there will be no hiding of the
implications of writing small pot business, maybe I'll make the same point I made on the
previous comments. We've invested very heavily to make sure that this business comes
on very efficiently. So the level of variables/attributable costs that we expect to allocate to
that business won't be -- actually, be that high. We've made the investment and this
business is coming on very, very quickly[ph].

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Should we expect a strain then in net cash when auto enrolment starts and this business
comes on. I mean even if it's got, I don't know, an GBP8 per year sort of allowance, you're
not going to be getting anywhere near the amount of GBP8 of fees for quite some time
for some of these people on auto enrolment. So are you going to have a cash impact
then if you're reflecting positive sterling reserves in cash?

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

I'm expecting a non-material impact from sterling reserves.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

Okay. Next question.

Operator
Oliver Steel, Deutsche Bank.

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Two sort of broad questions; the first is on the protection side. At the interim, I thought
you said that the sort of surge in public sector group protection buying had been a bit
Page 8 of 20



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C
Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2012-11-01

FINAL

exceptional. But it's, clearly, continued in the Third Quarter and I'm just wondering what
exactly is happening there, how big that market could be and where you're positioned in
that.
Then secondly, on protection -- I'm sorry, this is developing into three questions. Secondly,
on protection is the growth rate in your stock of premiums in UK Protection has gone
from, I think, 2% last year to 6% so far this year on a 20% year-to-date growth in new
business. And I'm just wondering if you can sort of help us with the translation from new
business growth into the stock of premium growth if, let's say, we're looking forward over
the next 12 months.
The third question I've got is on LGIM. You've grown very strongly overseas. But I don't
think I've seen a quarterly breakdown of the net inflows from overseas. So I wonder if you
could just give us that.

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

Okay, the third one will go to Mark Z. But start off with John.

A - John Pollock

{BIO 6037447 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, I'm sorry, Oliver, if I implied that there was either a surge or that it was one-off in
nature. What I -- if I didn't say this, what I meant to say was that we had started work really
off the back of the very strong public sector connections that we have with LGIM in being
able to facilitate some product support for them as they are looking for cost savings.
So we've been able to deploy a product into the councils that has gone particularly well. I
don't think that it is particularly one-off in nature. It, basically, insulates them from the costs
of ill health early retirement. And as a consequence, it looks a little bit like us to our
GIP[ph] product.
So we think that's just a sector that is -- that has been opened up by our engagement and
I don't really see any particular reason for that market to go away any time soon. So I'm
reasonably optimistic about our continued success in that space.
Just turning to stock versus new business, new business is really, you could think about it
as determining the rate of growth of stock, because we've always got claims and lapses
going off the back book. So they might have new business that we're putting on,
determines, if you like, the rate of growth of the overall portfolio. So a strong rate of new
business growth, which we have seen, has helped drive up the rate of growth in the stock.

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

Third question, Mark, do you want to answer the LGIM question?

{BIO 16142450 <GO>}

FINAL

Sure, yes. The -- I don't have the numbers committed to memory. But we had strong net
inflows in the Third Quarter from overseas. I think as I recall it was -- I believe it was
GBP3.3 billion for the quarter. Overall, net inflows were slightly up over the quarter. Again,
going from memory, I think it was GBP0.6 billion, as I recall.
So the bulk of the net new business was in the first half of the year. We had a quiet
August. It's not unusual for the Third Quarter to be somewhat quiet, given that it's the
overlap with the summer months. But we've had a good, strong finish to the quarter; it's
continued into the Fourth Quarter.

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

Okay. Next question.

Operator
Ashik Musaddi, JPMorgan.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Three questions. If I heard it correctly, you mentioned that the international, the LGIM
inflows from international is GBP3.3 billion and the Group inflows for LGIM overall inflows is
GBP0.6 billion in this quarter, i.e., there's a big outflow of GBP2.7 billion in the UK. Now can
you give some more color on what that is and what kind of margin was that?
The second question would be can you give us some color on the labor turnover in the
auto enrolment that you have taken like Sainsbury, ASDA, M&S, etc? And how does that
come back with your normal group pension portfolio?
The third one is can you give us some color on the margins on annuities and protection? Is
there any kind of contraction in margins you have seen in the Third Quarter, or is it normal
or is it going up? Thank you.

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

Okay. So start with Mark Z, then Mark G and then John.

A - Mark Zinkula

{BIO 16142450 <GO>}

Great, yes. So if I interpreted your question correctly, it was in regards to strong
international growth. But net outflows on the UK book so -- and we've been pretty open
about this and discussed it. Last year is the first year we saw net outflows in our passive
book.

Page 10 of 20



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C
Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2012-11-01

FINAL

So we have the UK DB market is a very mature market. We have a large market share and
we're trying to protect our position there. And are successfully doing that, particularly. But
most of the outflows are going to be in our passive book.
So correspondingly, we still have persistency rates that are north of 90%, which are
outstanding levels. And so we're keeping a lot of clients on the books and, as they're
transitioning out of equities and de-risking in the fixed income and LDI strategies, we're
doing a good job of transitioning a lot of those clients.
So even though we'll see -- could see net outflows on the UK DB book, if there's slight
net outflows on passive mandates and, ultimately, growth in fixed income and LDI
mandates, you could still see profit expansion even though it's a very mature market and
a soon-to-be declining market, very gradually declining market.

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay, picking up on your question about labor turnover and auto enrolment schemes, the
key point here, Ashik, is the fact that we underwrite every scheme individually. So there's
no kind of a take it price out there. So if a scheme's got different characteristics, such as
perhaps higher labor turnover, we will price for that accordingly. So that's absolutely part
of our underwriting process.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Pollock

{BIO 6037447 <GO>}

And yes, just on P&A margins, I am very happy with our margins; very happy, indeed.
There's been no particular margin pressure in any of our lines of business during this
quarter. So I'm very comfortable.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Thanks a lot.

Operator
Greig Paterson, KBW.

Q - Greig Paterson
Just three quick question. One is am I understanding this correctly? You've now decided
you're going to de-emphasize the cash flow metric that you've been trying to get
investors to focus on for the last two years and moving back to an embedded value EPStype arrangement, which -- that's the message that we're getting; anyway, if you can just
talk about on that.
Second point is, just workplace pensions, I think if you just look at the consensus and what
the actual number was, I think people got a bit sort of -- there was a misunderstanding
around how you book the surge in workplace pensions you've won. I wonder if you could - the stuff you've announced today, to what extent is that going to transition in the Fourth

Page 11 of 20



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C
Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2012-11-01

Quarter or the First Quarter next year and we have to sort of up our numbers from that
process? In other words, what have you announced to date and not booked yet?

FINAL

And the third question is just sort of quarter to date, I wonder if you can talk about on the
individual annuity side, whether you had seen any material impacts on people positioning
around gender pricing in individual annuities.

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

Okay, I'll take the first and then pass it onto Mark and John.
No, you haven't -- we haven't moved into that direction, I have to say, Greig. What we're
just underlining is that we just want to translate the strong operating performance into
strong earnings growth. And we will be promoting up the order some of the other
metrics. We're still very focused on cash and our cash targets.

Q - Greig Paterson
Just in particular, because you said that EPS are going into KPIs. Now, there's a strong
correlation between IFRS and your statutory cash flow. So I can only understand that as
meaning that the EV/EPS are now going to come into the KPIs. Is that a correct
understanding?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

No. That's not quite what I said either; it's that we have ROE, which is going to be -- I think
at the half year, you will have noticed that we promoted EPS and ROE into our headline
financials. And I'd expect us to be doing the same in our end of year statement. But that's
(multiple speakers).

Q - Greig Paterson
What accounting regime are you going to focus on for the EPS? That's what I'm trying to
ascertain.

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

So this is IFRS EPS (multiple speakers).

Q - Greig Paterson
All right. So there's no re-emphasis of EV?

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

No. There won't be, I'm afraid.

Q - Greig Paterson
All right. No problem.

FINAL

A - Mark Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Just on the -- just to help you with your forecasting, Greig, just to perhaps be clear. So in
Q3, just to perhaps go it through it step by step. What we saw in Q3 is the kind of names
we put in the press release today.
So we saw the pension scheme transfer of -- for Marks & Spencer during that quarter, as
well as their existing pension savers coming across to L&G; so that was in the numbers.
Likewise, the conversion of the Sainsbury's pension scheme was in the Q3 numbers.
In Q4, we would expect to see the bulk of the other pension schemes transfer across to
L&G during the Q4 period. And we will see the first of the big auto-enrollee scheme; so
Sainsbury's will auto enroll during Q4. Then in Q1 next year, we'll see the vast majority of
the new auto enrollees will come onto the books. So there is a phasing going on here.

Q - Greig Paterson
What I think has[ph] given magnitude, for the Fourth Quarter, the bulk of the rest of the
scheme's coming in, is it, on a par with the Third Quarter, M&S and Sainsbury's, below or
above time[ph]?

Yes, nice try, Greig. Yes, gender pricing impact, the rules are all pretty clear. And I think
most of the major players in the market have indicated when they're going to move.
And what we're actually seeing in terms of how the transition on December 21 will take
place is people making sure that they're slightly extending their price guarantee period to
allow for the cash to move from the ceding scheme into the annuity, just to make sure
that people aren't disadvantaged around that period of time.

FINAL

But in terms of any kind of pre-activity, what you've got to remember -- and I do think I
probably say this pretty well every time, the vast majority of people don't have a huge
amount of choice over when they retire or when they draw their income. Our pot size is
still around 30,000, which indicates the scale of the people that are annuitizing and the
demographic that are annuitizing. So we're not really seeing much impact yet from
gender price planning. And that doesn't surprise me.
That said, it is possible that some of the market, at the margin -- some of the market
growth at the margins is being driven by those people who have a capability to choose in
bringing forward their drawdown of their annuity. But it is definitely at the margins, Greig.

Q - Greig Paterson
Sure. Sorry, I'll sneak in a quick other question. I see you've gained market share in UK
health. And it's in the light of others gaining market share in UK health. I'm wondering what
sort of reduction in the combined ratio -- the pure combined ratio we need to factor in for
the full year? Is it going to be large, a little? And how much rate have you given up to
achieve that surge in market share?

A - John Pollock

{BIO 6037447 <GO>}

Greig, dear oh dear. That is just not how we behave. And you know that. So that's a very
cheeky question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Greig Paterson
Well I moved to you guys (multiple speakers).

A - John Pollock

{BIO 6037447 <GO>}

What we have done is, we have deployed some capability and grown particularly in
indirect[ph]. We -- so we've opened up our capability and grown the business. But we just
are always extremely selective on price. So we're not desperately trying to grow the top
line, unless it contributes very much to bottom line growth.
So our growth is not some kind of desperate whatever; it's opening up new channels.
We've signed some new distribution arrangements within the broker channel. And the
business is growing very nicely. But it is not sacrificing core just to get top line growth.

Q - Greig Paterson
No. It was just worrying me, because my premium halved when I moved to you guys. And I
just wanted to acknowledge that it was because I'm a better risk as you obviously see[ph]
that's the case, yes?

A - John Pollock

{BIO 6037447 <GO>}

Yes. You clearly are, Greig. You, clearly, are not in a flood zone. Even if you were actually,
you're tall enough to be able to wade through the water.

A couple of questions. The first one is a follow-up on asset management, with the
successful diversification outside the UK. But outflows in the UK. Now, your traditional
strength has always been in the UK managing indexed equities for the UK DB pension
schemes. Now, these schemes are closed to new entrants. And in some cases, future
accrual. Just wondering, are you seeing the benchmarks of these DB pension funds
gradually shifting towards bonds, as they mature? That's the first question.
And secondly on bulks, there's a real lack of supply in the bulk market now. Who are you
seeing, who are you up against when a scheme is being brokered?

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. The first one, Mark Z and then John.

A - Mark Zinkula

{BIO 16142450 <GO>}

Sure. Yes. There's definitely a trend. I'd say, it's not so much of a benchmark -- excuse me,
a benchmark change towards bonds as it is toward, I guess I'd describe it as, funded
status volatility. So there's clearly been a shift in the UK. And it's now happening in the US.
So our US business model is really built to focus on this phenomenon, where there's a
fundamental shift in the way that most plans are thinking about managing the asset risk.
And it's less of a weighted average risk mix of market benchmarks. And a traditional
whatever it would be, 60/40 or 50/50 split equities bonds. And now, rather it's more of a
liability-based benchmark.
And different plans have different tolerance levels on how much volatility that they can
sustain around funded status volatility; around that specific benchmark. That's going to be
different for each plan because, again, the characteristics are going to be different.
Then, over time, clearly, they're going to be going out of equities and increasingly into
fixed income. And LDI strategies; and ultimately, if they can afford it, into annuity
strategies.

And so we are -- we've transitioned our business model to be very much of -- from a
client service perspective, all the way through the product offerings that we have, in both
the UK and the DB market, to accommodate the needs of clients as they go down this
de-risking path.

{BIO 6037447 <GO>}

Yes, hi, Gordon. Just in terms of BPA. Actually, there's still the usual suspects appear on
quotes. It's not really for me to comment on our competitors' strategies. But certainly,
we're still seeing many of the normal players; PIC, MetLife, Goldmans are all still there. We
do still see Pru and Aviva from time to time. And it does depend a lot on the scheme. But
mostly, I would say the competition's still the usual suspects.

I realized I wasn't cheeky enough in the previous questions. So I'll have another go. It's just
two basic, simple questions.
The first one was a very simple numbers question. On page 10, when you show the tied
agent number, that doesn't include the Mortgage Club, or is that the Mortgage Club,
because I just couldn't really understand why the tied agent number is falling? And so,
given the protection cells are very strong, is -- and then, I thought the Mortgage Club was
growing strongly. So maybe you could tell me where that shows -- where you see the L&G
Mortgage Club, where that's shown in that disclosure. And how that's doing?
And the second question was about LDI. Have you had conversations with UK-based
clients with CPI-related liabilities, regarding the impact of what LDI solutions they may
have put in place. And the implications of the changes to RPI, because it seems that quite
a few people who have got CPI-related liabilities may have a -- and chose to implement
LDI, may have a negative shock from the changes to the way in which RPI is calculated. So
could you comment on that, please? Thanks.

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

Kate, do you want to answer the first one. And then Mark Z on LDI?

FINAL

I'll take the Mortgage Club. What's happening here is a changing mix within the Club. The
Club is actually writing ever-higher numbers of mortgages. And that's because we had
some DA non-tied members in the Mortgage Club. So we're increasing our share. And
those people typically would operate a panel of suppliers.
We had two changes in the network that resulted in slightly lower protection sales, where
there was some restructuring of some members from fully tied to DA. And one fairly large
supplier decamped from us and moved elsewhere. So there have been slightly lower
protection numbers.
That said, that's been offset by the concentration in panel use amongst the DAs. So this is
still a very sound flow -- inflow of business for IP. Most of the IP that we have seen, the
growth in IP that we've seen has been coming from IFA and our bancassurance sector. So
it's just a little bit of mix going on there, Andy. So it's a very strong mortgage distribution
and then a couple of member changes that has resulted in slightly weaker protection.
That said, there have been slightly higher sales of investment products through that
channel. But that's another story.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Okay. So the DAs are in there as well or they're in a different line?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Pollock

{BIO 6037447 <GO>}

Well the DAs would be reported through IFA, because they are typically IFA even though
they're tied to the Club for mortgages. So they're managed through the network line. So
it's just a numbers kind of move between the two lines depending on how the mix is
happening.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Okay thanks.

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

Okay, Mark, the LDI question?

A - Mark Zinkula

{BIO 16142450 <GO>}

Yes, sure. In regard to -- I'll take a broader perspective, there are a lot of changes
underway in the market right now; you highlighted one. There's a movement towards
central clearing and so forth.
So we have to make sure we continue to develop the range of options to accommodate
different plans, needs as market conditions change or these dynamics evolve. And we're,
clearly, engaged with clients on all these issues. It doesn't -- it's not going to, we don't
think, diminish the demand for LDI solutions. But it certainly could result in slightly different
solutions or different ways to hedge interest rate and inflation risk, our equity risk and so
Page 17 of 20

forth, depending on the underlying asset composition that a plan has. And so we're just
continuing to evolve our mix of strategies and solutions as market conditions change.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

FINAL

Are there people out there who are sitting on a surprise loss from their LDI strategy that
you've had to contact and what was their reaction, is it --?

A - John Pollock

{BIO 6037447 <GO>}

Getting cheekier now, Andy.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

No, no I'm just interested, because obviously the -- if the purpose of LDI is to hedge your
liabilities and, obviously, a lot of people have CPI-related liabilities and obviously the
inflation hedge is clearly RPI and RPI could be falling. I'm just trying to work out whether
there's a mis-selling liability coming from LDI in the UK and I've just go no way of working it
out, whether that's a realistic thing or not?

A - Mark Zinkula

{BIO 16142450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We don't provide advice, first of all. In terms of a mis-selling scandal or insinuations of that
would be a case here, as conditions change we're just simply working with the plans to
help them hedge their risks in the best way that's in accordance with various tolerance
level.

A - Wadham Downing

{BIO 17627522 <GO>}

Okay, we've probably got time for one more question, any more questions on the
queue?

Operator
Alan Devlin, Barclays Capital.

Q - Alan Devlin

{BIO 5936254 <GO>}

Just two questions on LGIM, first of all you mentioned in the press release that you've
recently received regulatory approval to market passive funds or index funds in the US,
that's obviously a huge market but also massively competitive with people like Vanguard,
(inaudible), BlackRock having trillions of dollars of assets. So how are you going to tackle
that market? And do you have the scale to be successful there?
Then just a second question, a follow-up on LGIM UK, are you trying to say that the gross
outflows from the mature UK business are fairly consistent because it's the mature DV
plans rolling off but the gross inflows or sales are more seasonal and they tend to be
quiet in the August period. So the outflows you've seen in this quarter, if we should
necessarily be too concerned about? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Mark Zinkula

{BIO 16142450 <GO>}

In regards to the first question and, you're right, it has been a massively competitive
market in the US. We do think that there are -- well, circumstances have changed since we
began to build our presence in the US about five years ago. And I'd highlight the main
ones being, first of all, certainly post Lehman there's been increased focus on
management concentration risk. And we've been getting a lot of reverse enquiries and
there appears to be more demand for another large index manager in the US market
potentially.
Secondly, companies as they're increasingly -- well, they're increasingly managing their
pension liabilities on a more holistic basis globally; global companies are. So we have an
opportunity to leverage off our UK client base. So we have several UK clients that have
affiliates in the US, typically it's a parent subsidiary in one direction or the other.
Third we now have a presence in the US, we have a very successful business platform
focused on fixed income and LDI. So the incremental cost of, obviously, building out the
proposition is less and we have a strong reputation already with consultants and so forth.
So it was the natural next step in the evolution of our business model in the US.

Bloomberg Transcript

And finally, I would say that there are for certain plans an opportunity to provide constant
management services as part of de-risking plans or exercises that the plans are
contemplating.
In regard to your second question, unfortunately I do think just given the size of our book
and the fact that we have several large clients there's going to be some lumpiness and
flows in both directions, both in terms of outflows and inflows. I think from a quarter-toquarter basis there will be some lumpiness. I think we expect persistency rates
unbalanced to still say very high; they've been around 90% for several years. And we do
anticipate that we'll be able to retain a lot of clients as they go out of passive again, into
LDI and a fixed income strategy as I mentioned before. But there will be some lumpiness
in both directions on quarter-to-quarter basis.

Q - Alan Devlin

{BIO 5936254 <GO>}
