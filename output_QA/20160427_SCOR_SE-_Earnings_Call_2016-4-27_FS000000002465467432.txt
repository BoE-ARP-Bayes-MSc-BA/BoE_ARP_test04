MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the SCOR Group's 2016 Q1 Results
Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to hand the
call over to Mr. Bertrand Bougon, Head of Investor Relations & Rating Agencies. Please go
ahead, sir.

Bertrand Bougon

{BIO 18934799 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the SCOR Group Q1 2016 results
conference call. Before starting this presentation, please consider our disclaimer on page
2, which indicates that the presented Q1 2016 financial information is unaudited.
With this, I would like to give the floor to Mr. Denis Kessler, CEO and Chairman of SCOR
Group, who is joined on this call by the entire committee (00:50) team.

FINAL

Thank you, Bertrand, and good afternoon, everyone. As you have certainly seen, SCOR
delivered a strong start to the year, absolutely in line with the Optimal Dynamics strategy
plan, with quite a very robust set of financial results.
The group indeed benefited from the momentum recorded in 2015. The plan, Optimal
Dynamics, will reach its maturity in a quarter from now at the end of June, at the end of
Q2. That means that we have only one quarter to go before the successful end of the
plan. The excellent news is SCOR remains firmly on track to achieve the targets defined in
Optimal Dynamics. We continue to combine profitability and solvency with an ROE of 11.2%
above the 1,000 bps over the risk-free rates, and despite financial market fluctuations in
the beginning of the year, a strong solvency ratio at 202%. We are well within the optimal
range of the solvency scale.

Bloomberg Transcript

During the first quarter, SCOR was once again quite active in the reinsurance market, and
we did confirm Tier 1 positioning. We did successfully sponsor a new catastrophe bond,
which contributes to optimization of retrocession structure in U.S. market; we did that in
January 2016. SCOR Global P&C continues to perform in this long-lasting soft market by
delivering good January and April renewals which Victor will discuss in more detail later on
in the presentation.
With regards to reserves themselves, they confirm our ability to combine gross
profitability and solvency in an environment that is not only becoming increasingly
competitive, but also increasingly challenging for the traditional reinsurance industry. In this
context, SCOR has been able to expand its franchise globally with gross written premiums
of €3.3 billion, up 5.1% at constant exchange rates compared to Q1 2015. Frieder will also
detail the excellent MCEV results of €5.6 billion or €30 per share in 2015, validating the
strength of the biometric portfolio.
SCOR Global Investments delivered a pretty strong return on invested assets this quarter
of 3.3% despite volatile markets whilst continuing to adhere to the principles of prudence.
Overall, SCOR records a net income of €170 million for the first quarter. In Q1 2016, SCOR
also successfully entered the Solvency II framework, using its full internal model to
manage the business and operations on a daily basis.
I'm also quite pleased to report at the Annual General Meeting for shareholders did
approve all of our resolutions this morning, including a dividend increase of €1.5 per share
that will be paid on Monday.
As you know, the traditional reinsurance market is affected by both the evolution of the
risk universe and the turmoil of the economy. It's widely known that the reinsurance
industry is currently in a situation of excess capacity due to a series of factors including the
low nat cat activities since 2011 and the development of ILS.

FINAL

Naturally, we experienced increasing price pressure at the recent January and April
renewals, fortunately, resisting on terms and conditions. I explained during the Q4 2015
results presentation that 2016 will be a difficult year in terms of the macroeconomic and
financial environment. The context has not changed and we are affected by a number of
exogenous factors. When I say we, the industry, the slowdown of the global economy and
adverse developments in some sectors, such as oil and gas, are pushing down the
demand for reinsurance.
As you well know, we face increasing foreign exchange instability which affects almost all
currencies. The economic cycle is troubled and there are more and more questions about
the duration of this economic cycle, and some people now really admit the hypothesis of
secular stagnation. Reinsurance market is also suffering from ultra-low interest rate
environment, in some cases, negative interest rates, and we believe that the pain of
persistent low if not negative interest rates driven by QE (06:00) monetary policies will
last for the foreseeable future.

Bloomberg Transcript

This extremely low-yield environment is weighing – has weighed on the return on invested
assets, and our RoIA decline that is also partially due to the combination of IFRS 9
accounting rules and the capital charges, Solvency II, and rating agency models.
On top of that, you can add regulatory overload, imposing blunt capital charges and even
ever-increasing reporting requirements. The industry, reinsurance industry is also facing an
ever-growing number of protectionist regulations, notably in emerging countries which is
affecting the contribution (06:44) of capital. These regulations include limitation of internal
repossessions in Brazil and India, and mandatory sessions to state-owned or local
reinsurance in Indonesia.
The environment that has changed represents some great opportunities for the group.
Traditional risks remain and are growing in severity, notably natural catastrophes while in
the meantime risks are developing, for example, nuclear, cyber, biohazards, cloning,
connected cars, the impact of solar storms on grids and so on. The protection gap is
significant and needs to be closed. It concerned all business lines: nat cat, mortality,
disability protection, enterprises coverage, and so on.
The fiscal austerity in developed countries will drive risk in the private – from the public to
the private sector, creating opportunities in pensions, healthcare, nat cat, infrastructure
and so on. In the end, I believe that the tailwinds will be stronger than the headwinds,
even if the road gets a little bit bumpy.
SCOR has proven its resilience, and we continue to prove its ability to anticipate and
absorb shocks. We are simply realistic about the changes offered by the environment we
operate in. SCOR will pursue development based on the cornerstones that has proved to
be successful in the past and which have enabled the group to become a recognized Tier
1 reinsurer. Agility is in the group's DNA and thanks to our seasoned teams, we will
continue to find solutions to ensure both technical and financial profitability and an optimal
level of solvency.

We know how to deal with an uncertain environment. Thus, it is in that context that we are
meticulously preparing a new strategic plan, which will be unveiled on September 7, 2016,
during IR Day and we all hope that you will attend this IR Day.

FINAL

Let me now hand it over to Mark, who will give you more details on the financial
performance in Q1 2016. Mark, the floor is yours.

Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Thank you, Denis. Moving on to Slide 6, I will walk you through the key financial highlights
of the first quarter of 2016. SCOR wrote approximately €3.3 billion of gross written
premiums in the first quarter, representing a 5.1% increase over Q1 2015 at current
exchange rates, or 5% at constant exchange rates. This top line growth was driven by
SCOR Global Life with a 10.5% rise at current exchange rates. During Q1, SCOR Global
P&C's gross written premiums slightly decreased by 1.6% at current exchange rates and
this decline is specifically explained by Victor later on.

Bloomberg Transcript

During the first quarter, SCOR achieved high-quality results with a net income of €170
million, benefiting from a low nat cat environment, generating an 11.2% return on equity,
thereby exceeding the group targets set at 1,000 basis points above the risk-free rate.
The P&C net combined ratio for Q1 stood in an excellent 89.7%, and the Life technical
margin continued to outperform at 7.1%, both surpassing the Optimal Dynamics
assumptions. SCOR Global Investments delivered a solid return on invested assets of
3.3%, and their ability to generate this level of return on invested assets in the extremely
low-yield environment confirms the relevance of its prudent investment strategy, notably
through the derisking of the portfolio.
Going to page 8, shareholders' equity was relatively stable over the first quarter at €6.4
billion, corresponding to a book value of €34.13 per share. The shareholders' equity was
supported by the strong net income recorded in Q1 while being negatively offset by the
currency translation adjustment of minus €191 million, largely due to the weakening of the
U.S. dollar against the euro. Financial leverage stands at 27.6%, temporarily above the
range indicated in Optimal Dynamics.
And as explained during our fiscal 2015 results, the normalized financial leverage would
be approximately 20.6%, assuming the intended calls of the CHF650 million and €257
million subordinated debts, callable in the third quarter of 2016.
Let's move to page 9. SCOR generated a high level of cash flow. Thanks to the
contribution of both business engines, we've been able to deliver a strong net operating
cash flow of €317 million for the first quarter. That figure benefited from some timing
differences, leaving the normalized operational Q1 cash flow generation at approximately
€250 million.
The total liquidity of the group reached €2.7 billion at March 31, representing a substantial
increase year-on-year, in line with temporary pause of the rebalancing of the investment
Page 4 of 25

portfolio which François will discuss later on. Approximately €6.8 billion of liquidity including
cash and short-term investments is expected to be generated within the next 24 months
from the maturity of fixed income securities and interest coupons.

FINAL

I will now turn it over to Victor to comment on the P&C results.

Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon. We are on slide 10, and it shows that Q1 is an
excellent start of the year for us. This quarter is again characterized by low level of nat cat
loss activity. Besides this, the large manmade loss activity that we experienced than
unusually high level during two consecutive quarters of last year remains back at its normal
level. This confirmed that what we saw last year was a spike as we commented at the
time, and illustrates the very nature of our business, which must be looked upon at over a
sufficiently long period.

Bloomberg Transcript

This brings us to an excellent net combined ratio of 89.7%, which is in line with our
assumption on where it should be on a normalized basis. You will recall that for this year,
we have revised our annual nat cat budget downwards to the equivalent of 6 percentage
points of net combined ratio instead of 7 percentage points previously. Normalized net
combined ratio stands at 94.3% for this quarter. It is worth mentioning that there is
nothing to report on the reserving side.
On the subject of nat cat and regarding the two post quarter close events, the
information is not complete and final yet, of course. However, I can tell you that based on
the information available to date, the total amount of losses for our shares on the Kyushu
and Ecuador earthquake should stay within one quarter of our annual nat cat budget. This
means that we believe that these two events can be absorbed in the second quarter.
Regarding the top line, as Mark mentioned, the comparison between the first two
quarters of this year and last year is influenced by the fact that Q1 2015 was a very
buoyant quarter with relatively stronger growth. In addition to this, Q1 2016 top line is
impacted by two specific measures that we took.
First, is our decision to discontinue our capital provision to one of the syndicate in the
portfolio of 10 syndicate plus channel. The second is the consequence of the continued
realignment of our activity and portfolio in Aviation, which led to a reduction of the
premium income. This leads to a Q1 gross return written premium decrease of 1.1% at
constant exchange rate.
The impact of these two specific measures will get diluted over time during the year, and
without them, the quarter-to-quarter comparison of the gross premium written would
have shown a growth of 2.7% at constant exchange rate. Such a massive growth of about
3% is in line with the indication that we gave previously regarding the trend of the top line
of the entire year.

Now moving on to Slide 11 and the two following, well, those three slides provide you with
the same detailed information as following any renewal season. They complement the
press release of last Friday. For us, there are two main reasons to be satisfied with the
results of the April 1 renewals. The first is that they demonstrate our ability to continue to
keep the expected performance in line with the group target and the assumptions of
Optimal Dynamics. This is achieved by activity managing the portfolios and simultaneously
seizing opportunities to win shares of profitable business from existing and new clients.
The second reason is normalization of the relationship with the major Japanese insurance
groups.
I will now hand over to Paolo for the presentation of the Life division results.

Paolo de Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Victor. Moving on to page 14 of the presentation I'm pleased to report that in
Q1 2016, SCOR Global Life continues to deliver strong and profitable growth. Our gross
written premiums reached €1.9 billion, which represents a growth of 10.5% at current
exchange rates or 9.9% at constant exchange rate. Our new business pipeline continues
to be healthy across all regions and all product lines with new business margins expected
to meet the group profitability target.
When comparing our 2016 premiums to last year premiums is to note that last year our
premium growth was back loaded in the second half of the year. Therefore, during 2016,
we expect our year-over-year growth in premiums to normalize at around 4% to 5%. This
will bring us in line with the Optimal Dynamics assumption of 6% average growth between
2013 and 2016 at constant exchange rate.
Overall, technical performance over the first quarter of 2016 stands at 7.1%, ahead of the
7% assumed in Optimal Dynamics. We've been able to deliver the strong technical margin
thanks to both the profitability of our new business and the good performance of the inforce portfolio.
I will now hand over to Frieder Knüpling, SCOR Chief Risk Officer, to comment on the 2015
MCEV results.

Frieder Knüpling
Thank you, Paolo. Page 15 gives an overview of the development of SCOR Global Life's
embedded value of the past eight years. Since 2007, that means during a period which
spans spent the entire financial crisis, it has grown almost three-fold. Its development in
2015 mirrors that of our Solvency II own funds as our MCEV valuation basis is very close to
Solvency II.
Page 16 shows that last year SCOR's embedded value has grown by over €800 million,
reaching €5.6 billion even after repatriation of €236 million of capital from the Life division.
The main contributor to the increase was solid operating earnings of €426 million which
were mainly driven by a strong new business value of €354 million.

FINAL

Economic variances led to a strong increase of MCEV of €245 million mainly resulting from
market value gains from SCOR's investment portfolio and modest (18:37) interest rates
on U.S. dollar and GB pound. Foreign exchange gains of €395 million are mainly caused by
the rise of the U.S. dollar against the euro in 2015.
Moving on to page 17, the value of new business has grown by 9% year-on-year. MCEV
earnings have more than doubled driven by the value of new business and economic
gains. Embedded value is more suitable for capturing the economic value of Life business
than IFRS. This can be seen in the increase in SCOR Global Life's off balance sheet value
by €574 million in 2015 to €2.4 billion. This increase in value not recognized under IFRS was
mainly driven by the new business written in 2015 which is only partially reflected under
IFRS and by far foreign exchange movement.
During 2015, SGL has generated more than €520 million of free surplus from the
development of its existing business. €470 million were used to finance the capital and
reserve requirements of new business written in 2015. In addition, a very significant
amount of €236 million was returned to the group consisting of €100 million in dividends,
together with interest on and repayment of internal loans.
This demonstrates the ability of the Life business to fund new business growth whilst
returning significant amounts of cash to the group and increasing the financial flexibility of
the group. As in the past, there are more details on the MCEV 2015 in the full
presentation and the technical document which are available on the website.

With this, I hand over to François de Varenne for the Investment part.

François de Varenne
Thank you, Frieder. Moving onto Slide 19, SCOR's total investment portfolio reached €27.6
billion at the end of March 2016 with an invested asset portfolio of €18.2 billion compared
to €18 billion at the end of December last year.
To face the increased level of economic and financial uncertainties, SCOR Global
Investments has reinforced its prudent investment strategy since June 2015 temporarily
and tactically in order to preserve our investment portfolio and wealth of SCOR's
shareholders.
In response to additional headwinds which have materialized since the beginning of 2016,
we have further increased our liquidity at 14% of invested assets, up from 11% at the end
of 2015. This de-risking has been done at the expense of (21:25) portfolio and most
specifically the financial, energy, metals and mining sectors. The duration of our fixed
income portfolio has been maintained stable at 3.9 years.
The high quality of our fixed income portfolio has been maintained as well with a stable
average rating of AA-. Moreover, SCOR Global investments has maintained a very strict
policy of avoiding any sovereign exposure to eurozone peripheral countries.

FINAL

At the end of March, expected cash flows from the fixed income portfolio over the next
24 months stands at €6.8 billion which represents more than one-third of invested assets,
facilitating the dynamic management of our reinvestment policy as soon as market
condition will permit.
In spite of the adverse economic environment and the prolonged low yield context in all
major currencies, SCOR Global Investments manages to deliver a very strong and
recurring return on invested assets which stands at 3.3% for the first quarter of this year
compared to 3.1% last year. This performance has been notably driven by capital gains
realized on our real estate portfolio.
Looking forward, I am confident in achieving our objective of delivering a return on
invested asset of above 3% until the end of the Optimal Dynamics plan. For the full year
2016, the estimated return on invested asset may be impacted by the temporary
derisking of our investment portfolio and the length of this derisking strategy. Given our
current reinvestment rate of 2% and the cash position, 10 percentage points higher than
our long-term strategic level of 5%, the annualized cost of our current hedging strategy
can be estimated at around 20 basis points if it was maintained during the full year,
impacting momentarily our return on invested asset.
With this, I will hand it over to Bertrand Bougon for the conclusion of this presentation.

Thank you, François. On page 20, you will find the next scheduled events starting on July
27 with the Q2 2016 results. And, of course, our Investor Day on September 7 as well as

Hi. You can hear me? Great. First two, the first question is on the April renewals. Can you
just give us a little bit of color around the Japanese renewables? I know you lost some
business last year due to the state that somebody have taken the score? Can you just talk
us through whether you recaptured all of that?
And the second question is just on how you categorize nat cat claims in your combined
ratio calculation. Could you just maybe articulate what level of loss you need for
something to be considered a nat cat claim rather than fully situational? Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

I think the question, Victor, on the first one, the renewables in Japan. That's number one.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

I think you will understand that we are not going to comment on specifics on our
Japanese clients. I think that is not – that will not be correct. What we said last year is that
we had lost the Mitsui business. What we say this year is that well the relationship has
normalized, which means that the relationship has been established – reestablished or
have continued with this re-launch of Japanese insurers and I think that's what we can say.

Bloomberg Transcript

And regarding nat cat, and the nat cat event is a nat cat event. There is no threshold or
size given everything that we can do, the nat cat ratio. But for really events of below €3
million which we can consider that. We can ignore.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Great. Fantastic. Thanks very much.

Operator
We now take the next question from William Hawkins from KBW. We now take the next
question from William Hawkins from KBW.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks. Just for the operator, we get blanked out when you're announcing us. Two
quick questions, yes, so you get a lot of questions on the investment return, I've just got a
very simple one. Is there any seasonality in your investment income in the first quarter? It
does – typically in the past year, seems to have been below the run rate from the rest of
the quarters. I know last year you had a CPI issue that depressed the figure. But even
allowing for that the first quarter it seems to be weak. So I just want to see is there
anything seasonal going on in your investment income?
Secondly, the Solvency II ratio, could you tell us the numerator and the denominator and
you might think I'm splitting hairs on this, but the 202%, but by my math against the 211%
at the end of last year, maybe 7 percentage points comes from the decline in yields. But I
can't really find anything else that should be negative. Market sensitivity otherwise is quite
low. And presumably, you should have had some capital generation in the first quarter. So,
Page 9 of 25



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2016-04-27

FINAL

for me, again, you may just say it's splitting hairs, but I would thought your Solvency II ratio
should have been around 205% or even slightly higher, not 202%. So, either I'm
underestimating the sensitivity to yields or there's some other negative that I've not
allowed for that makes a few percentage points. Could you maybe help me on that?
Thanks.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

François?

A - François de Varenne
On the seasonality of the investment income, so there is no seasonality in Q1, usually,
that's in Q2 mainly due to the dividend we received and the equity portfolio also on some
funds. So, no specific comment on this in Q1. Just as a reminder, if you look at Slide 39 in
the appendix, you should compare the income of 2% in Q1 this year to 1.8% last year. So,
it's (28:44) increasing. It's only for Q2.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

On the solvency ratio, so we estimate a decline by 9 percentage points. We are not
disclosing a split between own funds and solvency capital requirement at this point. We
may be doing this in the future. It is largely explained, as you said, by the decline in
interest rates. That has accounted for about 8 points given that interest rates have
dropped by roughly 50 basis points. It is largely in line with the sensitivities which we
published two months ago. And then there's been a bit of impact from general market
volatility and market value movements. Yes, we do allow for some capital generation
during Q1, but we also reflect the (29:58) exposure of the portfolio, and we accrue
expected dividends on a quarterly basis, so in total it doesn't have a strong impact on the
solvency ratio.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Forgive me. Even if you're not going to give me an exact number, just should I understand
the decline mostly comes from available capital going down or required capital going up
or (30:22)?

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

It's led between the two. The decline in interest rate leads to an increase in our capital
requirement and a decrease in our own funds, so you can pretty much spit it between the
two.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

We now take the next question from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca.

FINAL

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hi. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. I'll go ahead. First thing is on the P&C comments on
Aviation. It just seems like the – at least the renewal data wasn't really lowest. If I look at
last two years, say, renewal in January, for example, Aviation book used to €125 million
odd last January, and this January it's around €150 million, €170 million.
I'm just trying to square this comment that something has changed in Aviation because I
understood that so far you were squarely comfortable with that, and I mean that it's
enough to make an impact at the group level, if you could just comment a bit about that.
And also, just to clarify, the 2.7% you mentioned, did you also say that going forward it
should normalize? I just want to understand that.
And second question is on the Life Re growth. So, the free surplus is (32:08) well, €250odd million lower this year than last year on that Slide 18 I think. And that's probably due to
the very strong growth. Should we assume that if growth is sort of normalizing then the
new business strain should kind of normalize?

Bloomberg Transcript

And in that same context, the dividend upstreamed were a little bit lower this year than
last year despite such strong growth. And this year was €100 million; last year was €125
million. Is there any (32:42) into that? Thanks.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thanks a lot. Maybe on Aviation, I don't know. Is Victor?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

In the Aviation side, it's, as you know, most of the primary policies renew in November.
And what we had is with one particular of our major participation we had an over estimate
of premium by the ceding company. And since we were at the same time asking them to
re-underwrite part of their portfolio and revised the underwriting guidelines, the
estimates that they had done before while they had to get them down. And as you know,
we work on estimates when we write quota share, so we have to rectify the estimates,
hence, the volume being down. So, it's very one specific and you could even imagine
which one, probably.
Regarding the 2.7%, yes, what we are saying is that this is an impact that – in January that
we have, and this will normalize during the year. So what I said is that about 3% increase of
the premium that we had planned for the entire year, we maintain it, yes.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Because, sorry, in the past it used to be a 5% premium growth, up until – because
you had €6 billion targeted for 2016, which was sort of like and implied growth. That's why

It's my mic. It seems to be receiving (34:33). I think we said €6 billion. Well, we continue to

Q - Vinit Malhotra

Sorry, in this mic confusion. €6 billion is still maintained, or should we expect to be a bit

We'll now take the next question from In-Yong Hwang from Goldman Sachs. Please go
ahead.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Hello. This is In-Yong Hwang from Goldman. I hope you can hear me. I've got two
questions both the P&C Re side. Firstly on the U.S. growth, again, as of January, you seem
to have grown quite strongly there. Obviously, it's a focus market for you guys. Could you
just give us some confidence of the profitability of the growth that you're getting here,
given that the pricing trends in that market seems to be probably the most, yes, negative
out of the all three divisions that you show especially in the April renewals?
And secondly, I think Denis you mentioned emerging risk such as cyber at the start of the
call. Could you just remind us where you're standing there and where you see the
opportunities from your side? Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Sorry, we forgot to answer the previous question on Life. Free surplus since we tried to
answer all the questions.

A - Frieder Knüpling
Yes. I could take that.

Frieder, could you please answer this question? That was the previous question, sorry.
Come back afterwards.

FINAL

A - Frieder Knüpling
Yes. So the capital transfers back to the group were slightly lower than last year but still far
above what one would consider, for example, SCOR Global Life's share in the group
dividend. So it is still capital repatriation beyond those needs. So that's an element of
active capital management in this.
The new business strain in 2015 was slightly higher than that of the year before because
the business mix was slightly different and the way the business was placed with the
group. This is also related to the fact that this still measured on a Solvency I basis which
was still in force at the end of 2015.
Going forward, the main entities, operating entities in the group are – European entities
will be subject to Solvency II instead. The free surplus of the operating entities under
Solvency II basis will be significantly larger than under Solvency I basis, so this constraints if
you like will be much, much softer and the group will place even more importance on its
group solvency scale and solvency target to managing cash and capital within the group.
So, this is something which will really drive our capital management much more in the
future than the Solvency I based free surplus metrics which are no longer in force.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

And sorry, can I follow-up if I'm still in the call? Can I follow-up, and will this change to
Solvency II on the Life side on new business strain, will it start showing up in the group
solvency as well, should we factor for that or I mean the group S II ratio?

A - Frieder Knüpling
It is already included in our Solvency II disclosures so the movement in solvency between
one year and the next which we disclose thus reflect the impact of new business. Under
Solvency II basis, this will in many cases not be a new business strain anymore because
Solvency II allows for new business on a – closed to economic valuation, so at least for the
business which sits within Europe and this conservative new business strain which you
traditionally saw under Solvency I will not exist anymore, at least not in the same way. So
we will see situations when new business actually increases solvency and free surplus
rather than consumes capital.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

FINAL

Well, the growth at the 01/04 renewable is more in line with the growth that we have
planned for the entire year. Well, that is quite explainable in the sense that, well, EMEA is
January 1 whilst April May, June and July is much more Asia and U.S. and our growth is
much focused on the Asia and U.S. In actual facts, we even slightly reduced in EMEA. So I
think the trend is there to say that basically we are where we thought we would be.
As far as the U.S. is concerned, well, first of all I don't quite agree with the statement that
is where – the problem is the starting point and where we are. I think I can assure you that
the business we book in the U.S. is clearly at the required profitability and even the
underwriting ratio which is loss ratio plus commission of our U.S. at the moment is below
the average of the division.
So I think we have no worry on the business we book which is a mix essentially. We are
extremely careful to have the short tail, long tail mix by which, well, we can stick to the
overall target. So definitely our long tail intake is limited by how much short tail we can find
in the market, including proportional, by the way that fits in with the target.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Great. Thank you. If I could just, yes, repeat my second question. It was on emerging risks
which Denis mentioned at the start of the call. Just wanted to get your sense on that

different approach regarding, yes. these emerging risk. Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

In terms of how aggressively they want to be writing cyber contracts, for example.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Okay. Well, we ourselves are at the moment of the view that we do not have yet the level
of technical knowledge and data by which, we can get aggressive on the market. We are
actively learning, acquiring knowledge and I think we are progressing reasonably well.
We're also testing the water with a certain number of businesses that we accept to write,
but this is very well contained in something that we feel is totally manageable and it's not
going to impact the overall profitability target.
So that's where we are and we are building. And there is an opportunity clearly there, but
it's not yet reached the stage where as we feel that – I was talking this morning about
symmetry of information. Well it's even, well, level knowledge and information from both

We'll now take the next question from Sami Taipalus from Berenberg.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Can you hear me? Hello? Yes. Okay, perfect. Yes. Two questions, please. First on the
Life business. The proportional longevity in premium seems to be going up and I think you
mentioned on the last call that the margin on this business is a bit lower than on the
(43:30) business. I understand that the ROEs are obviously similar. I'm just wondering if
you could just give us an indication of what the proportion of mortality was – sorry,
longevity was in Q1 and how big the proportion would need to be before it started
affecting your margin target in the Life business where you'd have to start thinking about
maybe bringing that down a little bit.
And then the second question is on your expense ratio where it had ticked up a little bit in
Q1. I was just wondering whether this is sort of a new normal for that expense ratio. You
kind of indicated in your comments that there was some structural reasons behind the
uptick and whether there are any items elsewhere in the combined ratio that offset that
uptick. Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thanks. Paolo, on longevity and the effects on margin.

A - Paolo de Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Yes. Right now, we're at around 7% of the group being longevity. The longevity business,
by definition. has a lower margin. It's much more longer term. The risk in nature is very
different. So we usually give some indication of the margin would be somewhere
between 3% and 5% of that business, and it really does depend – it varies greatly deal by
deal.
I think we're in the process of looking at the next three years in terms of the strategic
plan. So, for this year, the growth on longevity will not drive any changes in our
expectations on technical margin, at least at this point. I think we – the best place to have
this conversation will be actually in September when we present the new strategic plan if
as a group we decide that we still have the appetite to write as much longevity as we
write more, and those decisions are in the process of being made really at this point.

I can't actually hear anything.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Yes. Well, it seems to be (45:57). We said we will navigate between 6.5% and 7%. I think
we are (46:04) of this trend. What is important for me is that we speak to the combined
ratio, and, well, I mean, it may happen in a given quarter that we are a bit higher than the
average at the end of the day. On a normalized basis, we are still where we want to be.
So I think...

Q - Sami Taipalus

A - Victor Peignet

end of our range, well, our combined ratio on a normalized basis is still where it should be.

FINAL

Hi there. Two quick questions. Firstly on U.S. mortality. I noted in the EV report that you
strengthened assumptions for U.S. mortality, so it's the old SCOR book. I mean, was there
a big difference in assumptions within the old SCOR book and Transamerica and Generali
so that's part of a wider review of assumptions in U.S. mortality and maybe just tells us
how experience has been on the – on all of those books in U.S. mortality over the course
of 2015 and what we might discern from the EV report.
Secondly, for François, you're running a high level of liquidity. You increased it again in Q1.
What has to happen for you deploy that liquidity? You talked about wanting greater clarity
on the outlook. I think we'd all like that but I'm not quite sure what you feel you're going to
get and what you feel you need to see to deploy some of that liquidity. Thanks.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Paolo, on (48:12).

A - Paolo de Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So the change in assumptions is the consequence of the regular review of our
assumptions which we do every year even during the year, so there's nothing particular
which triggered this. There is still a bit of assumption harmonization to be made between
the different blocks of U.S. business which SCOR has acquired over the past years hence
the comment. But as I said, this is a regular exercise which we conduct every year and
which we're possibly doing over the past. And mortality experience of the U.S. portfolio
was very close to our best estimate assumptions, so no significant deviation.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

So, presumably there was a deviation in your old SCOR book hence the assumption
change, but you've never referred to the U.S. mortality assumption change before.

A - Paolo de Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

No. There was no specific negative experience on this book. These are long-term
assumptions over I mean several decades and we want to make sure that our
assumptions also in 10 years and 20 years down the road are consistent and are valid.
And because – all of this is present value, you see the impact in the assumption changes
but it was not triggered by specific experience variance in either book.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay.

A - François de Varenne
So on the Investment side, just to answer to your question, I think we have been quite, not
to say, very successful since 2007 to detect in advance potential shocks on the market.
And we demonstrated our ability to reinvest quickly our cash and liquidity position as soon
as the market condition permit.

Page 17 of 25



Company N ame: SCOR SE

FINAL

That was exactly the case. You should be happy that we detected the mess at the
beginning of this year and we started to announce it after the summer last year. And we
started to de-risk the portfolio end of 2015, with the peak of volatility probably reached
late January or February this year.
Today, yes, it's true that in the market the level of risk aversion or volatility is a little bit
lower compared to the peak observed a few months ago. Having said this, the level of
uncertainty is still very high in terms of interest rate policy, monetary policies, geopolitical
risk or tension are the maximum today everywhere. So the level of uncertainty is very high.
Again, we prefer in those situation – and again, I think we have been quite successful since
2007 to do this, we prefer to protect the value of the portfolio to increase momentarily
just for a few months the cash position. And as soon as we have more visibility on the
market, we also demonstrated in the past that we have the ability to reinvest directly
(51:30). We are waiting still a little bit to have more comfort on the market today.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

So, have you increased liquidity since the end of Q1, or is it still standing around that level?

A - François de Varenne
No. No. It's relatively stable.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And the real estate realizations you made during the quarter, is that part of raising
liquidity, or is that just a timing issue unrelated to that?

A - François de Varenne
Not at all. This capital gain has been achieved through the disposal of one of our buildings
in Paris within our real estate portfolio. And this production is a typical illustration of our
value-added management style within the real estate portfolio, which I presented, if you
remember, during our last Investor Day in September. So we have completely
restructured this building, let it to a new tenant and subsequently sold it, achieving a net
return on this transaction above 12%, which is nice.
(52:33) in terms of your question on the fact that this transaction is not a one-off for us. It
was entirely factored in my expectation for the full-year assumption in terms of return of
invested assets embedded in the last presentation. And if you look at Slide 51 with the
unrealized gains in the real estate portfolio, we still have a significant amount of
unrealized gains within our real estate portfolio, and those assets will be sold in the future
as soon as the value creation will be at the maximum for each asset we own.
So you should expect over the next quarter and year still a significant contribution of the
related portfolio. That's the way we really manage this portfolio where we try to create
value through the restructuring of assets.

was if you maintain the current level of liquidity, the annualized impact will be 20 basis
points roughly?

FINAL

A - François de Varenne
Yes. Basically that's it because their investment rate is 80%. That's indicated in the slide

Q - Olivia Brindle

Hi there. Can you hear me before I start to say anything? Hello?

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Yes. We do.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Olivia Brindle

{BIO 17273762 <GO>}

Okay. So first question just, I guess, probing a bit on your cat book, so especially in light of
the fact that you've gone from the 7% cat load to 6%, just trying to understand what
you're doing around cat at the moment. So in the April disclosure, you sort of mentioned
a bit of – a bit more of U.S. cat more in the specialty side. U.S. cat rates in January seem to
have stabilized a little bit. So I'm just wondering if you could talk about what you're doing
on your exposures there and how we should, therefore, think about the 7% to 6%?
If I look at the earned to gross premiums on the P&C side, that's actually gone up. So just
wondering if any sort of compute that we can get around that 7% to 6% would be helpful.
And then, the second point also touching on something mentioned in the renewal
disclosure, you said that's improving pricing on the proportional side and you had a 1%
number on that. I was just wondering exactly what lines you're talking about and could it
be that doesn't include any offsets and increased ceding commissions. That would also
be interesting to hear.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thanks, Olivia. On the cat book, Victor?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

On the cat book, the reduction from 7% to 6% is basically due to the improvement of our
risk position (55:37) program and not to a change in our underwriting policy on Cat. As far
Page 19 of 25



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2016-04-27

FINAL

as the U.S. cat is concerned, well, this is a bit an exception of our underwriting, we do it
with a combination of the specialist cat team in Zurich that dates back to the era of the
acquisition of the acquisition of Converium and the complement team in Chicago. But
actually, the philosophy is exactly the same as for the rest of the cat business, and we
have a general management of our cat portfolio worldwide.
As far as the property, well, it's basically specific property risk in the U.S. that we are
talking about on which what you are mentioning is not effective totally. I mean, the
commission – there is no increase of commission compensating for the improvement of
the price or at least new compensation is not complete.

Q - Olivia Brindle

{BIO 17273762 <GO>}

And just sort of following up on that, if we were to look at overall across your P&C
business what the proportion of cat has been and what it's trending to, I mean, should we
assume that there is a bit more of that given that you've been growing in various places
including the U.S., or would you say it's more stable and any business you pick up is rather
opportunistic?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, I don't think we are opportunistic writers in general, so not even in cat. No. I think our
cat premium overall is still a bit above 10% of the overall, so probably something like 12%
maybe today, something like that. No big change from the year before. I mean, the cat
increases with the rest of the portfolio. I'm talking here of the pure cat premium which is
non-proportional cat.

Q - Olivia Brindle

{BIO 17273762 <GO>}

So, yes.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Olivia, you're satisfied or you want to ask more?

Q - Olivia Brindle

{BIO 17273762 <GO>}

Yes. No, on that point, yes, just the second question on proportional business.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Which was? Pardon.

Q - Olivia Brindle

{BIO 17273762 <GO>}

So, you talked about proportional lines benefiting from improved pricing in certain areas,
and you had a 1% improvement I think on your book. So, just wondering exactly sort of
where that's coming from and to what extent it's offset by increases in ceding premiums,
ceding commissions.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good afternoon, everybody. I have two questions. My first question, I would like to come
back to William's question regarding the seasonality that we see in the investment
income. And to François, you pointed to Slide 39, and last year, at least we had this sort of
(59:10). If you look back, you also can see that Q1 was structurally regarding the regular
income on a lower level than the other three quarters and has been that there is some
seasonality from dividend in Q2. And now again in Q1, it looks the 2.0% and also if you
take an absolute number, they look further on the lower level compared to where we
have been in Q2 to Q4. And the question is really whether the 2.0% is the run rate going
forward, or should we expect some ramp up going forward?
And then the second question is on the Life Re business. On the net technical results that
you showed on page 34, the €86 million, the margin here looks stronger than last year in
Q1 and could you elaborate a little bit on the drivers behind this margin improvement?
Should technical margin improvement on the drivers and whether this should be the run
rate going forward also?

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thanks, Frank. François...

A - François de Varenne
(01:00:29) on the seasonality, again, we don't see a lot of seasonality in Q1, that's really in
Q2 especially on the equity portfolio. Just to understand the different sectors (01:00:44)
on the income yield in Q1 compared to Q2 the last quarter if I expect the Q2 to Q3 with
the dividend last year, the income still is good. It's affected as I mentioned in the previous
question or in my speech by the fact that we have 14% of cash in the portfolio that returns
(01:01:08). So again you see in this especially income yield the effect of the prudence
(01:01:15), but again, it grew up to (01:01:20) basis points of return to protect and to avoid
the peak of volatility that we observed in the market during Q1.

Yes. Good afternoon. Two remaining questions for François. The first question would be
on the cash position of the group, the 14%, 15% you're currently having. Is anything
changed in terms of outlook and in terms of the state of financial market, we see cash
flow generated by the group in the coming months and quarters and with the coupon and
maturing securities coming in, should we expect the level of cash by year end to increase
again from the 14% level to the end of the year? Again, nothing is changing in the market
or you're more likely to reinvest with the same type of split of assets?
And the second question would be related to the unrealized gains on the real estate
book, the €160 million. Can you just clarify if this is purely invested assets and not taking
into account unrealized gains on the real estate for own use? Thank you.

So, Thomas, on your first question, so we have 14 points of liquidity in the portfolio today,
and the amount of €6.8 billion including the liquidity we have today that will mature
between today and the next 24 months.
Given the economic environment, we don't expect to increase the liquidity position unless
there is a strong deterioration of the market condition in the next week or month. So if we
see better condition in the near future, you should expect a decrease of this cash, but at
this stage, the intention is not going to the cash position today or in the future.
On the unrealized gain or the realized gain, so I confirm that the realized gain we took on
the real estate portfolio is really, again, on one single building that is located and which
belong in Paris that was just describing (01:07:08) largely last September during the
Investor Day presentation and (01:07:16). All the unrealized gain on the real estate
portfolio that you see on Slide 52 – or 51, that real estate portfolio, we own for investment
purposes which means it excludes the premises or the buildings we own as operating
premises (01:07:44) which are classified under IFRS and all intangible asset.

We'll now take the next question from In-Yong Hwang from Goldman Sachs.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you so much for letting me ask a follow-up question. I just have one very
quick one on portfolio management in your P&C book. Obviously, that's helped you a lot
in staving off the pricing pressure in the reinsurance market over the last few years. I was
just wondering if there's a kind of a logical limit to how much can do on the portfolio
management side. I just noticed that the cancellation of your businesses for the April and
January, renewals have decreased in the last couple of years. So I was just wondering if
there's, yes, let you can (01:08:33) directly beyond that front, or if there's – if you still see
opportunities where you can do that. Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, I hope we'll never reach the limit, but there must be one somewhere. If you look at
Slide 11, I think the qualitatively what you see in the first of April renewal is what you were
not seeing but what you start to see which is showing how we proceeded in the past,
well, couple of years ago, you would have had cancelled only to manage the portfolio, we
were canceling business that was not producing and we were replacing by better
business.
Today, we are still doing that to a certain extent and also to another extent, we are
reducing shares on business where we think that strategically we should not lose but

practically, well, we cannot continue to support at the same level because of the
competition on prices. So, the way we have added a second stage to the portfolio
management.

Okay. That's very clear. Thank you very much.

And this second stage, you can only add it, in my opinion, if your franchise is dipping up or
the client tolerated you having it.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Yes. Understood.

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Okay.
