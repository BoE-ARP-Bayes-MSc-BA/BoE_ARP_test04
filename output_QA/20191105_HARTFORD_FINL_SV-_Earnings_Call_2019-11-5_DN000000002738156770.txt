Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. The Hartford had an excellent quarter
with strong financial results across all our business lines. Third quarter core earnings rose
31% over prior year to $548 million or $1.50 per diluted share, with lower catastrophe
losses and continued solid investment results. Our businesses are performing very well.
Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI was up 8% to $42.55 from year end. The
consolidated 12-month core earnings ROE was 12.3%, an impressive result in the current
market environment. The strong execution of our strategy is demonstrated by our
consistent operating performance quarter-to-quarter, delivering on key integration
milestones, and continuing to invest in our business to enhance customer experience
inefficiency.
Doug and Beth will cover results in more detail, but I wanted to touch briefly on a few
items. Commercial Lines highlights in the third quarter include core earnings of $303
million, up 14% over prior year. Solid top-line growth with and without Navigators and a
renewal pricing rate acceleration compared to the first half of the year.
When we announced the acquisition of Navigators more than a year ago, an important
part of our strategy was to broaden our underwriting in product capabilities as a Global
Specialty player, and added benefit was the expansion of our distribution relationships
into the wholesale channel to serve more risk needs of customers. Nearly six months of
past since we've closed the Navigators transaction.
The progress to-date is on track and I'm very pleased with the collaboration amongst the
teams and the positive reception from distribution partners. Our book is benefiting from
the strong pricing tailwinds in the market, providing the opportunity to restore certain
product lines within Global Specialty to targeted financial returns.

FINAL

Personal Lines core earnings were $87 million, up 85% benefiting from lower catastrophe
losses and favorable prior year development. While up slightly from prior year, the
underlying combined ratio of 92.3 for Personal Lines was a strong result. Our primary
focus in this business has been returning to growth, with new business up 34% in the
quarter.
Overall, net favorable reserve development for Property & Casualty was $47 million in the
quarter. They were both favorable and unfavorable development in various lines. Our
experienced actuarial and claims teams have demonstrated the ability to identify
emerging trends within our data, which is used to update our estimates each quarter.
Overall, I am confident in our loss reserve estimates.
Group Benefits delivered another excellent quarter with core earnings of $141 million, up
38%. The increase versus prior year was driven by favorable loss ratio, higher net
investment income and lower amortization of intangibles. This was partially offset by
increased investments in technology, claims management, and higher commissions
related to our voluntary products.

Bloomberg Transcript

The total loss ratio improved 4.4 points, driven by favorable disability results, partially
offset by a deterioration in the life loss ratio. The improvement in the disability continues
to come from favorable incidence trends. Results also benefited from updates to our
claim recovery assumptions and the recognition of an experience refund related to New
York Paid Family Leave product or accident year 2018.
In Group Life, severity was elevated in the quarter. However, we don't see any consistent
trend other than normal volatility. On the top line fully insured ongoing premiums were just
off slightly versus prior year. Persistency is running slightly below historical trends, as we
adjust pricing on targeted segments of the Aetna book. Importantly earned premium on
the Aetna book of business is in line with our deal assumptions and conversions of cases
continues to go very well from both a platform and pricing perspective. Overall, we are
very pleased with the operational execution and financial performance of Group Benefits.
Before I turn the call over to Doug, I wanted to make a few comments on the macro
environment. The Property & Casualty industry is facing a number of challenges that have
been well documented. Net investment income is under pressure and what is likely a
prolonged period of low interest rates, affecting new money in overall portfolio yields.
The frequency of severe weather related storms, as well as other catastrophic events
such as wildfires are elevated, pressuring rates to keep up with CAT trends. Social
inflation related to larger claim settlements continue to put pressure on loss cost trends.
However, social inflation is not a new phenomenon. We have been monitoring these
trends for years, taking the appropriate actions to ensure our pricing models in
underwriting reflect these realities.
To conclude, with one quarter left in the year, our experience through the first-nine
months is generally consistent with the outlook we provided with no major surprises. The
successful integration and execution of our two recent transactions, strong financial
Page 3 of 22

results, and capital management demonstrate our strategy is working. It is an exciting
time at The Hartford for all our stakeholders, customers, employees, distribution partners,
and shareholders. I am confident in our ability to produce consistent results contributing to
shareholder value creation.

FINAL

Now I'll turn the call over to Doug.

Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. The Hartford's Property & Casualty results
for the quarter were strong. Top line growth was fueled by the Navigators acquisition,
while underlying organic growth in commercial lines was a solid 4%. In Personal Lines, new
business growth is up significantly from third quarter 2018, but is moderated from earlier
in the year. We're pleased with the underlying returns across all of our Property & Casualty
businesses as each continues to execute effectively.

Bloomberg Transcript

It was a relatively benign quarter for catastrophes, as losses were well below third quarter
2018. Current year CAT losses in the quarter totaled $106 million, $63 million less than a
year ago. In aggregate, Property & Casualty reported favorable prior year development
of $47 million this quarter. Improving severity trends across workers' compensation, small
commercial package business, and personal lines auto all drove favorable reserve
releases. Partially offsetting these releases was reserve strengthening in commercial auto
liability, and general liability driven by some large loss activity.
As Chris has already mentioned, there's been a fair amount of commentary during the
quarter regarding social inflation and we're certainly not immune to these unfavorable
(inaudible) trends. However, keep in mind, our Hartford book is made up primarily of
smaller customers with lower limit profiles. In addition, the adverse development cover
we purchased on the Navigators loss development provides another layer of protection.
Over the past few years, while we've observed higher loss trends, we've also adjusted
general liability and commercial auto reserves accordingly. At the same time, we've made
underwriting and pricing adjustments to our book in response to these trends. We actively
monitor these trends and we'll continue to take appropriate actions as necessary.
Let me now shift into the results for our business segments. The underlying combined
ratio for Commercial Lines which excludes catastrophes and prior year development was
93.9, deteriorating 0.2 point from last year, but a strong performance nonetheless. As
expected, the Navigators book generated approximately 1 point of increase on the
combined ratio. This was partially offset by favorable non-CAT property results.
I'm encouraged by the pricing environment in the quarter. Our renewal written pricing in
standard Commercial Lines was 2.8%, up 40 basis points sequentially from second
quarter and up 90 basis points from prior year. This positive pricing change remain
somewhat depressed by the current workers compensation pricing environment.

FINAL

Middle market pricing, excluding workers' compensation was 5.6% in the quarter, up 130
basis points from second quarter and up a 180 basis points from the prior year. This
strong improvement reflects the rate actions we're taking across our core lines. Given
industry loss trends and operating performance in these non-workers' compensation
lines, I expect this pricing trend to persist.
Let's now take a look inside our Commercial Lines business units. Small Commercial
continued its excellent performance with an underlying combined ratio of 87.9. The margin
improvement versus last year was driven primarily by lower non-CAT property losses and
lower underwriting expenses. Written premium was flat to prior year due to renewal
written pricing, decreases in workers' compensation, and the completion of the new
business rollover from the foremost renewal rights transaction. Excluding foremost, new
business premium growth was up a very strong 13% for the quarter, driven by workers'
compensation and package business.
We expect continued new business growth to come from the launch of our nextgeneration package offering we call Spectrum. This is much more than just a new product
release, with this modular policy and the enhanced platform that supports it. We've taken
our industry-leading capabilities to a new level making buying small business insurance
easier than ever. A consumer buying small business insurance from The Hartford now
receives tailored recommendations for their coverage or the ability to customize their
own. Their agent is able to view real-time pricing much the same way and online retail
shopper can see a running total of the costs of products placed in their cart. As of today,
we're live in 32 states and we'll be in 45 by year-end. We are already seeing increases in
quotes, an additional, optional covered selections. This game-changing product launch
only adds to our excitement about our long-term prospects for growth in this segment.
In Middle & Large Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 99.6 improved 1.6 points
from 2018, driven primarily by lower non-CAT property losses. Notably inland marine
losses, which were elevated in the second quarter have moderated. Written premium was
up 12% over last year, due in part to the addition of certain legacy Navigator businesses
within Middle & Large Commercial. EX-Navigators written premium was up 7% with strong
production in national accounts, large property and programs as well as in verticals such
as construction and energy. We're achieving rate increases across Middle & Large
Commercial. Our property and auto rate increases are up sequentially in the quarter over
100 basis points with liability not far behind.
In Global Specialty, the underlying combined ratio of 96.2 deteriorated 6.4 points,
primarily the result of including the Navigators book this quarter. Since the acquisition,
we've been aggressively re-underwriting and repricing portions of the Navigators book. In
the third quarter, we achieved double-digit rate increases on both the Navigators US and
international business, where significant rate acceleration during the quarter and since the
first quarter of this year.
In the US, we achieved strong underwriting results in our management and professional
liability and surety lines. We're also pleased with both renewal pricing and new business
generation from our wholesale distribution channel in the US. In international, we've taken
significant actions to address two plus years of sub par returns in our Lloyd's syndicate

and London market portfolio. In addition to the aggressive pricing actions we're taking on
this book, we've exited certain underperforming lines and reduced significantly the
number of binders, MGAs and line slips across the portfolio. We've also materially reduce
the overall limits deployed in several lines including D&O, E&O and Casualty.
Our Global Specialty team is off to a terrific start. They are actively addressing
opportunities in the book, as well as taking advantage of favorable market conditions
where appropriate. Integration efforts continue, including expertise, sharing and data
science, technology, product design, claim and many other areas. Executing across core
risk functions will play an important role in improving the financial performance of this
business. We fully expect Global Specialty to be a significant contributor to commercials
premium growth as profit returns to target return levels.

Moving to Personal Lines. The underlying combined ratio of 92.3 deteriorated 50 basis
points from the third quarter of 2018, but still a very good overall results. The expense
ratio increased nearly 1 point due to the impact of lower earned premium, while the loss
ratio improved 40 basis points. The loss ratio improvement is reflected in both our auto
and homeowner results driven by earned pricing increases and non-CAT homeowners
experience. New business growth was up 34% compared to prior year. This was another
positive new business quarter as marketing spend and product adjustments continue to
gain traction.
In AARP Direct to auto, our critical production levers, including flow, close ratios, and new
sales, all improved compared to prior year. Importantly, we're pleased with the underlying
profile of this growth and encouraged by the improving trends. Despite continued strong
improvement in direct new business growth, total written premium was down 4%, though
we've made progress to improve the profitability of our ERP book more work is needed
on retention and new business to return to positive growth.
In summary, this was a very strong quarter across our Property & Casualty businesses,
We're executing effectively against our plans while responding to loss cost trends and
competitive market dynamics. We're taken appropriate pricing actions and making
disciplined underwriting decisions. This is driving clear progress in lines and accounts that
need to improve overall profitability.
Meanwhile, we remain extremely encouraged by the product breadth and depth of the
underwriting talent that the Navigators acquisition is contributing and we're already seeing
the impact of these additions in our businesses and with our distribution partners. The
positive progress on key milestones drive my bullish outlook on our future. I look forward
to updating you all in another 90 days.
Let me now turn the call over to Beth.

Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Thank you, Doug. Today, I'm going to cover third quarter results for the investment
portfolio Hartford Funds and Corporate and provide an update on capital management.

FINAL

Our investment portfolio continues to perform very well, with strong limited partnership
returns and generally stable investment yields. Net investment income was $490 million
for the quarter, up $46 million or 10% from the prior year. Excluding Navigators net
investment income was $462 million or 4% higher than the prior year. The annualized
limited partnership return was 15.3% in the quarter due to higher valuations on underlying
funds.
Lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads increased net unrealized gains on fixed
maturities after tax to $1.8 billion at September 30, up from $1.4 billion at June 30.
Unrealized and realized gains on equity securities classified and realized capital gains in
the income statement were $19 million before tax in the quarter and a $181 million before
tax through September 30. The credit performance of the investment portfolio remains
very strong. Net impairments in the quarter totaled $1 million, flat with third quarter 2018.

Bloomberg Transcript

Given the increasing likelihood of sustained low interest rate, I wanted to touch on how
we manage the portfolio in this environment and the impact of the portfolio yield due to
lower rates. We have a broad range of investment capabilities and a well-diversified
portfolio. Our strategy does not pursue lower credit quality for the purpose of making up
for lower yields and we will continue to invest in a diversified manner. For the quarter, our
current yield before tax excluding limited partnerships was 3.6% equating to $425 million.
Taking into consideration potential lower reinvestment rates projected using the forward
curve, we could see the portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships declined by close to
10 basis points in 2020 reducing the quarterly run rate of net investment income by
approximately $10 million before tax.
Turning to Hartford Funds. Core earnings of $39 million were down 5% from last year, but
up $1 million sequentially. Daily average AUM rose 2% from second quarter 2019, reflecting
strong market performance, partially offset by net outflows. Investment performance
remains very strong. As of September 30, about 70% of Hartford Funds outperformed
peers on a one, three and five year basis. Corporate core losses of $37 million improved
by $8 million from third quarter 2018. The principal driver of the improvement this quarter
was $11 million of income after tax from our retained equity interest in Talcott compared to
$1 million in third quarter 2018.
During the quarter, we continued to repurchase shares. Year-to-date through November 1,
we have repurchased 2.2 million shares for $126 million. With strong capital generation and
financial flexibility, we are pleased to be able to both invest in our businesses and return
capital to shareholders. During the third quarter, we issued $1.4 billion of debt comprised
of $600 million, 10-year 2.8% senior notes and $800 million 30-year 3.6% senior notes.
We used the proceeds to redeem approximately $1.65 billion of debt with a weighted
average coupon of 5.3%.
The redemption resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $90 million before tax.
We continue to plan to repay our $500 million, 5.5% senior notes maturing in March 2020,
which will put us in line with our leverage targets. Book value per diluted share, excluding
AOCI was $42.55, up 8% year-to-date and 9% at September 30, 2018. Core earnings
ROE over the last 12 months was 12.3%, well in excess of our cost of equity capital.

FINAL

A few other items to comment on before I close. We have included disclosure in the 10-Q
about the potential for subrogation recoveries from PG&E related to losses incurred
uncertain 2017 and 2018 California wildfires. Given uncertainties with respect to approval
of the PG&E bankruptcy plan, we have not recognized any subrogation recoveries to date.
Based on subrogation claims submitted by all insurers to PG&E and the terms of the
proposed settlement, which is contingent upon approval of the bankruptcy plan.
We would expect gross subrogation recoveries to be approximately $325 million,
although the actual amount we collect to subject to uncertainty. The first $116 million of any
such subrogation recoveries would reduce reinsurance recoverables we have recorded
under our CAT Reinsurance Treaties. Accordingly any benefit to income would be for
subrogation recoveries in excess of $116 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to fourth quarter, it has already been an active quarter for catastrophe related
events. Our budget forecast in the fourth quarter is approximately $80 million pre-tax.
Before considering any losses from the current California wildfires, we are approaching
$80 million of catastrophe losses in the month of October, including losses from
tornadoes in the Dallas area and other wind events. While it is still too early to make an
estimate of losses we may incur from the current California wildfires, we are monitoring
the fires closely in the areas we have ensured properties and businesses at risk.
As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we will complete our annual study of a spasticity
environmental reserves. Under the adverse development cover we purchased in 2016, we
have $977 million of remaining coverage available for increases in these reserves. Also we
did not seen any additional net loss reserves in the third quarter to our adverse
development cover for Navigators. So we continue to have $209 million of coverage
available on that book of business.
To summarize, the execution of our strategy is generating strong results across our
business lines. The integration of Navigators is on track and we look forward to continuing
to update you on our progress.
I'll now turn the call over to Susan, so we can begin the Q&A session.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Good morning. First off on that I do, the -- appreciate the new kind of streamline
disclosure within the press release that was helpful this quarter. My first question for you is
on capital. Just following up on some of your prepared remarks, it seems like you guys
got the majority of the tax attributes you are expecting this year as of the end of the third
quarter, just looking at the 10-Q disclosure. So I just -- I wanted to walk through that and
get a sense of share repurchases for the fourth quarter. And then for next year on the
capital side is, could you just give us a sense of the dividends, you could upstream from
the P&C subs in 2020 and also there is any change in the tax attributes you expect as
well?

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. So first of all, thank you for the comment on the press release. I'm glad that you like
the new format. So yes, as it relates to holding company cash. I would say overall, we're
on track with what we expected at the beginning of the year. Yes. The timing of the tax
benefit we received from our AMT refunds did come in a little bit earlier than we
anticipated, but we were anticipating that this year. So we took all of that into
consideration as we have projected sort of our view of share repurchases over the course
of this year and into next year. And we continue to target for this year about a total of
$200 million in share repurchases and then the remainder of our $1 billion authorization
would be used in 2020.
As it relates to then dividend streams as we go into 2020 again, as a reminder, we did
not take any net dividends from P&C in 2019. But we do anticipate going back to our
normal cadence in 2020. As we've talked about in the past, we see dividends sort of in
the $850 million to $900 million range. Obviously, it will depend on actual results from our
Group Benefits business. We're typically in the 300 to 350 range obviously results in
Group Benefits have been very strong. So we've seen some increases in those dividends
through the years. And then mutual funds usually is in that $100 million to $125 million.
And then we do still have some remaining tax benefits that we would expect to receive in
2020. So when we look at 2019, we're probably a little bit over $700 million in tax benefits
that will come through. And as we look to 2020, we'd be just slightly under $600 million.
So again, very much in line with what we have laid out previously. And then again, I'll just
remind you, as I said in my prepared remarks, we do still anticipate paying our maturing
debt of $500 million in March of 2020.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Thanks. That's very helpful. And then my second question, if we want to kind of keep track
of how Navigators is trending, you guys highlighted some earnings projections for that
business going a couple of years out, so I'm just trying to get a sense. Can you kind of set
the stage or give us a sense how much earnings came through in the quarter or is the
best way for us to really look at the Global Specialty margin to get a sense of how
Navigators is tracking?

Elyse, thank you for your question. I would say what we've commented upon in the past as
far as our goals, it related to the financial performance of Navigators are really
unchanged. I think we did say that the slope of it might be slightly different and the
components might be slightly different, but we still see a path to earning $200 million of
core earnings prior to amortization of intangibles in that four year to five year period of
time and still excited, obviously there's a lot of rate have been taken in the specialty
space broadly defined, but Doug, that's what I would say over the long term, but what
would you say in the near term?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Just add that this quarter, we made very few adjustments to the prior Navigators loss
ratios across their lines either prior year or in the current action year. We tweak auto
liability slightly in the quarter, but other than that Beth, it was a pretty quiet quarter relative
to actuarial assumptions.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then can you give us a sense of the rate that you're getting just within their
book of business.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah. I mentioned in my commentary Elyse that it was double digits. And in the quarter,
essentially the US book was right on top of 10. Internationally, they were getting closer to
16 and when you put the two together, we're tuck-in 12-ish -- 11 to 12 points of price. I also
said that it was accelerating in the quarter. So we're quite pleased about that as you think
about the run rate July through September. And in early peak of October keeps me
optimistic, October, it looks a lot like September. So I think we're off to a really good start.
I'm very pleased with progress, Vince's team working hard to change the outcomes here.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

Good morning. Thanks for the call. I was hoping you could weigh in a little bit more on
some of the auto trends that we have seen it other companies both the commercial auto
trend and the severity in frequency seems to be a little bit different by company and kind
of how you vary that? What are your experiences have and so why you think its behind it?
And then sort of second question, the football with the private passenger and they ask
kind of the same questions about frequency and severity, all states saw a little bit of a
spike in their frequency for physical damage and I don't know if you've seen the same
thing, but anyway those are my two questions.

FINAL

And Paul, let me just clarify Personal and Commercial both you want me to, -- okay. Let's
start with personal. We continue to be pleased by the trends we see in our Personal Lines
auto book, frequency has been in good shape for several quarters now. And severity
were mindful of collision severity, but essentially our loss trends are within our
expectations and feel good about progress in overall performance of the personal line's
auto line.
In Commercial, bit of a different story in the sense that our small commercial book much
smaller vehicle, we've been working right now for five years to six years, we have
transformed that book, we're essentially not a monoline player except in certain
circumstances. Improvement there, but more improvement necessary in the commercial
auto small commercial space. In the middle, again, this is not especially auto sector. This is
essentially commercial auto fleets attached to our middle market accounts, slightly
heavier than small commercial. We also have been chasing rate here over the last six
years to seven years. We've made progress, but not at all acceptable relative to our
operating performance in the line today.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we continue to make underwriting adjustments. We will continue to work hard on rate.
Very pleased that our rate was up over 10 points in Q3 and auto. We'll continue to work at
that in Q4 and into 2020. When I think about loss trend, they look to us like they are in the
mid-single digits maybe plus a little bit in that 5 to 6 -- 6.5 range commercial auto. We're
mindful that which means our pricing needs to be on top of that plus some to make
appreciable progress in combined ratio. Chris or Beth anything?

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

Do you have any particularly theory about the commercial business. It might be different
from other folks about why we're seeing this a very trend and whether or not it's
deteriorating [ph]?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

I would just offer that our book of business on the Commercial side, EX-NAV is largely
primary auto. So we're not a significant player in the excess space. I do think the excess
layers have had some pressure over the past three years, four years. Navigators has an
especially auto book. We're very mindful that. We're working closely with them, sharing
our trends, working actuarial assumptions et cetera, and taking quite a bit of rate there.
So our rate change in the Navigator auto book is substantial. But I don't have any greater
insight, because I don't have insight into other competitor books like I do our own.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks. A couple of quick ones here. First, I'm just curious in the Commercial Lines
segment, the expense ratio declined year-over-year only around 17% growth G&A
expenses I expected to be a little bit higher than that. Was there anything unusual there?
Or is that a decent run rate with respect to kind of G&A expense growth and what we're
seeing with the expense ratio?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Good question, Brian. And there are some thing is happening in both Q2 and Q3
that make that compare a little bit challenging. So let me do my best unpack it. In Q3
quarter, we actually had some credits that ran through from taxes, licenses and fees and
also some bad debt credits. And when you kind of laser them and you basically get a
quarterly expense ratio more like 34.5. In Q2, we had some one-timers that put some
upward pressure on the expense.
And I'd also point out to you, as the Navigators book comes into our expense ratios as a
typical specialty company sometimes have -- they've got slightly higher expense base. So
between the US and certainly the international, there is a little bit of inflation on the
expense coming in from NAV that we work our way through over the next couple of years
as we earn our way toward those profit targets we've talked about. So I look at the run
rate Q3 more in the 34.5 range I think that's kind of where we'll be Q4 as I look out.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Thanks. And then my second question in the Small Commercial area, you talked
about how it's a little bit more insulated from the social inflation environment given the
kind of limits profile of that business. I'm curious, have you seen any increasing
competition in that area as a result of what's going on in the loss cost inflation
environment?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah. Brian, this is Doug. Here we respond to -- I would say, again across many of our
businesses, there is always competitive pressure. There is new entrants. There's FinTech
related or insured tech-related activities, but I wouldn't say it's rapidly changing in a more
competitive environment where everyone is piling in, I would say when heard us talk about
this before, we have a 30-year history here with a lot of data, a lot of capabilities, a lot of
deep trusted agent relationships that does provide an element of advantage to us, but
we are really tuned in on the emerging trends and our own mindset of, what do we need
to do to continue to get better every day. What do we need to continue to differentiate
ourselves as one of the top go-to-market, so that's our mindset. And Doug, if you would
add anything?

Yeah. So maybe just a couple of comments about our new Spectrum and then comments
on what we've been working on the last couple of years, so very excited Brian about this
launch of NextGen Spectrum. We've been kind of in the design and building stage for a
couple of years now, and I think it's going to be a terrific product in the market much in the
way. The digital experiences that we're all used to on our personalized because of that
launch we've been laser-focused these last couple of years to get our rate adequacy on
our spectrum product where they need to be because it's very difficult, if your profit
challenge in the current line and then go to launch new product.
So as we think about loss trends over these last couple of years, we've continued to
make sure we're on top of those trends with pricing. We see liability trends in that
spectrum area, still in the mid-single digits and our pricing has been matching that over
time and we feel good about our balance sheet in terms of the reserves that are
recorded on our ledger. So yes, we've been very focused on loss trends here I think good
progress and now exciting that we launch our new effort into the latter half of 2019 into
2020.

Next, we have Jimmy Bhullar of JP Morgan.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. I've a couple of questions for Doug. And first on commercial lines. How
do you think about your ability to take advantage of improving pricing in the overall
market, especially given that you've got a big exposure to workers' comp where prices
are actually obviously under pressure?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Well, we're optimistic that our non-workers' compensation pricing continues to improve,
as I suggested that certainly that was the case in Q3. And I expect that to continue into
Q4. Yes. We recognized we have some headwinds on the workers' comp environment, I
would again point out the profitability of the books is excellent particularly small
commercial. So we're mindful of those headwinds and navigating in the middle account by
account and being thoughtful about class selection and state and geography and small
commercial. So yeah, it is a tale of two where we're working hard to improve our core
pricing, while we understand it's a very competitive workers' comp dynamic that matters
greatly to us.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

And then on Personal Lines, I think you would hope that at some point over the next few
quarters, you'll start to see stabilizing premiums and maybe an improvement in
Page 13 of 22



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2019-11-05

premiums, but it seems like more and more companies are sort of shifting their focus
from reviving margins to accelerating growth just comments on competition whether it's
still rational and your expectation of when you can sort of get to flat to positive premium
growth in that market?

FINAL

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Jimmy, obviously we're not going to give any guidance or specific drivers, but the overall
focus is both Doug and I've comments upon has been growth orientation. But you are
right, I mean it's a dynamic marketplace just because we want to grow and there's a lot of
other competitors that are shifting to that same mindset.
So, the trick in that environment, at least in my judgment is going to remain disciplined.
You got, again, segment appropriately your new business by states or territories that
makes sense for you compared to where your pricing is and the team is executing very
well. It's just we're getting the responses just not converting as many new business
opportunities as feasible, but Doug, that's what I would say?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. I agree Chris. And I think we laid out in the supplement, you can see we've made
very good progress on the retention front. So I think there's a little more work to be done
there and I think there is a little bit more left. And then absolutely, we are focused on
adjusting and thinking carefully about what we do on the new business front because we
want to raise those levels new business successes.

Next, we have Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey, thanks. Good morning. First question for Doug on, I guess keep it here on
commercial auto and just thinking about, it seems like over the past call, half decade.
We've been talking about commercial auto reserve development, and it seems like we've
been talking about are probably more Hartford than a lot of competitors, maybe not so
much over the past year, but I'd just be curious to maybe hear your thoughts on the
extent to which maybe you feel like you got ahead of some of these trends maybe in '15,
'16 and '17? And to the extend that you're seeing something new, what is new in this 2019
environment that you potentially had reserve for contemplated prior to this?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Ryan, thanks. Let's just start on the quarter and then I do want to comment, because I
think you're onto something relative to the prior trends. So in this quarter, we made an
adjustment to our prior year development based on some large losses we had seen in
Page 14 of 22



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2019-11-05

FINAL

our national account book, so it's largely national accounts. I would say almost all national
accounts 80% of the change is national accounts. And it's something that we had not
adjusted in the -- last several years, so really exclusively our National book.
If you go back over five years to six years correctly stated, we have been adjusting auto. I
would say back in the '12, '13 time period, we had a broader specialty auto book
transportation vehicles that caused some of the adjustment and actually raised our
attention to this commercial auto dynamic that we've been working hard on for five years
or six years. So I would agree with you. If you've looked at what we've done in the
commercial auto space on our reserves and our current actual year underwriting and
pricing. This has been an ongoing work in process for us. We did some tuning in the
quarter, but more importantly, we continue to leverage the findings in our book of
business to do the best job we can and underwriting a profitability book going forward
and we're sharing them with Navigators as we come together.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Perfect. And then, then maybe for Chris. Chris just on Group Benefits are we seeing some
very favorable trends there? And I guess what surprises of P&C analysts, how well pricing
seems to hold up? So I'm curious, in your view, how does the pricing cycle kind of work for
Group Benefit? Are you seeing more competition there, what insulates Group Benefits
from seeing I guess some of the same trends we've seen in workers' comp over the next
couple of years?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Sure, Ryan, I would say, yeah, we are performing very well, and I said in my commentary, I
think we've provided enough data to say that there were a couple of one timers in this
quarter. So I'd look at it that the quarter was roughly more in line with that $120 million
earnings, and 8% margin, but clearly above our long-term views that we've guided to
which is still six to seven. I think the thing that you just have to keep in mind, there is a lot
of the results that are emerging today are based on pricing and commitments we've
made two years, three years ago that are just outperforming. So unlike P&C, we generally
make three year rate guarantees. We're very thoughtful and disciplined in making those
three year rate guarantees because that's the commitment. So we're just outperforming
the expectations both on incidences and recoveries that is contributing to that current
outperformance. So hopefully that helps you.

Next, we have David Motemaden of Evercore.

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just a question for Doug. I just wanted to get a bit more detail
on the changes that you guys made to reserves in GL. And also just talk about what you're
Page 15 of 22



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2019-11-05

assuming on severity going forward in your loss picks and what sort of rate you're seeking
in the market right now?

FINAL

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

That was a multiple component question, so let me do my best to work our way through.
In other liability, general liability, we made some tweaks really across years, across
businesses I would say a series of small tweaks couple in the product area, a couple of
umbrellas et cetera, nothing significant in any one pocket but largely across our middle
market book of business. Construction included a little bit of our specialty general liability
book. So that really is the basis for the tweaking we did in the quarter for general liability.
In a broader sense, we think about loss trends. Overall, our loss trends are somewhere in
that mid-single digit range, when you combine all our lines and I'm thinking primarily about
auto liability and GL which are the two lines that really formed the basis for most of your
question. So they may move a bit between small and middle and some of our specialty
lines with the specialty -- Global Specialty book, but we're talking about trying to be on
top of mid-single digit trends. And now our pricing across various lines is either on top of
slightly advancing on or appreciably on top of in the case of some of our specialty excess
areas.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I share with you, we're really pleased about some of the specialty areas that we've
had substantial movement in pricing, double-digit moves in pricing where I feel like we're
going to see the benefits of that kind of work into our book in 2020 and beyond.

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Got it. Great. Thanks. And a question for -- just for Chris on the group business and top
line specifically, sales were down a decent amount year-over-year, just sort of wondering
what you're seeing competitively. And also more specifically what your outlook would be
for top line earned premium growth here over the next few years as that knows is more
fully integrated?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Sure, David. I would say, I was trying to explain that I mean it is still a competitive
environment out there, but there is still an element of rationality that I see most of our
competitors are exhibiting, you might have an account or two or new business opportunity
where someone does something more aggressive, but generally competitive but
balanced. So I would say the year-over-year numbers that you're looking at it does look
down but really when you adjust for so in New York, the family paid leave product that
launched in '18. You really have sort of a $40 million delta between year-to-date '19
compared to year-to-date '18. So you really you can consider it slightly down to flattish.
So again, I think we're still performing at a high level from our sales side. We do still get
some contribution to sales in that $40 million to $50 million range from Aetna's medical
staff that is still referring business and jointly selling. So we feel, good about the overall
sales performance. So I said in my opening comments, premiums are slightly down 1% on
an earned basis, primarily due to just higher lapses, lower persistency on the Aetna book
Page 16 of 22

as we are taking targeted actions to reprice those book. So everything is according to
plan, but as we look forward, I still see modest growth in top line for Group Benefits.
Really supported by some of our ancillary lines anchored in A&H and voluntary.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Hey. Good morning. I wouldn't mind maybe trying to get more color on next-gen
spectrum in terms of maybe you can just kind of isolate what the major changes are, is it - from the commentary, is it easier for your -- the business owners to self service. I'm just
curious, is there a direct selling component to potentially for small businesses? And then
also is there ultimately to measure the success to you, you expect sales to accelerate or
better profitability? Just any more color would be great since it seems like it's a big deal.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Yeah. Good question, Mike and thank you for asking it. I'd start by saying, yes, this is a
sales tool that essentially will sit on the desktop of our CSR's customer service reps
around the country and all the agents and brokers we do business with. It's a tool that will
allow them to be faster, more insightful and help their customers make choices. I would
say inside the tool you should think about good-better-best type dynamics, all the
coverage is very tuned to what a certain customer or SIC class would require. What types
of optional coverages, are there, et cetera. So, I think it's a best-in-class selling tool with
advice that either, comes out of the blocks with a terrific offer a customer or offers
additional coverages that a CSR will work with a potential customer to purchase.
So that is at the basis of this exciting innovation for us. And then secondly, yeah, we do
expect over time. Our new sales and spectrum to lift. It's hard to predict, but our
expectations over the next couple of years we will see some change in our new business
sales and we'll watch that carefully and report on that as we go through time.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. Yeah. Lastly, if we step back and kind of talk about in a broader sense
about commercial pricing versus loss cost trend. What -- is it fair to say that there is -- if
there is a gap it's not, it hasn't changed much quarter-over-quarter or taking into account
workers' comp and I mean -- so it sounds like there hasn't been any meaningful notable
changes over the last quarter.

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

And is your question more in the loss trend area or the pricing area. Just so --

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

It's kind of both. It seems like pricing is moving north and trend might be moving a little bit
north. So net-net kind of similar to last quarter.

FINAL

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah, I would agree with your statement in the aggregate. And then I think we have to
parse it apart by specialty, by excess, by primary, financial lines, spectrum et cetera. So in
the aggregate, yes, we see lifting in pricing across middle, non-workers' comp, as we've
examined our loss trend, I would say, largely in the primary space pretty consistent with
Q2. Yeah. Maybe we are little careful to make sure we're catching some uptick in the
social inflation dynamic, but I don't think material in any given way. And then in the
Specialty book, yeah, we're spending a lot of time inside our excess and umbrella, our
specialty areas and we're mindful of where trends are expecting a little bit of upward lift
in those trends and therefore our pricing has been pretty aggressive there so pleased
with progress on both fronts, but I think you have it about right.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning. Two quick follow-ups. So maybe going back to Mike's question
on rate versus loss trend. So if you blend I guess all the moving parts and look at small
commercial. As we head into 2020, is your sense that the loss trend will end up running
harder than what we expected, hence the rate versus loss trend metric does not expand
or is it more a function of the book?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

So let me start and Beth and Chris, can grow it up. We're not prepared today to take into
2020 yet. What I am very pleased about is, if you look at our metrics on our XX [ph]
combines across commercial. And you see him for our segments, I think we've done a
nice job and dealing with loss trend getting improving rate performance and across both
our most profitable segment, which is small commercial kind of holding in margins that are
terrific.
And we are mindful that we need to make more meaningful change in the middle and
large commercial areas. So I look at an all-in Q3 number on top of Q2 and feel pretty
good about it. And as I mentioned in my earlier commentary, we know there was a little
bit of upward pressure from the NAV book coming in. We'll work our way through that and
at some point, that'll be a positive because we'll start turning the tide on that number as
we move into 2020.

And I must -- Chris or anyone has to add something to that.

FINAL

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

All right. Again I think Doug is accurate as always. I think the trick is going to be here -everything sort of more granular, right. These days, whether it would be states products,
accounts. So when you add it all up, I think what Doug says makes perfect sense. My
particular point of view is that this could be a dynamic environment for the next couple of
years for sure, because I don't think it's realistic at least in my expectation that 15 points of
rate in Specialty book in aggregate is going to get you back to targeted returns.
As I said, particularly as it relates to Navigators, we're taking a multiple year journey to get
to targeted earnings and returns. And I think a lot of others are going to be in that same
position where just one year of feeling good about high-single digit or low-double digit
rates in certain lines primarily specialty isn't going to cut it and it's going to require a
multiyear approach.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. The only other question is on the last call, I guess we had fine tuned Navigators a
bit and Chris on that call, you had said 0.10-ish [ph] was sort of the number for 2020. Are
we still in the ballpark or based on what is evolved or we are somewhere in the middle or
not?

A - Chris Swif t

Yeah. Obviously, we are not going to give you any really specific details but the ranges

Good morning. Yes. Most of my questions have been answered, but I did want to follow
up on the new Spectrum policy. And I wondered specifically whether the, there's a little bit
of leapfrogging going on with other competitors in their own system. Can you actually
detect when someone else has something, and a new strong offering and see a little bit
of lowering of your quote volume, then you put something out, you see a little bit of
higher. And if you do, does that last for a while, does that have some duration? I'm just
trying to get a sense of the growth components and how this might play out?

Thanks, Gary. We do watch all of those statistics carefully. So we're able to watch quote
volume, we're able to watch yield. So the number of hits or successful quotes against
total quotes. I would say relative to competitors rollout, we watch what they've put out
publicly. And normally there is a little bit of a buzz or discussion about enhancements or
innovations in the marketplace, I'm sure, very similar to what's happening with our nextgeneration Spectrum offering right now. I think that's the easier way to find out about
things but we study the numbers we're mindful of even the statistics I quoted in my script,
right. We're watching optional purchase, optional coverage purchases right now, we're
watching number of quotes and we have an expected trajectory that we expect to see
over the next three quarters or four quarters, and so we'll be right on top of that.

The next question we have will come from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everybody. I want to start with one on the reserve development and in
commercial lines, then sneak in another one on the Group Benefits. So with the reserve
development, I think in recent years we've seen kind of initial loss picks in both general
liability and commercial auto come in a bit below most recent picks for our prior years.
Can you maybe talk about that dynamic and how comfortable you are with your picks for
the more recent years considering the fact that you have been increasing the initial loss
picks there? And is it just pricing that you've achieved that's offset some of the weaker
picks in prior years?

A - Doug Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Let me start and then Beth can work over the top. I would say over the past six plus years,
we've been working both pricing and underwriting. So we've been adjusting our offerings
Page 20 of 22



FINAL

Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2019-11-05

across the marketplace in classes, monoline, group with other accounts, et cetera. So
multiple different options that we've been working. In general, I would agree with you that
we have been light on our Axiom picks at 12 months, which is the reason that if you look at
our trend line, we've made adjustments to those prior year picks over the last six years,
seven years. And I think we do a nice job of disclosing that in our supplement. So the
disappointment is that loss trend obviously has been higher than we expected and we
didn't get the punch that we expected on the underwriting side, and so we're doubling
down now, I think we continue to make progress.
Again I'd separate some of this discussion by class of vehicle, whether we're talking small
commercial with primarily private passenger and light-vans or middle mark with some
heavier or the specialty area. And I think that our success or lack thereof is not very
different than the overall marketplace. But what we've tried to do is when we see
something in the book, we've addressed it both on our reserve levels and also on the
underwriting and that's why I don't think there is anything new here. It's just -- we just
need to dive even harder, Beth?

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

No, I think that summarizes it very well, Doug.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thanks. And then on the Group Benefits side, is the experience and claims
recoveries that you've seen for recent vintage as you expect that to kind continue -- is
that baked into your estimates today or do you expect some reversion that to me?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah. I would say beyond that obviously we update our statistics in views periodically
that's what we did this quarter. So that reflects our best views of trends going forward
that in essence, we priced product on and book reserves on. So it is our best thinking
from here. Now, we've always talked about it changes in incidents and/or recoveries is
somewhat employment centric related. So as long as we don't have any big shocks into
the system, I would expect our estimates here to hold, but as I said, it's a dynamic world
out there and when things change we just have to reevaluate our assumptions and we
would change accordingly.
