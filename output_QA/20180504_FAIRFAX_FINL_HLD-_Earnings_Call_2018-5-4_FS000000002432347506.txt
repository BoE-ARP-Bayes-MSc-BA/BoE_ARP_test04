Your host for today's call is Prem Watsa with opening remarks from Mr. Derek Bulas. Mr.
Bulas, please begin.

Derek Bulas
Good morning and welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's 2018 first quarter results. This
call may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ perhaps materially
from those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of
uncertainties and risk factors. The most foreseeable of which are set out under risk
factors in our base shelf prospectus which has been filed with Canadian securities
regulators and is available on SEDAR.
I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa.

FINAL

Thank you, Derek. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Fairfax's First
Quarter Conference Call. I plan to give you some of the highlights as usual and then pass
it on to Dave Bonham, our CFO, for additional financial details.
In the first quarter of 2018, book value per share increased by 4.9% adjusted for the $10
per share common dividend paid at the first quarter of 2018. Our insurance companies
had an excellent first quarter with a combined ratio of 96% with excellent reserving and
producing an underwriting profit of $109 million. All of our major insurance companies had
combined ratios of less than 100% with Zenith at 86.1%, Odyssey Group at 91.2%, Allied
World at 94.8%.

Bloomberg Transcript

First quarter operating income was very strong at $238 million and strong net investment
gains in the quarter of $934 million, which arose primarily as a result of net gains on
equities of $1 billion, offset by losses in bonds and CPI-linked derivatives. The gain on
equities was primarily from Thomas Cook changing the accounting for its ownership in
Quess Corp. from a subsidiary to an associate company. Under IFRS accounting, Quess
Corp. was deconsolidated from Thomas Cook, and Fairfax's ownership in Quess was
recorded at fair value. In the next year, Quess will be spun off from Thomas Cook and
Fairfax will own approximately 33% of the company.
As shown on page 50 of our quarterly report, we realized gains on our investment
portfolio of $727 million in the quarter and had unrealized gains of $207 million. As we
have mentioned in our annual meetings, annual reports, quarterly calls, and I mentioned
again with IFRS accounting where stocks and bonds are recorded at market and subject to
mark-to-market gains or losses, quarterly and annual income will fluctuate and investment
results will only make sense over the long-term. All in all, we had net earnings of $684
million for Fairfax shareholders.
Our insurance and reinsurance businesses premium volume was up in the first quarter of
2018 versus 2017 by 42.6% primarily due to increases at Northbridge, Crum & Forster, and
Odyssey, and the acquisitions in 2017 of Allied Group, the Latin American operations of
AIG in Argentina, Chile and Colombia, and AIG branches in Central and Eastern Europe,
offset by the divestiture of First Capital, while the combined ratio for our insurance and
reinsurance operations was 96%. Excluding the acquisitions and divestiture, our premium
was up 7.1%.
At the subsidiary level, the change in net premiums written and the combined ratios in the
first quarter was as follows. Odyssey Group, I just wanted to emphasize Odyssey has
changed its name from OdysseyRe to Odyssey Group, which includes OdysseyRe,
Hudson Insurance, and Newline Group Insurance in London. So it's three companies
together. They thought it appropriate to have a name changed to Odyssey Group. So
Odyssey Group had a 91.2% combined ratio and a 24.2% increase in premium, excellent
results. Crum & Forster, 99.7% combined ratio, 7.5% growth in premium. Northbridge,
99.2% combined ratio, 6.8% growth. Zenith, 86.1%, premiums down 7.1%. Fairfax Asia,
104.5%, premiums down because of First Capital, 22.1%. Brit, 98.9%, premium is up 3.6%.
And Allied World was in, for the first time in Fairfax, 94.8%.

FINAL

We continue to hold our CPI-linked derivatives with a notional value of $119 billion, which
produced unrealized losses of $20 million in the first quarter. If some of the unexpected
risks come to pass, these CPI-linked derivatives could become very valuable. We will
continue to hold them for some time.
When you review our statements, please remember that when we own more than 20% of
a company, we equity count (00:05:56). When we own above 30%, we consolidate, so
that mark-to-market gains in these companies are not reflected in our results.
As you can see on page 55 of our quarterly report, the fair values of our investment in
non-insurance associates and listed consolidated companies like Cara, Grivalia, Thomas
Cook, Fairfax India, Fairfax Africa is $5.5 billion versus a carrying value of $4.7 billion, an
unrealized gain of approximately $800 million that's not on our balance sheet.

Bloomberg Transcript

In January, the company completed the acquisition of the insurance operations of AIG in
Uruguay for $5.9 million in cash. In February, Fairfax India entered into an agreement to
acquire a 51% equity interest in The Catholic Syrian Bank for approximately $186 million.
Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the
second quarter of 2018. This bank is headquartered in Thrissur, Kerala, and offers banking
services across India.
Also in March, Fairfax India entered into an agreement to acquire an additional 6% of the
outstanding shares of Bangalore International Airport from Siemens for approximately $67
million. This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions expected to close in the
second quarter of 2018 and will increase Fairfax India's equity interest in Bangalore Airport
to 54%. Bangalore Airport owns and operates the Kempegowda International Airport in
Bangalore, India through a public-private partnership.
In the last four months, we raised $1.84 billion through a CAD 650 million bond issue at
4.25%, a €600 million bond issue at 3.1%, and a $600 million bond issue at 4.58%.
Proceeds are being used to retire debt maturities for essentially the next four years. The
company expects to save approximately $50 million annually in interest expense. The
make whole provision, we will have paid to redeem our debt to-date, is approximately
$62 million.
On April 19, 2018, the company entered into an agreement, as you know, to acquire 100%
equity interest in Toys "R" Us Canada from its U.S. parent for approximately $237 million,
which is CAD 300 million. Closing out the acquisition is expected to occur in the second
quarter of 2018. Toys "R" Us Canada is a specialty retailer of toys and baby products with
82 stores across Canada.
During the fourth quarter of 2017 and up to May 2, 2018, the company repurchased for
cancellation and repurchased for treasury a total of 543,481, to be exact, shares,
subordinate voting shares, at an aggregate cost of approximately $284 million. As we've
said in the past, we believe the new U.S. administration's policies of reducing corporate
taxes to 21%, rolling back regulation business and possible significant infrastructure
spending has the potential of boosting economic growth in the United States for many
Page 3 of 18

FINAL

years to come. Already sentiment among small and large businesses has improved
dramatically and animal spirits in the U.S. are alive and well. When the U.S. economy, which
is approximately $20 trillion, does well, much of the world does well too. To us, this means
our concerns of China or Europe precipitating a worldwide recession, depression have
been significantly reduced but not eliminated. The fundamentals for the United States
may well be excellent for the next few years.
Of course, the trade policies of the United States could precipitate a collapse in world
trade, so these risks will continue to be very much monitored by us, and we continue to
think the new administration's policies may make this a stock picker's market and one in
which we have thrived over the past 32 years. We will continue to pick good companies
which provide significant downside protection and potential appreciation over the longterm.

Bloomberg Transcript

As of March 31, 2018, we have $12.1 billion in cash and short-term investments in our
portfolio. We have 32% of our total investment portfolio to take advantage of
opportunities that may come our way. We have another approximately $6 billion of oneand-a-half-year treasury bills that are classified as bonds. Interest income is currently
running at a run rate of $700 million, up $100 million from year end. With a run rate of $15
billion in gross premium, a huge focus on underwriting discipline, a portfolio of
approximately $40 billion, and our investment team operating in a stock picker's market,
all grounded on our fair and friendly culture built over 32 years, we expect this will all help
us to generate a 15% return for our shareholders.
Now, before I turn it over to Dave Bonham, our CFO, so he can give you some more
information on the underlying financials, I wanted to say that in the future, our conference
calls will be done by Paul Rivett, our President, with Dave Bonham, our CFO. As Paul is on
holiday during the next conference call in August, I will do it. But after that, he will take
over the calls.
I will now pass it on to Dave.

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Thank you, Prem. So, in the first quarter of 2018, Fairfax has reported net earnings of $684
million or $23.60 per share on a fully diluted basis, and that compared to the first quarter
of 2017 when we reported a net earnings of $83 million or about $3 per fully diluted share.
Underwriting profit at our insurance and reinsurance operations increased by $2 million
year-over-year to $109 million at a 96% combined ratio, relative to an underwriting profit
of $107 million last year at a 95% combined ratio.
Our combined ratio in the first quarter of 2018 benefited from net favorable prior reserve
development of $86 million and that translated into about three combined ratio points.
And that was somewhat lower than net favorable development of $103 million in the first
quarter of 2017 when it was 5 combined ratio points. Current period catastrophe losses in
the first quarter of 2018, all of which were attritional, totaled $53 million or 2 combined

FINAL

ratio points. And that was higher than the cat losses in the first quarter of 2017, which
totaled $39 million or 2 combined ratio points.
So now turning to our operating company results. We can start with Northbridge.
Northbridge's underwriting profit of $2 million and a combined ratio of 99% in the first
quarter of 2018 was comparable to the underwriting profit of $3 million at a combined
ratio of 99% in the same period in 2017. Net favorable prior year reserve development in
the first quarter of $13 million or 5 combined ratio points increased from a $10 million or 4
combined ratio points in the first quarter of 2017 and principally reflected better-thanexpected emergence on commercial and personal automobile lines of business. In
Canadian dollar terms, net premiums written by Northbridge increased 7% in the first
quarter of 2018, reflecting price increases across the group and strong retention of
renewal business.
Turning to Odyssey Group. In the first quarter of 2018, Odyssey Group reported an
underwriting profit of $55 million and a combined ratio of 91%. That compared to an
underwriting profit of $48 million and a combined ratio of 90% in the same period last
year. Catastrophe losses in the first quarter, all of which were attritional, totaled $38
million translated into 6 combined ratio points and that was somewhat higher than cat
losses of $29 million last year translating into 6 combined ratio points.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net favorable prior year reserve development, principally related to property catastrophe
loss reserves, was $41 million or 7 combined ratio points in the first quarter of 2018 and
that was similar to the first quarter of 2017 when Odyssey Group reported $36 million or 7
combined ratio points of net favorable prior year reserve development.
Odyssey Group's net premiums written increased by 24% to $690 million in the first
quarter of 2018 from $555 million last year, the increase principally reflecting higher net
premiums written across all of its divisions with the U.S. insurance division accounting for
the majority of the increase mainly in crop and automobile lines of business.
Moving on to Crum & Forster. Crum & Forster's underwriting profit of $1 million at a
combined ratio of 99.7% in the first quarter, again, was comparable to underwriting profit
of $2 million at a combined ratio of 99.5% in the first quarter last year. There was no net
prior year reserve development in the first quarter of 2018 and a nominal amount in the
first quarter of 2017. Current period catastrophe losses were also nominal at Crum &
Forster in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017. Its net premiums written increased by 7% in
the first quarter, principally reflecting growth in excess and surplus lines, accident and
health, commercial multi-barrel (00:16:27), general liability, property, and commercial
transportation lines of business.
Zenith reported an underwriting profit in the first quarter of $27 million at a combined ratio
of 86% compared to an underwriting profit of $37 million at a combined ratio of 80% in
the first quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease mainly reflected lower net
favorable prior year reserve development, $23 million in the first quarter of 2018 or 12
combined ratio points. And that development reflected net favorable emergence on
accident years 2013 through 2016. Net premiums written by Zenith of $308 million in the

Page 5 of 18

FINAL

first quarter of 2018 decreased by 7% year-over-year, and that was principally reflective of
price decreases.
Brit reported an underwriting profit of $4 million and a combined ratio of 99% in the first
quarter of 2018 compared to an underwriting profit of $11 million and a combined ratio of
97% last year. There is no net prior year reserve development and nominal current period
catastrophe losses in both the first quarters of 2018 and 2017. Net premiums written of
$409 million in the first quarter increased by 4% year-over-year, reflecting the positive
impact of underwriting initiatives they've launched in recent years, price increases, and the
favorable impact of foreign exchange.
Allied World reported an underwriting profit of $27 million and a combined ratio of 95% in
the first quarter of 2018. Allied World had nominal net favorable prior year reserve
development and no current period catastrophe losses in the first quarter of 2018.

Fairfax Asia. Fairfax Asia reported an underwriting loss of $2 million and a higher combined
ratio of 105% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to an underwriting profit of $5 million
and a combined ratio of 94% in the comparable period in 2017. Net premiums written by
Fairfax Asia decreased by 46% in the first quarter, reflecting the impact of the sale of First
Capital in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding First Capital, net premiums written
decreased by 22%, and that was due to lower premium retention at the other companies
in the segment.
Insurance and reinsurance other, this segment produced an underwriting loss of $5 million
and a combined ratio of 102% in the first quarter 2018. That compared to an underwriting
profit of $1 million and a combined ratio of 99.5% in the same period last year. The lower
underwriting profit principally reflected the absence of prior year reserve development in
the first quarter of 2018, whereas that reporting segment benefited from $13 million or 7
combined ratio points of net favorable prior year reserve development in the comparable
period 2017.
Excluding the net premiums written by Fairfax Lat Am and Central and Eastern European
AIG branches that were acquired in 2017, net premiums written by this segment were
comparable year-over-year. The runoff operating segment reported a loss, operating loss
of $33 million in the first quarter of 2018. That was a decrease when compared to the
operating loss of $40 million in the same period last year. Losses on claims of $14 million in
the first quarter, principally reflected net adverse prior year reserve development related
to asbestos loss reserves at U.S. runoff.
Consolidated interest and dividends increased from $128 million in the first quarter of 2017
to $211 million in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting the reinvestment of cash and shortterm investments into short-dated U.S. Treasury bonds, the consolidation of Allied World's
interest and dividends, total return swap income, and overall higher interest income
earned.
Fairfax recorded an income tax provision of $53 million and an effective tax rate of 4.9% in
the first quarter of 2018. The low effective tax rate reflected the non-cash gain on the
Page 6 of 18

FINAL

deconsolidation of Quess, which did not attract tax in India and resulted in an income tax
rate benefit of $236 million.
Moving to our financial position. Our total debt to total capital ratio increased to 27.2% at
March 31 from 25.8% at December 31, 2017, and that increase primarily reflected a
temporary increase in our long-term debt prior to deploying those proceeds from the
most recent debt offerings to retire outstanding long-term debt. We ended the quarter of
2018 with an investment portfolio, which included holding company cash and investments
of $40.2 billion, which increased from $39.3 billion at December 31, 2017.
With that, Prem, I'll pass it back to you.

Thank you. And speakers, our first question comes from Tom MacKinnon from BMO
Capital. Your line is now open.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks, good morning.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Good morning, Tom.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

So I'm just wondering (00:22:18), with the decision to deploy some of the cash, what was
driving that and why short-dated U.S. treasuries?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah, so short-dated treasuries from 3-month T bills to 1.5-year T bills. You're picking up
quite a significant spread as the yield cobbles up, so as the yield cobbles up, moved up.
So that – we've put $5 billion, $6 billion. We've done that. Brian Bradstreet's done that.
And that basically has resulted in about $100 million plus minus of interest income, Tom,
without any capital risk. We think spreads are low. And so we are still keeping – or any
bonds we have will be like two, three years, high quality. And we're not taking term risk,
neither are we taking any significant credit risk. And we're just waiting for an opportunity
to get some more interest income, and at the same time, protecting our down side
because spreads are very low in the credit markets.

FINAL

You've mentioned that deployment of the cash, historically, you've said, it certainly gives
us an impression it might be gradual and that's one thing you're looking at with
convertibles and warrants as well. Any update on that thinking? And given that you're
probably 25% in equities, do you think you'd more into common stock?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah, so when you have a 24%, 25% in common stock and we are buying at – they're all
on long-term investment values, we think they're very attractive. And you never know
when these stock prices go up, so there's some of the things that – for example, in
Greece, we think in Greece, this is the year for Greece and investments in Greece,
particularly the Eurobank, could do well. Eurobank is selling at about €1, book value of
€2.64. Tomorrow, they'll come out with a stress test and see – the rumor is that the stress
tests are all fine (00:24:44). And then, suddenly, you have a company that is way below its
book value, selling at – we're a shareholder of Eurobank, so I'll take that with a pinch of
salt, that's a ridiculous price. So will that go up in the next three months or six months?
Who knows, but that thing can go up significantly just like it's come down significantly.
And if you look at each one of our names, now I highlighted that, Tom, in our AGM, I put
that all there. And I said, there's a whole bunch of names that we can't forecast, but we
expect to do well. Quess, which just came out, was – it's built a huge intrinsic value
because of Ajit Isaac and he's built a wonderful company focused on services, and we are
spinning it out because Thomas Cook decided to spin it out and we agreed because its
market value is bigger than Thomas Cook now. And Madhavan Menon did a wonderful job
running Thomas Cook and allowed Quess when we bought it in 2013 to develop. And
then now it's got such a high market value and such a terrific track record that it's decided,
their board has decided to spin it off. And all shareholders will own the company. We'll
own, as I said, 33%. So we've got a lot of things there that we think will develop positively
while we've got basically 50% in cash and treasury bills that we can earn more money. But
then we get an opportunity like I spoke about, Seaspan. We've put $250 million
convertible, a warrant exercisable at 6.5%. And then they had a terrific acquisition that
they wanted to make. They came to us. We extended another $250 million at 6.5%. And
the stock is about $8 a share, but we get 5.5% of interest income for the next seven years
and a warrant that lasts for seven years.
So we've done a lot of that and that I think I've showed that in our annual report, 35%,
37% of that company is what we'd own. People have to trust you a lot before they allow
you to have 37% of the company. Well, we've had about six, seven of them already. And
we are expecting, and Paul Rivett is very much involved in this. We're expecting that we'll
have a lot more, Tom. And we like the protection that we get when we get 5.5%, 6%, 7%
in a debenture or a preferred and the warrant in a company that we really like.
So because we built our company over 32 years and we've got this very good culture that
we demonstrated, I think, and you saw it at the AGM, it's a huge plus. And that's where
these opportunities are coming our way. And so we're very focused, as I said, looking at a
totally insurance business and our investments. We don't really have to do a lot. We're
focused on making that 15%, which translates to about – with a 95% combined translate to
Page 8 of 18

FINAL

about 7% on our investment portfolios. And I know you'd like it to be quantified as an
analyst, as a good analyst, Tom. You want it to be nicely quantified quarter-by-quarter.
Well, we've never worked that way.
Fairfax has been built by going on the basis of a lumpy return as opposed to a traditional
quarter by quarter by quarter, so that you can forecast it. We're not in that business. We're
in the business of building intrinsic value and with a 95% combined, our insurance
companies are doing very well, really well reserved, $40 billion of investment portfolio.
We don't have to buy anything. We make our 15%. We have a tremendous amount of
flexibility in terms of buying things that we want to. But our first objective, as I've said
many a time, is to buy back our stock, and we've bought about 0.5 million shares already.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

If I can squeeze one more in, your decision not to be on the call going forward, what's on
(00:29:17)?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Hey, just to – I'm focused on capital allocation and focused on investing. We got $40
billion, Tom. And so I think we just had our AGM, and this quarter is really, from my view
(00:29:35), we want to do it because of the quarter. But I think it's the right time. Paul is
very involved in all our business, to pass it on to Paul and I'm there. And if there's any
question that needs to be answered and all I'll be there. If anything significant is
happening, I'll be there. But Paul Rivett is very qualified to take it forward. And next time,
Paul, I'm going to be on holidays and Paul will be taking the conference call. So it's a nice
transition, Tom. I think it's timely.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Thanks very much.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

Very welcome, Tom. Next question, Ash.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Holden from CIBC. Your line is now open.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Hey, good morning, Paul.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Hey, good morning. So two-part question. The first part of the question is, when I think
about – when I look at the gains Fairfax has realized over the last year and also when I look
at the allocation of capital in terms of the equity positions you have, I start thinking more
and more about Fairfax as having significant exposure to emerging markets versus the
Page 9 of 18



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td

Date: 2018-05-04

U.S. economy directly. So my question is, do you agree with that characterization? And if
that's true, why have you kind of positioned the portfolio that way?

FINAL

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah, no, we're opportunistic, Paul, wherever the values are, so we're in Greece, for
example. That's not exactly emerging markets. We're in the United States where the
markets are high. Do we own Netflix or do we own any of the high FAA (00:31:24) bank
stocks? No. But there's a lot of stuff that is available if you look. And like Seaspan, I gave
you an example there and other names that we've talked about. But in the emerging
markets, we're really excited about India particularly. We think the opportunity is huge.

Bloomberg Transcript

We had IIFL, by the way. It's a big investment in Fairfax India. Their quarterly report just
came out yesterday. And anything you look at is growing at 35% to 40%. They got three
businesses. They're spinning it off and I won't bore you with the details, but just look at
that quarterly report, IIFL. And you'll get a sense for the opportunity of good companies,
run by founders, who are building businesses over the long-term. Because the economy is
growing so significantly and these businesses are coming in from a low base, the
opportunity is very significant.
So we are there, and Fairfax Africa, we are seeing a huge number of opportunities with
Paul Rivett from our side working with Quinn McLean from our side, and Mike Wilkerson
and his team in South Africa. Mike is in New York. We had a very nice meeting at – first
annual meeting, Paul, for Fairfax Africa and we're about close to 150 people and investors
really, people who are looking at Fairfax Africa as an investment or have invested already.
So we are looking – the big plus I think for us is just that people trust us and so these
opportunities that we get whether it's Africa or India or in the United States or Canada or
in Greece. They think that we will treat them well and they're right. We're going to treat
them well, but we expect to make a return.
But it's a long-term return. It's not quarter-by-quarter. So, when you look at your models
and you, as an analyst, good analyst, you're looking at your model and trying to quantify,
saying, they got 50% in cash, where are they going to get the returns? Very tough to
figure out for you, it's tough for us to figure out other than we've got a 32-year record of
outstanding investment results. Not good in the last five years. I showed that at our AGM,
but next five years are going to be different. So, Paul, follow-up with your next question, if
you've got one.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Yeah, so my next question is sort of related to modeling and your, maybe some of your
more unique exposures is, how do we think about the minority interest in Allied and Brit
and their participation in things like Quess and First Capital, et cetera?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah, so the Brit, I said at our AGM, we have the ability and – after three years, that three
years comes up in June and there's a couple of months that we work together, but Paul is
already working with OMERS, who's our partner, in terms of working out a deal where they

get a good return and we're able to buy back that 30%. In Eurolife, we have the same
opportunity. In their case, they've done so well that because they had these Greek bonds
and Greek bond prices went down significant – I mean, rates went down, prices went up.
And so they will have the ability to buy back that 40% that OMERS has. They're not able to
buy it in 2019, but we might be able to make a deal to buy it back. And so those two
companies might well be 100%-owned.
Allied, we have another two years to go I think before by – in June, we'll have another two
years before we can buy back Allied. And we have a wonderful relationship with OMERS.
We make sure they do well. And for us, it works out well over the long-term. So it's a good
relationship, Paul. And it's a win-win, win for them, win for us.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Dwelle from RBC Capital Markets. Your
line is now open.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

Yeah, good morning.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Good morning, Mark.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Tom took a couple of my questions. Thank you. So I only have really one other question. I
just wondered if you could talk just a second about the debt refinancing. You chose to use
some eurobonds as well as Canadian bonds, which is not surprising. Just kind of what the
game plan is there, what the timeline is (00:36:26) to get all the redemptions done? I
know there are some market aspects to that, but just kind of in general what you're
thinking about there.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

No, that's a good question, Mark. So we raised that, I think, a little more than over a $1.8
billion. This is the advantage of Fairfax, right. We have a very small company at the head
office, and it's not focused on the operation, the operation that decentralized. But at that
head office, we are focused on acquisitions. We are focused on capital allocation. But also
we are focused on financing. So led by Paul, Dave Bonham, and Peter Clarke group, we
raised that $1.8 billion with the idea that in the next four years, we have approximately that

coming up. And we are – we think interest rates will go up over time because the
economy in the United States is doing well, and so if interest rates goes up, it behooves
us to refinance. And so we had just refinanced 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. We still have
some 2021 left, but we just want a clear runway for the next four years. We'll reduce stock
costs at the moment about $50 million. We have a make-whole payment that we have to
make. When you're calling these bonds, you have to pay the bondholders depending on
where interest rates are, the spread is fixed (00:37:59). So we've got some more to go,
Mark, on that.
But basically, we want a clear runway for four years. We are extending term for 10 years,
so there's going to be no refinancing on that four years for 10 years. We reduced the
costs for all 10 years, particularly if interest rates go up, and gives us a huge amount of
financial flexibility. So that's basically – we did all of that, as I said, led by Paul, in about
three or four months. And for the first time, I took – I was very happy about – to note that
for the first time, we did a eurobond issue. And Dave, Fairfax is really not known in the
eurobond market. This is the first time, and we had demand, I think, for about €1 billion
plus and we did €600 million at 2.75% coupon that we had hedged, so before we went
and the hedge took our cost at the 3.1%.
And when I say hedge, what that means is just we're locking up at the underlying. In their
case, I guess it's the German bond rate. But In the United States, it's the U.S. Treasury
rate, and so that we are not – we are happy with the U.S. Treasury rates so we linked it up
(00:39:26). In the case of the U.S., our rate was 4.88%, I think, but it was 4.58% for our 10year bond because we hedged and the interest rates had gone up. So that's a huge
advantage for Fairfax because it's already got access to the eurobond market now and
we do – we can raise money in the United States, we can raise money in Canada. So, as
you go bigger, $15 million, $14 million, $12.5 million of capital, we need that ability. And our
company, I remind you, being built for 50, 100 years from now, long after I'm gone. So
we're just cognizant of that and recognizing that.

Q - Howard Flinker

FINAL

Hi, a few historically sound property and casualty underwriters have noted lately that rates
have begun to creep up. Could you discuss the rating environment please?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah, no, we had – Howard, as you know, we had huge catastrophe losses last year,
perhaps a record. The numbers are coming in, of course, and with the expectations of
$130 billion, $135 billion, so it's a record amount, but the prices didn't go up as much.
They've gone up. If they had losses like in the Caribbean, it certainly (00:41:09) went up
10%, 15%, maybe higher for some accounts. But broadly speaking, you didn't have a – you
might have thought, you might have speculated after that loss that there'd be hard
market. It's not a hard market, but the prices are not going down any longer. The prices
have flattened out. And in areas you're getting 5%, maybe higher increases, and so it's
not a bad market. But it's not a market like 2001 where you had a broad hardening market
where it's allowed you to have greater – we doubled our premium during that market that
will fill worldwide hard (00:41:53) market, haven't had that yet, but one of these days
something will happen that – because of returns in the insurance...

FINAL

Good morning, Luis (00:42:31).

Q - Operator
Good morning. I have basically a question on the share repurchase, just a clarification. You
have – you repurchased roughly year-to-date around 340 million shares. And of those,
you have 116 million that are for cancellation and the rest are for share compensation, I
believe. So the 223 million are essentially not going to be eliminated, they're going to
continue on the share count. So basically, my – I mean, is that right?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

No. (00:43:11) our incentive programs, more recent ones, Luis (00:43:16), however, like 15
years, right. So they're – I don't know if we mentioned that, but they're like longer-term
where everything we do are – Canadian share plans are like 5 and 10 years. You get half in
5, and half in 10. But these recent ones are like 15 years. So, for 15 years, they're not going
to be issued. They're eliminated. And at the end of 15 years, when our executives get
them, then they'll go into the shares outstanding. So that's how it works.
Dave, please confirm that.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - David James Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Yeah, that's absolutely right. So, if we purchase shares for the share plan, that reduces our
share count when we purchase the shares. And then as Prem says, they stay in treasury
for 5, 10, 15 years, and then when they're reissued, they increase the share count.

Q - Operator
Okay. All right. Good.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

And you can see that, Luis (00:44:17) in our shares outstanding. If you look in our interim
report, you'll see that. That's how it's shown. But that's what we're doing. But as I said
before, that we just think every time we get an opportunity where, over time and this is
more like in the next 10 years, for every time we get an opportunity, extra cash, we're
going to be buying our stock back.

Q - Operator
Right. Well, yeah. Okay. And that's a good clarification. And I just wanted to just pass on
the – I mean, so it's 340 million. It's roughly over 1.7%. Do you think that's – I mean we had
great prices to buy back in February, March, and I just wanted to feel is that like – could
you, guys, be more aggressive or do you think that that's a fine level for repurchase? Just
wanted to have your feel on that.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah, so you saw we are buying rightly. We bought stuff in the fourth quarter. We bought
in the first quarter. We bought in the – right till yesterday. And so we're continuing to buy it.
You can see the prices we paid. But we have to always look at Fairfax, and first, financial
soundness. We have to always look at it in that sense. We have to look at it, and as I said
at the AGM, Luis (00:45:49) that we are looking at buying our minority interest. And when
I say minority interest, I'm talking in Brit, talking in Eurolife, which I just explained to you,
and Allied. So we have to look at all of that, and then we have to use our cash accordingly
in terms of buying our stock. So that's what you should expect in the next 10 years. That's
what we're going to do.
But our first alternative always is, can we buy shares back? We've issued shares. I showed
that to you in the annual report and in our AGM. We had 5 million outstanding when we
began, we issued 22.8 million, and now we got 27.8 million. But that's what we issued to
build the company we have. Now we want to – we don't think we need to buy anything.
I'm not saying we won't, but not issuing shares to buy it and what we want to do is just go
the other way. And every time we have an opportunity in the next 10 years, we are going
to be buying back our stock. And we think that's the best thing we can do for our
shareholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Operator
All right. Sounds great. And one follow-up basically regarding Eurobank. As you
mentioned, previously, you have a lot of confidence in the bank and in the recovery of
Greece. And given that our cost is way significantly above the current price and like why
haven't you guys thought about increasing that position, given that we only own 17% and
could own significantly more, is there (00:47:34)?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah, yeah, we own quite a bit already, Luis (00:47:38) and cost is much higher, exactly
right. But our cost is below book value and book value continues to grow. Just one statistic
that you – I don't know if you attended our annual meeting, but Bank of Ireland, since loan
loss, since non-performing loans, they peaked in, I think, three or four years ago, they're
down almost 75%. These are loans that are non-performing, down 75% as the economy
started recovering. The economy in Ireland has recovered very well as you know. But in
Greece it's gone down. The better part of 30%, the GDP is down about 28%. It's
recovering now. Most people are thinking 12% (00:48:29) as you and I are talking on the
telephone, they'll be – because it's down 30%, there will be years where it might grow
6%, 7% growth because it's coming from such a low base.
And the non-performing loans are going to drop and that's huge for a bank like Eurobank.
And that's what happened in Ireland with the Bank of Ireland. And Richie Boucher, by the
way, is Head of the Risk Committee at Eurobank and is on the board of directors. And so
we see tremendous possibilities for Eurobank, but we've got a lot invested already. So
we're tempted, Luis (00:49:09), but we haven't bought a lot more.

Yes, we have another question coming from Mikel Abasolo from Solo Capital
Management. Your line is now open.

Q - Mikel Abasolo

{BIO 3756596 <GO>}

Yes, hello, thank you very much for taking my question again.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Good morning, Mikel.

Q - Mikel Abasolo

{BIO 3756596 <GO>}

Good morning, yes. Prem, my question is a very short one, very specific one. Warren
Buffet in his annual shareholders meeting put the probability of $400 billion catastrophe
as immaterial (00:50:41). I think he talked about perhaps a 2% probability. He explicitly
mentioned that most property and casualty insurance companies would go under. Have
you thought about such a terrible scenario and the probability, how Fairfax (00:51:04)?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yes, Mikel, we think about that. That is the biggest risk an insurance company has and we
think of that all the time. We think about it by company and in total Fairfax exposure, and it
comes right to me. I'm involved in it myself because that's as you point out and as Warren
has pointed out, that's a scenario that can impact the company. So we look at it all the
time, have been looking at it for 32 years and making sure that we can – any type of
impact like that, that we can survive. And so if that storm, I guess it was Irma that was
heading towards Miami, if it had hit Miami, which would have been a huge event, we'd
Page 16 of 18

FINAL

have survived that. And a lot of people would have got badly, badly hit. So we look at all of
those worst case scenarios. We've got limits. And most of our exposures, we've got
limits, Mikel, that allows us to know what our exposures are. We don't just believe – we
don't look at these models. We look at different ways in terms of – different ways of
looking at earthquakes and hurricanes and all of that.
And so there's no guarantees in life, but we'd like to think we'd be one of the last to
survive. So we have every intention of surviving those events, those worst case events.
And like Warren, we look at worst case events. Like, we look at 1,000-year events and,
like, way off the scale in – we think of ourselves as, in the head office, as risk officers. All of
us look at risk first, like, what can hit our company. And the cat exposure is one. You got
stock market fluctuation, interest rates going up. You've got reinsurance recoverables. So
we followed this for 32 years, and we have every intention of doing that for the next 50
to 100 years. But a good question, Mikel.
