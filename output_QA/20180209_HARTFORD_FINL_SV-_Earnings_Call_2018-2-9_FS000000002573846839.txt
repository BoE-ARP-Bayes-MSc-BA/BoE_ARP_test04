MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Sabra Rose Purtill, CFA
GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Also, please keep in mind that as a result of the agreement to sell Talcott Resolution, current and prior financial results
for this former segment have been accounted for as discontinued operations, which is in our corporate segment, as
required under U.S. GAAP
Our commentary today also includes non-GAAP financial measures
Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure are included in our SEC filings
as well as in the news release and financial supplement

Business Highlights
Accomplishments
• 2017 was an eventful year at The Hartford with several major accomplishments, including the acquisition of
Aetna’s U.S. group life and disability business and the agreement to sell Talcott Resolution
• However, bottom line results were negatively impacted by the loss on the sale of Talcott and the charge for U.S.
tax reform

Core Earnings
• Core earnings were up 11%, and core earnings per diluted share were up 19%, despite exceptionally heavy
catastrophe losses in 2017
• This is an outstanding result, reflecting the strength of the organization
• Commercial Lines margins were strong, personal auto profitability improved greatly, Group Benefits and Mutual
Fund results were excellent, and we had very good investment returns across the board
• Looking back over the year, I am truly pleased with our results and impressed with our team’s ability to deliver
on the numerous initiatives we have underway

Personal Lines
• In Personal Lines, I am very pleased with the strong improvement of our auto line where the underlying
combined ratio improved by 4.2 points
• Improving auto profitability has been a top priority for our management team
• And this is a significant milestone as we position the business to return to growth by leveraging the historical
strengths of our AARP relationship
• Overall, Personal Lines results were significantly affected by the major catastrophe events of 2017, with full year
cat losses more than double our average annual expectations

Commercial Lines
• In Commercial Lines, we began 2017 focused on maintaining our strong underlying margins, as we correctly
anticipated increasing competitive forces
• Margins did remain strong, although we expected pressure in workers’ compensation and general liability
• However, as Doug will discuss more fully in his comments, we have some optimism that pricing environment
may improve in 2018 and our disciplined approach to underwriting and pricing will serve us very well as the
market pivots

ICON Quoting Platform
• We also advanced a number of strategic initiatives in Commercial Lines that continue to strengthen our value
proposition and extend our competitive advantages
• For example, in Small Commercial, we continue to innovate with an ever-improving agent and customer
experience
• We have now integrated E&S product capabilities within our ICON quoting platform, becoming a one-stop
provider to more customers, including an integrated billing option
• We also started offering automatic quotes through ICON for group benefit products at point of sale,
enabled by our advanced data and analytic capabilities

Middle Market
• In Middle Market, our industry verticals are building momentum, led by outstanding teams of industry veterans
who have joined The Hartford in recent years, excited to combine their underwriting and product expertise with

our distribution and service excellence

Group Benefits
• In Group Benefits, we posted excellent financial results on both the top and bottom line
• Our value proposition on service and claims management for life and disability, coupled with our voluntary
product offerings, resonates very well with our customers, and we see the benefit of that in our retention
• Lastly, we welcome more than 1,800 new teammates from Aetna to our company, further strengthening our
market-leading capabilities

Mutual Funds
• In Mutual Funds, we continue to grow core earnings, supported by sales and positive net flows from strong
investment performance and expanded fund offerings
• And last but not least, in December, we signed a definitive agreement to sell Talcott Resolution for a total value
to shareholders of about $2.7B with an expected closing date by June 30

Investments
• Across the enterprise, we are making investments necessary to compete in a digital world defined by customer
experience
• We’re expanding our digital portals in Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Group Benefits to give agents and
customers greater access and flexibility in managing their coverage, billing and claims
• We are deploying robotics in operations, allowing us, for example, to process e-mailed requests for certificates
of insurance in minutes
• And we are especially committed to our data and analytics journey
• We continue to invest heavily in the talent, technology and data that we believe is increasingly defining our
business
• This work is generating new insights on risk, underwriting and claims management, which in turn elevates our
customer experience and improves our financial performance

Group Benefits Business
• The addition of the group benefits business from Aetna is additive to our efforts as we are now the number two
writer of both workers’ compensation and group disability insurance with unparalleled data sets across those
businesses
• This is exciting progress in our vision to become a broader and deeper risk player in the market, defined by a
unique focus on agent and customer needs
• All of these 2017 successes are a part of a much broader plan to ensure that The Hartford is a contemporary
company and prepared for a rapidly changing future, both financially and operationally

Tax Reform
• Turning to tax reform, there are many positives and a few watch areas

• Growth in investment should accelerate with the passage of tax reform, while cash is repatriated from overseas
• In the insurance sector, we are pleased that the playing field has been leveled to a certain degree

Tax Benefit
• On the other hand, there is uncertainty about how the lower tax rates play out over time, and the extent to which
the benefit will be competed away or be subject to regulatory rate reduction actions
• For 2018, a good portion of the tax benefit will fall to the bottom line as most of the year’s earned premiums
were written in 2017
• And many lines, including personal and commercial auto, property and liability, still need additional rate to
achieve our profitability goals
• We will continue to work hard to achieve them
• We also intend to use a portion of the additional cash flow we expect from tax reform to accelerate execution on
our existing technology initiatives

Core ROE
• We begin 2018 with confidence and momentum in all our businesses, focused on our financial and strategic goals
for each
• With the economy expanding, we see plenty of opportunities for profitable growth
• Based on the metrics we provided for 2018, we expect to generate higher earnings and a core ROE of between
11% and 12%, including the benefit of lower tax rates
• We expect the improvement to come from additional margin in Personal Lines, continued strong margins in
Commercial Lines, and earnings growth in both Group Benefits and Mutual Funds
• However, we do not expect much of an impact this year from the sale of Talcott, given the expected timing for
closing the transaction

Capital
• As we have shared with you before, the priority for our excess capital is to generate long-term sustainable
growth, either organically or with acquisitions that make financial and strategic sense
• We will also evaluate debt and equity capital management opportunities, being thoughtful and focused on
creating sustainable shareholder and stakeholder value

Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index
• Finally, it’s not just what we did in 2017, but how we did it
• Our philosophy is simple
• We believe that doing the right thing every day is core to our character
• Customers, agents, employees know we are a brand they can trust, that we treat people with respect, and we
honor our commitments to them

• I’m proud of the recognition we have received for this, including our third year of being in the Bloomberg
Gender-Equality Index, nine years of recognition by Ethisphere as one of the most ethical companies, and
numerous best place to work awards from various groups

Junior Fire Marshal Program
• We also believe that we have an obligation to make a difference in the communities where we work and live
• You can see this in our sustainability report we published on our website
• The Hartford supports many activities, including educating kids on fire prevention through our Junior Fire
Marshal program, which celebrated its 70th anniversary this year
• We’re also a founding sponsor of the U.S. Paralympic team, which will be competing in South Korea in
March

Conclusion
To conclude, 2017 was an outstanding year for The Hartford
While bottom line financial results and book value were affected by some of our strategic decisions, I am very pleased
with our underlying performance, the strength of our balance sheet, and the value we provided to customers during a
year of record catastrophes for the industry

Douglas G. Elliot
Q4 Highlights
Group Benefits and Personal Lines
• Looking back on our business objectives for 2017 and the results achieved, both operational and financial, this
was an excellent year for our Property & Casualty and Group Benefits businesses
• In Group Benefits, we capped off a year of outstanding earnings and solid top line growth with the Aetna
acquisition
• In Personal Lines, we delivered strong improvement in the underlying auto combine ratio
• And in Commercial Lines, we successfully achieved top line growth while balancing underlying profitability in
competitive markets

Claims Team
• Our financial results were impacted by historic industry catastrophe losses, but we’re pleased with how our
property book performed in these extreme events
• Our claims team and the entire enterprise responded to our customers with the care and diligence our brand
represents
• In the midst of these tragic events, we were at our best, backing our promises and helping our customers rebuild
their lives

Group Disability Loss Ratio
• I’d like to share a few thoughts on our 2017 financial performance for each of our business units, beginning with
Group Benefits, where core earnings for the year increased to $234mm, up $30mm from 2016 with a core
earnings margin of 5.8%
• The group disability loss ratio for the year improved by 4.9 points due to positive pricing as well as favorable
incidents and recovery trends
• The group life loss ratio was very solid, but up one point vs. prior year due to favorable changes in reserve
estimates in 2016

Aetna Acquisition
• Looking at the top line, 2017 fully insured ongoing premium increased 14%
• Excluding the two months of results from the Aetna acquisition, growth was 3%
• Overall, book persistency on our employer group block of business, including the business acquired from Aetna,
was approximately 90% for the year and fully insured ongoing sales of $449mm were flat with 2016

Organizational Structure
• Fourth quarter sales of $103mm were up $60mm over last year, largely due to one national account sale
• Integration of Aetna’s group benefits business in on track
• Our organizational structure is complete, and all aspects of the integration are moving forward with urgency
• I’ll share more details on this in a moment when I cover our 2018 outlook

Personal Lines
• In Personal Lines, core earnings for 2017 were $13mm, including catastrophe losses of $453mm before tax or
12.3 points vs. our 2017 outlook of 5.8 points
• The full year underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior year development was 93,
improving 2.4 points from last year due to improved auto performance
• The Personal Lines auto underlying combined ratio improved by 4.2 points to 99.7 for the full year, driven by the
combination of earned rate change, underwriting, and agency management actions
• These have clearly taken hold in our book of business and we are confident that our auto profitability
improvement plan is on track
• Keep in mind, when looking at our quarterly results, that fourth quarter has the highest underlying loss ratio of
the year

Commercial Lines
• In Commercial Lines, we delivered $825mm of core earnings for the year on a combined ratio of 97.3
• Catastrophe losses for the year were $383mm or 5.6 points vs. our outlook of 2.3
• The underlying combined ratio for Commercial Lines was 92 for the year, up 2.6 points compared to 2016

• Overall, this is consistent with our expectations at the outset of 2017 and very strong absolute performance when
compared to the industry and our peers
• Approximately half of the increase is due to margin compression in workers’ compensation and general liability
and the other half due to higher variable compensation and technology costs

Renewal Written Pricing
• Renewal written pricing in standard Commercial Lines was 3.2% for the full year, up a full point from 2016
• This is a positive sign and I’m encouraged by the recent price firming in property
• In Middle Market property, price change this quarter was up 1.5 points compared to third quarter
• Pricing across all other lines for the quarter was generally consistent with third quarter with continued strong
trends in auto
• Our workers’ compensation rates are down sequentially in Q4 by about half a point, driving our overall quarterly
pricing change down slightly
• Loss trends in workers’ compensation continue to be favorable relative to historical norms

Small Commercial
• Written premium of $7B for the year was up 3% from 2016, driven primarily by growth in Small Commercial
including the acquisition of Maxum
• Small Commercial had another outstanding year
• The underlying combined ratio was 87.8 and written premium grew by over 5%, driven by strong retentions and
$596mm of new business
• Our competitive advantage in this business has been achieved over many years through strategic innovation,
consistent investment, and rigorous execution and 2017 was no exception
• We began rolling out new capabilities in ICON that allow our agents to submit excess and surplus lines business
through a national wholesaler to Maxum and other underwriters as part of our Small Commercial package

Digital Service Platform
• Behind the scenes we continued to simplify our quoting process to make more quotes bindable with fewer
underwriting questions by using advanced data and analytics
• And we expanded the functionality of our digital service platform, allowing over 30% of all of our service
transactions during the year to be completed online
• The momentum of this business builds by the day

Middle Market
• In Middle Market, we posted an underlying combined ratio of 96.2 for the year, up 4.7 points from 2016
• This was slightly higher than our expectations due to non-cat property losses and margin compression in general
liability and workers’ compensation, including an increase to policyholder dividends on certain participating
workers’ compensation contracts where loss performance has been superior

• We also had higher variable compensation and technology costs

Retention and New Business Production
• Written premium increased 1% for the year based on solid retentions and new business production of
$484mm, up 5% vs. prior year
• During 2017, we introduced a new multinational capability allowing us to win more accounts with exposures
outside the U.S
• This has brought growth in domestic premium on accounts for which we might not have been able to
compete in prior years
• We also stood up an energy vertical, achieving solid new business premium, and a growing pipeline of
opportunities
• And our construction practice has matured into a strong business, delivering double-digit written premium
growth in 2017

Specialty Commercial
• In Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 97.8 for the year was 3.3 points higher than 2016
• Nearly three points of this increase was driven by higher expenses, similar to our other commercial business units
• Our bond business posted another strong year, delivering excellent underwriting results and strong growth, the
result of new and expanding projects among our policyholders as economic conditions improve
• And in financial products, we have successfully shifted to a middle market centric platform where pricing and
loss trends have been more table

Accomplishments
• Looking back on our financial results and accomplishments for 2017, we are very pleased with our execution
across our businesses
• Market conditions vary by business and line but have been competitive across the board
• We are more confident than ever in our ability to navigate such challenges

Cost Synergy Target
• Before I turn the call over to Beth, let me offer a few comments on our goals for 2018
• In Group Benefits, continuing the successful integration of the Aetna business is a top priority
• Now three months post-acquisition, we are even more enthusiastic about the team, the business, and the claims
technology we have acquired
• Integration milestones for 2018 are in place, including actions necessary to achieve our cost synergy target of
$100mm
• We are underway with plans to bring the newly acquired claims management application, Workability, into
our technology platform

• Once combined with our existing case management system and newly developed billing and digital engagement
tools, we will have a market-leading technology suite for our customers, both individuals and employers

Group Benefits
• Overall, we’re off to a great start in Group Benefits for 2018 with continuing strong core business results
• January 2018 renewal retention on both our existing Hartford business as well as the acquired block has been
strong, in line with prior year
• And January sales are favorable to last year
• We expect Group Benefits 2018 core earnings to be between $310mm and $330mm after-tax
• Our 2017 results included very strong partnership investment returns, which our planning assumptions do not
expect to repeat in 2018
• We also had better than expected prior year loss outcomes in 2017 that we expect to normalize in 2018
• Net income, which includes integration costs, is expected to be between $275mm and $295mm after-tax

Personal Lines
• In Personal Lines, building off our substantial progress in 2017, we will continue to increase our new business
marketing in AARP Direct, returning to new business growth in direct auto as momentum builds throughout the
year
• For 2018, we expect to achieve a Personal Lines combined ratio of 96 to 98, including 5.6 points of catastrophes
• This implies an auto combined ratio of 97.5 to 99.5, including 1.1 point of catastrophes, putting us in line with
our targets

Commercial Lines
• In Commercial Lines, industry-wide evidence of margin pressure began to emerge in 2017, triggering an
inflection point in the market
• And as a result, we are beginning to see improvement in property pricing
• I expect this trend to continue and include general liability pricing improvement during 2018 as well
• Specifically, for our book of business, we expect our auto rate gains to continue in the high single-digits

Property and General Liability
• In property and general liability, we expect to see pricing trends improve to mid single-digits over the next four
quarters
• However, given favorable profitability trends in workers’ compensation, rates in this line could range from flat to
slightly negative
• We remain committed to underwriting discipline, maintaining strong margins and seeking growth when it meets
our profit targets

• As is always the case, we have some very well performing lines of business as well as some pockets of business
that need price increases to reach target returns
• Our pricing actions will be driven by these profitability indicators and a key priority will be the improved
performance of our middle market property and liability book of business
• As a result, we expect an overall 2018 Commercial Lines combined ratio between 93 and 95.5, including 2.6
points of catastrophes
• This represents a slight improvement from 2017 after normalizing for catastrophe losses
• This is driven by our expectation of rate increases in areas of the business that are performing below targets and
continuing strength in our workers’ compensation results

Summary
In summary, 2017 was a very strong year of execution across our Property & Casualty and Group Benefit business with
core earnings of $1.1B
Despite the historical level of catastrophe losses, our businesses performed well and achieved progress on many
strategic priorities
• This work continues in 2018 and our momentum is building
Our core priorities remain unchanged; profitable product and underwriting expansion, deep partnerships with our
distributors and outstanding value to our customers

Beth Ann Bombara
Financial Highlights
Mutual Funds
• I’m going to briefly cover fourth quarter and full year results from the other segments and investment
performance before taking your questions
• Turning to Mutual Funds, fourth quarter core earnings were $37mm, up 76% after excluding a state tax benefit
recognized this quarter
• Full year 2017 core earnings were $110mm, up 41% over the prior year due to higher investment management
fees as market appreciation and over $3B in net inflows drove an 18% increase in total segment AUM to $115B
• Investment performance remained strong with 68% of Hartford funds beating their peers on a five-year basis,
which contributed to the robust sales

Net Loss
• Corporate, which has been restated to include Talcott as a discontinued operation for all periods presented, had a
net loss of $4.1B in Q4 due to the $3.1B loss on discontinued operations and an $867mm charge resulting from
U.S. corporate tax reform, reflecting a reduction in the value of net deferred tax assets

• The Corporate net loss for the year was $4.5B
• In the quarter, Corporate had core losses of $51mm, slightly better than prior year, primarily due to a state tax
benefit of $5mm
• For the full year, Corporate core losses totaled $229mm

Talcott
• Regarding Talcott, the sale and separation process is on schedule and we expect to close by June 30
• Since the transaction economics were locked in at signing, our results, for the most part, are not impacted by
Talcott earnings going forward

Investment Portfolio
• The investment portfolio continues to perform well
• For the quarter, net investment income, which now excludes Talcott, declined by about 4% to $394mm, primarily
due to lower income from limited partnerships compared to the prior year
• For the full year, net investment income was $1.6B, up 2% due to higher limited partnership returns, which were
12% before tax in 2017, well ahead of expectations

Portfolio Yield
• The portfolio yield for full year 2017, excluding LPs, was 3.7%, down 10BPS from 2016, due in part to lower
reinvestment rates and lower non-routine items such as make-whole payments on fixed maturities and
prepayment penalties on mortgage loans

Core Earnings
• To summarize, fourth quarter core earnings were $293mm, basically flat with fourth quarter 2016, and full year
2017 core earnings were up 11% to $1B
• For the quarter and the year, the major factors were a change to favorable prior year development, better
underlying personal auto results, and higher Group Benefits and Mutual Fund earnings, offset by significantly
higher catastrophe losses and some deterioration in underlying Commercial Line margins, driven in part by
higher expenses

Balance Sheet Items
Debt Ratio
• Turning to the balance sheet, our rating agency adjusted debt-to-capital ratio increased to 28.8%, up about 4
points sequentially as a result of the net loss in the quarter
• We maintain our long-term goal of reducing our rating agency debt ratio to the low- to mid-20s and expect that
leverage to improve over the next 12 to 18 months due to future net income and net reduction of nearly $1B as
we have previously stated

• Our overall reserve position remains strong
• I’d note that the annual asbestos and environmental ground-up review conducted during Q4 2017 did not impact
earnings, as the $285mm in net loss development was covered by the reinsurance agreement with National
Indemnity Company that we put in place at the end of 2016
• As a reminder, that agreement covers unfavorable development of up to $1.5B, so there is $1.215B remaining
under the cover

Core Earnings ROE
• Core earnings ROE for the last 12 months was 6.7%, up 1.5 points from a year ago
• This ratio is depressed somewhat because it is calculated using average equity
• If you normalize beginning equity for the loss on discontinued operations, pension transfer and tax charges, it
would be closer to 8%
• We expect our ROE to improve in 2018 due to earnings growth, including the impact of lower federal income
taxes
• Based on the metrics we provided for 2018, we would expect our core earnings ROE to be in the 11% to 12%
range

Cash Flow
• In addition, over time, we will deploy the cash flows generated from the Talcott sale and from the monetization
of our tax net operating losses and AMT credit into higher return opportunities
• Regarding capital management, during 2017, we repurchased about $1B of our common shares and increased the
quarterly dividend by 9%, marking the fifth consecutive year we raised our quarterly dividend

U.S Corporate Tax Rate
• Before taking your questions, I’d like to briefly summarize the impact of a lower U.S. corporate tax rate in 2018
• Our only major preference item going forward is municipal bond income as the dividend received deduction was
in Talcott
• So, aside from the 5.25% tax rate on muni-bond income, almost everything else will be taxed at 21%
• Our effective tax rate will be the direct result of muni-bond income as a percentage of pre-tax income
• In other words, if muni-bond income is about 23% of our total pre-tax earnings, which is approximately where
we would expect it to be in 2018, then the effective tax rate would be about 17%

Sale of Talcott
• I’d also note that the reduction in the corporate tax rate reduces the carrying value of the tax benefits we retained
in the sale of Talcott
• The tax assets we’ve retained are now carried at approximately $700mm, down from the $950mm we discussed
in December

• However, the net present value of the retained tax benefit has increased as the reduction in value of the NOLs
is more than offset by the accelerated monetization of the AMT credits we retained

Tax Reform
• I’d also like to point out there is one aspect of the accounting for tax reform which could result in a subsequent
change to the 2017 loss on the sale of Talcott
• We’ve provided a summary of this in the appendix to the slide deck
• This change would be the result of accounting guidance that the FASB may issue later this month
• That guidance is expected to either require or permit us to retrospectively reclassify certain equity amounts from
retained earnings to AOCI as of December 31, 2017, or mail out prospective adoption of that change in 2018 or
2019
• The amounts that would be reclassified represents a stranded tax rate differential that has already been reflected
in earnings
• The knock-on impact of this would be an approximate $193mm reduction in the loss on sale reported for 2017,
but there would be no impact on the underlying economics of the transaction

Conclusion
To conclude, full year 2017 core earnings demonstrated good improvement from 2016, despite high levels of
catastrophes in each quarter of the year
As we begin 2018, our priorities include continued profitable growth, integration of the Aetna business, closing the sale
of Talcott, reducing debt leverage, and ultimately, redeploying the proceeds of the Talcott sale into higher-return
opportunities
We will continue to focus on maintaining strong margins and underwriting discipline, while growing where it makes
sense in a market showing early signs of improving pricing dynamics

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
<Q - Brian Meredith>: Chris and Doug, I was wondering if you could comment on your thoughts of the impact of tax
reform on pricing potentially going forward with respect to Personal Lines, but also workers’ compensation insurance.
<A - Christopher J. Swift>: Sure, Brian. I’m happy to provide some color, and Doug, I’m sure, will provide his views
also, which are similar. I think the dialogue and debate here on tax rate is, you got to put into context, is just one
component of pricing. I mean, there’s the other components, loss trends, underwriting, classifications, acquisition costs,
operating costs. I mean, so you need to manage all of them together. I would also say it depends on the starting point,
from a pricing indication side of what may or may not change at the price level to a customer. As we said in our
comments, we’re going to try and expect to hold on to a significant portion of the tax benefits in the near-term, but we
are going to put in our models for pricing purposes that are filed ultimately with regulators, the new effective tax rate.
I think, ultimately, this will come down to them, as far as, ultimately, a game theory of just what happens at the market
level, what do competitive forces in the market do. But I would also state that not all lines of business are price
adequate. And as I said in my prepared comments, we’re going to try to improve those lines where we need price
action. I think the other thing too, I alluded to, and I’ll give you the dollar amount, but we are going to accelerate some
IT investments, digital investments, and product development and data and analytic investments over the next two
years. I would say that incrementally is about $50mm pre-tax that’s in our plan, it’s in the guidance that we provided
you. So that’s how we’re thinking about tax reform from more of a macro level.

But, Doug, what’s your point of view?
<A - Douglas G. Elliot>: I guess I would just add, Chris, that I continue to think about our line profitability and our
segment profitability. So feel very good about our auto progress, but still more work to be done. We posted a 99.7 point
of progress this year, but that doesn’t leave a lot of underwriting profit and we still have more work to do on that line.
So we will see how this plays out. A lot of our pricing actions are already determined for 2018 and we’re determined to
improve our profitability, particularly in Middle Market and Personal Lines auto. So we’ll continue to talk about this
and share as we go forward. I think it’s still early.
<Q - Brian Meredith>: Got you. And then one for Beth. Beth, just thinking about taxes and tax reform and elimination
of the AMT, what is the kind of cash benefit that you expect kind of on an annual basis from just the reduction in cash
taxes paid?
<A - Beth Ann Bombara>: I’m sorry, how much is the benefit? Or where is it going?
<Q - Brian Meredith>: Yeah, what is it benefiting? You gave us the present value number, but I’m just kind of
thinking, are you going to pay any cash taxes in 2018 now? What is it going to look like from a cash flow perspective
for you guys?
<A - Beth Ann Bombara>: Right. So, looking at 2018, we’d expect to pay little to no tax in 2018. As it relates to the
AMT credits that we’ll be able to monetize over time, that will really start when we file our 2018 tax return in 2019. So
we’ll start to see those cash flows coming through as well. So, when we look at both our NOLs and AMT credits, and
based on our current projections for taxable income, we’d expect to monetize those over the next three to four years.
<Q - Kai Pan>: My first question is on personal auto. If you look at your rate increases still in the double-digits, I
assume your loss cost trend probably mid single-digit, so there should be 5-point improvements in the core underlying
margin going forward. So I just wonder why the guidance is only sort of showing under 50BPS to the midpoint? Are
there more to come?
<A - Douglas G. Elliot>: Yeah, Kai, this is Doug. I would start by suggesting that over the next couple of quarters,
you’ll see the written pricing come down a little bit, so our earn trends, now that we’re achieving improved
profitability, are going to be slightly less than we’ve had in the past. The other thing is we had very good trends across
our frequency and severity in 2017. Hard to suggest they’re going to repeat next year. So we try to be thoughtful and
conservative in our selections going forward. I think those two combinations still imply that we will see improvement
in the auto line underlying, going forward. We’d love to see the same rate of change in 2018 that we saw in 2017, but
we’ll have to see how that plays out.
<Q - Kai Pan>: Okay. Then my second question on Commercial Line, could you talk a little bit more about the loss
cost trend in workers’ compensation and general liability? And what gave you confidence to achieve the improvements,
given that the 2017 results fell short of the regional guidance?
<A - Douglas G. Elliot>: Sure. Our overall workers’ comp performance has been very strong. And that goes back a
number of years. And although we tweaked it a bit in 2017, I still look at the overall performance and feel very good
about it, particularly in our Small Commercial world. So that’s just as a starter. As we move forward, I think our
sophistication in underwriting and the work we’re doing in claim to work and combat, if you will, trends that we expect
to see in medical and in wage give me confidence that we will be able to continue to produce very solid returns, right.
And every time I think about my answer on a workers’ comp question, I do ask you to think about small vs. national
accounts vs. middle market. They compete very differently. Their results vary. But in general, we look across our
segments. We feel good about the line. Our trends have been very solid. Frequency has been in very good shape for a
number of years. We’re watching severity around medical. It’s still better than historical norms, but we are watching
the hospitalization end of those costs. As we go forward, we’ll kind of compete month-by-month and
quarter-by-quarter and make sure we’re reflecting that in the pricing accordingly.
<Q - Kai Pan>: Thank you very much.

<A - Douglas G. Elliot>: Kai, let me add one other – as I was answering that question, I was thinking also about your
Personal Lines question. I think we’ve shared in the past that we are going to ramp up our marketing spend in Personal
Lines. So, when you think about the overall combined ratio, expect to see a little bit more cost in the personal lines
expense component of combined. That’s also adding to a part of the answer that I shared with you.
<Q - Elyse B. Greenspan>: I guess this is following up on some of the earlier questions. As we think about the
underlying margin guidance, and this is both a Personal and Commercial Lines question. It seems like your
commentary points to some improvement on the loss ratio and potentially higher expense ratios given investments in
both of the businesses. Is that how you see it when you think about 2018 with the spread between the loss and the
expense ratios?
<A - Christopher J. Swift>: Elyse, it’s Chris. I would say from a higher level, yeah, generally, the case. I mean, we
think we could obviously get some rate in the book. We’re going to try to manage frequencies and severities to a good
outcome, but we are going to continue to invest in the organization, both IT, digital product. I would say that our
expenses this year are probably a little elevated, primarily compensation related from our goals and performance side.
So I would say that there is going to be a reversion to the mean going forward on compensation costs. But as far as
investments in those areas that I described, that will continue at a healthy pace.
<A - Douglas G. Elliot>: Elyse, I would add, as well, that we’re working mix of lines of business as well underneath
the broad scenario. So, as an example, I did talk about surety. Surety has been a growing with a solid performance in
2017. Our top line in surety was up 10%. It’s one of our outstanding return areas. We’re going to do more in surety.
And so we’re also mixing the book underneath. Auto is showing signs of improvement in Commercial Lines as well as
Personal Lines, so that’s an improvement story. So we’re battling hard to, number one, maintain the strong margins
we’ve achieved, but to see if we can do a little bit better in 2018.
<Q - Elyse B. Greenspan>: Okay, great. And then another question, in terms of auto, in your guide for this year, you
get to about that 96.5, which has been your target for that business. And you did point to still taking rate in the high
single-digits, so maybe this is more when we think out beyond 2018, but do you think you can run that business better
than a 96.5? Because meaning, if you keep taking high single-digit rates, essentially you could get the margin lower, or
then where we just see greater expenses as well in that business?
<A - Christopher J. Swift>: Yeah, Elyse, it’s Chris. I would say, again, as I pivoted and Doug has been talking about,
too, I mean, we’re trying to return to growth, right. I mean we’ve had to take some aggressive actions with the book
and shrinking it. So I would say that the growth aspect of it will contribute to obviously an expanding combined ratio
while we continue to manage a loss cost in trends. And I would say, again, it’s going to be a dynamic marketplace out
there, too. I mean, there is a lot of strong competition in this area. We’re focused in on the more of the mature market
segment with a value proposition that is somewhat different. So we remain confident that we can grow and return to the
higher levels of premium volumes, which should also generate some relief on the expense ratio. But make no mistake, I
mean, it’s still going to be very, very competitive.
<A - Douglas G. Elliot>: Elyse, I certainly echo all of Chris’ focused comments on growth. The other thing I would
just point out, I think I mentioned returning to mid single-digits as opposed to higher single-digits. So I expect pricing
over the next several quarters to be more in that 5 range than the higher single-digits.
<Q - Jay Gelb>: Beth, can you talk about the potential for share buybacks to restart, the timing on that? And what we
should think about in terms of magnitude of buybacks in 2018?
<A - Beth Ann Bombara>: Yeah. So, Jay, I’ll go back to the comments that we made in Q4 when we stopped our
share buyback due to the Aetna acquisition. We’ll be back to you when we have a new capital management plan, but
right now, we’re focused on closing Talcott, and then, we’ll evaluate what the best use of that capital is and the timing,
but not prepared to talk today about expectations for 2018.
<Q - Jay Gelb>: Okay. And then my follow-up, and this is – I remember sort of asking this question on the Talcott
call. I believe now that the expectation is for 11% to 12% return on equity in 2018, I believe back when Talcott was
announced, the expectation was for that to improve in 2019 as the full benefit of the Aetna transaction comes into play.

Is that still the case for 2019?
<A - Christopher J. Swift>: Jay, it’s Chris. I think I probably led that charge on the improvement. And I would say,
generally, directionally, we still see it, but I mean there’s going to be some competing forces, right. So we always try to
stay focused on hand of what we need to do in 2018 that sets up a good 2019. So know our focus is on executing,
particularly as it relates to standing up Talcott as a separate company, integrating Aetna, and making sure we’re getting
all the expense saves out of there, which obviously from an earnings side will contribute in 2019. But on the other
hand, we are – with that 11% to 12% guide, that does reflect a significant tax benefit in 2018 that we’ll have to see how
that plays out in 2019 and 2020 and beyond. So that would be the only caveat that I would share with you that there
could be some competing forces that impact that trend going forward.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: My first question, it looks like there are some competitors in the auto market who will be
stepping up to make customer growth a priority for 2018. Can you talk a little about the sales proposition at the AARP
business and how you retain those customers and how those customers might be less risky to be picked off by a more
aggressive competitor in the market?
<A - Douglas G. Elliot>: Let me try to tackle, Josh, that in a few pieces. Number one, we’re certainly ramping up
marketing, as I mentioned, so that we get more client contact. We get more inbound activity. And based on our
marketing evidence in the last 90 days, that’s happening. So we’re feeling more flow. Second part is our ability to
close, offer competitive prices and then close. And so we’re focused on our skills on the phone, we’re focused on
fine-tuning of our auto class plan. Again, this is a state-by-state mix dynamic. So there are a lot of dynamics that we are
working on, all trying to improve our close ratio on those inbound calls. And again, we’re going to continue to move
our marketing spend up as we move throughout 2018. So I expect this to be a growing, positive story, but we’ll have to
work our way through the first 90 days and then we’ll share progress as we move throughout the year.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: All right. I’ll take one more stab at the $25,000 question that Jay asked. Your preference is
obviously to do transactions, I think, over doing buybacks if the right transaction came along. But what is your appetite
for letting a war chest build or the priority about returning capital as it builds to shareholders? Is there a philosophy
internally about what to do with the money as they come in?
<A - Christopher J. Swift>: Yeah, I appreciate the question, Josh. What I would say, again, in the follow-up to Jay’s
question, I mean, we’ve got lot of levers still to continue to expand ROE. So as much as we talked about some
competing forces that might be happening, I mean, there are levers that we have to be able to help manage to expand
ROEs beyond that 11% to 12% that we guided to in 2018. And clearly, capital management is one of them. So I think
you’ve seen our history. We’re balanced. We’re thoughtful. We’re, if anything, consistent. So I would expect that
philosophy to continue. I don’t think there’s a calculus I could share with you right now, but as excess capital builds,
we know we have to deploy it effectively or return it to shareholders in a timely basis, and that’s what I would say right
now.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Doug, I wonder if you could give us a sense as to the auto claim frequency trends that you’ve
embedded in current pricing?
<A - Douglas G. Elliot>: Well, certainly, 2017, we’ve talked about them, right. So we feel very good. Our frequency
has essentially been flat. We’ve had low severities, low single-digit severities. We are looking forward at similar
frequency trends for 2018, and I would say small single-digit severity trends in the 2 to 4 range. So not a lot different in
2018 than what we think we’re experiencing today, what we are experiencing today. That’s as much as I want to give
on the guidance front.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Okay. No, that’s good. It’s helpful. Second question, as we anticipate stronger U.S. economic
growth, does that have any implications on its own for margins in workers’ compensation and in Maxum?
<A - Douglas G. Elliot>: Where we have felt that strong economy certainly is in our bond business with construction
startups. We’ve had a number of nice opportunities in our construction unit. New projects, shovels in the ground, etc.
And obviously we continue to feel it in Small Commercial. So the startups, the new economy, the small employee
groups, under five where we have a terrific product and we have a lot of focus in that micro-segment of Small. So those

areas are clearly signs that we’re bullish about. I think we’ll see more of that as we move through 2018. Overall, a solid
economy is a good indicator of workers’ comp and disability. So we understand that our trends relative to employment
are good signals for key lines for us. And we have our fingers crossed that we’ll see a very solid economy moving
forward that we’ll be able to grow from moving into 2018.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: We’ve had sort of a turbulent financial market in Q1. I wonder if you could just talk about
your overall investment strategy going into the market and whether you’re in a de-risking, re-risking, looking at this as
an opportunity to buy, how you reposition the portfolio through this.
<A - Christopher J. Swift>: Yeah, Bob, let me start and then Brion Johnson, our CIO is with us here, ask him to give
you some additional color. But generally, I think we feel very good, and we’ve got a high quality portfolio, well
diversified. We’ve traded out of certain sectors a while ago that we did not think held its potential for returns. So the
largest concentration we have is still in munis and corporate investment grade bonds. So, generally, we feel very good.
I mean, and if you look closely at the tape, credit spreads are holding in fairly well. We’ll see how trading goes today.
So, to the extent that the equity markets have been rolled over, corrected a little bit, we’re not seeing the same pressure
to-date in the credit environment. But Brion, what would you add?
<A - Brion Scott Johnson>: So thanks for your question, Bob. I would say that Chris articulated well. We take a sort
of a through the cycle approach to the investment portfolio. We’re very comfortable with the status of the portfolio. It is
a high quality portfolio. And over time, we have been lowering the risk profile of the portfolio. Just as the cycle got
longer and the compensation for risk got lower. So, since we’ve been doing that, we’re pretty reasonably well
positioned for the environment that we’re in. We’re nibbling around the edges where we see opportunities. But we’re
not inclined to change the overall risk profile of the portfolio in response to recent developments.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Thank you very much. Just a quick follow-up. First quarter weather in the northeast
sometimes nails you cold in frozen roofs, have you had any issues yet that you’d speck out, Doug or...
<A - Brion Scott Johnson>: You know, Bob, again, I’m looking at Doug too. There’s nothing that hits our radar
screen. I mean, you’re always going to have some frozen pipes. I was in Minneapolis earlier this week and it was cold,
but it’s the winter. But nothing’s hit our desk as anything outsized right now, Doug, would you say?
<A - Douglas G. Elliot>: I agree with that.
<Q - Jimmy Bhullar>: First, I had a question on Personal Lines. As you think about the price hikes that you’ve been
implementing, obviously, those have helped your margins recover. Have you been able to raise prices through all the
states, or are there states that are still pending that haven’t fully flown through yet?
<A - Douglas G. Elliot>: Jimmy, there are still states that we are working on. So we’ve achieved rate adequacy in a
number of states, the large majority of states, certainly the majority. But there’s still a couple of key states that are
working. California is one of those states that made a lot of progress, but we have a little bit more work to do as we
move into 2018.
<Q - Jimmy Bhullar>: And I’m assuming that’s a material part of your business.
<A - Douglas G. Elliot>: It is. It’s a significant part of our Personal Lines business.
<Q - Jimmy Bhullar>: And then, what’s your expectation for lapses on the Aetna group business as you onboard it,
and are there any concerns that they sold a lot of business on a bundled or cross-sold basis in major medical? And even
though you’re going to be doing it, it’s two separate companies, so what’s your expectation for lapses as you onboard
the book?
<A - Christopher J. Swift>: Jimmy, it’s Chris. Doug made the commentary on it, all the data that we see, we knew
going into it. We’re not surprised. We are, obviously, trying to renew as much of that business as possible. We
understood their pricing approach and philosophy. We’re harmonizing it with ours. We’ll be thoughtful. I would still
say that, again, the guidance we provided, I mean, there is a tolerance for shock lapses in 2018 that we’re going to try
to manage to avoid. But I think we have a reasonable to conservative plan on premiums from a lapse side. And Doug, I

know we’ve got weekly integration meetings and we’re trying to manage to outperform that, Jimmy, but I don’t think
there’s any surprises and we’ve got similar experience with profit improvement on certain accounts on our book over
the years, and we’ll execute very thoughtfully.
<A - Douglas G. Elliot>: And Jimmy, you know how far in advance this book works, right. So we didn’t expect to see
much shock lapse in 2018 because much of that had been renewed over the course of the spring and summer months,
certainly the national account book. We are right in the throes of working hard on the 2019 book. Chris and I are
heavily involved in the key account decisions. So, literally, it’s not like we have information we’re not sharing. We are
working over the next 90 to 120 days on key 2019 renewals and I think we’ve built in some shock. But based on what
we’ve seen so far, we feel very good about the way the integration is going, the sales force coming together, the tools
and technology roadmap. So I’m optimistic about how this is coming together, and I think our plans are well thought
out.
<Q - Jimmy Bhullar>: Okay. And then just lastly for Beth, can you quantify stranded overhead from Talcott that
might need to be allocated to the other businesses? And how was that accounted for this quarter?
<A - Beth Ann Bombara>: Yeah, so we estimate that when we look at the costs that aren’t transferring with the
transaction, it’s probably $35mm to $40mm annually. And we expect to eliminate those stranded costs over the next 18
to 24 months. So I don’t see that as being a significant drag for our businesses. You’ll see some of those costs in the
corporate line until we close. But again, when you think about the size of our expense base, it’s a pretty small amount.
<Q - Jimmy Bhullar>: And that’s stranded as well as allocated? Because there’s some probably corporate overhead
that’s allocated to Talcott that will have to be allocated to the rest of the businesses.
<A - Beth Ann Bombara>: Yeah, that’s right. That’s how I’m defining stranded. I’m looking at all the costs that we
previously allocated to Talcott, looking at those things that I know are transferring, those things that we know will just
get eliminated right away, and then this is really the overhead piece that we have to address.
<Q - Jimmy Bhullar>: And this quarter that number was still in discontinued operations or was that allocated out of
that already?
<A - Beth Ann Bombara>: It’s already – it’s in the corporate line. It’s kind of hard to see for the quarter, but yes, it’s
in the corporate line.
