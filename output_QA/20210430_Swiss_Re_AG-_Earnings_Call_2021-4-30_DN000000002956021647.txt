Presentation
Operator
Good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to Swiss Re's First Quarter 2021 Conference
Call. Please note that today's conference call is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to John Dacey, Group CFO. Please
go ahead.

John R. Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Thank you. And good morning or good afternoon to everyone on the line. I'm here today
with Thierry Leger, our Chief Underwriting Officer; and Thomas Bohun, our Head of
Investor Relations.
As usual, I'll start with a brief overview of the key figures we published this morning. Swiss
Re had a strong start to 2021, with a first-quarter net income of $333 million. This resilient
result has to be seen in the context of the quarter that sadly witnessed the highest
pandemic deaths to date in our two largest life and health markets, the United States and
the UK.

Excluding COVID-related losses, the Group achieved a net income of $843 million. P&C
Reinsurance reported a net income of $477 million, benefiting from significantly -benefiting significantly from underwriting discipline and a continued price improvement in
the book. The business segment was affected by large natural catastrophes of $316
million primarily due to the US winter storms in February. We believe that the recent
portfolio actions taken on secondary perils, in particular, helped us to reduce these
impacts. The reported combined ratio was 96.5% and we are well on track to achieve our
normalized combined ratio estimate of less than 95% for the year.
Life and Health reinsurance endured significant COVID losses of $570 million driven by
peak COVID deaths in the United States and the UK, as well as some other countries.
Excluding COVID-19, the underlying business performed very strongly with an ROE of
16.8%. Corporate Solutions reported a net income of $96 million, a result of successful
turnaround, which has been achieved. The reported combined ratio was 96% and we are
on track here to meet our estimate of below 97% for the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Within Group items (inaudible) continued its strong track record of growth with gross
premiums written in the core business, up 150% versus the same period last year. The
Group reported a strong return on investments of 3.5% for the first 3 months of 2021,
driven largely by recurring income and supplemented by gains on equities in the course of
the valuation of those for the first quarter.
As for the April reinsurance renewals, we're pleased with the outcomes achieved. We saw
overall volume growth supported by transactions of 20%, while nominal prices increased
by 4%, more than offsetting the slightly lower interest rates and the higher loss
assumptions in some of the sub-portfolios. Our year-to-date premiums renewed are now
down 3% versus last year and we continue to seek out attractive opportunities which
meet our profitability requirements.
Overall, we're pleased with the performance of our businesses this quarter, in particular,
the strong profitability in P&C. We're also encouraged by the rapidly diminishing impact
from COVID-19 on both our P&C and most recently in the current quarter on our Life and
Health business with respect to the largest markets.
With that, I hand it over to Thomas, who will take us through the Q&A.

The first question comes from the line of Andrew Ritchie with Autonomous. Please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi there. First question, John, you benefited a lot from the underwriting actions in the
quarter. I'm guessing that would be particularly your reduction of aggregate reinsurance
exposure. I don't know, one, could you give us a little counterfactual, what could you think
your cat losses would have been as you not taken action or if you can't give us that, just
remind us what remaining work there is to do on reducing that exposure? I guess I'm just
trying to understand some of those contracts have seen deductibles used up in the
quarter because of tax losses, and therefore, could be more on risk as we go into wind
season and I'm not sure where your remaining exposure is there in that? And how
comfortable you are? How much more work you still have to do on that?
The second question is this now, you sounding the all clear on P&C COVID losses as in we
should forget the guidance of up to $500 million, which you gave for the full year? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John R. Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

So Andrew, I'll take -- maybe frame the question a little bit, if I can. And then probably, turn
it over to Thierry, our Chief Underwriting Officer, who can help with a little more details.
With respect to the underwriting, especially January 1, where we said we reduced the
aggregates, we also were looking to reduce our exposure more broadly to what we've
referred to the secondary perils by among other things, increasing the attachment point
for our covers in excess of loss, and so this combination, I think has helped us. That's the
first.
And the second thing is our overall view for the industry loss in the winter storms in the
US, Texas, in particular, on Re are $13 billion, which might be a little smaller than some of
the other players. Equally in New South Wales, our view of the industry loss there probably
is more contained than what you might see otherwise. And so what we've booked for
those storms ended up being a fairly minor amount compared to what the picture is
coming out of Australia in the days where the flooding occurred might have indicated.
But Thierry, maybe you can help with some color.

A - Thierry Leger

{BIO 16674977 <GO>}

Just to build on what you just said, John. So absolutely factual. I would just not be so
specific with regard to aggregate excels. They were part of the reduction that we've
been targeting. But the real target were secondary perils, as John pointed out, and
anything too close to the frequency. So we also targeted very low layers, for example,
and proportional business what we call top-down layers and so on. So it was a broader
target that we had.

You also asked, what's remaining, right? And obviously, there is always something to do in
a portfolio to make it better. But given that we didn't just start on one-one this year, but
we did some strong work already last year. My expectation is that the big work is done by
this point in time.

FINAL

A - John R. Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

And maybe, Andrew, on your second question, with respect to the P&C COVID losses.
Yes, the first quarter P&C losses were probably below where we might have expected
them. I don't think that means we're all clear for the rest of the year. We think there may
be some event cancellation charges, which still coming through. There may be some -- in
certain geographies, some credit and surety losses otherwise popping up. What we feel
comfortable about is that at least with everything we know, we've -- we believe our BI
portfolio on property is well reserved. We maintain IBNRs for both property and for
casualty in the P&C Re business above 80%.
So we'll continue to work with our primary clients to sort out what the actual losses really
are there and book them accordingly. But I wouldn't say that there is nothing coming on
P&C Re. I think we're probably a little more optimistic today than we might have been
three months ago.

A - Thomas Bohun

{BIO 22165501 <GO>}

Thank you, Andrew. Could we have the next question please.

The next question comes from the line of Kamran Hossain with RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. So I mean, just following on from Andrew's question about I guess COVID and that will
clear on the P&C side, let me ask it in a slightly different way. Is it reasonable to assume
that more than half the losses would have happened in kind of Q1 or large proportion of
the $500 million you had kind of sites of P&C would have happened in Q1, and therefore,
it's unlikely that you do hit $0.5 billion for the year? So that's the first question.
And the second question is just on I guess the Life Reinsurance business. Clearly, the
picture in the US and the UK was dire in Q1 but seems to be getting a lot better. Once
those issues really go away, once deaths slow down, I guess they have, do we stop
worrying about COVID as an issue for the Life business? Or is there something that could
surprise us elsewhere? Any thoughts on that would be really helpful? Thank you.

A - John R. Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Thanks. So maybe I'll take a shot here, and again, Thierry can come in. With respect to the
P&C, yes, I think there is some reasonable expectation of attrition during the course of
2021. The numbers we gave, which was less than $500 million across the lines of business
was for the full year. We suggested that most of the exposure was probably in the first

Page 4 of 14

FINAL

half on event cancellation, in particular. It doesn't exclude the possibility of something
popping up.
But again I think, we're feeling better about the exposures and the likelihood of the losses
now than we were at the beginning of the first quarter. I know you're looking for more
precision. I think we could probably provide something at the mid-year results, where full
half of the year is clear and we might have a better line of sight, frankly, on some of the
other reserving positions on property, in particular.
With respect to Life and Health, you're exactly right. The curve has been bending down
hard in the UK, first, and more recently in the US on actual deaths. There if you look
month-by-month, December was the worst month for average daily deaths related to
COVID in the United States for all of 2020. January was worse than that. February was still
very, very bad and March started to see some improvements. And here in April, we're
now down to less than 1,000 daily deaths in the United States and trending lower. The
vaccination efforts clearly are being rolled out and being effective in reducing deaths and
the overloads that you saw in those Q1 months with respect to hospitals and health
systems, more broadly.
So I think this will come down. It's not going to go to zero. There will be a continuation of
COVID-related deaths in the United States for some period of time, as the vaccines reach
some equilibrium level of the people that one who got it, but some people just are not
going to. So I don't expect it to be zero. But I think you should expect sometime towards
the end of this year that we'll stop talking about it as a separate event assuming we
continue the current path and that there are no new variants which are overwhelming the
current vaccination efforts.
Thierry, I don't know if there's anything?

A - Thierry Leger

{BIO 16674977 <GO>}

No, nothing to add. I think you said it very precisely with regard to the Life and Health
COVID that defend the world's rather worse. And we were expecting March was rather
better. And right now, UK and the US because of the vaccination efforts are actually rather
positives for us. But -- and those are two countries we have major exposures, obviously,
but it's far too soon to make predictions at this point in time

Hey, afternoon, everyone. Can we get a bit more color perhaps on how the net written
premiums have developed at this stage? You mentioned at the full year, you look at using
more retros. So should we expect the reduction of the net levels to be a bit worse I guess
in the 3% year-to-date on the gross level? And should we expect to see any more
material volume reductions later renewals like January or is April more to one that we
should run off going forward as a baseline? And then perhaps thinking about April
renewals, can we get a bit more color on what made up that growth, which lines which
countries? And how much of it was the regular premium? I think you mentioned just there
was the odd one-off transaction perhaps just trying to, first, to get a run rate on regular
volume growth within that would be great? Thanks.

A - John R. Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

So I'll ask Thierry to start on these and I'll jump in if there's anything that comes to mind.

A - Thierry Leger

{BIO 16674977 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So let me start with net written premium question. So as you could see, right, the
prediction is not easy to make on the premium side, but to assume that we will hedge
considerably more is not our assumption. And if we do, it's not going to have a major
impact on the premium anyway. So -- but, of course, we are optimistic. If the opportunities
to protect our volatility at the right price, we will do. But again, it will not have a strong
impact on the net premium development.
Regarding the April renewals. So there were really the two elements that we have
emphasized already over the last month. So we said the January renewals have been
down, but, we haven't done as many large transactions as we would have done the other
years. But we also said we would expect large transactions to come our way at some
point. And so we had some of those now coming through and we were pleased about
those and we think it's a good -- there have been good opportunities for us to put capital
at work. So the margins are very satisfactory.
On the non-transactional, let's call it core business, we actually had a very good renewal
on the volume side and the margin side. We've been building, and particularly, in Japan on
a very strong renewal a year ago, and have been able to improve the portfolio further in
terms of margin, but also the mix of business. Also, there we have done a bit of work
around our exposures to secondary perils and low frequencies. So a very, very satisfactory
renewal.

A - John R. Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

And one of your specific questions on geography. What I can say is that while the April
renewals is dominated by Japan, we did see some opportunity to also book some
important premiums in the United States on this April renewal.

The next question comes from the line of Vinit Malhotra with Mediobanca. Please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon. Thank you very much. So one topic I could ask on is on Corporate
Solutions, where obviously the numbers look great and one comment is the reserve
releases remain very high. The fourth quarter was also very high and 1Q was also quite
high as I understand. And could you just help us understand, this comes from very recent
year property book, how should we -- I mean is it still to come? Is it done mostly this
reserve release in Corporate Solutions because usually, you don't expect many releases
from? So that's the first question.
Second thing is just if I can follow up. So, Thierry, very clearly have said that the last call
that NEP will not be as poor as the January renewals and obviously it's looking a lot better.
How should the rest of the year -- will there also be some similar effects from the last one
or two years business to be expected in the NEP? And are you comfortable with this kind
of 5%, 6% sort of growth rate for the rest of the year? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John R. Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

So maybe I'll do the first one with respect to Corporate Solutions. I mean you're correct
that there was a positive prior year development from reserves largely in the property
side, coming through on Corporate Solutions. I think the point here is we're very
comfortable with the overall reserve position across all lines of business on Corporate
Solutions book. We've been somewhat cautious about not over interpreting what has
been a modest frequency of reported losses to us. We think there may be late claims
development or reporting coming through. And so, we're not bringing everything into the
current P&L on the expectations that there is still something to come. So I don't think
we're being extravagant with the realization of prior year reserves here. I think in fact that
we will -- we continue to be very well and strongly positioned, having learned some
lessons in Corporate Solutions in 2017 and '18.
The second question, I'll come back to Thierry.

A - Thierry Leger

{BIO 16674977 <GO>}

So, Vinit, on the premium growth rate and the expectations for the full year and how much
we -- you should read from the first three months into what it means for the full year. So
it's clear that the first three months have been profiting from 2020 business, that is now
earning through. So the one-one renewals obviously they earn through in the first quarter
only very partially. So that -- therefore, the growth we've experienced in 2020 is what has
been part of the driver here. Other driver has been FX with some proportion as well. And,
therefore, you know, when your question is can we kind of expect this gross impact to be
the one for the full year. I can really not say but it does seem on the higher end of what I
would expect definitely. So I would rather go into something flat for the year, but it's very
difficult to say and will depend on the level of transactions that we see and the
opportunities in the business.

FINAL

Yes, I'd say both transactions. But also, I mean we do have some important renewals on
June 1 and July 1 in front of us. And depending on what we find ultimately price adequacy
there, we'll be happy to write value-creating business along the way. But for now, as
Thierry said, the current 6% premium earned has been aided both by the book written in
2020, some multi-year deals and a little bit by foreign exchange.

The next question comes from the line of Thomas Fossard with HSBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, good afternoon. Two questions on the Life Re side. And the first one would be on
the top-line growth of the 13%. Also, if you could make some comment on what drove this
growth in Q1? And what we should expect on a full year basis? Second question, ability to
Life as well will be on the normalized -- of the adjusted for COVID to $17 million net profit,
which looks to be, I would say, a higher run rate than the $200 million per quarter. So just
wanted to also -- could you explain what has been the driver? Is there anything to flag on
the underwriting side, on the expansion side or that was driven by financial specificities?
Thank you.

A - John R. Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Yes, so on the premium growth, we did find some attractive transactions in Life and
Health also that we could book especially in EMEA that were assisting us. I don't know that
we'll maintain exactly that level of growth through the full year, but we've got capital to
deploy and our Life and Health franchise continues to roll, and we see a number of
opportunities. So as the primary industry continues to do some restructuring, we can be
helpful in positioning some of the portfolios that people are looking to move with. With
respect to the ex-COVID performance, you're right, 270 is a big number. The 16.8% ROE
is clearly flattered by a decreased equity base as the unrealized gains in the portfolio
have shrunk because of interest rates rising. I think -- the way I think about it, we said in
our guidance that we thought we'd be at the lower end of the 10% to 12% return on
equity range in '21 and '22 based on an equity base of $8 billion. And I'm comfortable to
continue to provide that guidance. We had a little bit of an unusual situation, where in
almost every geography the technical result was modestly positive. But the positive
oftentimes we see in some geographies a pleasant sum of minus and the technical result
is not as universally strong as what we saw here, but this was pretty much across the
board. And is it somehow helped by the COVID losses? I can't say that, but I can say that
it might not have been modestly either. So the guidance we have out there for something
closer to, if you do the math, 200 per quarter is probably something, which I'd suggest is
consistent with what we've previously stated.

ahead.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. I have couple of questions, if you can help me. First of all is how do we
think about return on investment. It was pretty high at about 3.5%. So would it be possible
for you to give some extra color as to where it came from, like, what is the recurring
return? What is the unrealized gains on equities? What is the crystallized gains on equities
and bonds, that would help? And any split in business lines would be very helpful as well.
Just to understand how much of the strength in earnings are coming from this?
The second question I have is, going back to your lower cat losses this year. I mean, any
thoughts on, like, whether you had just lower market share in Texas or where your market
share, like, normal. It was just highlight recession? Any thoughts on that would be very
helpful as well? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John R. Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Ashik, I'll let Thierry -- sorry, I'll let Terry do the second. On the first one on the return on
investments. Yes, I mean 3.5% is a very, very solid number. The underlying a number of
2.1% is our new running yield definition. I think the difference between the two was not the
result of a bunch of realized gains that we went out and sold either fixed income or
equities but rather largely driven by valuation increases across our equity portfolio, some
of that in the principal investments portfolio. Some of that in the private equity portfolio,
which typically gets booked or comes into our books with a three months lag. And so,
what you're seeing here is the fourth quarter for some of those positions a positive.
Again, actually, the first quarter of this year has been positive. So there'll be a little head
start as we go into Q2 with those private equity positions.
Overall, nothing exceptional there. And again, it was in the matter of us going out and
pushing -- or grabbing a lot of gains on this portfolio. The US capital say that we have to
do the mark-to-market on a quarterly basis and that's what you see. So, Thierry, on the
second question?

A - Thierry Leger

{BIO 16674977 <GO>}

Yes. So the winter storm in Texas has been actually a good example to demonstrate the
impact of our strategy in underwriting. It's a secondary perils. So it's cost (inaudible), but
it's one that we still try to avoid in the sense where when we say we want to avoid the
frequency, remove ourselves from secondary perils then that's one of those. And at the
level of the loss $13 billion, as mentioned by John, you wouldn't expect reinsurers like
Swiss Re to participate to a large extent.

Page 9 of 14



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG

FINAL

So the way we would design the reinsurance programs would be that our clients take
rather a higher share of those losses. And our share of wallet, if you want, would kick in
when the losses in the market get larger, so that's a very good example. And I can tell you
that without the restructuring of our portfolio, indeed, our loss in the first quarter would
have been larger from that Texas loss, but also from the Australian loss. So we could
really demonstrate also internally that it had a very positive impact.

The next question comes from the line of Vikram Gandhi with Societe Generale. Please go

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Hello, hi. It's Vikram. (inaudible). Good afternoon, everybody. I'd be interested to know if
the Group has started deploying the excess liquidity, given how the yields have moved
this year?

Bloomberg Transcript

And secondly, if you can remind us on the hedges that are still in place on various asset
classes that will be very helpful? Thank you.

A - John R. Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

So, that's actually one big question because of the -- my answer to the first is actually the
second. We've done a fairly large unwind of the hedges during the course of the first
quarter, continuing a little bit here in April. As we mentioned, we started the year with a
fairly defensive posture. It seems a long, long, long time ago, but the month of January or
the first week of January was a pretty eventful one vis-a-vis political situation in the UK and
in the US. And so we were starting defensively. Those hedges have largely come off,
since then.
But in doing so, we've been measured and the re-risking of the portfolio. And so, we still
maintain a fairly liquid position outside of having reduced the hedges. If we see the
opportunities to put those funds to work, we will. But in the meantime, we remain, I think,
focused on keeping liquidity high and the duration were largely matched for the
regulatory reasons with enough space at the lower end to be able to move cash if we
need to move cash into some new opportunities on the asset side.

Q - Emanuele Musio

{BIO 19781440 <GO>}

Hello. Hi, thanks for taking my question. A quick one on the combined ratio. The combined
ratio that you reported this quarter reflects your initiatives plus better rates, it's not that
(inaudible) throughout the year. So my question is, have you seen any tailwind in Q1 that
might not be recurring, such as, for example, (inaudible)? And also on casualty, could you
please give us an indication on how claim trends in casualty we look like this year versus
same period last year?

A - John R. Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

I think we'll have Thierry take both of those.

A - Thierry Leger

{BIO 16674977 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So the combined ratio that you mentioned. And there was some tailwind we
profited from, I would say, that is not the case. We've been actually experiencing results,
very much in line with our expectations for the portfolio that we've built. We have been
very confident with the portfolio, the mix and type of business that we have been writing.
In terms of tailwinds, as you called it, right, man made losses you mentioned, they have
certainly been at the lower end. We're observing still that space. We think some of it is
helped by COVID, but the year is still very long and we will have to be careful to see how
this will turn around when actually COVID is going away. So that's a space certainly from an
underwriting perspective we watch very, very carefully.
Also, when we cost business, we are particularly careful not to take necessarily the
experience of the last 12 months as an indicator for the future. That would be very
dangerous. Which leads me to casualty, so you were kind of right to imply that somewhat
in casualty, we've seen calmer month and we think that, particularly in the US due to
COVID the courts were just less active. And that's one thing. But we also think that the
industry and people were generally less active so many reasons why we have actually
seen less of casualty claims. Now, underlying all of this our conviction, my conviction, is that
social inflation, all the mega-trends that we observe has not changed at all. So we still feel
that there is negative sentiments -- sentiment our large companies, if at all, that has even
worsened during the COVID crisis. The COVID crisis on its own has offered its dramatic
toll on people has offered or will offer when the courts open even more opportunities for
plaintiff bars to claim against companies. So we are very carefully watching that space too,
when the courts were open to see how that's going to go. We are looking at funding of
the -- of this industry. And the funding is going up. And this would, therefore, take the
combination of the funding, the COVID crisis and the reopening of the courts. There is no
reason to believe, that this would remain at this low level. And it does support our
strategy and strong -- very strong repositioning of our casualty book in the large
corporate space, where we actually exited 60% of the exposures.

Q - Iain Pearce

{BIO 19522835 <GO>}

Hi, thanks for taking my questions. The first one I have was on the cat budget. I'm just
trying to understand the moving parts of that, the cat budget is up 5% year-on-year, but
obviously you've shrunk exposure to secondary perils, and sort of those aggregate
exposures. So just wondering why that's increased up securities of AGP [ph] as well? And
whether you think that is more conservative estimate?
And then also on sort of large loss exposures. With the cat budget going up and reduced
exposure to secondary perils, should we expect lower market shares in the secondary
perils events in aggregate exposures, but then higher market shares of the sort of more
tail risk events?

Okay, I can start, and John if you want to add something. So the cat budget, obviously, is
not just related to one perils such as TCNA or so. So it is an expression of all the business
we write around all the perils. We've actually seen a healthy growth in many of the perils.
We wish to write more of. I've told you over the last month, that we actually to the
contrary very, very keen to go any of our modeled perils. We have peril -- modeled 180
perils.
And as I said, we're very keen to go though. So for me, the increase in cat budget,
therefore, is very good news. And it shows that we actually improving our diversification of
the cat book, which is the case, and accordingly the budget has moved up.
The question to secondary perils is all your remark, although that secondary perils -- our
market share would have reduced to the benefit of the others is absolutely correct. So we
have definitely strongly reduced our exposure to secondary frequency perils and
increased our exposure to the modeled perils.

A - John R. Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

So I mean, just to reiterate. I do think the true tail risk of large events is something which
we're comfortable reinsuring. And, yes, that exposure has grown, but it hasn't necessarily
grown in any single peril. It's grown across a range of global potential events, as Thierry
indicated.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much and good afternoon. Just one question on Life Health Re. As
obviously, you've experienced strong premium growth. Some -- my understanding was
driven by some transactional business, can you tell us how much is actually Financial
Solutions business in particular solvency driven transactions. These usually come with a
lower margin. And if I remember correctly, from the Investor Day, you said that you want
to move down to what smaller clients but also an effect from that seen in the Q1 already?

A - Thierry Leger

{BIO 16674977 <GO>}

Yes. I'm happy to take this one. So on Life and Health premium growth though the -- I think
John alluded to it already, so it's been rather at the higher end of growth, definitely for us
too. This is a risk pool business that we expect to grow over time. We see many reasons
for that, societal reasons. There is this huge protection gap out there on the Life and
Health business side across almost all lines of business. So that's clearly enough room to
grow, but definitely not at this pace. So as you rightly point out, the differential in growth
has been coming from large transactions. And no, they haven't come from Financial
Solutions or solvency-driven deals. They have mainly been in the area of longevity and
M&A restructuring-related transactions.
