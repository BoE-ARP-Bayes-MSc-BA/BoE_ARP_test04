And now, Jay Fishman.

Jay Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

Thank you, Gabi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
We couldn't be more pleased to report an outstanding start to 2014, with net and
operating income of over $1 billion and record net and operating income per diluted share
of $2.95. Our operating return on equity of nearly 18% in the quarter is the highest since
the Fourth Quarter of 2009 when we posted just over 18%.
These results keep us very much on track to meet our financial objective of achieving a
mid-teens return on equity over time. And this is the case even if one were to exclude our
favorable prior-year reserve development in the quarter, given that our accident year
operating return on equity was 14.7%.
In the Fourth Quarter of last year, I shared with you that we believed we were firing on all
cylinders, and that continues today. We had terrific First Quarter results in Business
Insurance; their profitability improved once again.
We couldn't be more pleased with our efforts to improve returns through the continued
execution of our granular pricing strategy. Given our segmentation approach of seeking
appropriate returns, on an account-by-account and class-by-class basis, we have shared

Page 2 of 26



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2014-04-22

with you that the headline aggregate rate gain, which is the result of our active pricing
strategy, will come down as we continue to execute this strategy.

FINAL

Some industry observers perceive this as an indication of increasing price
competitiveness. We reject that notion, because we are managing our pricing actions very
thoughtfully.
And in that regard, for our individually underwritten accounts we have the ability to
consider each individual account's contribution before engaging in renewal negotiations.
This is where our analytical competitive advantage, based on data, really matters. Our
strategy is very much proactive and much less reactive than it seems many industry
observers believe.
That said, our assessment of the competitive environment as it relates to rate is that it is
for the most part unchanged. This is supported by the fact that we continued to achieve
historically high levels of account retention.

Bloomberg Transcript

Another point of support is the data we are providing on slide four of the webcast, which
for our middle-market business compares the renewal rate gain and number of accounts
in the poorest-performing segment of this business in the First Quarter of 2014 to the
First Quarter of 2013. You can see that the renewal rate gain was virtually the same in
these quarters, but that the number of accounts qualifying as poorest-performing and
renewed in the quarter declined from 289 to 216.
As our overall portfolio improves and the number of accounts in our poorest-performance
band has declined, the change in the aggregate headline rate gain, to the extent that this
band contributes to that headline number, reflects the decline in accounts in this band
rather than a change in the competitive environment within the band. In summary, given
that our goal was to achieve improved returns consistent with our financial objectives,
there is nothing that we see happening in the competitive environment today that causes
us to be less optimistic about our ability to achieve our goal.
In Financial, Professional & International Insurance, we achieved 20% growth in operating
income and a 47% increase in net written premiums, both from the impact of the
Dominion acquisition and strong performance in our management liability and surety
businesses. Our integration efforts in Canada are very much on track, and we are really
pleased with the progress we have made.
Turning to Personal Insurance, in homeowners we produced a combined ratio of 72.4%, or
86.5% excluding favorable prior-year development, even considering the meaningful
winter weather we experienced in the quarter. This performance, taken in the context of
our results over the last decade, continues to demonstrate industry-leading performance.
In personal auto, we experienced 1.1 points of improvement in the underlying combined
ratio. More importantly, we are very excited about the deployment of our new personal
auto product, Quantum Auto 2.0. We've now rolled the product out in 28 states and the
District of Columbia.
Page 3 of 26

Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2014-04-22

FINAL

It was our expectation that this product would dramatically improve our comparative rate
or quoting position, and that is what we are experiencing so far. While we have achieved
this improvement largely through reductions in price, it is critical to note that this lower
price structure is based upon the expense actions we have committed to and
meaningfully achieved, as well as a lower commission for Quantum Auto 2.0.
Consequently, once fully rolled out, we believe the product is priced to produce returns
that are consistent with our long-term goal.
While we are reasonably confident in our estimates of loss content, particularly because
the product was built largely on the foundation of Quantum Auto 1.0, it will take a few
more quarters for us to know more. We will continue to roll this product out across the
country.
We are pleased that we now have a product that can successfully compete in this rapidly
changing marketplace. Brian will speak more about Quantum 2.0, and we look forward to
talking to you more about our strategy in personal insurance during our Investor Day on
June 6.
Finally, this morning we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend per share of 10%
to $0.55 per share, which is the 10th consecutive year we have increased our quarterly
dividend. We note that the compound annual growth rate for our dividend over that time
is 9.6%.

Bloomberg Transcript

With that, let me turn it over to Jay.

Jay Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Thanks, Jay. By any measure, our First Quarter results -- record net and operating income
per diluted share of $2.95, operating ROE of 17.8%, and a GAAP combined ratio of 85.7% - were exceptional. As was the case in recent quarters, these strong results were built
upon very solid investment results, primarily driven by private equity and real estate
returns, along with very strong underwriting performance.
Within underwriting, earned rate increases continued to exceed loss cost trends in each
of our business segments, although this benefit to our loss ratio was mostly offset by the
severe cat and non-cat winter weather that gripped the country this quarter. Our loss ratio
also benefited from net favorable prior-year reserve development of $294 million pretax,
which was up $63 million from the prior-year quarter and was adversely impacted by
catastrophe losses of $149 million pretax, which were up $50 million.
In addition, our expense ratio benefited from a $76 million pretax reduction in an
estimated liability for state assessments that we are required to pay in relation to our
workers compensation premiums. This reduction in our estimated liability resulted from a
change in state law that took effect in the First Quarter of 2014 that clarified our payment
obligations.

FINAL

Each of our business segments once again produced net favorable prior-year reserve
development. In BI, net favorable development of $93 million was driven by better than
expected loss experience for general liability excess coverages that resulted from a more
favorable legal and judicial environment than we had expected, as well as favorable cat
and non-cat property loss development partially offset by higher than expected loss
experience for liability coverages within CMP.
Net favorable development of $69 million in FP&II primarily resulted from better than
expected results in contract surety and bond and financial products, while in PI a net
favorable reserve development of $132 million was primarily driven by better than
expected loss experience in homeowners and other, cat and non-cat weather-related
losses.
On a combined stat basis for all of our US subsidiaries, accident year 2004 and prior
developed unfavorably by a de minimis amount, approximately $11 million, while each
accident year in the period 2005 through 2013 developed favorably in this quarter.
Operating cash flows were very strong, a little over $700 million, and up from $530 million
in the prior-year quarter. We ended the quarter with over $1.6 billion of Holding Company
liquidity, and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $2.6 billion pretax, or $1.7 billion after
tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year, mostly
due to reductions in spreads. Book value per share was $73.06, or 7% higher than a year
ago and 4% higher than at the beginning of this year.
Turning to capital management, we continue to generate much more capital than we
need to support our businesses, allowing us to return $882 million of excess capital to our
shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $177 million and repurchased $705 million
of our common shares, including $650 million under our publicly announced share
repurchase program, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, and $55
million to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover
employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting and payout of performance and
restricted stock awards.
Finally, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.50 per share to $0.55
per share, a 10% increase on top of last year's 9% increase. So with that, let me turn the
microphone over to Brian.

Brian MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Thanks, Jay. In Business Insurance, we had a very strong quarter with operating income of
$653 million and a combined ratio of 87.7%. The underlying combined ratio, which
excludes the impact of cats and prior-year development, was 88.1% for the quarter, an
improvement of 4 points year-over-year.

Page 5 of 26



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2014-04-22

FINAL

As always, there were some moving pieces in the combined ratio this quarter, including a
favorable nonrecurring expense item and unfavorable non-cat weather losses. Excluding
these items, margin expansion driven by the impact of earned rate in excess of loss trend
was about 2 points.
Turning to production trends, beginning on page 10, retention was up in the quarter to
81%, while renewal premium change was down somewhat from recent periods at about
7%. The 7% included pure rate increases of about 5%, down about 1 point from last
quarter. The rate increases continued to be broad-based and were led by commercial
auto.
New business volume in the quarter of $443 million was similar to recent periods. Loss
trend continued to run at about 4% for the segment. So on a written basis, rate gains
continued to be about our current view of loss trends.

Bloomberg Transcript

The production results for the quarter within the segment tell somewhat different stories
this quarter, so I would like to spend a moment discussing each of them individually.
Beginning on page 11 with select accounts, our small commercial business, the production
metrics reflect the impact of our active strategy to improve the profitability on portions of
this business.
For some time, we've been taking the necessary actions to improve our returns, and
those actions have been successful. Consequently, we are shifting focus and rate
expectations to retaining more of our business and are pleased with the 4-point
improvement in retention this quarter. We also feel very good about the 9.2% renewal
premium change we achieved for the quarter.
Turning to commercial accounts on slide 12, both the aggregate rate and retention were
unchanged from the Fourth Quarter of 2013. But as we have commented before, it is not
the aggregate number that we focus on.
As we have successfully executed our strategy of improving the returns of this business
over time, the headline aggregate rate increase number has moderated, while retention
has improved. We continue to execute a very granular strategy to retain our bestperforming accounts and to get significant rate increases on our poorer-performing
business.
As we enter the fourth year of implementing this strategy, our ability to execute is largely
unchanged. So in summary, we continue to see a pretty stable commercial accounts
market, with rate and retention dynamics consistent with improving product margins.
Looking at Other Business Insurance on slide 13, the environment is largely the same as
for commercial accounts with the exception of the larger end of our national property
business, specifically large layered property risks where we have seen rate pressure
intensify. For perspective, our entire national property book represents about 5% of our
total Business Insurance net written premiums, and the large layered programs are a
subset of this.

FINAL

In the Financial, Professional & International segment, operating income of $195 million is
very strong and up 20% over the prior-year quarter. The increase was driven by the
inclusion of The Dominion, higher levels of underlying underwriting margins, and our
decision to exit a management liability excess of loss reinsurance treaty in 2014.
The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 90%, a slight improvement from the
prior year. The improvement was due to earned rate in excess of loss trend across the
segment, along with the exit from the management liability reinsurance treaty I just
mentioned, largely offset by the impact of The Dominion.
The Dominion had a negative impact of 2.2 points on the segment underlying combined
ratio. This is the First Quarter that reflects the full impact of the Dominion acquisition, and I
am pleased to say that the integration is proceeding in line with our expectations.
Of course, we expect that The Dominion results will improve over time. However, given its
relative size, we don't intend to spike it out going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to production results, surety gross written premium of $216 million was up from
$195 million in the prior-year quarter, reflecting gains in contract surety. In management
liability, retention and renewal premium change remained strong at 85% and 8%,
respectively, while new business was down a little bit from recent periods.
In International, retention continued to improve and came in at 83% for the quarter.
Renewal premium change rose to nearly 3%, and new business was up significantly yearover-year due to the impact of Dominion. So overall, a great quarter for the segment.
In our Personal Insurance business, operating income of $268 million for the quarter was
up 36% versus the First Quarter of 2013, driven by higher net favorable reserve
development in homeowners along with improved underlying underwriting results in both
auto and home. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 87.4%, an
improvement of about 2 points versus the First Quarter of 2013, due to lower expenses
along with rate increases in excess of loss trends, partially offset by higher non-cat
weather-related losses.
Looking specifically at auto production, retention remained strong at 81%. Renewal
premium change was about 6%, while new business volume was up significantly versus
recent periods due to the rollout of our new product, Quantum Auto 2.0. Jay spoke about
how pleased we are with the early production results for Quantum 2, and I would like to
take a moment to give you some additional color on our progress on the expense
initiatives that are fundamental to our ability to make our auto product more pricecompetitive.
As you recall, in addition to a 2-point commission reduction for the new product, we are
taking actions on our operating expenses, which will result in savings of about $140 million
pretax. To date, we have executed on initiatives responsible for about two-thirds of the
$140 million run-rate savings, and we remain on target to achieve the full run-rate saves by
the end of this year, in line with our original expectations.

FINAL

As we mentioned last year, the operating expense reductions are primarily intended to
benefit auto, but will also benefit the homeowners results. In terms of impact on the
combined ratio, the benefit from the operating expense reductions will be split roughly
equally between the loss ratio due to claim expense reductions and the expense ratio
due to other insurance expense reductions.
We believe that the initial success of Quantum 2 is due not only to the delivery of a
product with competitive price and a structure that better responds to consumer buying
preferences, but also to the strength of our long-term relationships to the independent
agent channel and the fact that we are a recognized brand in the marketplace.
Turning to auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio was 92.3% for the quarter, an
improvement of over 1 point versus the First Quarter of 2013, and was driven by earned
rate increases in excess of loss trend. Our current view of auto loss trend remains at
about 4%, with no significant change in the underlying texture from previous quarters.
Looking at homeowners, production was strong in the quarter, with renewal premium
change of about 8.5% while retention remained at 84%, and new business volume was up
from the prior-year quarter, due in part to a lift from the improved auto new business.
From a profitability perspective, the underlying combined ratio was approximately 80%,
an improvement of close to 1.5 point versus the First Quarter of 2013, and was driven by
lower expenses, earned rate increases in excess of loss trends, partially offset by non-cat
weather-related losses.

With that, let me turn it over to Gabi.

Gabriella Nawi

{BIO 2211991 <GO>}

Thank you. Before we open it up for question and answer, may I ask you to please limit
yourself to one question and one follow-up, please? Thank you. We can now open it up
for question-and-answer period.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Michael Nannizzi, Goldman Sachs.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thank you. I had a question actually, Jay. Has anything changed in terms of your philosophy
around cat or non-cat weather, reserving philosophy? Just because it looks like this year,
and we have seen a little bit recently, non-cat weather creates difficult comps on the
underlying, but provides for favorable reserve development for prior year.
So is that coincidence of those guys? I am just curious. Has that changed in the last year or
two? Thanks.
Page 8 of 26



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity

A - Jay Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

FINAL

This is Jay Benet. There is no change in the way we go about reserving. Reserving is
based on the actual storms that take place and then the assumptions that surround that.
And one of the things that we have had some difficulty with has been the weather
patterns of the last several years. If you recall, not so much last year but the couple of
years before that, when there was a lot of tornado experience that was creating both
non-cat as well as cat weather, there was oftentimes a lot of hail with that. And when the
hail manifested itself, usually it was several months later; in some cases, even longer
periods of time than that.
Particularly last year, what we saw when we had storm activity was, first of all, an
expectation on our part that the hail development would continue as we had been seeing
it. And in fact what turned out to be the case was there was very little long-tail hail
immersion, if you will, that came about.
So there is nothing really different about the way we are reserving, but it is just using the
facts and circumstances that emerge over time to come up with the best estimates, and
then revise those when new information comes up.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Got you. Great. Thanks. Then, I guess the other question, talking about really focusing on
the lowest-performing cohort and taking as much rate as you can there, Brian. It seems
like that has also been a philosophy that has been in place for a little while.
How much more do you think opportunity there is in that cohort to continue to push for
right-size rate? Like, how long will it take to push that cohort into the good bucket?
Thanks.

A - Brian MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Yes, so a couple points in there. When you look at that cohort, we will continue to move
stuff up -- we don't have the crystal ball as to know exactly when and what we will be able
to do going forward.
When we look at the results that we have seen in recent quarters, we are encouraged
that we don't see any change. So we continue to work it account by account.
One of the things I -- you started with we get as much as we can.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Right.

A - Brian MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Page 9 of 26



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2014-04-22

The philosophy is a little different than that. We are looking at these -- in every cohort,
there is always a distribution of accounts. We are looking account by account within that
cohort. We are trying to work with the customer and with the agent to come up with what
is the appropriate number for that account.

FINAL

In aggregate, we have been able to maintain at about that 20% rate increase level. But
there is a distribution of accounts within there, so while we will continue to work at it.
There will always be new business that we'll write that will -- we don't write new business
planning for it to be in cohort 5; but there will be some that will end up there. There will
be other accounts that will have loss experience that will have them deteriorate, and they
will go down into cohort 5.
But as you can see from the data we show, it is continuing to shrink. So it will never get to
zero, but --.
But right now, we feel pretty good that we are still able to take the actions we need to
take on the accounts in that cohort. And where we can, we are happy to retain the
business; and where we can't, we lose some of it. I don't know if that's helpful.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Great. No, that helps. Thank you very much.

Operator
Jay Gelb, Barclays.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thank you. The first question I have is on the merger and acquisition environment. Clearly
we have seen a more hostile environment emerge in Bermuda. And I know that is not at
all a focus area for Travelers.
But, Jay, I was wondering if you could focus on the M&A environment currently and
whether you might be interested in more bolt-on deals like the Dominion opportunity, or
perhaps even something more transformational.

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

Sure, Jay. While not -- we don't compete in the reinsurance arena at all, actually, so I don't
have any particular insight into that segment or the dynamics around it. You all understand
that, have a different view of that than I ever could; so I will leave that to your commentary.
Our own situation is really unchanged, which is that we will look at anything, because you
always learn by whatever you look at; but our interest is very selective. We have achieved
a level of performance and returns and profitability that we, at least domestically, don't
need to be any bigger to be successful.
Page 10 of 26



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2014-04-22

FINAL

If we can be and continue to be successful, that's fine. Being bigger and being less
successful is a bad trade-off. So we are always evaluating whatever we look at in the
context of return on invested capital. On invested capital importantly, it's margins,
profitability, all that.
So we will -- I would say that our interest domestically remains unchanged, but relatively
highly selective. We have always said that there were a few environments outside the
United States that from a long-term perspective we were quite interested in.
Brazil was one of them, and we had the opportunity to partner with the Malucelli firm; and
that transaction has gone just really well. In the context of a joint venture, where so many
things can go wrong, so many things in this one have gone right, and it has really been a
terrific experience.
It has actually reinvigorated my belief that you can actually do a joint venture and have
both parties feel good about it and be successful and do good business.
Canada was opportunistic in that there were very few acquisition candidates that were
really available. This was a decision by the owner of Dominion to exit the business
strategically.

Bloomberg Transcript

We were approached with a very small number of other people. And it moved us, as I
have commented before, I think the numbers were from 21st largest in Canada to now
the 10th largest.
At 21st, you are not sustainable. It really becomes difficult to hire talented people, to
invest in systems and infrastructure. I don't mean to say that the people who worked for
Travelers of Canada were not talented; they obviously were. It just puts a stress on the
organization.
So having the opportunity to acquire Dominion and then most importantly, most
importantly, were two elements of it that were intriguing to us. First, we thought they
were on the right path to doing the right things to make their own business more
profitable. We thought we could accelerate the time frame, that our skills, size and scale
and our experiences that we have had could accelerate that.
And then the more intermediate and longer-term aspect of taking our commercial
products, exporting them up into Canada, and using Dominion's remarkable distribution
organization to leverage, that remains just right clear in focus. It's just so important for us
to do.
I have expressed before, although I am less optimistic that we can -- that it will happen -- I
would love to find us in India in some way. The challenge there is that it takes a
tremendous amount of time and investment. Not dollars, because it is a relatively small
market; time and investment in people and infrastructure, management attention, for a
26% ownership. And it's difficult to make sense of that.
Page 11 of 26



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2014-04-22

If we had a higher degree of confidence that that regulatory prohibition would be lifted, it
would become 49%, we would be more aggressive. There are certainly plenty of partners
in India who have raised their hand and have expressed interest in partnering with us.

FINAL

So the identification of a partner is not the issue. The issue is making real sense of an
investment longer-term.
We are a P&C company. That is what we're going to be. There may be other
environments that will pop up and we will take a look at.
Continental Europe broadly is over-insured and under-returned and doesn't hold a lot of
excitement for us. So it's going to be case-by-case.
We hope to use the venture in Brazil to look at other South American opportunities. So we
will continue to find those spots where we think that our skills, the attributes, the partner's
ability to bring value to the transaction make sense and we will invest in. So that's as
comprehensive an answer as I can give you.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That is very comprehensive, thank you. Then just on capital management, with the
increase in the dividend and the strong level of retained earnings, any thoughts as to
whether Travelers could increase the combined share buyback and dividend to be more
than an annual level of operating income going forward?

A - Jay Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Well, the basis upon which the capital management starts is with the operating company
capital. So to the extent that you are making -- your earnings are creating capital that you
don't need, that is the basis for the share buybacks and the dividends.
We are always looking at other things that will free up capital. You might recall from a
couple years ago, we mentioned that we had had reductions in the amount of reinsurance
recoverables we had, or there was a sale of a runoff business -- that both freed up capital.
So we look for those kinds of opportunities, but those are things that may or may not
happen.
The real juice, the real underlying current that gives rise to the ability to return capital, that
is the earnings.

Q - Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Good morning, and congratulations on a great quarter. First, just a question of the
numbers and how we should think about them.

FINAL

Last year you guys ran I think over a 15% ROE; this quarter it was nearly 18%. And the
accident year ROE you mentioned earlier I think was -- rounds up to 15%.
I know we all need to normalize for many things, as I think you guys do internally. But when
you think about where you are, what should we think of as where you are in your core runrate ROE?
And how far really are you from the mid-teens ROE target that you have over time? Are
we there? And if not, how much -- if you bring this back to the point, how much more rate
momentum do you think you would need to get us to that target?

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

Josh, it's Jay Fishman. We are not there. Most definitively we are not there.

Bloomberg Transcript

In order to achieve our goal -- and it is not vague by intention; it's vague because our
business is simply not as precise as some people tend to think, this mid-teens ROE over
time.
To achieve that, you're going to have to achieve periods of time where you exceed midteens, because there will be good weather, there will be bad weather, and that is going
to move back and forth. So we still have to make progress.
So there is no particular change in our approach, our philosophy, what we are trying to
achieve. Jay will tell you that when we -- if you take out the workers comp assessment
change, that that impacts ROE by 90 basis points or something, by something like 90
basis points. So you can take the 14.6% and you can make it --.
There are so many moving parts and so many unusual (technical difficulty) unusual. There
are -- every quarter has unusual pluses and unusual minuses, and they just keep washing
out over time.
We have more to do if we're going to get back on track. At this level of interest rate, I am
still not 100% convinced that it is achievable in today's environment.
We said several quarters ago; I will reiterate it today -- it remains an aspirational goal. I
think that it is critical in an organization to express a strategic goal and, absent something
fundamentally changing that is permanent, sticking with it.
It's not just words that we use here in a webcast. It's embedded in the systems by which
we price product; it's embedded in the systems by which we evaluate risk selection; it's
what people in the field, underwriters, understand their mission to be.

So we don't mess with it lightly. We leave it as it is because it takes so long to get the
DNA of an organization to reflect these strategic initiatives.

FINAL

We've got two things going on. Interest rates remain at overall historical lows, and the
weather patterns are simply less predictable than they were. Both of those remain, and
we are not yet at the pricing level, and so we are going to keep going.
I don't know exactly how to quantify it. I really don't.
I am not holding back. I don't know how to quantify X points of rate in various businesses,
in various product lines, and help you -- I wish we had that kind of granular understanding
about returns and losses and the rest; I just don't know how to do it.
I just know that as I look at each quarter and analyze it and break it down, that we are still
not there yet.

Q - Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. That's helpful. That's helpful. If I -- this is going to seem like a non sequitur in a way,
because you are still raising pricing, but if -- we are all looking forward and trying to look
maybe six months out again, so what we will be talking about in six months and things like
that.
So the question, if I ask you a bigger question, Jay, this used to be a boom and bust
sector. And I think you called -- among the first to get the post-cycle idea out, into the
discussion three or four years ago, and no one believed you.
But with improvements in data analytics and more responsible behavior across the board,
we have seen three years of pricing firming. So everybody is starting to dust off questions
as pricing slows, look back at history, and what does history tell us.
Last time, history -- last time we saw pricing start to slow, there was seven years of pricecutting and a 40% decline in commercial lines. It was obviously a different story. It was a lot
of -- the backdrop was very different.
But I am wondering; as you guys put your strategic planning hats on, and you think about
the market, can you help us think about what here has been structurally changed? If we
were to put on a three; to five-year view, what you think we will see if we get --if we move
-- we decisively pass the firming part of the cycle.

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

Sure. I will start off by saying we could be wrong. Just because we believe it and manage
our business that way doesn't by definition mean it will be right.
It's entirely possible that we just don't see it right. But -- and it's important, because
otherwise -- you always have to consider the prospect of, what if you're wrong.

FINAL

We have been talking about much less amplitude in the cyclicality of our business for a lot
more than three to five years. I think you can go back almost 10, certainly eight, where it
began to get increasingly clear to us that the factors that we thought had contributed to
that remarkable cyclicality were being moderated.
They were much better data. I know that we led that effort because of our history; but we
are not unique in the sense of one and only in that regard. Better data, better analytics,
broadly across the business, the industry, particularly amongst the best competitors.
I think that Sarbanes-Oxley actually had a meaningful impact on our business. It brought
Boards of Directors into the discussions of reserve setting and the controls and
procedures behind it.
Those were really good things. Not because they changed bad behavior -- because you
can presume that in my comment; I don't mean it that way. But it improved the processes.
It fundamentally improved the processes by which managements are held accountable,
which Boards embrace.
That's a big deal. That was a meaningful change in our industry that I don't think a lot of
people really understood; and I believe that now.

Bloomberg Transcript

So now, I will tell you -- at least, this is a Travelers' view. I am not speaking for anybody
else, but I will tell you for us.
We don't -- the question that we get asked probably more than any other, which we just
scratch our head about is, well, now that returns are where you want them to be, why
don't you grow?
And talk about a non sequitur question, it's one that we so struggle to understand. There
is a presumption in that question that we can moderate our rate gains on the margin and
somehow grow our business and change behavior.
First of all, I don't know how to moderate thousands of transactions in any given quarter
one at a time and move it on the margin. We give our folks tools, we give them
processes, we give them goals, and we let them manage it. And the numbers, in the end,
end up the way they end up.
We also don't believe that you can on the margin grow your business by cutting price
marginally. I think, we think, that is just a fool's approach to the business. If you really want
to use prices, that type of a competitive approach, you've got to cut it to the point where
you will accept materially lower returns than anybody else. That will change it; and my
guess is it will be at a level of profit that is simply unsupportable for the long term.
So we at least, we reject the notion that you can moderate pricing to grow your business.
Now that doesn't mean that we are free from that obligation. We try really hard to grow
our businesses, and in many cases we have been extremely successful.

FINAL

It has not been based on price. It has been based on risk selection. Importantly, identifying
the competitive advantages that you have in your business and applying them more
broadly to business opportunities that arise.
We had the best national accounts workers comp business there was, and lots of you
have been exposed to that and you understand the competitive dynamics that exist and
the advantages we bring. Once we decided that we could apply that expertise to the
small commercial business, we were able to grow that segment in small commercial
meaningfully, really meaningfully, and it mattered.
In our middle-market business, when we decided to get much more specific and
program-driven, less generalist, we've actually been able to grow the premiums from -going back to 2005 -- a little over $2 billion to now a little over $3 billion in that business.
Real growth, not by price, because in that period of time largely price has either been flat
or it's increased. But by identifying segments of risk, risk return, where the return trade-off
was worthwhile and it made sense for us to apply those competitive advantages.
Now -- so we don't -- we're not -- we may get dragged into it; maybe there will be other
competitors that will be willing to accept subpar returns at a level that at some point force
everybody to respond. That was the old days.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think the industry is smarter than that. I may be wrong. I think it is.
We are running our business with that in mind. And I am hopeful, hopeful, that that will
convert into a financial services business, an industry in P&C, that looks more like so many
others, greater consistency, less volatility.
That level of volatility is in no one's interest. It's not even in the customer's interest. It's in
nobody's interest.
Consistency of risk management and its costs are important economically, and I am
hopeful that we will get there. But ultimately, every company makes its own decision,
every company pursues its own strategy, so all I am expressing to you is ours, recognizing
that we could be wrong.
But that's my view of why things are different -- our view of why things are different today
than they were perhaps 20 years ago.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi. Good morning. The first question is on the accident year loss ratio ex-cats for the
Business Insurance segment. We had some very small improvement, maybe around 20
basis points of year-over-year improvement in that segment. I understand there is some
non-cat weather. But if you could help me understand how you look at these numbers that
would be helpful, given that pricing is in excess of loss cost trends. Thanks.

A - Brian MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

So -- and I lost track of the numbers you were doing. So you were looking at ex-cat,
accident year --

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Loss ratio. Correct. So that is about 60.2 points this quarter versus 60.4 points in last
year's First Quarter, so that is a small improvement.
Most of the improvement on the accident year combined ratio came from the expense
ratio, I believe, 150 basis points outside of the workers comp. So since you are setting
pricing in excess of loss costs, I would have thought that the loss ratio would have had
more significant improvement.

A - Brian MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, okay. Jay has got the numbers.

A - Jay Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Yes, without getting into the specifics of -- yes, this is how we react to it. I mean, the way
we react is we obviously have some very specific views as to what the components of the
changes are.
So in blowing apart that 20 basis points, we look at, well, what is the impact of rate
earning in versus loss trends? And how does that compare to prior quarters? And are the
trends that we had been seeing inherent in this number that we are seeing here?
And the answer to that is yes. We continue to earn in rate in excess of loss trends.
Then the next obvious question then is, well, okay, if that is the case, how come it's not
showing up? As you had said, this is a quarter where the weather has, on a non-cat basis
as well as a cat basis in an area like Business Insurance, been much more of an impact
than it was in the First Quarter of last year.
When you think about the weather this particular quarter with the winter storms, one of
the questions that we had been mulling over in here was if you look at the relationship of
losses, weather-related losses in BI versus PI. Personal Insurance, while it had weather
events this quarter, they really looked not all that dissimilar from where they had been in
the prior year.
Page 17 of 26



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2014-04-22

FINAL

And in the case of BI, they were much higher, both in terms of cat and non-cat. Looking
further at that, we find that in Business Insurance you are dealing with insureds that have
many more flat roofs, that when there are ice storms and snowstorms sustain more
damage than sloped roofs and homes that people own. And then secondarily you have a
lot of sprinkler systems in businesses; and when sprinkler systems freeze and then water
damage results, the damage is extensive, much more so than the homeowners business.
So in pulling all these things apart, we look at the data, we look at the relationships, we
look at the causality, and see that it all makes sense to us. In this particular case what you
are seeing are the 20 basis points of improvement, but it is really the rate in excess of
loss trend benefit being offset in large measure by the weather.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure, that's helpful. Just as a follow-up to that, we have seen the expense ratio improve
meaningfully in this segment -- that is, the Business Insurance segment -- and the other
segments. Curious as to whether this is repeatable and whether this is a function of
management action, because you feel that the pace of rate increases are now starting to
moderate. Thanks.

A - Jay Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, there is a combination of stories here. First of all, in Business Insurance, Business
Insurance is where the benefit that we called out in the press release relating to the
workers comp assessments is coming through. So that is the lion's share of what is taking
place here.
We continue to manage expenses very, very carefully in Business Insurance, and we are
getting some benefit of expense leverage here that is also contributing to the reduction
that you are seeing. But the primary driver in Business Insurance was the reevaluation of
the estimated liability that we called out.
In other areas, we have changes in commission rates that we have talked about that have
come through; also the expense saves that we talked about in PI. So there is lots of
different stories, but it all goes back in most cases to a very diligent view as to how to
manage expenses in this place.

Page 18 of 26



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The

The first question is on loss cost trends in Business Insurance. Maybe using California
comp as a backdrop, has anything changed in terms of loss cost trends when you look at
Q1 versus Q4?

A - Brian MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

FINAL

This is Brian. The short answer is no.
Your comment of taking California comp as a backdrop, I don't think I would ever use
California comp as the standard for things broadly across the book of business. So in our
comp business and the other lines, really no significant movements at all this quarter from
what we have been seeing historically.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

I can see now I was unclear. I was alluding to SB 863 and its impact.

A - Brian MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Yes, specifically in California.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Brian MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Yes, I don't think we want to go that granular in talking about specific trends. I mean, we
have got a decent sized book in California and continue to manage it on a granular basis
and feel good about it.
But -- yes. Everything, all those changes are reflected in the results that we have got in our
book. So we would prefer not to delve that deeply into one state's specific actions.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Okay. I guess switching gears and going back to the discussion on Quantum 2.0, it's in 38
states -- it's in 28 states right now.
What I was trying to get at was, how should we think about the impact it might be having
on premiums right now? I.e., is there some way to segregate the impact when we look at
the numbers?

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

This is Jay Fishman. In the aggregate, no. And were we to dive into the individual states
where the product has been rolled out, what you would see -- I am trying to recall. Almost
universally, maybe that is not exactly so, but you would see a meaningful increase,
meaningful increase in new business in each of those states. And because it has only

Page 19 of 26



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2014-04-22

been out for a few months and it's only still out in 28 states and the D of C, there is still
some time to go before it evidences itself in our numbers.

FINAL

I think the best that I could provide to you -- this is not a budget. I want to make it clear;
it's not a budget. It is to some extent a guess on our part; and of course competitive
reaction can change all of this.
But our guess is that if we keep going at the pace and things remain as unchanged as
they are now, that by the time we get to the Fourth Quarter of this year that we will
achieve breakeven status. Meaning that in the Fourth Quarter the book will no longer be
shrinking. So it will shrink again in the Second Quarter; it will shrink again in the third; by the
time we get to the fourth, we should be able to hit breakeven.
And that gives you, I think, a sense of its intermediate-term impact on a book of our size.
Remember that it's -- all new is coming out 2.0. Renewal is at the agent's discretion based
upon the individual customer's need.
And I am be reminded here by everybody that my comment about the Fourth Quarter is
that that's the policies in force, not premium dollars. Policies in force should, we hope,
given everything we see, would project to flatten out in the Fourth Quarter.

Thank you. Two questions. The first is in the management liability business; we see an
increase in the acceleration I should say of the price increase. I am I guess a little surprised
by that. I am wondering what is happening in that business.

FINAL

Secondly, related to Canada and Dominion, are you able to take capital out of that
business now? If not, when will you be able to?

A - Alan Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Jay, it's Alan Schnitzer. Let me start with the first one, then I will turn the second one over
to Jay. In management liability, what you are seeing there is RPC, renewal price change.
That has got two components, one is rate and one is exposure.
The rate underlying that sequentially in quarters would be pretty consistent. Up slightly,
but I would call it consistent with the prior quarter.
What you see in addition to that, though, is exposure. That is us being able to improve our
position in some accounts that have been performing well, in some cases from an excess
position to a primary layer, and then just an improvement in ratable. So it is really those
two pieces that you are seeing there.

A - Gabriella Nawi

{BIO 2211991 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sorry, this is Gabi. Just to clarify. It is renewal premium change on the page in the webcast,
not renewal price change.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Got it.

A - Jay Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

As it relates to your question about the capital position and taking capital out of Canada,
first and foremost is looking at the opportunity that we have with Dominion to both
integrate it, get it into Travelers in as seamless a fashion as we can, and then take
advantage of the business opportunities up in Canada.
So we will maintain a capital base in Canada that will support those business activities.
Your question is a good one, but it is complicated by both profitability and growth; and we
will just manage it very carefully up there.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

Great. Thanks. On the change in the estimated liability for workers comp state
assessments, could you clarify what states that applies to and what exactly changed in the
nature of the assessment?

FINAL

A - Jay Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Yes, this is Jay Benet again. The state is New York State.
New York has been going through some rethinking of how they manage things associated
with workers comp. You might recall from last year, I think it was in the First Quarter,
maybe the second. It was first? We had had a change in the way certain reopened
workers comp claims were funded; and that actually had a cost to us last year that went
through prior-year development.

Bloomberg Transcript

What New York State has done recently is change the way they fund the workers comp
bureaus in New York. Effective 1/1 of this year, instead of doing something that they had
done historically -- and without getting into all the complications associated with it -- we
had, along with others, charged policyholders surcharges in particular years and then
collected those. That was the basis upon which we were supposed to be funding at a
later time what the costs were that we were being assessed by New York State for
operating their various bureaus.
And there was a disjoint, frankly, between what our surcharges were and what we were
actually assessed by the state of New York. At times we saw that assessment being
higher than what we collected, and that caused us to look at our obligations for that and
build up an estimated liability associated with that.
When New York State changed the law effective 1/1, it didn't change the surcharges we
had collected. In fact, there was a true-up period where you looked back four years from
that date. You looked at what you assessed in that time frame -- I'm sorry, what the
surcharges were in the time frame, what you had paid, and then settled up with New York.
And we paid that.
But what it did was it eliminated going forward this uncertainty as to a breakage, if you
will, between the surcharges and the assessment. So this estimated liability for that
breakage in effect was what we no longer required.
And going forward, the matching of the surcharges and the payments to New York State
will be something that will be very definable, so there is really no need for this estimated
liability anymore. It is a one-time thing. It is a true-up and it is not something that will recur.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

But it transfers to the expense ratio rather than the loss ratio because it is more of a payas-you-go?

It is tough to forecast what we are going to see. I think we feel great about our comp
experience and the capabilities we have and the risk selection we have gone through, and
feel confident that we are appropriately recording the things as we see them today.

FINAL

A - Jay Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

And our pricing strategies are similar to what we described earlier. Where there are
accounts that have been poor-performing or under return we have been seeking rate
gains to improve the profitability; and ultimately that will evidence itself in the numbers.
So -- I am not -- yes. Other than that, do loss costs develop as we contemplate they will?
That is always the variable.

Q - Adam Klauber

{BIO 1494359 <GO>}

Okay. How are medical loss cost trends running?

A - Brian MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Consistent with what our expectations have been. We are not going to disclose specific
numbers there, but -- I don't think we have in the past. But you can read what is going on
in medical loss cost inflation broadly in society and in the economy, and it is higher than
normal inflation, but something that is consistent.
I think for us, one of the things that is really fundamental to our success in this line is
literally 20 years ago we decided we were going to invest heavily in our abilities to
manage the medical component of the comp claims; and I think we have got clearly
industry-leading capabilities there and that really matters for us.
So we are obviously looking at what the trend is on our book, and I don't know if it's
different than what other companies are seeing. But it's clearly been within our
expectations and something we watch very, very closely but right now feel good about.

Does that change that suggested guidance for the year?

A - Alan Schnitzer

Hi, Larry; it's Alan. No, it doesn't.
We certainly took that into account when we gave the outlook a quarter ago. If you look in
our 10-Q and you look in the outlook, we really say the same thing about the balance of
the year, meaning the next three quarters we expect to be broadly consistent with fullyear 2013.
So obviously we did come in under that in the First Quarter. So if you just do the math, that
would suggest a slight improvement on the full year. But again I would just point you back
