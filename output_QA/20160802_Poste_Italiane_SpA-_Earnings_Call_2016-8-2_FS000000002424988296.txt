{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

Thank you and good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We are pleased to report a solid set
of numbers for the ﬁrst-half 2016. Let me start by stating that these results have also been
impacted by a positive one-oﬀ related to the Visa Europe disposal for €121 million, which I
will better explain later on. In any case, the expected underlying trends conﬁrm progress
of execution as per our plans for each of our businesses.
More speciﬁcally, revenues for the period were up 11% at €17.7 billion. EBIT has grown 32%
to €843 million. Without the above-mentioned Visa eﬀect, growth would be 13% at €722
million. Net proﬁt has grown 30% to €565 million. Without the above-mentioned Visa
eﬀect, growth would be 4% at €451 million. The solid set of ﬁgures generated robust
funds from operation of €263 million that I will further detail in the following charts.

FINAL

Moving on to slide number three, here you have an overview of our key numbers.
Consolidated revenues and proﬁts were up, respectively, by about 11% and 32% over the
period. This is mainly due to the following. Financial services, operating proﬁt increased
by more than 6% from €456 million to €485 million. This is mainly attributable to higher
capital gains realized from active management of BancoPosta asset portfolio of about €77
million, in line with the delta already indicated in the ﬁrst quarter.
The disposal to Visa Incorporated of our stake in Visa Europe for €121 million fully
corresponding to the already-indicated capital gain booked in ﬁrst-half 2016. This
disposal is a consequence of Visa Incorporated acquisition of Visa Europe aimed at
creating a single global company. Lower operating cost by 14%, which I will explain later
on.
Furthermore, for ﬁnancial services, all of this has been partially compensated by higher
net recharges from the mail and parcel business unit of about €184 million as a direct
consequence of the already-commented revenues growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

Insurance and asset management, revenues increased by approximately 15% from €11.2
billion to €12.9 billion, and operating proﬁt maintained a robust 9% growth year-on-year.
This is mainly due to the ongoing positive performance of life gross written premium and
an initial contribution on non-life assets and asset management products.
Mail and parcel, revenues were equal to €1.844 billion, down 2.5% on 2015. More
speciﬁcally, Q2 revenues were ﬂat versus the same period in the previous year,
remarkably improving vis-à-vis the 5% reduction posted in the Q1 2016. This is a
consequence of a better revenue mix with a higher contribution from parcels, partially
oﬀsetting the expected decline in traditional postal revenues. EBIT has been positively
impacted by higher recharges to the ﬁnancial division. Please bear in mind that we will
account for our usual accruals on voluntary personnel reduction incentive schemes only in
the ﬁnal quarter of the year.
Before moving in to each speciﬁc business unit, let's have a look at our clients' asset
breakdown on slide number four. Volumes increased by almost 3%, bringing total assets
to €488 billion versus €476 (4:52) billion of last year. The mix continues to remain wellbalanced with a clear resilience of postal savings collection and a material increase for
about €3 billion in our current account deposits. The strengths and the reliability of our
brand, the proximity to our customer base as well as enough range of simple and safe
products continue to deliver an increasing asset base and proﬁtability for the group.
Let's now move in to each speciﬁc business unit results, starting with our ﬁnancial services
revenues evolution on slide number ﬁve. Net of the already-commented contribution
from the disposal of the Visa Europe stake, revenues have grown from €2.6 billion to €2.7
billion, mainly as a consequence of the realized capital gains on the active portfolio
management, as well as the marked increase in ﬁnancing products distribution. This has
been partially oﬀset by the expected lower postal savings collection and payment cards
distribution fees.

As a general overview, let me also conﬁrm that for the full-year 2016, we expect to
generate returns from current account deposits in the region of €2 billion as a
combination of capital gains and portfolio yield.

FINAL

Within this framework, please note that in the ﬁrst half of the year, we have already
realized approximately 80% of the total capital gains expected for the full year, as already
indicated as of the end of March.
In more detail, slide number six provide you with a breakdown of the ﬁnancial services
business unit revenues. The major key points here are the following. First, returns on
current account deposit, higher revenues are mainly due to the already-commented
higher capital gains, along with increase in our average deposits. Second, fees from
postal savings collection, the reduction is attributable to lower fees as a consequence of
lower recognized communication marketing costs.
Third, fees from transaction banking, the 1% increase recorded in the second quarter
substantially oﬀset the already-commented Q1 reduction, which was mainly related to the
public broadcaster's decision to adopt a new payment system for license fees.

Bloomberg Transcript

Fourth, distribution fees. We recorded a very strong growth in personal loans and other
personal ﬁnancing products. Let me underline that this represents an area of strategic
growth, which is mainly based on the recently-renewed oﬀer range supported by an
important marketing campaign.
Fifth, payment card fees, the increase is mainly due to the already-commented impact of
the Visa Europe disposal. Net of these eﬀects, fees decreased by about 3%, partially
recovering the Q1 reduction, which was related to lower subscription fees applied to debit
(8:10) and prepaid cards due to a cap (8:14) in the interchange fees decided by the
European Union.
To conclude on these charts, I would like to underline that excluding the Visa Europe
impact, ﬁrst-half 2016 revenues are up 1.7% versus the previous years. Let me also remind
you once again that on this business unit, we keep on remaining fully focused on stability,
on revenues and proﬁtability.
Let's now move to slide number seven. Regarding our active portfolio management, let
me point out the following major items. Average deposits of BancoPosta account grow to
€48 billion from €45 billion in 2015, up almost 7%.
Our realized capital gains amount to €4.2 billion, vis-à-vis €3.5 billion of the previous year,
mostly as a consequence of lower interest rates despite higher B2B to boom (9:18)
spreads recorded over the period.
Let's now move to BancoPosta regulatory framework and capital position on slide number
eight. Inasmuch as BancoPosta capital adequacy is concerned, let me stress four major

Page 3 of 18

FINAL

key points. First, BancoPosta regulatory framework continues to be fully aligned to
European standards.
Second, ﬁrst-half 2016 Tier 1 ratio reached 16%, substantially doubling the minimal
regulatory requirements. Third, ﬁrst-half 2016 leverage ratio stands at 2.9% as a
consequence of higher assets under management. Should the growth of BancoPosta
asset under management continue, we are, in any case, prepared to recapitalize
BancoPosta with no impact on our dividend policy.
Fourth, ﬁrst-half proﬁtability recorded a remarkable 36% return on equity versus 31% for
the full-year 2015. Without considering the already-mentioned Visa eﬀect, return on equity
is 33%. All of this, coupled with a zero lending risk proﬁle, makes BancoPosta a unique,
superior return fee-based revenues player in the Italian ﬁnancial industry.
Let's now move to insurance and asset management on slide number nine. Gross written
premium increased by 11%, driven primarily by the continued increase of our life business,
conﬁrming Poste Vita as the number-one life insurance in the Italian market. Moreover, we
have also beneﬁted from double-digit growth, even if from a small base, in our non-life
oﬀering premiums, whose results will become more and more material going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

Inasmuch as asset management operations are concerned, let me underline that asset
under management increased by close to 16%, reaching over €6 billion, conﬁrming this
area as one of our key strategic growth pillars.
With regards to our investment portfolio breakdown, let me highlight the increase of
investment in multi-asset funds, which moved from 8% in 2015 to 11% in 2016, conﬁrming
our diversiﬁcation strategy towards a more adequate risk to return proﬁle. This, of course,
continue to be fully aligned with our capital requirements. Let's now move to slide
number 10 on the mail and parcel business unit.
On volumes, let me highlight here, on the one hand, traditional mail volumes fell 10%
year-on-year, while revenues decreased about 3.5%, as a consequence of the positive
pricing eﬀect as a result of the new regulatory framework in place since October the 1,
2015. On the other hand, parcel volumes increased by 14% year-on-year, accelerating
versus Q1, conﬁrming the positive momentum, mainly driven by the growing e-commerce
penetration in Italy. Revenues increased more than 7%, mainly thanks to the improvement
of our oﬀering range, which partially counterbalanced the ongoing pricing pressure
within the industry.
Moving to slide number 11, ﬁrst, let me remind you that that infra (12:55) segment
revenues increased by approximately 8%, mainly due to higher revenues driven by capital
gain and the Visa disposal eﬀect recorded by the ﬁnancial service business unit as well as
higher gross written premium collection.
At the same time, operating costs have decreased by 0.7% period-over-period, thanks to
our continuing cost management actions. Speciﬁcally, mail and parcel operating costs
have been further reduced by €29 million over the period, mainly as a result of lower cost
Page 4 of 18



Company Name: Poste Italiane SpA
Company Ticker: PST IM Equity
Date: 2016-08-02

FINAL

of goods sold, which decreased almost 2%, primarily due to lower IT operational
expenses and lower cost on vehicles and logistics.
I will comment on overall labor cost dynamics in the following charts. Let me now move to
slide number 12 to discuss group operating costs. Focusing on our cost structure and
consolidated level, overall, group operating cost structure remains substantially stable.
The already-mentioned reduction in cost of goods sold has been partially compensated
by higher D&A related to previous years' CapEx. Let me conﬁrm here that we expect the
full impact of our new managerial action in terms of cost reduction to be fully
implemented starting from the year-end and onwards.
Let's move to slide number 13, labor costs remain substantially stable year-on-year at €3
billion. As you're fully aware of, we have already launched a voluntary pre-retirement plan,
and we expect about 5,000 people to leave the group through this plan by year-end. As
of the end of June, about 3,900 people have already signed up to this pre-retirement
scheme. We will therefore see the full impact on payroll in 2017, in line with our plan.

Bloomberg Transcript

In this regard, let me remind you that, as I have already indicated previously, we will
account for an amount in the region of €400 million as per our usual accruals on voluntary
personnel reduction incentive schemes only in the ﬁnal quarter of the year. As for 2016,
we will pursue further reduction in head count versus 2015. However, please bear in mind
that during the course of the year, we shall ﬁnalize the renegotiation of the national labor
contract.
Let's now run through our proﬁt and loss evolution below the EBIT line on slide number
14. Net income for the period equaled €565 million, recorded an increase of
approximately 30% from €435 million recorded in the ﬁrst half of 2015.
On top of the already-commented positive EBIT evolution from 2015 to 2016, this
performance is also related to net ﬁnancial income equal to €15 million. Taxes for a total
consideration of €293 million corresponding to a tax rate of about 34% in further
reduction versus 2015.
For the full-year 2016, we expect a normalized tax rate substantially in line with last year in
the region of 40%. As I said before, let me stress once more that the net income beneﬁt
from the already-mentioned Visa capital gain, which is subject to taxation in the region of
6%. That's why we have such a lower tax rate at the end of the semester.
Let's move on to slide number 15, commenting CapEx. The optimization of the overall
investment program for the period is part of the restructuring program. More speciﬁcally,
the majority of the investment program is mainly related to information technology and
digital platforms. The balance is related to a selected upgrade of facilities, construction
data center buildings and postal logistic operations.
Looking at the net ﬁnancial position on slide number 16, ﬁrst, let me highlight the positive
contribution of our funds from operation as the results of the already-commented
operating performance. On the other side, negative change in working capital is mainly

FINAL

due to the expected capital gain dynamics recorded during the ﬁrst half, including the
impact of Visa deal that will be absorbed in the second part of the year.
On the dividend and equity movement front, the €176 million inﬂow is the result of €620
million coming from our BancoPosta ring-fence capital and dividends from other
participations, partially compensated by payment of the dividend to our shareholders for
a total consideration of €444 million. On past receivable, we expect to complete the cash
in by year-end with a consequence relevant impact on the change in the working capital.
Thank you for your attention, and let me hand over to the CEO, Francesco Caio, for some
closing remarks. Francesco.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you very much, Luigi, and good evening to everybody on the call. It is just about
slightly more than a year since we ﬁrst came to the market to illustrate our company. We
positioned Poste, as you may remember, as a proﬁtable cash-generative platform with
value-creation potential through a combination of growth and transformation. Having for
each of the businesses we are in a clear understanding of the drivers of value, we believe
the results of the ﬁrst half provide a good evidence of our capability to deliver against this
strategy and this value proposition through a rigorous and disciplined execution.
And quickly, let me run through what I and we as a team consider the highlight of this ﬁrst
half and that particular alignment with our strategic priorities, starting from ﬁnancial
services. In his remarks, Luigi had already commented our focus on yield, proﬁtability and
return on equity. The ﬁrst half saw a return on equity well above the 30%. It's 36% if you
take into account the disposal of the Visa run-oﬀ. It is actually 33% without that impact.
We see stability in the NII combined with growth in current account deposit. We've seen
very material growth in personal loans as the result of the eﬀort we've put in to rearrange
the product that we're oﬀering and the material alignment of our systems, training and
advertising. And we continue in our digitization program where we have the beneﬁt of
more than 3.5 million apps downloaded in the Postepay App on mobile. So, strong
proﬁtability and stability of revenues.
In insurance and asset management, we highlighted growth as the key value driver, well,
we have delivered growth with an 11% in gross written premium in life. But as Luigi
mentioned, we're already seeing some interesting accelerating growth in non-life, which
is almost, albeit from a small base, recorded a 60% growth, whilst we continue to see
momentum in asset management with some good performance of the funds that we have
developed together with Anima as part of our partnership.
Finally, something that we are comforted by is the progress in mail and parcels. You've
seen the revenue declines substantially slowing as a result of two drivers: the impact of
positive re-pricing in correspondence in mail; and some real good traction in parcels,
where we see an opportunity to strengthen our position not just in the B2B, but
increasingly in the B2C as we leverage the prospect and the opportunity to have a postal

FINAL

network serving speciﬁc B2C traﬃc of small parcels driven by e-commerce that, as you
might have noticed, is beneﬁting from very substantial growth eventually in Italy as well.
We, at the same time, have started a deployment of the new delivery process. Some of
you might be familiar with what we described to the market as the alternate day deliveries
in low-density areas. The program oﬃcially got the rollout – the execution rollout at the
beginning of April, and we're pleased to report that notwithstanding the inevitable
learning process and ﬁne-tuning of the process, we are growing increasingly conﬁdent in
our ability to deploy these new systems. And as you have heard from Luigi, we continue in
receiving good signing from our people in terms of the voluntary retirement program
we're on.
So, let me wrap it up here. It's a good execution of a working strategy that is delivering
the growth that we're aiming at and, more importantly, continue to provide us with a cash
ﬂow to pay the dividends that I remind you Posta (22:45) for this year are targeting the
80% of our net proﬁt for the full year.
I would stop here and hand it over to Luca Torchia, our Head of Investor Relations, to
manage questions that you might have. Thank you.

Q&A

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Luca Torchia

{BIO 19160880 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you very much. We already started the (23:10) session. I understand that the
ﬁrst question is coming from Gianluca Ferrari, Mediobanca. So, please, Gianluca, go
ahead.

Q - Gianluca Ferrari

{BIO 15042989 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Three questions from my side. The ﬁrst one is if we
have any update on the potential acquisition in payment systems you mentioned a few
months ago.
The second one is that modeling personnel costs next year, we have basically three big
moving parts: the early retirement packages; the hiring; and you mentioned during the
speech the renewal of the national labor contract. Can you help us in understanding what
kind of change year-on-year in personnel costs we should expect for 2017?
The last question is 3,900 early retirements signed so far. What is your expectation for fullyear 2016 in terms of head count reduction? Thank you.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

So, Gianluca, this is Luigi. Well, so far, we do not have any update on the acquisition side.
Of course, as we said many times, this is one area of interest. But as of now, we do not
have any update. When it comes to the personnel costs, I do conﬁrm what I said before.

Page 7 of 18



Company Name: Poste Italiane SpA

Date: 2016-08-02

First of all, we are targeting for the current year 5,000 people in terms of exit from the
group on the basis of this voluntary retirement program.

FINAL

We said that we are going to see the full impact in terms of proﬁt or loss on the cost side
next year. On average, the cost of one person is in the region of €40,000, €45,000, so
you can imagine what we are talking about.
We have also to consider one element, which is not irrelevant. There might be some
absorption costs related to some temporary injection, because, on one hand, we have the
exit of the people on the basis of the age. But on the other hand, we are also adapting
our organization. So there might be a sort of time delay in fully beneﬁting the reduction of
the work force. But I would say that the 5,000 next year should start producing full eﬀect,
as we said.
National labor contract, the contract will be negotiated and ﬁnalized if everything goes
right. Of course, it's not only on our side. It is expected to be discussed during the course
of this year. We do not make any projection at this level for obvious reasons. So I think that
– we are assuming that starting from next year, we should see anyway the positive impact
of our workforce reduction even after the ﬁnalization of the national contract. But of
course, I cannot be more speciﬁc there than that.

Q - Gianluca Ferrari

{BIO 15042989 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank you.

A - Luca Torchia

{BIO 19160880 <GO>}

The next question is coming from Mr. Mike Werner from UBS. Please, Mike, go ahead.

Q - Michael Werner

{BIO 4790902 <GO>}

Thank you. I've got two questions. First, on the unit-linked business that you established I
believe during the quarter, I was wondering if you could disclose anything about the sales
and inﬂows that you saw during the quarter from that business.
And then second, on mail, actually, I guess two sub-questions here. One, we did see a
downtick in terms of volumes for mail in the second quarter versus the ﬁrst quarter and
we did see something similar, I think, last year. So, there appears to be some seasonality. I
was wondering if you could help explain the seasonality of the business as well as what
we should see in the second half. And then secondly in the mail and parcels business, we
did see parcels volumes up around 14%, but revenues attributed to this part of the
business was up only 7%. So, I was just wondering if this was a mix shift or if this was a
result of declining pricing potentially due to a competitive environment. Thank you.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

Well, let me start by – from the second question related to the mail, speciﬁcally. Yes,
you're right, if we look at the volumes dynamic in the second quarter, yes, we're talking
about – if I'm not wrong, about 11% decline versus 2015. But also, if we look at the second
Page 8 of 18

Date: 2016-08-02

FINAL

half of the year in 2015 and therefore, if we assume that 2016 is going to follow the same
trend, well, the second half is normally better than the ﬁrst part. So, we should expect – we
have a sort of seasonality. You have to consider that normally and particularly in the last
quarter, we see an increase in volumes because of Christmas, because of the holidays, of
the period. So, the trend should be like that.
When it comes to parcel, the fundamental point is that it is true that we have seen an
increase of about 14% in the ﬁrst half of this year; 18%, by the way, in the second quarter. If
we transform this into revenues, on average, in the ﬁrst half of the year, we have seen an
increase of 7%. But if we look at the revenues in the second quarter, this number goes up
to about 11%. What does that mean? Means that what exactly Francesco was saying
before, so we are working in managing our contracts, and we start seeing some positive
impact in terms of price dynamics. The sector is under pressure, but we have seen
diﬀerent dynamics. So, we are not so far, in particular in the second quarter, to see a sort
of convergence between the dynamic of the growth of revenues versus the growth of
volumes. We are not yet there, but we're working to turn completely into revenues the
growth that we see in the volumes.
When it comes to the unit-linked, the question, if I'm not wrong, was how much we're
talking about in the ﬁrst half of the year, about €500 million.

Q - Michael Werner

Thank you.

A - Luca Torchia

{BIO 19160880 <GO>}

Thank you. The next question is coming from Mr. Alberto Villa, Intermonte.

Q - Alberto Villa

{BIO 16005221 <GO>}

Good afternoon. A few questions from my side as well. The ﬁrst one is on the Atlante 2
project. Can you comment a little bit more in details what is, I mean, your commitment in
terms of eventually taking part to this project?

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

We are looking at this through our subsidiary, Poste Vita. As you remember, Poste Vita was
a member of Atlante 1 with €260 million. As you know, the closing of Atlante 2 at the
moment is forecast to be by August the 8. We see through Poste Vita an opportunity to
reallocate some of our assets in line with our asset strategy evolution. And therefore, we
will be ﬁnalizing terms, conditions and the amount of participation in the next few days if
all the compliance and the ﬁnancial criteria that we adopt through Poste Vita for
investment are there.

Q - Alberto Villa

{BIO 16005221 <GO>}

Right. The investment you made in the ﬁrst, I mean, vehicle, is that, let's say, an indication
of what you could eventually invest in the second vehicle?

A - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

Probably, it's going to be less than that. But as I said, it would be ﬁnalized in the next few
days based on the closing process that is run by the partner (31:59).

FINAL

Q - Alberto Villa

{BIO 16005221 <GO>}

Thank you. And the second one, I don't know if you can comment, but there were rumors
on the press about the fact that board of directors today could have taken into
consideration the timing and, let's say, some of the details about the potential placement
of the treasury stake that is expected by the end of the year. I don't know if there is
anything that you can share with us at this point in time.

A - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

We can only conﬁrm that we're working with our key shareholder, the treasury, in the
execution of their plan that, as you know, they have published with the objective of having
a second tranche of their equity listed on the Stock Exchange by the end of this year.

Q - Alberto Villa

{BIO 16005221 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. The last one, if I may, is more of a business question on the industrial (32:56)
side. Given the level of interest rates and their investment rate you are now facing due to
the market conditions, would you think to slow down the new business into the life
traditional policies? And compared to when you drafted the business plan, do you think
that the proﬁtability could be – when you ﬁnish to harvest the capital gain, could be a little
bit lower due to the investment rate environment – the interest rate environment or not?

A - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

Well, as we said, we see life insurance still as a growth opportunity. We have a solvency
ratio of almost 400%, which is well in excess of the minimum requirements. We carry on
behalf of our customers an unrealized capital gain of about €12 billion.
And we continue to believe that we are competitively positioned to continue to explore
growth whilst we are gradually reallocating our capital, whilst we build the platform and
the base to diﬀerentiate our asset management capability in other products. So, we feel
very comfortable with continued growth in the sector.

Q - Alberto Villa

{BIO 16005221 <GO>}

Also, on the banking side, I mean, running oﬀ the capital gains would not create a major
drop in the prospective proﬁtability.

A - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

Well, we have been very clear throughout, we have on the – Luigi was very clear, we
continue to beneﬁt from carry in excess of €4 billion of annualized capital gains. You've
seen at the other end of the spectrum, the growth, albeit from a small base, that we're
beneﬁting from in ﬁnancial product distribution.

Page 10 of 18

Therefore, we feel we have all the time in the coming years to develop alternative sources
as we continue to beneﬁt from the NII that we have indicated in the region of $2 billion as
an element of our P&L.

Q - Alberto Villa

{BIO 16005221 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you very much for the answers.

A - Luca Torchia

{BIO 19160880 <GO>}

Thank you. The next question is coming from Martin Leitgeb, Gold – at (35:28) Goldman
Sachs.

Q - Martin Leitgeb

{BIO 17568539 <GO>}

Yes. Hello. Good afternoon. Three questions on my side. The ﬁrst one is just on the
dividend, dividend policy and the capital gains. If you can just conﬁrm, so the dividend
policy, 80% payout, will be based on the reported net income, or will it strip out capital
gains? And also along the same lines, whether you expect or whether we should expect
any further sizeable deals – material deals in the second half of the year?

Bloomberg Transcript

Second question is on the mail side. So, looking at the volume evolution of mail, while the
total numbers are falling by 10%, it seems to me that the high-value items such as
unrecorded mail and recorded mails are falling by only 1% to 2% in the ﬁrst half of the
year despite the price increases. Are you seeing there a little bit of a change in trend? Are
we hitting, in a way, the bottom for this type of mail at the current levels? And perhaps if
you could give us a little bit of color for what you expect for the second half.
And then lastly, third question will be more on the ﬁnancial services. So, in the second
quarter, there seems to be some change in the patterns of your asset gathering; a bit less
life insurance on a quarterly basis, a bit more third-party distribution which has run quite
nicely. Now, what should we expect for the second half of the year? Now, clearly, the
trends of the ﬁrst quarter and the second quarter are quite diﬀerent. So, could you give us
some color about what should we expect for the second half of the year? Thank you.

Dividend.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

... what dividend policy is applied? The 80% is applied to the reported net income.
Therefore, that will be the number including this Visa capital gain. Then I think when it
comes to that (37:23), Francesco, if you want to...

When it comes to the mail side, well, I said something about before, because if we look at
the seasonality eﬀect, we should expect in the second quarter of the year some slowdown
in the decline. I don't know if it's too early to say that we are close to the bottom. I think it
is too early. The positive message, I think, is that the revenues are showing resilience, the
decline in revenues is in the region of 3%. And this is deﬁnitely very positive as an
outcome of the change in the regulatory framework.
So, let's see the second half of the year. For sure, it looks a little bit better than what we
should assume, but it is too early to say. I would be very prudent when it comes to the
conclusion. Let's wait a couple quarters ﬁrst.

Bloomberg Transcript

When it comes to the ﬁnancial services, well, I think the trend that you have described is
taking place. We expect in the second part to deliver on the positive sign an increase in
fees of the distribution of personal loan, for instance, where we have reported a very
robust ﬁrst-half results. In terms of size, we have seen an increase of about 49% versus the
previous year, which has been producing to an increase of 23% in terms of fees. So it's
doing quite well.
And we expect substantial stability when it comes to the other element, i.e. the revenues
related to the active portfolio management in the region of €2 billion. As I said during the
presentation, 80% of the total capital gain plans have been already released, so we are
just looking for a remaining portion of about €100 million to be ﬁnalized in the second
part of the year. So, I think we are basically there.

Q - Martin Leitgeb

{BIO 17568539 <GO>}

Thanks. Sorry. On life insurance, quite a diﬀerent trend in Q2 versus Q1?

A - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

I would look at the two quarters combined.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

And as I was saying before, life insurance continues to be the center of gravity, if you wish,
of the insurance management side. Obviously, we're very pleased to see that the funds
that we've put on our shelves, some of them developed with Anima, are gaining traction
along the lines of the gradual migration of the revenue mix we expect. But it's more of a
mid- to long-term mix shift than something that we would regard as imminent in the
second half.

Good afternoon to everybody. A couple of clariﬁcations on the quarterly results. If I'm not
mistaken, you mentioned that you plan to unlock something like €100 million of trading
proﬁts in the second half of the year. Is this correct? And if you can share with us what was
booked in the ﬁrst half? If I'm not mistaken in the Q1, you had something like €380 million.
So if you can share with us what was the Q2 contribution?

Bloomberg Transcript

The second question is a more a strategic ﬂavor. The ﬁrst one is on Poste Mobile. We read
some rumors on the press reporting of a possible disposal process of this business unit. If
you can give us a little bit more indication on these.
And the last one again on your strategy, you do have a strong (41:16) in the processing
business, in the document management business as well. You do have also strong labor
force, which are all elements, which, in my view, ﬁt quite well with the possible –
increasing the volume in the NPL business, where we learn that there is a lot of document
management business that is involved. And I was wondering whether this can be for Poste
Italiane a possible business opportunity going forward. Thank you.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

So, let me cover the ﬁrst question. Yes, I conﬁrm that we are targeting another €100
million by the end of the year. At the end of June, we are at about €380 million in terms of
capital gain related to the active portfolio management, to which you have to add the
€120 million Visa. So without the Visa, we are talking about the active portfolio
management. We have reported €380 million in line with what we have reported in the
ﬁrst quarter. So we are projecting €480 million by the end of the year. That's the number.
Francesco, I don't know if you want to cover...

A - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

On Poste Mobile, we have read what you have read. We continue to be very happy with
that asset. There are no news on that front. And then there was the question on NPL. Well,
we have present in – as you were saying, in document management and in that kind of
thing, but we take a fairly broad view as an opportunity. We do not have at the moment
any speciﬁc plan to build just on that particular business. We regard that business as one
of the many industries we're serving, and we continue to believe that we have a very

Thank you. We have now Ms. Fulin Liang, Morgan Stanley.

Q - Fulin Liang

{BIO 21126177 <GO>}

Hi. I have two questions please. The ﬁrst one is about the product. So, the question is
actually what's the proﬁtability diﬀerence between your unit-linked product and the
traditional life insurance product? And if I understand your traditional product was by –
you can earn 100 bps spread at the minimum. Is that the same for unit-linked products?
And also, what's the average guarantee rate of your current and traditional life product
portfolio? I'm sorry if the question is a bit long, but is on the product side. And the second
one is, could you actually give us a bit of comments on how the interest rate – the low
interest rate is going to impact your pension – your staﬀ pension scheme costs? And that's
the two questions. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

So, let me start from the second question. We do not have, as a managed team, a private
pension scheme, and we are not for now oﬀering to our customer pension scheme –
pension products. What could impact the remuneration, the return for our customer is in
particular the dynamic of the spreads or, if you want, of the interest rate.
As Francesco said before, we have about €12 billion of unrealized gain as of today. And
this number, I would say, can change in particular if we have a signiﬁcant change in the
CDS or in the spread between the Italian – 10 years B2B and the boom (45:38), or if there
is a change in the interest rate.
In such a case, you might see a reduction in the stated gain. But according to the current
scenario, the €12 billion are expected to remain substantially stable. And therefore – and I
go to one of your questions, we are in a position to oﬀer our customers a return on
average in the region of 1.5% to 2%, I would say.
As of the 1st of July 2015, we guarantee basically zero return. The average portfolio
guarantee is in the region of 1.1%. When it comes to the fee that we gain when we oﬀer
products like the traditional one, well, we have an upfront fee of 2% and we have a
recurring fee in the region of 0.8%, 0.9%.
When it comes to the unit fees, we have an upfront of 0.9%, so basically 50% of the
traditional one. And a recurring a little bit higher in the region of 1.1%, 1.2%. I think those

are the numbers. Thank you.

FINAL

Okay. Thank you. Sorry, my second question is just – sorry for the confusion. My second
question is about your staﬀ pension cost, not the pension product you provided to the
customer. It's about your internal pension scheme.

A - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

Next question is now from Anna Adamo, Autonomous Research (47:44).

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Anna Adamo

{BIO 16893946 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. My ﬁrst question relates to the revenue coming from
the postal savings business. I can see there has been a material growth (47:53) reduction
in revenues year-on-year in €2 billion of outﬂows from the stock of postal savings quarter
on quarter. And also the fee margin has dropped by at (48:06) 45 basis points versus the
52 basis points that you have previously guided. And will you give a bit more color
around this business and what we should be expecting in terms of fee margins from
postal savings?
And the second question is if you can just give us an update on the Solvency II position of
Poste Vita, that would be great. Thank you.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

So, this is Luigi. Let me start from the ﬁrst question. Let me clarify a little bit the numbers
related to the postal savings. First of all, the number that we have reported when we talk
about the stock under administration on our side, they include also the interests in the
period, which are not subject to fee, of course, and therefore to revenues from the CDP.
There are no change in terms of fee, so we are talking about 52 basis points, applied to
the stock net of the interest. There is a diﬀerence versus previous year, because this year
we had lower revenues related to the recognition of marketing expenses that we have not
basically recorded, because we have not spent the money. So you have minus revenues,
minus costs in terms of margin. The eﬀect is the same.
There is a little bit of pressure. We have seen in the ﬁrst half of this year a trend which is
substantially in line with the previous year. The dynamic has been a little bit diﬀerent. The
ﬁrst quarter has been very positive because of an increase that we have seen in the postal
savings. We had a decrease in the second quarter. But year-on-year, we are basically in
Page 15 of 18



Company Name: Poste Italiane SpA

line. The fee is the same. The diﬀerence is related to the lower recognized cost, as I said
before.
When it comes to...

FINAL

A - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

Solvency II.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

...an update of Solvency II, what we have reported 404% at the end of last year. As of
June, we are not very far. We are in the region of 385%, so deﬁnitely very robust and
solid. As you have seen also in the chart that I reported which is related to the invested
capital, the incidence of the (50:41) has declined, about 73%. We had an increase of
bonds and some unit-linked products in particular, which of course absorbed a little bit
more capital. But I think we are deﬁnitely in a good shape with the ratio which is very
close to 400% even at the end of June. So, as I said before, as Francesco said, we have
margin for increasing our risk appetite proﬁle.

You're welcome.

A - Luca Torchia

{BIO 19160880 <GO>}

Thank you. The next question is coming from Michael van Wegen, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch.

Q - Michael van Wegen

{BIO 6435238 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Good evening, guys. One question. Looking at your ﬁnancial services business,
we see quite strong growth in the average deposit base from €45 billion to €48 billion in
six months. To what degree is that driven by your own eﬀorts to grow that or to what
degree is that a ﬂight to safety? And how do you expect this to develop going forward
given the situation in the Italian banking sector? And I guess, related to that, to what
degree do you think you can redirect that – those deposits into, yes, richer-margin
products? Thank you.

A - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

Well, there is no doubt that there is a component of ﬂight to safety. We are a very robust,
ﬁnancially sound company. People know it. We've been traditionally associated with the
notion of trust, proximity, and therefore, it's not surprise that given the evolution, this is
what we've seen. But in fairness, we've seen also somehow diﬀerent dynamics on the
postal savings. There was a surge at the beginning of the year, whilst these surges now

FINAL

kind of go back to normal, whilst the current account deposit seems to be substantially
stickier than other products.
And as a combination of digitization of processes, the reduction in time for queuing our
oﬃces, a broader range, and let's not forget that there are some cross-selling impact and
some lowering churn (52:53) impact through the development we're seeing in the
personal loans, for instance. They tend to go hands-in-hands with a stronger loyalty and
the more opportunity to do business with us. We're also seeing at the same time growth
in people and customers that have with us, more than 75,000. And therefore, it's part of a
combination of the eﬀort we're making to upgrade our position in the market and
broadening the appeal of BancoPosta.
Bear in mind that this is an interesting news just in terms of, if you wish, a benchmark of
how well we're doing in money gathering, but also has obviously some impact on P&L
and cash ﬂow, because we tend to invest this deposit, as you know, by statutory
requirements into European government-backed bonds. And if you take an average of
1.3%, 1.4% (54:01) yield that we can do with this portfolio, this is all good news.

Bloomberg Transcript

My last point is that contributing to this growth is also the very healthy development of
Postepay evolution, which is some of you are familiar with that. The upgrade of our precharge debit card where people can have payment transactions, they have their salary
debited and all the rest of that, so – credited, rather. It is – for all intents and purposes, it's
an entry point for a current account that is proving very popular. We sold more than 2.5
million of these cards in about two years.
And that's because the number of transaction per card is higher. The number of – the
amount of money that people tend to preload on this charge is higher that is having an
impact that all-in-all adds to another probably slightly more than €1 billion in terms of
deposits.
So, it's a combination of the very massive eﬀort we are deploying in our ﬁnancial services
to position ourselves as a trust and reputable leader in transaction banking.

Yes. Sorry. Very, very quick one. You clariﬁed that the one-oﬀ gain from Visa is
distributable proﬁts. I understood you have a legal dispute underway with H3G. They are
asking you a compensation of approximately €100 million, and I think Tar (55:37) is due to
present a verdict soon. Any chance a negative verdict could lead you to provision €100
million, and that might negatively oﬀset the €120 million one-oﬀ gain from Visa?
