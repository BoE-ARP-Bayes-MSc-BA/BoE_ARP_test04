{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Linda. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call.
We're pleased to do announce a very good quarter on all fronts. After-tax operating
income for the quarter was $197 million, comparable with the prior year. Our annualized
operating return on average common equity was 15.6% for the quarter, and our diluted
book value per share increased 4.5%. Our result benefited from strong contributions from
both underwriting and investments, continued strong premium growth globally, favorable
reserve developments, and a relatively light catastrophe and weather activity in the
quarter.

FINAL

For the nine months, we reported a combined ratio of 90.5%, operating income of $4.08
per diluted share compared to $3.67 in the prior year, an operating ROE of 12.1%,
reflecting ongoing strong performance.
Back to the quarter. Our gross premiums written were up 7% with both segments
contributing. This is the result of our continued efforts on three fronts. First, we have
amplified our activities and showed strong growth in improving market segments
particularly in the US. Second, we're seeing ongoing returns from the substantial
investments we made in new initiatives of recent months and years. And finally, we
continue to be disciplined in the selection of risks we are prepared to assume in a
competitive market.

Bloomberg Transcript

For the quarter and for the year-to-date, our accident year loss ratio, excluding
catastrophes, was 56%. That ratio was up over the prior year quarter due to differences in
mix and to a lesser extent claims activities and improved views of loss trends in certain
lines. However, for the year-to-date, which is more relevant, the ratio improved a little
over a point, reflecting margin expansion in lines that benefited from improved
experience and rate increases, and various actions taken to optimize our portfolio.
Over the last couple of years, we've made significant progress in growing lines of
business which would help to reduce our overall portfolio volatility. Some of these lines
may have higher loss ratios than our historical product mix. However, they contribute
meaningfully to improvement in our overall risk-adjusted returns. Our ongoing efforts to
reshape our catastrophe portfolio have a similar positive effect. We believe our risk
selection, combined with our diligent attention to portfolio construction, will continue to
deliver significant returns for our shareholders.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.

Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Thank you, Albert and good morning everyone.
During the quarter, we generated strong results with an annualized operating ROE of
15.6%. In addition, quarterly diluted book value per common share increased by $1.93 per
share, or almost 5% in the quarter. Our results benefited from growth in our book of
business and continued favorable prior-year reserve development, which was partially
offset by natural catastrophes and weather-related losses which, although light compared
to expectations, were higher when compared to the same period of last year. Valuation
improvements on an available for sale investment portfolio due primarily to the strong
results from our other investment portfolio and the positive impact of spread tightening
on our high yield fixed maturity holdings also contributed to the growth in our diluted book
value per share.
Moving into the details of the income statement, our Third Quarter gross premiums
written increased 7% to more than $900 million with growth emanating from both of our
segments. In our insurance segment, our top line was up $45 million, or 9%, reflecting a
Page 3 of 21

FINAL

continuation of the trends noted in the first half of the year. The liability line was our
strongest contributor. Growth in our professional lines business reflects our continued
global expansion. Property benefited from rate increases as well as new business, which
significantly exceeded the continued reduction of cat-exposed business written through
MGAs. The accident health line continued to contribute to the top line growth during the
quarter, bringing the year-to-date increase in growth written premiums to almost $90
million. On the other hand, we had minor reductions in aviation and marine lines.
In reinsurance, our top line was up $12 million, or 4%. Growth was driven by professional
lines, mainly reflecting selected new business, with agriculture continuing to contribute.
These increases were partially offset by decreases in property and motor, relating to a
number of factors including premium adjustments and a reduction in reinstatement
premiums received.
Our consolidated net premiums written were up 10% exceeding the growth rate for gross
premiums written. Similar to prior quarters, the difference is driven by a number of factors,
with changes in reinsurance purchasing in our insurance segment having the biggest
impact. This included reductions in the quarter-share session rates for significant portion
of our professional lines and liability books, a reduction in the cost of our property per risk
and property cat protections, and higher retentions for both property and marine.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our net premiums earned were up 10% for the quarter, with growth in insurance and
reinsurance driven by our accident and health and agriculture initiatives respectively.
Our Third Quarter consolidated current accident-year loss ratio increased 3.2 points to
61.5%, compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the increase in the
frequency of natural catastrophe and weather-related events and a change in the mix of
our business, with a proportional shift towards lines that incur a higher loss ratio, such as
agriculture. In insurance, the current accident-year loss ratio increased 1.3 points to 55.9%.
This increase in the accident-year loss ratio during the Third Quarter of 2013 was primarily
due to the change in our business mix. For the year-to-date 2013, the current accident
year loss ratio for insurance is 63.8%, up slightly from 62.2% for the comparable period of
2012, largely reflecting the increase in the natural catastrophe and weather related events
in the first half of the year.
The Third Quarter current year loss ratio for reinsurance segment was up 5 points to
66.6%, primarily attributable to catastrophe and weather-related losses. We recognize $51
million of natural cat and weather-related losses, net of reinstatements, relating to a
number of worldwide loss events, namely European hail storms, $15 million, Mexican
floods, $15 million, Toronto floods, $15 million, and Colorado floods, $3 million. These
contributed 10.5 points to the accident-year loss ratio, whereas in 2012, net losses related
to US drought conditions and Hurricane Isaac contributed 5.9 points. An additional factor
that contributed to the variance was the change in the business mix with a significant
growth in our agriculture line which again incurs a higher loss ratio.
For the first nine months of the year the current accident-year loss ratio for reinsurance
increased by 0.9 points to 63.5%, with the same factors contributing as described in the

Page 4 of 21

FINAL

quarterly comment above. During the quarter, our results continued to benefit from net
favorable prior-year development, which aggregated to $80 million. Short-tail classes in
both segments contributed $57 million of that balance, primarily reflecting better than
expected loss emergence.
In addition, we continue to give weight to actuarial methods that reflect our favorable
experience for the liability reinsurance business which contributed a further $26 million of
favorable development for the quarter, and to our reinsurance professional lines, which
contributed $10 million reflecting lower ultimate loss estimates for years 2009 and prior.
The favorable experience was partially offset by adverse development in our credit and
surety line of $15 million, which follows recent claims activity on certain European bond
exposures.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Third Quarter reflected a steady acquisition cost ratio, while our G&A expense ratio
decreased 0.8 points to 14.8%. While our total G&A costs increased primarily due to
increased head count, as we continue to build out our global platform, from a ratio
perspective, this was more than offset by the growth in our net earned premium during
the quarter.
Net investment income was $103 million from the quarter, up from Second Quarter's $83
million, and very similar to the $104 million of the Third Quarter of last year. Once again,
the most significant driver of the change in net investment income quarter to quarter was
the performance of our other investment portfolio which contributed $32 million to this
total versus $12 million last quarter and $34 million in the Third Quarter of last year. The
majority of our other investment portfolio is hedge funds which benefited from the strong
equity markets during the Third Quarter.
Income from our fixed maturity portfolios, including cash and short term investments,
remain steady at $75 million for the quarter similar to last year's $76 million and $73 million
in the prior year quarter. The yield to maturity for our fixed maturity portfolio declined
modestly from 2.4% to 2.2% during the quarter, due primarily to some spread tightening
and a reduction in the duration of our portfolio from 3.5 years to 3.2 years. In the
aggregate, the total return of our cash and investment portfolio for the quarter was 1.4%,
inclusive of foreign exchange impact. The primary drivers of return were spread tightening
on some of our fixed maturity holdings and strong returns from our equity and hedge
funds holdings.
We continue to hold a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio, with cash and investment
assets totaling $14.8 billion at September 30, up approximately 0.5 billion from June 30
and a year ago. Our fixed maturity weighted average credit rating remains unchanged at
AA-.
Our total capital at September 30, 2013, was $6.8 billion consistent with our capital
position at year-end. Net income generated during the year and a net increase in our
preferred share capital from transactions during the first half of the year were offset by
common share repurchases and dividends and the decrease in unrealized gains and
investments due to an upward shift in sovereign yield curves during 2013.

During the quarter, as we discussed with you in the last call, we halted the repurchase of
our shares under the authorized share repurchase plan as we went through the Atlantic
wind season. We currently have $409 million of remaining authorization for future
repurchases and expect to resume repurchasing shares this quarter. During September
2013, AmVest upgraded the financial strength rating of each of our principal operating
insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to a financial strength rating of A+ superior. As you
know, this is the second highest rating that this agency awards, and we are very excited
about the potential opportunity the increased rating brings to our franchise.
Our strategic expansion opportunities continue to progress, and we remain optimistic
about our prospects. We believe that our diversified global franchise and strong balance
sheet will continue to allow us to take advantage of market opportunities as they emerge.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Albert.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Joe. Looking forward, the overall insurance markets continue to improve on
average but with increasing variation by accounts, lines of business, and geographies. The
US continues to see the strongest improvements.
For our insurance business, average price increases are coming in at a slower pace than
that observed in the Second Quarter of this year. For our international division, rate activity
as a whole was flat, similar to last quarter. The specialty lines which comprise this division
were typically mixed. We anticipate continuous flat rate change with this division, with
decreases in some specialty lines -- in particular aviation, terrorism, and offshore energy
offsetting positive rate change in others. Offshore energy is gradually and modestly
coming off historical high pricing following the two-year period of benign losses.
Meanwhile onshore energy rates saw continuous modest improvements after a number
of large losses in recent quarters. As with the Second Quarter, property rates have
stabilized in this division.
In our professional line division, rate change was flat overall, but again, with wide
variations. For the US, pricing across all units was positive. On the other hand, the
Bermuda excess lines are seeing pressure, especially on five-day coverages. Classes
which have seen higher than expected claims activity in recent years are also seeing much
higher rate increases. For example, primary public D&O is seeing rate change in the order
of 7%. International professional lines face significant pressure. While professional lines
overall have not improved as much as we may have hoped for at the beginning of the
year, we expect continued slow improvement, with rate increases on primary layers
continuing to be more robust, and international professional lines under more pressure.
In our US division, all lines remain in positive rate territory, but a 6% rate change for the
division overall. While pricing momentum has slowed on property lines, our casualty
business continued with double digit rate improvement. This division is thriving in the
current environment, with new submissions up over 20% and good retentions.

The abundance of capacity addressing property business has taken the edge off a bit
after two years of rate improvement, but we're still seeing many attractive opportunities.
Within our reinsurance segment, underlying primary market conditions are a positive, but
increasing competition amongst reinsurers are such that some or in certain cases all, of
the improvements are staying with the cedants, leaving reinsurers with a generally stable
level of overall profitability on renewed business. The combination of new capital and the
advertised reduction in reinsurance purchasing from several large cedants should make
market conditions a bit more challenging as we enter 2014.
The unprecedented influx of capacity to the US property catastrophe market forced rates
down 10% to 20% in some cases. Pressure on rate extend to property and catastrophe
lines outside of Florida and the US, although not with similar severity. Size of competitive
pressures abound. Reinsurers have been more willing to offer expanded coverages,
including multiyear terms, private layers, and aggregate covers.

Bloomberg Transcript

Outside of property lines, the competitive landscape is also intensifying, as reinsurers
seek to expand their product offerings. Pressures on commission exist across the board
and as historically low (inaudible) continue, cedants are reviewing their buying strategies,
and generally containing more. Consolidation in reinsurance buying is resulting in more
multiline programs.
Despite these pressures, profitability generally remains good, and where necessary,
underlying primary rate improvements are accruing to the benefit of our treaties. Overall,
though, the market remains reasonable as I said, and we are confident in our ability to
navigate through the various issues. We have pricing systems in every line of business that
are focused on returns for every dollar of risk. When that return per dollar of risk is
adequate or attractive, we will deploy our capital to support our clients.
Underwriting excellence has been the hallmark of AXIS, and it remains our key strength
and differentiator in shifting markets. We are investing heavily to enhance our strong
underwriting culture and provide our underwriters with the tools and resources they need
to succeed. We're also adding improved data and analytics to meet our goals of
optimizing our portfolio, reducing earnings volatility while still delivering top tier returns.
Last month, the Lloyd's franchise board granted approval in principle for new AXIS
Syndicate 1686. This is yet another step in expanding our global underwriting platform to
deliver an efficient, globally diversified portfolio to our shareholders. This is the latest of a
number of initiatives this year introducing new product and expanding geographic
distribution.
Lastly, I could not conclude my prepared remarks without high lighting our recent upgrade
to an A+ by AmVest, which is not only a testament to strong track record of AXIS and our
favorable positioning, but also a key differentiating in expanding our targeted business in
what is currently a mixed market.
And with that, operator, I'd like to open the line for questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator

FINAL

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with a couple questions.
First is your own reinsurance buying? Obviously, you made some changes in general
retaining more of the business. Can you talk about what the plan might be for going
forward? Should we expect that net to gross ratio to continue to change? That's question
number one.
Question number two, on the investment side, can you talk about the new money yield
you're seeing available in the market relative to your portfolio yield?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Sure. Joe, why don't you take that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yes the last one Jay, we're attracting 2.2% in new money versus a book yield of 2.6%. So
the gap is widening a little bit from where it was in the Second Quarter.

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think on the reinsurance buying side, excuse me, Jay, I think there's a couple of factors.
The first is growth in lines of business where we don't buy reinsurance so, obviously, as
you see lines of business such as A&H that are predominantly kept net, that's going to
have on its own an impact on the cedent ratio.
The other area is in how we choose to optimize our various portfolios. So I think what
you've seen in the past and what you'll continue to see is an increase in our net retention
per risk on the various property-related lines, but probably more vying on catastrophe
side taking advantage of the terms available to manage our P&Ls, to manage our zonal
limits, and so on.
With regards to the professional lines and liability lines, we're liking the trends that we're
seeing on the professional lines, and we're likely going to be keeping those levels pretty
much where we are now. I think on the casualty lines, we're growing these relatively
strongly right now. We generally have a high session rate on those and overtime as that
book develops we are likely to keep a little bit more of that business.

A - Joe Henry

Page 8 of 21



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2013-10-31

The only thing I'll add to that is that a lot of these changes that we put in effect occurred
in March and April of this year and most of that has flown through our cedent written. But
not all of it has actually flown through all the cedent earned yet so we'll see a little bit of
that continue on into 2014.

FINAL

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

That's helpful. Thank you.

Operator
Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thanks. Joe, have you bought back any stocks so far in the Fourth Quarter?

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

No. We have not.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

So I'm just trying to understand. Again it was a light wind season, but you didn't -- you
didn't want to buy back stock and you talked about that on the Second Quarter call. But it
seems like just seems kind of unusual or I'm just trying to understand why you wouldn't
have bought back even like halfway through wind season some or following the end of
September when nothing occurred. Is there -- do you have a different plan in terms of
wanting to deploy the capital maybe at 1/1 or you want to hold the capital back to do
something else? I'm just trying to understand that change in posture.

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Well Mike, you know what happened last year in the Fourth Quarter in terms of wind
season. Not that we're afraid of that, but if you look at what we've done so far this year,
we've purchased 8.5 million shares, $360 million worth of stock.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Our operating income, less dividends, is $384 million. We're almost exactly on the plan
that we indicated to you before and we intend on following through on that in the Fourth
Quarter of the year.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

I see. Okay. So then that's -- so that's kind of the expectation is that maybe you pulled
forward the buy back in the Second Quarter and then you're going to wait to replenish
Page 9 of 21



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2013-10-31

FINAL

and adopt the same pattern on the four. Okay. That makes sense.
Then -- we've seen a lot of folks moving into crop this year. I'm just curious I'm guessing
that year over year price something maybe flattish despite last year's losses. First off, kind
of what is your outlook there. Is that an area where you want to continue to grow? What's
the competitive dynamic like on the reinsurance side? And if I could, what are your
expectations just given the decline in corn prices this year? Is that potentially going to
have any impact on your book? Thanks.

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think starting Mike with the market in general, there's been more people coming into it,
especially on the reinsurance side, as the primary companies this year. Following the
severe drought last year, we're looking to purchase more. Our experience is a little bit
different than what you mentioned in terms of pricing. I think you're right. Price something
flattish on the primary side but certainly on the excess and loss side especially in our lossimpacted accounts last year we certainly saw pricing increases and I expect that that will
stay.
In terms of the growth, I think that there is -- we have very well developed markets in the
US and some in Canada, but there's also in my mind real opportunity internationally. And
one of the things that we feel really good about is the fact that the team we brought in to
supplement the existing team that we already had in place, the team we brought in has
real expertise and real contacts, not only in terms of the US and North America market but
also internationally. So we think this market certainly still has opportunities both
domestically and internationally and I think in terms of international positioning we feel
very good about where we are right now.
With regard to the profitability of the year, it's looking in our mind and certainly reflective
of the numbers, it's an average year. We don't think it's a particularly highly attractive year.
We certainly don't see this as a loss year for the business. So we see this as an average
year in terms of profitability.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Great. Thank you.

Operator
Our next question comes from Gregory Locraft at Morgan Stanley.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Governing. Congrats on a nice quarter. What -- Albert, you mentioned the A+ and I'm just
-- I never thought of you guys as disadvantaged due to ratings. I'm just wondering what
does it open up in terms of lines of business? How will you run the business a little
differently? and maybe you can also talk about the Lloyd's initiative as well because again I
never thought it was something you had to have but now you've got both Lloyd's and an
A+ so what are you going to do with it?
Page 10 of 21

Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2013-10-31

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

FINAL

Well it hasn't hurt us, but it's good to have both. I think the short answer is that the A+
doesn't change the strength that we had the day before, the day after. But I think it's
great to have the recognition from the rating agencies for all of the hard work and
accomplishments that our people have done.
There is one area what I would say the A+ plus does make a difference, and that's in the
casualty and the long tails reinsurance business buyers of long tail reinsurance really care
about the ratings of the reinsurers they use and I know for a fact that the size of putting
them on the panel in the first place and the size of the allocations really do have -- are
really influenced by the A+. So I'd rather have it than not have it. I think it does provide
some benefits, and in our mind, it's nice to have an external validation for all of the good
work that we've done in our market positioning.

Bloomberg Transcript

With regard to Lloyd's, we absolutely did not need Lloyd's in the first phase of our life
cycle. We built a great international platform, we grew the business. Where we are right
now as we look to the next decade, where do we take this company to the next step?
This is just one more area, one more initiative in terms of diversifying our distribution
channels, expanding our geographic reach, and accessing new markets. So it's the right
thing for us at this stage of our life cycle, and I expect that it will provide us with greater
ease in accessing risks in certain areas of the world where we have not been licensed
previously and access to certain business that generally tends to stay in the Lloyd's
markets. We see both of these as a positive.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Yes. Certainly they are. Great. So just jumping back to Mike's question on the buy back
front, I just want -- I wanted to just clarify. So there's no change. You guys are going to
return 100% of op income this year in dividends and buy backs?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That was exactly Joe's point. We've given back through September 30 essentially 100%
of our operating income through dividends and repurchases. Our goal has been and
continues to be that we return pretty much close to 100% of our operating income in
dividends and repurchases. We will be reinitiating our repurchase program as soon as our
window opens. So we're right on target, we're right on plan, no change.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Sounds good. Sounds good. Okay. Great. Then last it's just you know, you guys are
fortunate because you have a balanced model globally, so you can go, you can sort of
access the risks that are most attractive whenever -- when you wish. Do you think we
could see a world next year where you're shrinking reinsurance and growing and growing
insurance, just given your pricing commentary? It seems that reason insurance is more
challenged than your primary lines. How do you think of it both from a top line and
margins perspective?

FINAL

Well Greg, I appreciate you saying it because that is in fact one of the great values we
have here access to both insurance and reinsurance markets, and we have them available
both domestically in the US and internationally. We don't have a preset view of how much
percentage of our top line needs to come from insurance or reinsurance or, from that
matter, international or the US. It's really about building the best portfolio that we can at
the time.
And with regards to the pressures that I've described earlier with regard to the
reinsurance market, there's no question that within the reinsurance market, there's
competition there. But at the end of the -- at the end of the day, the underlying markets
are still improving and some of those benefits are coming to us.
We will continue to write good business in the reinsurance market. At every renewal we
take a look at what the terms and conditions available to us are we mentioned earlier the
various tools that we have to look at profitability.

Bloomberg Transcript

I fully expect that we will continue to have a substantial and profitable business on the
reinsurance side. There may or may not as be as many new opportunities for growth in
the market itself, but as we've demonstrated to you, through the number of new
initiatives that we've created we're not waiting only on the market. We're creating new
opportunities for ourselves. The example we used last year was the fact that we were
getting into the agricultural business in a bigger way. We have started a US marine
reinsurance business. This year we added a weather and derivative units it our business.
We're expanding our presence in Asia.
We are masters of our own destiny. We find opportunities and although in reinsurance
markets are more competitive, I have every confidence that Jay and his team are going to
continue to do very well next year.

Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith from Evercore.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. The first question is just on the buyback and you've not said anything
different now versus before, but just curious. Your top line is growing double-digits and
yet to can buy back 100% of stock. Curious as to whether that's because you had lots of

excess capital before, or are you growing in lines of business that are diversifying, and so
therefore don't need as much capital?

FINAL

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think your second point is the more relevant point, which is that we are, in my mind,
doing an excellent job of diversifying the portfolio of making much more efficient use of
our capital, which is why -- and you and I have had this conversation before. I believe that
we can actually combine a lower volatility portfolio with sustained high ROEs.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. Second was a numbers question. In the primary insurance segment
we saw the G&A expenses shifting down sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Were there
one-time items this quarter that helped it and should we expect a lower run rate in the
future?

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Vinay, I'll dig out the insurance G&A ratio comparable in a second, but we did have one or
two one-time items in our overall expense structures and those get allocated down to our
businesses. Again, you saw an improvement in the G&A ratio overall that, as Albert was
saying, we're continuing to invest in the company. The reason our expense ratio went
down was really because of the growth in our premium relative to our expense growth.

Okay.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

So at the Investor Day, I think you talked about a 10% ROE, roughly given what's
happening in the reinsurance market, do you think that still is kind of ROE that the
company is writing business at?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yes, I think we frankly said that we can see the marginal business coming in at a 10% ROE.
In fact I would argue that with some of the pricing changes that we're seeing in higher

FINAL

underlying interest rates, we're seeing some improvements on that. But again with
regards to the reinsurance book, I would see two things. One is because notwithstanding,
as I mentioned, the competition and some higher ceding commission we're still getting
the benefit in many cases. So the underlying improvement, that's a net positive.
Secondly, as you know, the biggest driver of the E-piece is the catastrophe book, and by
balancing our catastrophe book, by removing some of the peaks in the catastrophe book
it ultimately resulted in a lower capital requirement for our overall reinsurance book such
that again I see the ROE on the reinsurance business, just like I do for the rest of the
company, moving in a favorable direction.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Vinay, I'll just come back on insurance. As you noted in the -- our expense ratio actually
dropped by about a point, but there is nothing unusual there. It's really just the growth in
earned premium year-on-year. The reinsurance segment expense ratio jumped up a bit,
but again Jay and team, through the new initiatives they're adding staff in that. So there's
nothing unusual in that expense number on the insurance side is what I'm trying to say.

Regarding the Lloyd's business, what's the expectation on what kind of business you
expect to write through that syndicate in premium volume maybe not this quarter, but
long-term?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well in the first instance the goal here is to transition some of our business that we're
already writing onto a Lloyd's platform and cede a syndicate, which is based on business
that we're currently writing mostly out of our London, Ireland, or Bermuda books, mostly
on the energy, the marine side, some property business. And so that will form the core. I
don't see this as an expansion into new lines of business. I see this more as an expansion
of our current lines of business into more international markets and more opportunities.

Q - Charles Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Okay. Just one numbers question.
In the reinsurance division, the acquisition ratio jumped up a bit. Should we think this is a -it's a bit over 22% now, as kind of a run rate from business mix shift or something unusual?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

It's a combination of a number of things. As you know, there are three things that affect
our ratios there. Obviously we mentioned earlier that in some cases ceding commissions
are up. You'll notice that there is a transition in our reinsurance book towards writing a little
bit more proportional. By definition proportional has a higher acquisition expense ratio,
generally more stable, but has a higher acquisition expense ratio. There is always a little
bit of noise in a quarter-by-quarter basis as it relates to sliding scale, profits, commissions,

Page 15 of 21

up or down, so on and so forth and that's really the three major pieces there. There isn't
anything there that I would think of as a seismic shift.

The next question comes from Ryan Byrnes of Janney Capital Markets.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everybody.
Quickly just on the underlying loss ratio in the insurance segment, you guys noted that
business mix played a factor there and I assume that's coming from the A&H growth. I'm
just trying to figure out going forward should we look for that underlying loss ratio to
continue to kind of be at the same levels going forward i.e., less improvement going
forward as the mix shifts with the A&H build out, but less volatility?

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good morning, Ryan.
As Albert indicated looking at loss ratios on a year-to-date basis is probably a better thing
to do than just looking at one quarter at a time. If you take out weather from our accident
year loss ratios, we've actually seen an improvement in insurance of 1.5 points during the
year. So as we indicated earlier in the year, we have some rate increases that were
expected to come through earned premium, and we would expect to see some
improvement in the margins and I think we are realizing that.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Then just quickly on this vantage surety stuff just want to -- were you guys
writing quote-share reinsurance or there was excess of loss? And was it all for multiple
years? Just trying to figure out where you guys have the exposure from?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Look, it's a combination of a number of things, but we did not have large quota shares,
matter of fact, I'm not sure of these things or significant and in case. And the $15 million
that we took is the combination of not only a small incremental reserving increase that
we're putting with regard to the Spanish bonds, but also just a little bit more money
across the board just for the additional uncertainty of legal risk, if you would, with regard
to European portfolio. So it's literally $7 million that are related to the Spanish bonds and
the rest is just more caution with regards to the regulatory environments in Europe.

Next question comes from Meyer Shields at KBW.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. Can I start with one on the P&L side, if you look at the major risk
I'm thinking of Southeastern hurricane and California and Japanese earthquake. There
wasn't much change in the 50-year, 100-year P&Ls but there was a pretty decent
sequential drop in the one in 250. Is there any way of sort of extrapolating from that, what
the reduced capital needs are?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I wouldn't try -- it's a -- when we do our capital is on a line by line, risk by risk and analysis,
we calculates -- you want to imagine we calculate all permutations of capital requirements
on a per risk basis, on a line of business basis, a stand-alone, diversified, and there is just
way too much in there to be able to extrapolate a specific percentage. But I -- the one
thing that I think is absolutely worth taking away from this is the management of the P&Ls
and the management of the diversification of the book of business is best that we are
today a much more efficient user of capital. Which is why, we can -- as Vinay brought up
earlier which is why we can grow a double-digit rates and still give back all of our
incremental capital to our shareholders.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. That makes sense. There was a bit of a slowdown in the insurance, accident and
health premium growth and I was wondering there is something significant going on there
just quarterly variation?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

If you look back at last year, the Third Quarter was by far the slowest production quarter
of the year. It's just a nature of that -- of that business of the Third Quarter is -- doesn't do
much. I think if you take a look at it on a nine month basis, the growth rate is very
impressive and continues to move forward. Chris and his team are doing a great job, they
know exactly what they need to do. And they are very focused on achieving their goals.

Page 17 of 21



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2013-10-31

Yes, Albert, just a couple of more questions on A&H business here, I'm wondering just, is
it possible to give a kind of a breakdown of what the impact of the mix shift some more
A&H and the insurance business had on the overall combined ratio?

FINAL

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Actually we do an analysis of all of the contributors and in fact and if you look at it, I
believe A&H is actually the single largest contributor to the increase to loss ratio for the
insurance division overall, both through a combination of mix and the fact that it's a higher
number.
So if we look at our A&H book, it was 9.6% of our premiums in the Third Quarter of 2012. It
was 13.7% of the premiums in 2013 quarter and that's in the mid-60s. So imagine the fact
that it's a higher ratio than the average of the premium for the insurance segment and it's
a much larger proportion of the earned premium and that's why it's having that impact on
these.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay, very helpful. Thank you. Then back on the A&H, at what grade is now the mix of
reinsurance versus primary and A&H business right now. And looking forward, how do we
expect that to continue to progress?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

As you will recall through our various presentations, reinsurance continues to be the larger
part of the book of business, but over time it needs to, our goal is to bring that business
down to 50% of the overall book, and this is the good time to kind of speak to where we
are in the various phases of our A&H business.
The reinsurance business is the part of the business that is easier to grow, you don't need
to have offices across the world, it's a more concentrated distribution mechanism. And in
fact not only have we grown faster on the A&H, but in fact we have already broken even
and made a profit on the reinsurance part of the A&H business.
The insurance business is a much slower business to pick up. You have to have all the
licenses in place, and I think we have shared with you some of the frustrations we've had
in getting all of those licenses in place that we have those now, it's the on the board
representation and it's the quoting on a risk-by-risk basis. So it's a slower ramp up and
again this is very consistent with the plan that we had in place.
We needed to have a better balance between insurance and reinsurance. We need to
have more granular risk-by-risk composition of our portfolio and I really view that as phase
two of our A&H strategy. Phase one was, get to the size of the business that will allow you
to at least break even, get the name out there, get the platform established. And I
continue to believe that we will have completed phase 1 by the end of 2014.

Page 18 of 21



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2013-10-31

And I think beyond that as you go from 300 to 500, it's much more of an insurance based
growth, it's much more of a risk by risk growth. Ultimately, lower expense ratios,
acquisition expense ratios on that part of the business. So where we are right now is in my
mind on plan with what we want it to be and where we need to be.

FINAL

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Brian, the one thing I will add is that, growth in insurance year-to-date last year was about
22% and growth -- I am sorry in the quarter was 22% and year-to-date basis, it's 118%. So
it's up to about 20% of our total premium across A&H and growing pretty rapidly.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great, very helpful. And just lastly Albert, I am just curious any opportunities with your A&H
business in the specialty health area with the Affordable Care Act?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well I think right now as you might imagine, there is lot of turmoil in the US market with
regards to the Affordable Care Act. I am actually quite -- and so it's difficult right now to
see how things are going to fall down. But I am convinced that in fact you are going to see
more limited coverages in the standard healthcare contract, which in my mind is going to
create significant opportunity for alternative coverage for additional wraparound covers
and I'm actually very optimistic that on the back end of resolving the transition to the ACA,
there will be increased opportunities for us in our A&H business.

Hi. Not quite, but close enough. A number of my questions were asked, I just have a
couple left .
Just to clarify couple of things on the reserve releases. Professional lines sounded like it
was favorable this quarter. I think the past couple of quarters there was a little trouble. Do
you feel like that's behind you now given what you saw in the quarter?

Yes. As you know, we took a pretty hard look at our professional lines business in the
second and Third Quarters and feel that our professional line reserve position is
adequate overall. We saw no need to strengthen those reserves further.

FINAL

Q - Ian Gutterman

And on the short-term releases, can you give a little color on -- was prior year large catdriven or do you book sort of attritional property losses and then if nothing happens, you
release it the next year. I'm just kind of wondering sort of the context of those releases.

A - Joe Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Right. For the most part, it's a combination of the two. We have had some releases from
prior, earlier accident-years, but for the most part it's our actual experience versus
expected, and our actual losses have actually been lower than we've expected. So we've
been able to release them.

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I'm not sure there's much to do or to talk in terms of updates because you know we have
initiated over the summer a third-party capital initiative that will allow us to partner with
some sources of capital and provide them with a portion of the business that we write in
certain lines of business. We're having tons of conversation. We're having a couple of
small deals that we've done, which look a lot more like retro than anything else really. And
I expect that in 2014 there will be some small portions of certain portfolios that will be
shared with some external sources of capital.
But this is a long-term play. There is lot of things happening, lot of headlines happening in
the ILS base in 2013. But when we're approaching this thing, as a longer term play making
sure that we match the right investors with the right risks. And again, our goals here, our
