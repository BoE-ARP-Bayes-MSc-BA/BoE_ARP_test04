Good afternoon. Good morning. And maybe to some of you, good evening from Munich.
We have a beautiful day, very much ﬁtting our numbers. I'll give you a quick overview on
what we have been achieving throughout '16 to '18. Then a little bit of view on the valuecreation strategy that we are pursuing for the next three years and then the more concrete
targets and outlook. Then Giulio is going to deep dive. And then we hope for some
interesting questions after that.
So let's turn to Page A3 particularly for those that are on YouTube and other channels so
you can follow. We had a very nice 2018, again, three years in a row, very good numbers.
And we hit our targets on the head. Operating proﬁt up 4%. Shareholders' net income up
10%, dividend up 13% to EUR 9, something we are very proud of. While the balance sheet
is still very strong, solvency ratio stood at 229%. The return on equity is back over 13% with
13.2% and the relative total shareholder return versus the Stoxx 50 is plus 7%. So all in all,
pretty nice. It is interesting to take a little bit of a step back to 2015 when we announced
the ﬁrst chapter of the Renewal Agenda. On Page 04, you ﬁnd a reﬂection on what we
tried to achieve over the last three years and how we positioned them. The 3-year EPS
growth rate on average was supposed to be 5% ROE 13%. Businesses with the Net
Promoter Score above market was targeted to be 75% coming from under 50%, which I'll
explain in a second. And we had, out of our annual Allianz engagement survey, distilled
an index that would indicate the leadership quality in the company and the feedback of
our people thereon. And we wanted to achieve 72%.
Now we have, by and large, made all of these numbers. What I ﬁnd quite interesting is to
go to the right-hand side of this slide and to look at the earnings per share growth in a
number of ways. The ﬁrst one is the 10-year average between 2005 and '10 -- '15, excuse
me, was 2.6%. Even worse, the analysts' estimates and the consensus in March of 2016 as
a base was about 2.4%. So when we gave ourselves a target of 5%, a lot of people were
scratching their heads and said, is this possible? We actually came out with 6.2%, 2.6x
what the analyst community consensus was at the time. And we are very happy with that.
Now the second argument that we had to confront. And that's focused on, on Page A5 is
that we cannot achieve growth, productivity and customer satisfaction at the same time. It
is not true. As you can see on this slide, we have made progress on all of these
dimensions at the same time. Finally, also in '18, showing signiﬁcant improvement in the
P&C expense ratio, while internal growth rate was at 5.7%, very, very strong. And customer
loyalty jumping to 74% of the portfolio. Something, again, that we really much like
because it shows that it's not just about ﬁnancial results, it's powered by underlying
improvements in the business. And that is something very important. We can speak more
about that. We did in the press conference this morning. And I'd like, at this point, to
reiterate the point. It wouldn't have been possible without the strong contribution of our
businesses, in particular, the people that live the customer service every day.
Now as we think about going forward, we always go very deep and talk to our investors
that is many of you around what are you really looking for when you think about Allianz?
And what are the key levers to create value? Now the underlying driver of value is really
earnings growth. Once you've reached a certain level of capital strength. And that's very
important, you still are giving a feedback, strong and resilient capitalization is super
important, as is capital discipline. I would like to reiterate the point what we said almost
four years ago now, we are managing your money very, very carefully. We are trying to

Page 2 of 28

make sure that it's well invested, that the return on invested capital remains high, above
13%, we'll get there. And we try to invest in the things that really grow value not just grow
top line. And an additional point was, ideally a low level of earnings volatility. That is
something that is important to us. But we also need to be aware as a ﬁnancial institution,
we are always susceptible to shocks from the outside world and we're going to discuss
that today. The world after quite a few years of benign environment is getting a more
rocky place as you saw in the Fourth Quarter of last year. And by the way, the First Quarter
of last year was also not funny. So we need to be aware the world is
getting to be a more diﬃcult place. And we are reﬂecting that in our plans, which means,
is we're going to focus on managing the levers that are on our disposal, not betting on
markets to be benign.
Now when you look at earnings volatility, let's take a little look at A8. And we have listed
the development of the operating proﬁts since 2008 and the business segment
diversiﬁcation that you can nicely see at the circles below. And there's been 2 low points.
One was 2009 that, by the way, was not Dresdner bank, there was large losses in
Property-Casualty, particularly in Fireman's Fund. Then '11, the sovereign debt crisis. Since
then, we had a very nice and continuous growth in the operating proﬁtability of the
business and that is what we are trying to achieve to continuously build the earnings
power of the group without rocking the boat along the way. And that is also reﬂected on
Page #A9. We want to be very strong in terms of resilience whether that's equity market
shock, spread sensitivity or interest rate sensitivity. We're going to talk about interest rate
sensitivity going forward. One of the big downsides of the Group when that goes back
even to the time when I was CFO was the very strong interest rate sensitivity that we used
to have in the Life segment. And therefore, we had given ourselves a target to reduce that
sensitivity to below 11%. Actually, it's 4% now. So now spread is really what moves our
interest rates no more and that is what has been a decade of extreme hard work and a lot
of success from the whole team.
Now capital management discipline. Page A10 gives you a very nice view from 2014 until
today in terms of the ROE development. And we have said that because of the fact that
shareholder equity is growing much faster and has been growing much faster than net
income development that we need to work on capital and capital payouts, which Michael
Diekmann and Dieter Wemmer announced at the time and we then delivered and have
been delivering on. And as you can see on the right-hand side, after 2016, we've made
sure that we keep on growing the net income. But do address the overcapitalization in the
business to ﬁnd the proper return and risk trade-oﬀ. And with what we have done in the
last year, we are where we are. And we're going to continue to do what we said we would
do. And you see that with the announcement of the additional share buyback that we did
yesterday evening.
Now, again, that is one mechanism to keep the balance between earnings growth and
capital growth in check. We obviously have other levers, in particular, to increase organic
growth as we announced at the Capital Markets Day in November. Then a supplemental
and bolt-on acquisitions if and when they make sense. Or that those instruments remain at
this disposal. And just to be very clear, Giulio will reiterate that we keep an eye on your
capital and keep it sort of very productive. But there is no automatism in doing share

FINAL

buybacks. We do that if and when it makes sense. Now particularly in this environment
where markets are fearful of Europe and we are signiﬁcantly undervalued by any stretch of
the imagination, our own share remains of the most -- one of the most attractive
investments for Allianz shareholders and management across the investment universe.
And that's why we are investing in our own shares.
Now let's turn to strategy, Page A11. There are 3 objectives: to outperform on traditional
and nontraditional competitors; to make really sure that Allianz remains at the forefront of
its industry in terms of performance; to transform the business, particularly starting in
retail with the Allianz Customer Model at its core and to rebalance the capital allocation
towards more proﬁtable growth supported by a number of initiatives, one of them being
our direct platform. But also across the geographic channel and customer segment
portfolio having very clear rules and hurdle rates. Let me remind you when I get to this
section.
Let's talk a little bit about the outperform. Now Allianz has a very good record in
outperforming on operating measures. On risk transformation, whether it's the investment
side, ALM, on pricing and underwriting, we've always had a very strong hands. But we
need to go beyond that. We need to achieve outperformance also on the customer
satisfaction side. That's what we said to ourselves the targets on MTS, they are very strong.
But it's not the case that we are everywhere the loyalty leader for our clients. We are in
most of the places now above market average. We're not yet loyalty leaders in all our
businesses and that is what we have to do. And the relative basis for decision-making is
not our internal plan, it's actually benchmarking. Who is the best in the market serving
clients in terms of productivity, in terms of proﬁtable growth and those are the ones that
we have to beat. We don't have to focus anymore on making our internal plans for
beating them. And that is only possible if we have the right bench. We have the most
motivated workforce in the industry. And there's some more work to do in terms of
making sure we train our people for the future and not just motivate. But also enable
them to compete in the digital world. In order to do that, we are developing the Allianz
Customer Model. We spent a lot of time on that in the Capital Markets Day. So I will not
repeat that here. The core idea is to make ourselves more simple than we are today,
starting with the customer interfaces, products and then moving into processes and then
reﬂecting that in internal organization, which, given our size and scope, is still quite
complicated. Digitalization is a support mechanism. It's not a substitute for human beings.
It is supporting simplicity and it's supporting scalability, something that we haven't been
able, as an industry, to demonstrate. And Allianz has to do in order to move from a
conglomerate discount to a conglomerate premium that we believe we truly deserve.
Now let's spend a few minutes on rebalancing capital allocation. So we've demonstrated
and proven to you over the last few years that we are indeed very disciplined in terms of
using your capital appropriately. So we started in 2015 with the commitment to move the
proﬁtability of our Life businesses, which were the ones that had the biggest challenges at
the time, to above 10%. Quite a few people, some of them in the room, said that is really
diﬃcult to do. A few years later, we have done it with all but 2 OEs in the group and even
those are on the way to achieve a minimum double-digit return on invested capital. On a
levered basis, the segment is probably north of 12% at this point in time. We need to do
this across the P&C portfolio as well. And we are going to work on making sure everybody

Page 4 of 28

meets minimum requirements. That is the basis for allocating capital and for allowing
people to grow. We do not want top line growth for the sake of top line growth. We want
to grow value. Last but not least, we are building the European Direct Platform for 2
reasons. The ﬁrst one is to make sure that the direct-to-consumer interfaces are being
redeveloped with our legacy. That's the real reason why we are starting there. But
obviously, it will spill over and is supported by our traditional businesses. As important is
the fact that we need to rebuild the operating platform bottom up and not just in a way
that we improve what we have. Because we need to, on a unit cost basis, move to very
diﬀerent levels of productivity from where we are today.
Now if we do this properly, ladies and gentlemen, we will be able to continuously grow
the business as you have seen it over the last two years. I'd like to turn your attention to
Page 13. The midpoint of the operating proﬁt target for next year stands at 11.54% more
than it was last year. And we're continuously growing it. On Page #14, we go back to the
same type of commitment that we made three years ago, which is, we would like to grow
the earnings per share more than 5%, 4% of which should be organic. Remember the
long-term average was about 2%. And so we are going to drive that. The proﬁtability is
supposed to be north of 13% without compromising on capital strength. Customer
centricity being north of 75% for the top (town) NPS and the IMIX score to top 73%. So
we're continuously working on driving performance up across our stakeholder measures.
That's what we are committing to. This is a longer-term plan. This is not about making the
next quarter target. I know that some of you have diﬀerent incentives. But that's what we
do. And you can rely on Allianz to deliver, not just in '18. But for the years to come. Thank
you very much. And with that, I hand over to Giulio.

Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Thank you, Oliver. Good morning and good afternoon to everybody. I will go shortly into
the results for the Fourth Quarter and then speak more at length about the results of 2018.
So if we move to Page 03, we see that also in the Fourth Quarter, we had good revenue
growth. Especially in P&C, we see a growth in revenue of 5%. So also the Fourth Quarter,
again, we had strong delivery on the Property-Casualty side. When you look at Asset
Management, we see that revenue have been down in the Fourth Quarter. And this is
driven by performance fees and sequentially is driven by the volatility in the market. The
volatility in the market had also some impact on the operating proﬁt development
compared to the prior period for Asset Management and life science. But still the results
are pretty solid considering the environment. And in Property-Casualty, we have been
able to grow the operating proﬁts signiﬁcantly over the last -- over the level of the last
year, also because the load from natural catastrophe was lower. And the outcome of all
this movement is that the operating proﬁt has been stable compared to the level of last
year. When we look at the shareholders' net income, we see a nice increase of almost
20%. And this is mostly driven by the impact of the tax reform in the United States. That
impact was negative in 2017 and it has been positive obviously in 2018.
So if we move to Page 5, here we had key KPIs for the entire year 2018. Again, very good
growth in our revenue. And especially, we are very pleased with the growth in PropertyCasualty, which was 5.7%. I'm going to come back later on this point. The operating proﬁt
has increased by more than EUR 400 million. This is mostly driven by the swing in
Property-Casualty. We see also an improvement of the results in Asset Management. And
Page 5 of 28

FINAL

in the case of life science, we see a reduction of the operating proﬁt. Most of that was
already anticipated in our outlook, as 2017, as you may remember, was very benign from a
volatility point of view.
And now when we look at the net income, we see a nice increase of 10%. This is the
consequence of the improvement in operating proﬁt, the eﬀect of the tax reform and also,
if you remember, we bought out the minorities of Euler Hermes. So this is also
contributing to the bottom line. The ROE is north of 13% and the growth in EPS is 14%
plus. And as you know, we have dividend -- increasing dividend of 12.5% up. So all KPIs
are showing in the right direction, which is improving. So we are very pleased with the
results that we have been able to achieve in 2018.

Now moving to Page 07, here we show the solvency ratio is stable. I'm going to come
back in 1 second to the diﬀerent driver of the solvency ratio. Just one comment on the
sensitivity. We are -- the most sensitivities are pretty much unchanged compared to the
sensitivities that we saw in the previous quarter. One sensitivity, which is much improved is
the sensitivity to the interest rate down 50 basis points. If you remember, just 12 months
ago, that sensitivity was minus 11% and now it is minus 4%. So we don't have a signiﬁcant
sensitivity to interest rate. We should keep in mind this sensitivity can be a little bit volatile.
We saw some volatility over the quarter. But deﬁnitely we are in a diﬀerent position
compared to the position we were just a few years ago.
Moving to Page 9, here you see the driver of the development of the solvency ratio. We
had about 3percentage point of impact, negative impact, due to regulatory changes just
to mention a couple, or three; one was the change in UFR, which is happening, by the
way, every year. Then the other one was some change to the way we are including Allianz
Life into the Solvency II numbers. And the third one is that we are now including also
Allianz Thailand in our perimeter. And before, Thailand was not part of the Solvency II
framework. What is very good is the development of the operating earnings. So the
operating evolution, which is 35%, this is obviously before we take into account for taxes
and for dividend. Once we adjust for taxes and dividend, we have a nice improvements to
capital generation of about 15%. And this clearly is oﬀsetting the negative impacts on the
market movement. As you know, especially the last quarter has been interesting from a
market movement point of view. Then on the capital management/management action,
we had the impact of the dividend, the buybacks and also the transaction like Euler
Hermes or Taiwan or (the OLB) transaction also impacting that driver. Then impacts that
we are adjusting, impact of tax and the other restrictions. So bottom line is strong capital
generation that oﬀset, if you want the impact of the market and also has contributed to
sustained buybacks and also has oﬀset any regulatory or model change.
And now let's go to Page 11, where we show the growth for the Property-Casualty
segment. Again, as I said before, it is a very strong growth, 5.7%. If you look at the growth
rate we have been able to achieve in the past in Property-Casualty, you see a growth rate
of between 2% and 3%. So what has changed? Just to mention the ﬁrst 3 companies in
Germany, we have been growing 4% in 2018. If you look at 2017, the growth rate was 2%.
In Italy was -- we had a growth rate of 1%. In 2017, was a negative growth rate of minus
1.3%. And even in France, for example, the growth rate has gone up from 1.4% in '17 to
2.2% in '18. And that can go down all the list. And I would say, there are almost no
Page 6 of 28



FINAL

Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2019-02-15

exceptions to the fact that we are being --growing faster compared to what we did in 2017
or also 2016. When we look at the renewal season, overall, you see a stable or positive
environment. So I wouldn't say that there is a hardening, still hardening in the market. But
there is also not a softening. And considering that we have a strong position to start with,
overall, we see this as a benign environment. Moving to Page 13. So we see the
development to the operating proﬁt for Property-Casualty which went up about EUR 700
million. There are 2 drivers. One is the improvement to the combined ratio and one is the
improvement in the investment results. Just to speak now about the combined ratio, the
combined ratio improved by 120 basis points compared to the time period. And this time
is very easy to understand the drivers. If you see 50 basis point improvement is coming
from a lower impact from national catastrophe. Then we have. And that's very good news,
70 basis point improvement from the expense ratio. You remember the beginning of last
year. Last year, we said, we want to get to 28.4%. And we are taking productivity very
seriously. We have been able even to achieve a 28% and that's a combination of the
productivity actions that we have put in place and also is a consequence of having a
stronger growth rate compared to what we had anticipated. Also, I just tell you the
improvement combined in the expense ratio is more or less wide spread across all
entities. So it's not just 1 or 2 entities driving this. But there was a big push in all
organization within the Allianz Group.

Bloomberg Transcript

At Page 15, you can see the combined ratio and operating proﬁt for the selected entities. I
will not go into the details now, you can ask me later. But as you see, most entities have
been able to improve the combined ratio compared to the '17 level.
Now we come to Page 17, where we show the investment results. As you see, the
investment result has gone up by about EUR 100 million compared to 2017. This might not
look intuitive, indeed, there is a one-oﬀ, which is an accounting consequence of a change
in how we participate a policyholder to the diﬀerent property sources in our accident
business in Germany. It is also a component of giving back the premium. So there is a
stock of policyholder participation. We have changed the way we participate the
policyholder to the diﬀerent sources and that has an accounting consequence, which has
led to, in this line item, to an impact of EUR 100 million positive. There is also, not
necessarily related to this thing, a EUR 50 million negative impact on the underwriting
result. So the net is about EUR 50 million. But that is important for you to understand that
you need to normalize the EUR 3 billion to EUR 2.9 billion. Now EUR 2.9 billion is a good
number because that's pretty much stable over the level of 2017. And also, where we are
focusing on the development of the interest income coming from our bonds, we see that
it's going down. But it's not going down as we thought. So we see some more stability
compared to what we had thought in the past.
And with that, we come to Page 19. That's about the Life business. We have been able to
grow production by more than 4 -- 5%. And the main driver for the increase in production
are Germany and then also the United States. Still a comment we give ourselves the goal
three years ago that 80% of our production should be in capital-light or preferred
products. And now, we are at 82%. But the good news is not only that we are at 82%. But
also that we are able to grow our business having a diﬀerent products range compared to
what we had just 3 or 4, ﬁve years ago. So that's the very good news.

Page 7 of 28

Now, we come to Page 21. You can see here that the operating proﬁt for the Life business
has gone down compared to the level of 2017. Again, '17 was very benign. On the
opposite, '18 was a little bit more challenging. Reality is that we are being able, more or
less, to achieve our target of EUR 4.2 billion. So we have been very close. And this despite
a higher volatility that we have experienced, not only in Q4. But also, remember, Q1 was
also a quarter with a lot of volatility. There are diﬀerent moving pieces as used in the
numbers but the main driver for the reduction of operating proﬁt is the investment
margin. Again, the majority of that was already expecting our -- in our outlook for 2018.
And now at Page 23, we show the operating proﬁt and the value of new business for the
selected entities. Let's focus on the value of new business for one second. It is growing
double-digit. And this is driven by 2 things. First of all, as I said before, we are growing
our premium or (low) production by more than 5% and the second one is we have an
increase in the new business margin of 20 basis points. So the combination of higher new
business margin and also higher production is leading to double-digit growth in value of
new business.
When we look at the operating proﬁt, we see that the operating proﬁt for the German
entity was relatively stable, which is also what we would expect in such an environment. In
the United States, we see a drop of the operating proﬁt. This is, again, the consequence of
the low volatility in 2017 and higher volatility, if you want, in 2018. I would even say that the
level of performance in '18 is more representative. If you want on the underlying
performance, slightly below what we would expect. But not signiﬁcantly below. Then we
had a few headwinds in France. On the other side, the development in Asia-Paciﬁc has
been very good with a growth rate of 30%, which is a consequence of the growth of the
business. But also, it is a consequence of the fact that we have sold our legacy block in
Taiwan. And so the drag from the legacy block in Taiwan has now vanished from our
numbers at least for half of the year.
And now at Page 25, we show the investment margin. As you can see, the investment
margin has declined by 10 basis point compared to the 2017 level. As you might
remember, our range was of a new business margin for 2018 of 90 to 95 basis points. So
we are little bit below the range that we gave you. And that's because of the volatility that
we saw in the capital market. For 2019, we expect anywhere the range to be between 80
to 85 basis points. I would say that if we have a normal volatility level, we should be at the
85 basis point, close to the upper end of the range. Then if we see more volatility, we are
going to grow most likely towards more the lower end of the range. Then clearly, there is
always a possibility to end up outside the range in one way or the other. But our best
guidance at this point in time is of an investment margin between 80 to 85 basis points.
Now we come to Asset Management. In Asset Management, you can see that the thirdparty assets under management have been broadly stable. When you look at that, at the
net inﬂows, you can see that on a net basis, between AGI and PIMCO, we had, for the
year, the net outﬂows of about EUR 3.5 billion. Now if you look at AGI. And the allocated
number is positive and that's a very positive news considering the environment. When
you look at PIMCO, we had about EUR 8 billion of outﬂows. If you look at the quarterly
development, you can see that we had quarters with positive inﬂows and quarters with
negative inﬂows, especially in the last quarter, we had inﬂows in the amount of about EUR
Page 8 of 28



FINAL

Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2019-02-15

29 billion (sic) (negative EUR 29 billion) So that was a diﬃcult quarter. But we also see that
as we come into 2019, we had in the month of January, EUR 5 million of positive inﬂows.
So there is some volatility around inﬂows. But I would say that there is nothing which is
fundamentally structural. And especially in the case of PIMCO, considering the excellent
level of performance of the funds, we think the franchise of the business is extremely
strong. And indeed, we can see this at Page 29. When you look at the revenue
development, you can see that the revenue on a ﬁxed adjusted basis went up 6%. If I
remove then the performance fees that have some kind of volatility and I just look at the, if
you want, the assets under management driven fees, the increase adjusted for FX was 9%,
about 9%. So we had a very strong increase in the revenue basis. There are 2 reasons for
that. First of all, the average asset bases during the year was higher compared to the level
of 2017. But the other point, which is critical is that fee margin is going up. And we saw the
fee margin not only being stable. But we already are going up over the last quarters. And
this, for me, speaks about the quality of the business.

Bloomberg Transcript

And with that, we can move to Page 31. Clearly, when the revenue are growing, one would
expect to also the operating proﬁt to grow at least to the level of the revenue. If we adjust
for ﬁxed eﬀect, the growth in our operating proﬁt in the Asset Management segment was
about 7%. One comment on the cost income ratio, as you see, is going up. But here, we
need to take into account that we had a consolidation, if you want to call it that way, of
ACP, Allianz Capital Partners. If we remove from the numbers the consolidation of Allianz
Capital Partners. The cost income ratio improved by about 20 basis point. And this
despite the fact that we are investing our business both at AGI and especially at PIMCO.
And with that, on the corporate line, I would just say that the drop in investment in the
operating proﬁt of corporate line is explained by the consolidation of OLB. And so we can
move directly to Page 35, where we show the nonoperating items. As you see, the
nonoperating items went a little bit more negative compared to 2017. Here, clearly, we
had a little bit less realized gains. We had a little bit more impairment than we had the
impact on the transaction in Taiwan. On the other side, restructuring charges have been
lower compared to the level of 2017. What has deﬁnitely also impacted positively our
results is the tax reform in the U.S.A. As you see, last year, our tax rate was 29%. And this
year, it's 26%, which is at the lower end of the range we gave to you of 26% to 28%. And
as we move forward, we expect this to be more or less at midpoint of the tax rate we are
going to see in the future years.
So Page 37, that's just a famous or a regular scorecard that we show to you. And now, we
are at the end of 2018. So we can look backwards. But I believe Oliver has already talked
about the very good journey over the last three years. So I don't have anything else to
add. It's now that I also want to thank our employees for the great eﬀort and for making
these results across the board.
And with that, we come to Page 38. That's some more detail about the outlook for 2019.
As Oliver has pointed out before, that's an increase of 4% compared to the midpoint of
last year. And that's ﬂat to the level of 2018. That's also tradition that we have here at
Allianz as you all saw in the slides of Oliver, usually we set the outlook at the level of the
prior period or lower. This tradition has been serving us pretty well in the last year. So
we'd like to keep a good tradition. And on top of that, I would also say that there is some
Page 9 of 28

volatility anywhere that we saw in the last -- not necessarily in the last weeks. But at least at
the end of 2018. And we are very cautious about this volatility. And this is clearly
impacting a little bit our view on Asset Management. Maybe in January, the performance
has been very good. So this number might be conservative. We take what's happened in
January. But we shouldn't forget adjusting it, saying that things might have looks a little
bit diﬀerent. On the Life side, we have a outlook of EUR 4.2 billion, which is consistent
with the level of proﬁt of 2018. Here, we need to consider that we are anticipating that the
consolidation of a joint venture in Spain. And so from that point of view, if you put back
the proﬁt that we are now going to get, the number will be EUR 100 million higher. Then
in Property-Casualty, beside the fact that you need to normalize a little bit proﬁt for
Property-Casualty and for the one-oﬀ I was explaining before, the point is, we expect to
have an improvement in the underwriting results as we go into 2019. On the other side,
we still take a very cautious view on the development of the income or the investment
income. Up to now, usually, our estimates have been always on the conservative side. So
our investment income has been higher compared to what we have assumed. But we
continue to take a conservative view and then we see what happens in 2019.
And with that, I would like to open up to the questions you might have on our numbers or
strategy.

(Operator Instructions) And we'll take our ﬁrst question from Michael Huttner with
JPMorgan.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

And I had 2 very geeky questions. So I apologize if that's a bit boring. The ﬁrst one is on
Slide B41. And there you -- where you've served the MCEV, the Life embedded value. And
there is the item, which shows, what I think of, cash ﬂow to the impairment is just EUR 190
million. Last year, it was EUR 2.6 billion. And I was hoping that Life generates more cash
for the group. So I just wondered maybe you can speak a little bit about that. Then on the
share buyback, maybe you can expand a bit because there seems to be lots of interesting
angles saying, well, it's good to maintain the ROE. But it's not automatic and you only
spoke about bolt-on not large deals that you may have done in the past. And also maybe
a little bit on the timing. Was it something you wanted by the AGM? And still on the
buyback, my favorite topic, what -- on Slide, I think, A10, it says, over EUR 5 billion capital
management. And I just wonder if it opens a door to do a little bit more in the rest of the
year?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay. Maybe I'll start with the question on Page 41, where you see a EUR 200 million
negative impact on the market consistent embedded value, which is, at the end of the
day, if you want that impact coming from dividend that have been distributive from our
Life OEs outside of the segment. Now you need to adjust this number also for
management action so which have nothing to do with the dividend. So we have
Page 10 of 28

FINAL

Date: 2019-02-15

management action that improved the MCEV. So you should adjust for that, which is
about EUR 300 million. Then we have 3 things that have impacted the position compared
to 2017. One is Taiwan, where we had -- as a consequence of the transaction, we had to
send money to Taiwan. So that's -- and also a substantial amount of money -- so that's a
negative impact there. You can look at this almost like in M&A. Then we had lower
dividend or no dividend in 2018 from Allianz Life in U.S.A. as a consequence of the tax
reform and also as a consequence of growth. And in the U.S.A., when you grow premium,
you have a big charge on premium. The beauty is that when you just go down on
premium this comes back right away. Then we had also less upstreaming from Italy
compared to what we had in 2017. So if you just adjust for the what is not really a dividend
issue and what are the impact from these 3 countries, you go back to a number which is
closer to the 2017 number. So that's on this one. On the share buybacks. So the question
is what is going to happen by the AGM. I don't think we are going to complete a EUR 1.5
billion program by the AGM. But I would expect that 1/2, or I would say, 2/3 of the
program is going to be completed by that date. So that's what will be my guidance. It
doesn't make a lot of diﬀerence whether we are going to be done by the AGM or 1 or two
months later, if you think about the number. But if you are interested in the payout ratio, I
will say that the payout ratio should be slightly above 50%. So we'll say something
between 50% and 51%. In the sense of the logic of buybacks. And if we are going to do
future buybacks, my response to it -- to this question will be, we are just doing a buyback
right now. And we are going to think later about potential buybacks. I think we have been
very clear in explaining our philosophy. At the end of the day, we are looking for
opportunity to create value. And maybe I'll give you also a point of reference. We did
signiﬁcant buyback in the past and also, we have a buyback right now. On the other side,
we're also doing M&A. So we -- it's a combination. So if you ask me the best way to create
value is some amount where the combination between the 2. Then now, we are doing
buybacks. So maybe this might also mean that we might do some bolt-on acquisition. It's
also -- but if we don't ﬁnd any opportunity, we are more than happy to do buyback. Again,
we don't have a schedule. It's not that we say every x months, we are going to do a
buyback. We look at the opportunity, we look at the numbers and then we decide based
on capital discipline, ﬁnancial discipline. That's how we decide when to do a buyback and
also how much of a buyback we want to do.

Operator
And we'll take our next question from Andrew Ritchie with Autonomous.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

So I had 2 quite big-picture questions. Oliver, you talked in the beginning about how
we're in a more diﬃcult place with respect to asset markets, capital markets, obviously, we
saw that in Q4. I just want to clarify, what is the Group doing in terms of its asset
allocation? We got the annual update this time. When I look at it, it doesn't seem there's
been any derisking of positions in credit. It looks like you are willing to take up real assets
-- real asset exposure higher even though I'm not sure returns are higher. So maybe just
clarify what is the Group doing with respect to its own asset allocation in light of tougher
markets, potentially more credit volatility? And second question is just a clariﬁcation. The
ROE target on the going-forward basis, just to clarify, is it formally upgraded from 13% to
13% plus? That being the case, what are the other levers besides earnings growth and

Page 11 of 28



Company Name: Allianz SE

capital management? What about internal capital allocation, is there much scope there
left still in terms of to deliver the ROE plus target, if that is the new target?

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
Yes. I'll answer the ﬁrst one and Giulio can do further one. So on the asset allocation,
Giulio can give you some more of the details. Indeed, it's watching very carefully the
credit quality that we do. And including government debt exposures because they are
also relevant for us and we have been very careful. When we talk about real asset
exposure, we typically like infrastructure and less liquid assets that are less exposed to
mark-to-market volatility day-to-day. Remember, the original target for the so-called
alternatives -- and when we talk alternatives, we don't mean low-credit quality, we mean
real estate, we mean infrastructure, the original target was EUR 110 billion. We have
achieved EUR 140 billion at the end of '18, just to give you the comparison. So this is what
we are talking about in order to make sure our results are less volatile than they would
otherwise be. And we are very careful in terms of diversiﬁcation. The other one is, in terms
of where is upside on the ROE side. Indeed, we would like to maintain an ROE higher
than 13%, not just get to 13% and there is various levers. The number one is what we've
just said and the people still apparently not fully believe is that we keep our investors'
money very carefully where we need it to have it. But if we don't need it, we'll bring it
back. Now the reason why we are on this one in an environment that we are in where you
have lots of volatility, you need to ﬁnd the balance, not just the disciplines, between
having a very strong balance sheet and not having capital sitting idle. We have quite a few
investors said, don't go too aggressive on buybacks and on solvency because you want to
make sure that under all circumstances, Allianz will be standing. And that is a very clear
prerequisite for anything that we do on capital management. We draw the house, err a
little more on the conservative side just to be very clear. Now we still believe in the
portfolio. I can take P&C as an example. We have improvements in terms of capital
eﬃciency. Some of our wholesale businesses that are operationally very good, Euler,
AGCS are still extremely capital intensive. So there are various levers that we can pull to
improve capital eﬃciency further.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And just to clarify, are there any areas of credit risk where you have actively derisked over
the year?

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
I am not aware of that in any large scale. We do this on a continuous basis.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Italy. Italy.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
Yes. The one thing we can -- could talk about is that we, as we have outlined three years
ago, have a consistent strategy to reduce sovereign debt exposure in sovereign Europe.
Italy has been example, where we have a long-scale schedule. But we try not to sort of
panic just because some spread widening happens. We have an optimization program
Page 12 of 28

that balances returns with risk reduction. And Italy would be a notable case. We have
been reducing our exposure. But that is according to plan, not because of the elections or
anything else.

And we'll take our next question from James Shuck with Citi.

Q - James Austin Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

First question was -- I just want to return to the dividend and the buyback. So the payout
ratio is -- I think, Giulio, you said, it was 50% to 51%. I kind of get 51.6%. So a little bit
above that. Your kind of guidance on the dividends had been pretty clear. It's 50% on
payout. So I'm just wondering whether that's just a nice rounding to get to EUR 9.00 on
the dividend. Or are you starting to creep up a little bit on the ordinary dividend payouts?
Then within that, also on buybacks, I heard your answer from earlier. I'm just interested to
know, are you moving more towards an annual cycle for buybacks? Or is it something that
you'll just revisit at relevant reporting periods? Second question on the Allianz Customer
Model. So the digitalization and products simpliﬁcation, obviously, you're seeing good
beneﬁts from that taking market share in some markets and good margins. I'm just
wondering, is there a trade-oﬀ with that model? So for example, is it aﬀecting your
product delivery? And is it aﬀecting the actual customer segment that you're going after?
So for example, is it mass-market customers more than the higher aﬄuent who might
want a more tailored solution? Then ﬁnally, just on U.S. Life. So I think the ﬁxed index
annuity book was up 20% or so across the year. Do you think that business is really
starting to get to reliant on 1 product? If you can get me a split of the sales by type of
product that would be helpful. Just focusing really -- I imagine that kind of 70%, 80% of
sales were FIAs. But some -- obviously, there's some quite attractive valuations out there
at the moment for U.S. Life company. So if you did want to diversify, would M&A be
something you consider in that space?

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
Well then, Giulio will tell you all of the big ones. I'll start with a funny answer. We really
liked that EUR 9. So we -- generally the policy is 50% payout plus obviously the eﬀects of
the share buybacks that come on top. But just as a more facetious answer. Giulio gives
you the details. The other one on the ACM, I think there is a misunderstanding. When we
talk about harmonization of what we do, for example, the Allianz product library that has
more than 200 modules, then this has nothing to do with standardization in the bad
sense. You think about it as your playlist on Spotify. Now you have billions of combination
opportunities. But it's always the same songs that you are combining. It's just no more
printed -- pressed on to a record. So what we're trying to say is we are creating modularity
that we can replicate across markets. And by the way, we are underpinning it with IT
capability so that we can sell, for example, a German life insurance product into Italy or
into Belgium in the future. That is really what behind -- it's behind and that will give us, for
the ﬁrst time in our history, true scale. It doesn't mean that an aﬄuent client is going to
get the boring standardized oﬀer that doesn't meet their needs. Giulio?

Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2019-02-15

Yes. So maybe starting from the question about Allianz Life. So the production is pretty
much everything either in FIA or in a so-called hybrid VA. And hybrid VA, at the end of the
day, from an economic point of view, is the same like ﬁxed index annuities. So the
distinction is a poor -- pure technical distinction of the way you submit a product. But I will
say that 99% of the production is ﬁxing this annuity or ﬁxing this annuity life production.
So that's also business we are extremely comfortable with, with a new business margin,
which is north of the 3.7%. So that's also the bread and butter of the company. And there
is pretty much no traditional VA left, I will say. It's totally negligible. Then I think you had
question on the buybacks whether we are on a annual cycle. No. We are not on any kind
of cycle, again. We're deﬁnitely not on a quarterly cycle, let's put it this way. But I wouldn't
say, now we are on a annual, biannual cycle.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
Let me just add, James, because I think actually it's a very good question in the following
sense. Giulio has explained on the capital generation side that we typically have an idea
of what the underlying capital generation of the group is, it's about 10% of the solvency.
Now last year, it was 15%. It was very strong. The cylinders kept on pumping. And when
we ﬁnd out that the capital generation is stronger, I just would like to reiterate that we are
then disciplined to say whatever we don't need for the growth of the business, we'll give
back as it emerges. So we have no incentives in the board to have your money sitting
here idle. But we also have, in light of this markets, no hurry in order to make sure that we
stay protected with a strong balance sheet. That is the balance that we are trying to strike.

Q - James Austin Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

That's helpful. Just coming back on the U.S. Life. My question was also around, do you
think that business is overly reliant on 1 business line? And shouldn't you look to be
diversifying into new areas? We've all seen what happened with or nearly happened with
(inaudible) annuities, for example?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay. That's a good question. So personally speaking, I can speak as the former CFO of
Allianz Life. I wouldn't say that it's critical to diversify into diﬀerent lines of business. I
would say think about that, we are speaking of the huge market, the annuity market in the
United States. And also, I will say, it's more about diversiﬁcation within diﬀerent
distribution channel. So that's the diversiﬁcation we should be looking at. But it's a huge
market. So we think is a niche. We are speaking of markets of billions, billions of U.S.
dollars. So my view. I might be wrong. But my view has always been that there is enough
diversiﬁcation revenue that you can get by diversifying distribution. And I think that being
very focused on doing something very well can pay oﬀ also pretty well.

Q - James Austin Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

And by implication, I presume you've ruled out any acquisitions in the U.S. Life space,
does it?

never do this, yes.

We'll take our next question from Jon Hocking with Morgan Stanley.

Q - Jonathan Michael Hocking
Three questions, please. Firstly, over the beginning, you were talking about earnings
volatility, reducing it as a value lever. I just wonder whether you can talk a little bit about
which lines of business or maybe geographies you see as being particularly volatile? Or
whether you're just talking about lines of business or potentially managing the vol
through the mix. Is there anything left here that you want to -- you've taken obviously
some of the lifelines, a lot of capital intensity. Was that something that's backwardlooking, or was that a forward-looking statement? Secondly, on AGCS, the revenues are
up a lot even though the rate achieved is relatively modest. I just wonder, are you actually
calling the cycle a little bit there? And how did you sort of square the circle in terms of
growing that business so much when it's still running at above 100% combined? Then just
ﬁnal question on the capital sensitivities. Maybe a little unfairly given what you've done on
the interest rate risk. But given the interest rate sensitivity, now it's so modest, the
softening spread is looking at one of your biggest sensitivities on the downside. I just
wondered, ﬁrstly, how much of that is Italy? Then whether there's anything you can sort of
usually do to reduce that volatility?

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
I'm going to talk about the earnings volatility and then can hand it over to Giulio, can say
a little bit about the AGCS strategically. Now there was more a backward-looking
statement in terms of what is meant and it was more solvency at the moment and then
volatility out of risk that we don't get paid for. So people will sometimes internally say, Mr.
BÃ¤te doesn't like volatility from NatCat. No. That's not true. I just don't like volatility
that's not paid for. So we need to make sure that we actually get paid for taking risk. And
we have a very robust proactive framework that you know, that Dieter introduced on the
top of what we've done in prior years. I'm just reﬂecting on what investor feedback is.
They search for us. I just like to always mention, we have volatility and solvency out of
credit spread that we believe we actually economically don't have, it's one of the failures
in the Solvency II model because it reﬂects run risk that we don't really see. And I would
like to reiterate that and hope that, that Solvency II ﬂaw gets eventually ﬁxed one day. But
the interest rate sensitivity was really one of the things that are really bad because you
don't get paid for it neither by the market nor by that. So I'm very proud of the team in
terms of having brought this one down and that is a big achievement. AGCS, when you
look at the numbers of AGCS, never forget they still chew on the Fireman's Fund portfolio
in the U.S. They're still in the process of restructuring. We said, until 2021, they have to
change their underlying operating platform and system. So they're running on both the
old and building the new. And that creates a drag on -- gives them the very high expense
ratio. And in terms of the growth, we're obviously looking at it and we need to look at it
very carefully. But Giulio can give you some more details.

FINAL

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yes. So and as you said. So we know the history. We are three years of combined ratio of
over 100%. But we know for sure that there was also a lot of volatility going against us. So
we're not at a 100% combined ratio as the underlying performance of AGCS, that's very
important. This -- we don't want to be complacent. Me understand that there is some
work we need to do. And on the pricing side, I would tell you that we see some stronger
pricing, especially in the area that have been either aﬀected by natural catastrophe in the
past year. So also in the areas where the combined ratio, the underlying combined ratio is
higher. You can also see that a lot of competitors are suﬀering on the industrial line. So
there is deﬁnitely a trend, which is in the right direction. And now we need to see how
strong this trend is going to be. But I sat down with the management team of AGCS just a
few days ago. And we can really see some rate improvement, underwriting action that we
can now get through. That wasn't necessarily the case a few months ago. So from that
point of view, we should see the improvement. But I come back to the point, the biggest
thing is not to see this kind of volatility either from natural catastrophe or also from the
large (cost) that we saw. This year already is going to show very diﬀerent numbers. Then
the additional improvement should lead to our target combined ratio of 96%, potentially
even 95%. But I would say, 96% by 2021. So that's in AGCS. Then you have a question on
the Solvency II and this price of government -- to government bond. I just tell you that -and the question is also how much is Italy? Since we are stress testing the thing in a very
automatic way, we just take 50 basis point on everything, including the German bond.
And so in reality, you can apply a percentage of how much Italian bonds we have on the
portfolio. That's about 10%. So I would say that about 1% of the sensitivity might come
from Italy. Now the point is, it's most likely that we get sensitivity out of Italy as opposed to
getting the sensitivity out of a German bond. But the contribution to the sensitivity is more
or less a proportion to the portfolio. The likelihood that we are going to see sensitivity
from Italy is stronger. Now there is a feature, which is called the volatility, the country
volatility adjusted debt might kick in, in some situation and even dampen their volatility.
So there is a point where, in reality, you get almost a cliﬀ eﬀect. Now to your question to
what we want to do on that? I just tell you that in the case of Italy, as Oliver was referring
before, we have a kind of program where we are, over time, reducing the exposure. But I
would not necessarily divest from German bonds because of a sensitivity, which is, we
know, a ﬂaw, if you want, of the Solvency II calculation. So there might be other reason not
to invest in German bonds because you get 0 interest rate. But not because of a sensitivity
to Solvency II. So the answer to your question is, yes, for some country where we see
higher risk, we have already decreased our exposure. And we are going to take the
opportunity to further the risk. But fundamentally, we don't think that having a sensitivity
to government bonds is a bad thing. And we also can see that our solvency ratio is
extremely high. So also from that point of view, we can deﬁnitely aﬀord this kind of
sensitivity.

Q - Jonathan Michael Hocking
Just to come back on AGCS. You're writing business here motivated by technical price not
a desire to get the expense ratio down faster?

No, no, absolutely. Absolutely. So no, no, we are using technical price. Maybe sometimes
also a diﬀerence between technical price, actual pricing and then you have to go through
the portfolio. But absolutely, we are driving to -- for further portfolio on aggregate on
getting the technical price. And there is no misunderstanding that writing business just to
sustain the expense ratio is not a good idea. And indeed, I tell you even more, the fact
that we are putting so much emphasis on productivity takes, in reality, to be disciplined on
underwriting because the pressure on bringing down the expense ratio and to be
productive is there. And we pay attention that there is no growth that is used to somehow
get a better expense ratio.

And we have a question from Vinit Malhotra with Mediobanca.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

There's 3 questions, please. One on P&C, one on Life and one on Asset Management.
Start with P&C. So just the large losses have been a bit of a pain last year, also very much
in Fourth Quarter. Are you thinking a bit about them as something that will go away? Or
maybe more reinsurance? Or is there some link in your models around the very high
growth and some of these large losses? If you can just comment on that or if you could
provide any numbers from the Fourth Quarter without large loss. That will be excellent.
Second thing is just on the Life. So I hear these -- the conservative approach and market
risks. But this 80% to 85% suggests what exactly that you think markets will be more
volatile? Or do you -- or is there other -- is there some other reason for downgrading the
investment margin? Lastly, on the PIMCO fees margin, which has been very surprisingly
positive, amazing result. Is this simply because more structured credit kind of products are
being sold and less because -- so is it more that? Or is it the retail institutional? Or are
these one and the same thing? Or maybe you could give us sense of the ﬂow between
these 2 lines, if possible.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay. So I'll maybe start from the large losses. So clearly, we are looking to that to see
whether any kind of large losses are consequence of bad underwriting. And indeed, we
have a loss review, a post loss review. Every time there is a large loss, we are going to -- or
the underwriter, they are going to look into that and determine whether there was an
error in underwriting or not. But maybe I want to give you a little bit of sense of what we
are dealing with. In -- I'm just looking at the losses of a EUR 10 million. In 2017, we had -- in
2018, we had about, let's say, 27 losses over EUR 10 million. And in 2017, we had like 21. So
6 more losses but the average loss is about EUR 20 million. So you already get EUR 220
million and this already makes 30 to 40 basis point to our combined ratio, loss ratio. Now
we are speaking of 27 losses as was 21. So it's not -- that's something also that we can

deﬁnitely argue about should be 20, 27, 30, 19. So it's something that is very diﬃcult to
give an answer. So we go back to the underwriting point. The only thing you can do is to
go through the review with the underwriters. And when the underwriters say it is okay.
And we would rewrite that business, that's something that tell us that from an
underwriting point of view, we are now making a mistake. But we are not taking this
lightly. Clearly, we're looking into that. I don't think is a major issue anyway. We are
speaking here of 20, 30, 40 basis point. And there can be some volatility over the years.
On the Life/Health side, the 80 to 85 basis point, I would say, is twofold. So there -- on the
one side, clearly, we are kind of cautious because of the volatility that we saw. But we also
know that some other recent pressure on the investment margin, especially in Europe
because we have a low interest rate environment. So from that point of view, to expect
that there will be some sort of compression in the margin is reasonable. On the other
side, we shouldn't forget that there is a -- basis is also growing. So there is a little bit of an
oﬀset on the absolute amount. Then 1/3 element, which is placed around 2. When we look
at the United States, we had that tax reform. And the tax reform leads to a lower tax rate,
which means you can get to the same ROE if you want. So IRR, because we are speaking
in terms of IRR in pricing by having a little bit of a lower spread. And so now, we didn't
pass all the spreads -- all the tax reform beneﬁts to the policyholder. So we kept
something for the shareholder too. But somehow, we are sharing part of it with the
policyholder. This means that we can get to a slightly higher return compared to before
having a lower investment margin. So you need to add up a little bit of caution because of
the market, a little bit of the impact on the tax reform. And the United States is a big
market for our numbers. Then also some compression and then you can understand why
we are putting down the margin between 80 and 85 basis points. Then coming to the last
question, which is Asset Management. I will say that in reality, when you go into all these
alternative products, you might have rather increasing performances as opposed to see
an increase in the fee margin because the fee margin is without a performance fee. So
indeed, that might be even playing against the fee margin. I just go back, let's say,
PIMCO, they increase one year ago, about one year ago, the fee on the income fund. So
when you have a performance, which is as strong as the performance of PIMCO, then
clearly, you can have also a pricing strength and you can see that. In the case of AGI, as I
just tell you, they are not giving the set targets. They don't give targets to the distribution
based on ﬂows. But they give targets based on run rate revenue on the ﬂows. And this
makes a big diﬀerence. So when you look at the number of AGI, you try to make a
relationship between their run rate revenue on the ﬂows. And the ﬂows, you get very
strange numbers because you might have negative ﬂows and positive run rate revenue
and that's because of a focus of management of AGI about getting quality business with
good margin and is not about chasing ﬂows at low margin.

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

A couple of questions. I wondered if you think your new targets are stretching enough
since you actually seem to be achieving most of them already. And a good example is
expenses, your P&C expense ratio is starting to come down but I wondered, could you
give us more about your ambition here. I notice, for example the German expense ratio is
very attractive at 25%. Is this something that could be viable for the whole of the group?

A - Giulio Terzariol

So when we look at -- the ambition is -- the ambition that we spell out in the Capital
Markets Day just a few months ago. So for example, when we said that on the expense
ratio, we like to be at 27.5%, clearly, if we can run as fast as we had been doing in 2018, if
we continue to see growth, I would expect that we are even going to be better than the
27.5%. But we need to see how the next years are going to play out. And on the combined
ratio, we said we want to go to 93%. So at the end of the day, it's going to be a
combination of productivity improvement. But also working on the technical excellence.
We also need to assume. And I'm going to be very clear on that, we are not going to have
the same runoﬀ for the foreseeable future. Rate runoﬀ is going to come down and we are
aware of that and that's the reason why we are working already now on technical
excellence to improve further our numbers. On the life side, I think we discussed that
we're going to put a lot of focus on the value of the business growth because the value of
the business growth is converting into operating proﬁt. Also from an analytical point of
view, we want to do more work on that. Then in Asset Management, we gave us targets
also on the cost income ratio. In the case of PIMCO, we're keeping the targets that we had
in the past, which is cost-income ratio below 60%. And as you know, PIMCO is heavily
investing in the business. And in the case of AGI, we want to push the cost income ratio
below 67%. So to your question whether we're making our life easier, I don't think we're
making our life easy. We have work in front of us. But I also conﬁdent that we can achieve
our numbers for 2021 and let's see how much progress we do in '19.

That's great. Very clear. Just as a follow-up, sorry, on the subject you mentioned about
sort of runoﬀ is 3%, I think you said that is your, kind of, normalized level, you're running at
4% at the moment. Should we expect 3%. And if so how quickly?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

I would say that that's my working hypothesis. We don't know how things are going to
play out. It will depend on the inﬂation. But I will say, yes, when we -- our working
hypothesis is that over time the runoﬀ is going to stabilize to a 3% level. This is not
something that necessarily is going to happen anywhere necessarily in 2019 or '20. But I
will say, by 2021, that's the working hypothesis. So we need to ﬁx a few assumptions too
and then we need to work around these assumptions in order to give us also the targets
that we want to have from an accident year loss ratio and expense ratio point of view. But
that's the number that we are using in our thinking.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
Nick, just to show you the 10-year average is anywhere between 3.5% and 3.7%. So we've
always had a strong reserve base. So I and Giulio do not expect a sudden drop oﬀ of the
reserve runoﬀ levels. But more a slow sliding scale on that. As inﬂation picks up, I think the
key long-term driver has been declining inﬂation in the industry. And we have been
reserving to a higher reserve levels that is normalizing. But it's slowly but surely
normalizing.

That's great. And so the reserve ratio, I notice, has been dropping a little bit. Is that
something you would recognize? The P&C reserve ratio has been falling, I think, in 2018?

FINAL

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
Yes. The issue is that it is bit distorted by higher NatCat events. The way, when we have
NatCat, we reserve a lot and then we ran that oﬀ relatively quickly. And then you see that
volatility -- so as NatCat reserves go down then you have higher -- sort of less high
reserves and that normalizes. So there is no decreasing trend in the numbers.

And we'll take our next question from Farooq Hanif with CrÃ©dit Suisse.

Bloomberg Transcript

Just going back to the Allianz customer model, I liked your Spotify description as kind of a
good way of understanding it. But it is quite radical and it is resulting in a lot of change in
a way that you do business and the way your peers do business. So just wondering what
the -- your employee response has been to it? How they feel about it? And importantly,
also, your agents, how on board are they with it, particularly given development of the
direct platform. Second thing is, you used to have EUR 400 million or so of annual spend
on digitalization, has that continued? Because I know your IT budget has gone up a little
bit? So I just wondered what your annual spend is? And lastly, going back to the expense
ratio reduction. From switching oﬀ legacy IT as you move to the ACM, how quickly will we
see the impact of that in cost cutting?

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
So -- and Giulio can also chip in as he feels ﬁt. So the employee base is actually static in a
positive sense because we're ﬁnally starting to produce beneﬁt from innovation in one
business to moving that to another one. And the key thing is, again, you create modules
for people to use. So for example, we have established the Allianz product library and a
product conﬁgurator in the Allianz business model, which allows you to bring product
design much quicker to the marketplace, bring innovation much faster to the marketplace
and then get beneﬁts out of it. For example, our top OEs in Motor are going to be on all
of the same pricing -- real-time pricing model, relatively soon. So you can see beneﬁts
from comparing pricing algorithm across markets and that gives us competitive
advantage. On the direct platform, there is always nervousness. But I call that phantom
pain. It's like people that have no arm talking about the pain in the ﬁnger. Why do I say
that, because there is no cannibalization. There is no cannibalization between direct and
non-direct. We can see that in Italy and we manage that, by the way, very carefully in the
way we approach the market. The client, however, he or she decides at the end of the day
how and where they want to buy from us. That is the person who decides what we do is
neither the distributors nor the product people. And we need to have a competitive oﬀer
that is scalable in the direct world. That is actually the key item when you think about
competitive dynamics, sorry for being a bit strategic. The digital players have one big
advantage. They work on platforms that are scalable. So with every additional clients, the
average cost declines. We have, unfortunately, the reverse business model that shows that
it's 250 years old. Our costs are unit links step upwards for every volume increase and
Page 20 of 28



FINAL

every price increase, we pay more cost, mostly on distribution. And we need to get out of
that trap. It's a long-term journey. But it's essential for us to get started as quickly as
possible. On IT, we're spending EUR 3.6 billion a year on IT globally. About EUR 600
million for that is on Asset Management. By the way, they are going up because, for
example, PIMCO is massively investing in technology with its new tech center in Austin.
That also explained a bit the increase in the cost-income ratio there for the year. And that
will not go away. What we have to do is invest it more smartly. We always say that we have
been taking older business models and put them into new bodies, i.e. new IT. We need to
make sure we switch oﬀ the old stuﬀ and use the money wisely to simplify our product.
Now in terms of beneﬁts coming through, great question, don't know the answer yet. We
are starting and we're going to exert enormous pressure on product and systems
retirement, not just for productivity reasons, gentlemen. But also for IT security reasons.
The biggest source of IT risk is old, undocumented IT systems that we run. So we need to
make sure that we retire our old legacy systems as quickly as we can. I cannot give you a
speciﬁc number on what the cost beneﬁts are. Giulio has some estimates and with that, I
hand over.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yes, I wanted just also to talk about your question about how much we are spending on
digitalization and similar. So we changed a little bit taxonomy of how we are tracking the
IT spend. But I can give you an idea. When we look at the IT change, which is about EUR
1.5 billion for 2019, we are spending about 1/3 of the IT change in productivity measure.
That has a lot to do with digitalization, simpliﬁcation of products. So 1/3 of this budget
gets into productivity. Then we have about 20% that we are spending in growth and
innovation that's also tied to the topic of changing processes as we also interface with the
customer. Then, we have about 10% to 16%, which is the commissioning. That's not
necessarily about investment in digitalization. But that's about removing legacy system.
This will allow us then clearly to free up resources for further investment in digitalization.
So a lot of the budget that we are deploying in IT goes into the topic of productivity,
digitalization, removal of obstacle, if you want, to have a easy infrastructure to deliver our
services.

in the future. So I'm just wondering if you can give sort of rough guidance as to how you
expect that to develop in the future years? And when I look at the results you just
reported, Q4, in particular, I guess, it was a little bit light. When I look for the whole year,
you say loadings and fees. You say we're up in line with growth. But -- plus the EUR 100
million, I guess, is a little bit lower than the growth rate you are seeing. So I'm just
wondering if you could square that. And when you look at guaranteed savings and
annuity business, that's been a very stable quarterly contributor to operating proﬁts. But
Q4 was down I think about 200 year-on-year. You talked about U.S.A. and unit-linked
reclassiﬁcation in France. But I don't think those were huge drivers. Looked like the U.S.
Q4 result was reasonably good and maybe a huge driver. So just wondering if I can
understand those moving parts. Then very quickly, on Asset Management, you said you'd
had a good start to the year. I was wondering if you could just give an update on ﬂows or
any other comments you want to make.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Asset Management. Maybe let's start from the Life side. Your other question about how
the investment margin is going to develop, I guess, beyond 2019. The range for '19 is 80
to 85 basis point. I would say that the new business margin should -- not the new business
margin, sorry, the investment margin should somehow stabilize towards the 80, maybe
could go down to 75. But then I would say that will be where the new -- the investment
margin is going to stabilize. Always keep in mind that the reserves are growing. So there
is an oﬀset. But that's also the reason why when we had the Capital Market Day, we also
said that the growth rate in Life is more about 3%. That's the reason why we need to get.
And value new business to go up. So that we can add to the growth level operating proﬁt.
So that's already all reﬂected in our thinking. You were asking questions about the
guaranteed savings in annuity. And you are referring to the federal number both for the
year and also for the quarter has been low. This is also driven by the VA, variable annuity.
Just trust me, when you have volatility up and then VA is going to go down and when you
have volatility down, VA is going to have a very nice proﬁt. Just to give you an idea, in
2017, the VA operating proﬁt, just from the United States, was EUR 260 million. That's a
big number. That's a block, which is less than EUR 30 billion. So when you have a 1%
margin on the VA reserve, that's a huge, huge margin. Now this year, we had EUR 40
million, which is clearly not as good and that's because the volatility has been higher. But
you really need to normalize the 2017 results. And the same applies also to the quarter.
When you look at the quarter, clearly, the volatility was very high. I just also tell you that in
the quarter, in VA, in the U.S., we had a small loss. So the numbers up to September were
indeed not that bad. Then in the Fourth Quarter, clearly, you have a loss. That's also the
reason why we stopped doing VA many years ago because we don't really like this kind of
volatility. Then I think you had a question on the loadings. And this is honestly speaking a
little bit too detailed. I believe there is always some sort of noise. So I wouldn't just
necessarily (notate) the growth and say automatically is going to reﬂect in the way we are
calculating the loadings here. Then on the ﬂows, I can tell you that the ﬂows in Q1 or in
January have been good. For PIMCO, we had EUR 5 billion of ﬂows and that's important
for me. When you look at 2018, it's true that we had negative ﬂows at PIMCO. But what is
important, you don't see a trend. I will be concerned if you see a trend. But when you see
the ﬂows are positive in some quarter and we have a very good quarter and then
sometimes are negative and then they go back to be positive, then I would really say this
has to do with volatility. Sometimes you might lose some big mandates and they might
not really be mandates with a high fee. Then a while back you get -- later you get this
Page 22 of 28

money ﬂowing through. So I really don't think there is any issue. PIMCO, on the opposite,
the performance is so good that I believe PIMCO is the place you want to go and invest if
you are an investor.

And we have a question from Jonny Urwin with UBS.

Q - Jonathan Peter Phillip Urwin

Just 2 quick ones on P&C, please. So what drove the 1.2 points of attritional pressure on
the loss ratio in Q4, please? I suspect it's just large losses, quarterly volatility. But any color
on the underlying development would be good. Secondly, on average, across the
booking and P&C, could you give us a rough estimate of where claims inﬂation is
running? And is the trend positive or negative?

A - Giulio Terzariol

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 6126952 <GO>}

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay. So coming from the -- answering the question on the attritional loss ratio. I will say
that in reality, this year you see less of a volatility compared to the volatility we saw last
year. And up here really looking at the attritional loss ratio even adjusting for weatherrelated and large losses. So that's the number that you don't see but I see. So last year in
the Fourth Quarter there was, if you want a drop in the attritional loss ratio compared to
what we saw during the year, this year you see more stability. And I believe the ﬁgures
that we see this year are more reasonable because you should anticipate a bit drop in the
loss ratio towards the end of the year. And this has to do, yes, with some volatility. But this
has to do also with the fact of when they actually start doing also the review of the trueups. And this year, there is more stability throughout the year compared to what we saw in
2017. So I will say, there is nothing to read into that. One thing that we are looking. So if I
just had to go into the details, it's the development on the property portfolio in Spain. But
here, we are speaking of a EUR 400 million to EUR 500 million portfolio. There were
some weather-related losses in 2018. But also we think there is more than that. But we
need really to go into the details, otherwise, on the macro level, I don't see any reason to
look at the 2018 number. So the last quarter and in clear from that, that there is a
deterioration on the overall book. And there was another question?

Q - Jonathan Peter Phillip Urwin

{BIO 6126952 <GO>}

Claims inﬂation. I'd say it's -- we don't see a lot of claims inﬂation clearly. If you are in
Turkey, you are going to have a diﬀerent view. You're going to say there is a huge claims
inﬂation. If you are in the U.K., you might have a slightly diﬀerent view because of the
pound depreciation. There might be some more claims inﬂation. But in general, when we
look at markets like Germany or we look at Italy or we look at France, we don't see
necessarily claims inﬂation. Also, when I go through the diﬀerent entity, you might see
sometimes an increase in severity, not necessarily because of claims inﬂation, can be
because of other reasons. But usually, you see a decrease in frequency. So we don't see
markets where you have, for the same time, an increase in frequency and severity. So
usually, you might see one thing going up, the other one going down. So there is not
much pressure from a overall claim situation on our numbers.

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

Just -- in the past, Guilio, you spoke about capital management in terms of 3 silos;
solvency, liquidity and leverage. I'm mean, clearly, the solvency looks very strong. You've
articulated that the liquidity, 3 OEs in the last business had diﬃculties with remittances.
And I've noticed also that the leverage ratio has moved up quite substantially over the
years. So can you comment on those 3 silos? Also, I just saw a headline on Bloomberg
saying that Allianz makes slow buybacks to make small acquisitions. Can you talk about
the interplay between the size of deal and the impact on potential buybacks in the future?
And ﬁnally, just in terms of M&A internal capacity, in the past you'd said, you may have
EUR 10 billion of M&A capacity. Could you give an update of where you are with that
capacity given the 3 silos?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yes. So the 3 components clearly are relevant. It's about the solvency, the liquidity and the
leverage ratio. Nothing's changed on the 3 component. Also, when you look at the
leverage ratio, it went up but just because the unrealized gains went down. If you look at
our debt position, has not changed in 2018 compared to 2017. So the only reason why the
leverage ratio went up is because of the movement of the IFRS equity. But not because
we have increased our leverage position. So from that point of view, our philosophy has
not changed. And with a diﬀerent market environment, our leverage ratio would have
been 26% instead of 27%. By the way, I feel pretty good at 26%, 27%, that's absolutely a
good level of -- a reasonable level of leverage.
On M&A, yes the EUR 10 billion, I always said, EUR 10 billion is potentially there. But
there's also a stretch. Also I said that's technically possible, I'm not so sure we will go for a
EUR 10 billion acquisition where we use only cash index. But that's technically a possibility.
I'm not so sure I understood your question about the buyback and the deal size and if a
buyback is -- they to announce before...

Our next question comes from William Hawkins of KBW.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

I'll be quicker on star one next time. Can you just talk again about the sensitivity of your
solvency II ratio to rating migration. From what I'm understanding, that's something which
is eﬀectively completely ignored on Slide B7. So with regards to your Solvency II ratio,
what work have you done to think about the scenario analysis for rating migration? And
what would be the impact? That's kind of question one. And for the sake of your time, just
quickly. On Slide B35, in terms of your earnings per share growth, do you think your past
couple of years of realized gains and impairments is a normal level that we should be
plugging in as part of your earnings per share growth? Or could the normal rates be
higher or lower?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

I'll start with the second one. I would tell you, when you look at the -- below the line item.
So we're not just focused on realized gains and impairment, I would also take into
consideration for restructuring. I will tell you that on the below the line items, you can
work with an assumption of about minus EUR 1 billion, right? So which will be more or less
the average between what we had this year and what we had in '17. So that could be your
working hypothesis on how you look at the below the line items. And on the question
regarding the solvency ratio sensitivity and the impact of credit immigration. We did some
exercise and -- which, in my opinion, is conservative -- sorry, not conservative, it's
aggressive because we said that if we have one notch of rating migration, the Solvency II
ratio of Allianz group would drop by 9percentage point. To me, looks like maybe it's a
little bit aggressive. I think it might be a little bit worse than that. But the point is, if you ask
me, there's not really a meaningful sensitivity. And that's the reason why we decided to
show at Page A12, what would happen to our solvency ratio if we have a crisis like the
Page 25 of 28



FINAL

Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2019-02-15

2018 crisis, which was a credit crisis. Because if you just look at the one notch rating
immigration, everything else doesn't change. Honestly speaking, that's really not a big
deal. But we know that we have really a one notch rating migration. There is nowhere that
equity market are not going to go down. There is nowhere that the boons is not going to
become negative. So we need to start doing all these kinds of exercise. And we believe
that, what we showed at Page A12, it's a fair representation of what would happen in a
major credit crisis, which we saw, by the way, that's the beauty. We have seen that just 10
years ago. And so that's how we look into this kind of question. So we are not ignoring
the point. I tell even more that we set our management ratio based on this scenario. We
set our liquidity position that we want to keep at the holding level based on this scenario.
So that's part of our management thinking and of our risk management appetite. And that
changes is much more severe than just saying one notch less credit rating and everything
else is unchanged.

Bloomberg Transcript

Just one question. In P&C insurance the price increases on the renewals, they were 1.2%
after the 9-month period and 1.4% for the full year, which implies an acceleration of price
increases in the Fourth Quarter. Can you say a little bit about where this price increases
came from? And is there a trend somewhere, a new trends or new initiatives, anything like
that?

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
Yes. We see a little bit of an improvement compared to what we had in -- reported a few
months ago. And this is mostly driven by little bit Australia, then Italy. But especially
AGCS. I mentioned AGCS before, that's -- there is a little bit of turning in the market. Now
there is no doubt and that is also not immaterial now, we need to see how signiﬁcant it's
going to be especially in the sense of the length, right? Because if you adjust a little bit of
an adjustment and then rates are going to stabilize or go back pretty quickly, this is most
likely not going to hurt much. But if we continue to see this kind of acceleration in the
renewal rates. And maybe also little bit more widespread then I think that could be a
strong sign for the future. Now it's a little bit too early. But deﬁnitely we see signs. As I told
you before, I had a meeting going -- line by line with the management team of AGCS.
And you can see that there is some signs of strengthening, call it, a hardening, not yet is a
attempt of hardening. And I think that might turn quickly also real hardening.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Just a short one. With respect to the bolt-on acquisitions, you suggest there was some
speculation about Allianz looking at VIVAT in the Netherlands. Would that sort of qualify
within those bolt-on metrics that you speak of? Then the commentary you made around
leverage. And I appreciate that your debt stack hasn't moved. But is it fair to assume

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
I will say, you should not expect any issuance in the normal course of activity. And with
regard to the VIVAT, that's what you mentioned. Let's put it this way, clearly acquisition of
this size might be bolt-on. But as usual, we don't speak about individual companies but
yes any acquisition, which is in the EUR 1 billion premium, something like that's might be a
bolt-on acquisition.
