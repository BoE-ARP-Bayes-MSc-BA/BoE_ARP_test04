Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thanks, Dennis. So this morning, we reported Fourth Quarter net operating income of
CAD79 million, or CAD0.70 per share, down from the particularly strong CAD0.82 from a
year ago. The early winter's impact on claims frequency and higher losses than expected
from weather events in 2010 led to results below our expectations in our auto businesses,
while strong results were reported in our other lines of business.
Overall, our combined ratio at 98%, up from last year's robust 94.6%, reﬂects higher
catastrophe losses and lower favorable prior-year development. Looking at the current
accident year, I am pleased to see an improvement in the loss ratio of 70 basis points
versus the Fourth Quarter of 2009.
Net income for the quarter was CAD97.5 million, or CAD0.87 per share, up 7.4% from last
year. We announced today that we are increasing our quarterly dividend by 8.8% to
CAD0.37 per share, marking the sixth consecutive year that we've raised our dividend.

Bloomberg Transcript

We also reported that we intended to renew our share buyback program once our current
program expires. We believe that our strong ﬁnancial position aﬀords us the ability to
return capital to shareholders, while retaining the ﬂexibility to actively pursue broad
opportunities in the market.
Our growth strategies continued to pay oﬀ, with a 4.8% increase in our premiums, despite
our cautious approach to new business in Ontario auto and the cancellation of certain
commercial group accounts in the prior year, which we've discussed a number of times
last year. Our continued top-line growth reﬂects our organic growth initiatives, as well as
improved industry pricing conditions, primarily in personal lines. For the full year,
premiums rose 5.2%.
Overall, our underwriting performance and steady investment income resulted in an
operating ROE of 13.2% in 2010 and GAAP ROE of close to 14%, notwithstanding our more
than CAD800 million in excess capital. This is evidence that our strategies and action
plans are working.
Moving on to our outlook for the P&C insurance industry in 2011, I would like to comment
on growth, underwriting, as well as ROEs. 2010 has very much played out as we had
anticipated for the industry. After nine months, the industry has recorded 5.3% premium
growth in auto, driven by Ontario; 9.5% growth in personal property, in reaction to years
of heavy water-related losses and more frequent and severe storms; and 3.3% income in
commercial lines. We expect more of the same in 2011, which should translate into a
growth rate for the industry in the mid-single-digit range.
From an underwriting perspective, again after nine months, the industry is tracking at
about a 102% combined ratio. For 2011, we anticipate some improvement in personal

Page 2 of 19

Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2011-02-09

lines, resulting from auto reforms in Ontario and continued premium increases in
personal property, but do not foresee the industry earning an underwriting proﬁt.

FINAL

Finally, looking at the industry's return on equity, we do not expect improvement in the
near term from the 7% level that it stood at through three quarters. Although underwriting
income might improve slightly, we anticipate this would be oﬀset by the negative impact
on investment income from the low yield environment.
Looking speciﬁcally at Intact Financial, we believe that we are quite likely to outperform
the industry's ROE by at least 500 basis points, which is our stated objective in 2011, given
our current level of outperformance at 700 basis points for the ROE, our combined ratio
advantage, our yield advantage and our signiﬁcant capital management ﬂexibility.
Speciﬁcally for Ontario, while the true eﬀectiveness of the reforms will not be known for
several months, initial signs are encouraging and consistent with the views expressed in
the past few months. It is important to reiterate, however, that the reforms were not
intended to address the degree of fraud that became apparent in the last year. That is why
as a Company we are taking actions to ﬁght fraud well beyond what the reforms were
meant to accomplish.

Bloomberg Transcript

For the industry, we estimate that the combined ratio is still well north of 110% and that
premiums remain inadequate. As such, the level of approved rate changes for the
industry announced earlier this year is a positive sign, but does not fully address the
inadequacy in the system. Outside Ontario, the proﬁtability of our auto businesses is
strong and conditions remain relatively stable.
Pricing conditions in commercial lines remain soft, although we've beneﬁted from ﬁrmer
prices in the past year in a number of segments where we operate. Empirical evidence in
the quarter continues to highlight that our focused approach is paying oﬀ in our
commercial P&C business. We were able to grow our units 2.5%, in conjunction with
putting through over 3% higher rates, while our reported top-line growth was more than
5%, if we exclude the impact of the canceled group that I referred to earlier.
In conclusion, 2010 marked a successful year for the Company, as our strategies and
action plans continued to pay oﬀ. We grew our top line by more than 5%, improved our
combined ratio by more than 3 points to 95.4% and increased our net operating income
per share by almost 50%.
From a capital perspective, we ended the year with a strong balance sheet, despite
having returned CAD0.5 billion to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share
repurchases.
Looking ahead, we are excited about our prospects for 2011 and beyond, and believe that
our disciplined underwriting and robust capital levels place us in a strong position to
beneﬁt from the environment in which we compete.

With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Tullis.

FINAL

Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles. Fourth-quarter underwriting performance was healthy, but below the
particularly strong results of a year ago. The combined ratio at 98% exceeded last year's
94.6%, with a more normal seasonal weather pattern, compared to the unusually good
weather last year.
Prior-year development was favorable at 5.3% of opening reserves, but less than last year,
which included a CAD22 million release related to minor injury cap reforms. Top-line
growth was solid at 4.8%, while earned premium growth reached 5.3%.
Slide nine shows results by line of business. In personal auto, top-line growth slowed from
6% in the Third Quarter to 4% as we adopt a cautious approach to new business while we
make sure that the Ontario auto reforms and our auto action plans unfold as expected.
We are also focused on managing and combating the ongoing issue of fraud.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our disciplined approach to the Ontario auto market has led to a loss ratio
outperformance versus the industry, which accelerated from 6 points in 2009 to 14 points
in the ﬁrst nine months of 2010. Renewals in the coming quarter will beneﬁt from rate
increases already in the system, and units should beneﬁt as competitors raise rates.
Of note, underwriting results in Ontario were 5 points improved versus the prior year.
Overall, the personal auto underwriting loss in the quarter is due mostly to Cats, as well as
to the impact on claims frequency from the early winter driving season. Excluding the
impact of Cats in prior-year development, the current-year loss ratio improved 0.8%.
Let me provide more detail on the level and nature of our catastrophe losses in the
quarters. We are typically quite accurate in estimating the impact of weather events.
However, this year, there were a couple of prior-period storms where I believe we could
have done a better job, and where, with the beneﬁt of a few months of hindsight, it is
clear that we underestimated the impact of these storms.
One in particular, the rain storm that hit Ontario and Quebec from September 29 through
October 1, was unique in that it overlapped two quarters. In total, the Cat losses in the
quarter and for the full year fall into what I would consider a normal level, but 2010 again
illustrated the lumpy nature in which they tend to occur.
In personal property, top-line growth continues to reﬂect low-double-digit premium
increases, partly oﬀset by a small drop in units. We increased segmentation initiatives in
the past 12 months, and are comfortable losing unproﬁtable business. In fact, retention is
best for the most proﬁtable customers.
The 91.7% combined ratio was strong, but trailed last year's unusually strong 87.8%. We
estimate the impact of our home insurance action plan to be roughly 13 points of
Page 4 of 19

FINAL

combined ratio compared to the initial target of a 10; to 15-point improvement through
mid-2011. While we believe the improvements already in place would get us to the top
end of this range, we maintain focus, including rate increases, product changes and
claims management.
Commercial auto reported solid results in the quarter, both from a top-line and bottomline perspective. Premiums rose 5.8% and unit growth was particularly strong at 7.4%. The
combined ratio of 93.9% was solid, but above last year's very low 70.4%.
Commercial P&C premiums increased 3.6%. While market conditions remain very
competitive for new business, retention rates are solid, despite 3% rate increases at
renewal. Underwriting income of CAD12.1 million was much improved from last year's loss
of CAD7.4 million, as the combined ratio improved 10 points to 93.8%.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the investment side, we generated about CAD73 million in net interest and dividend
income. We expect this level of investment income to continue in the near term as growth
in invested assets is likely to continue to be largely oﬀset by the impact of the low yield
environment. The continued market improvement positively impacted our AOCI balance,
but also generated a loss on embedded derivatives. Book value per share increased 10%
from a year earlier to CAD27.37 per share.
We ended the year in a strong ﬁnancial position, with approximately CAD800 million in
excess capital. Debt-to-total-capital at 13.9% remains below the target ratio of 20%.
Because of our strong ﬁnancial position and the quality of our earnings, we continue to
return value to shareholders through an 8.8% dividend increase, as well as the renewal of
our normal course issuer bid.
With over CAD1 billion in excess capital and additional debt capacity, we have plenty of
room to return capital to shareholders while retaining the ﬁnancial ﬂexibility to pursue
strategic growth opportunities.
Before closing, I would like to touch on capital requirements. In December, OSFI released
a discussion paper on revisions to the MCT. OSFI had previously announced that the
impact would be neutral to industry capital levels, and we were surprised that the
discussion paper as currently drafted would lower aggregate industry MCT by
14percentage points, and a little less than that for Intact.
We have provided impact to OSFI on what we view as this most conservative outcome. It
is too early to say how this process will end. However, we see no change in our plans or
strategy as a result.
In summary, Intact remains well-positioned through its continued focus on operational
excellence. We will continue to leverage our strengths and to take advantage of
opportunities in the market.
With that, I will now turn the call back to Dennis.

Thanks, Mark. Stephanie, we are now ready to take questions.

FINAL

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Andre Hardy, RBC Capital Markets.

Q - Andre Hardy
Thank you. I have three questions. The ﬁrst, on the quarter, what would the combined
ratio have been if the Company didn't have to adjust reserves for storms that happened
earlier this year -- so in 2010 calendar year?
Secondly, can you comment on the timing of implementing a shareholder rights plan, and
what triggered that thought process?

Bloomberg Transcript

And thirdly, Mark, related to your closing remarks on capital, one of the issues is that
anything with a long duration will have a higher capital requirement. Can you comment as
to whether perpetual prefs are still an attractive investment with higher capital
requirements potentially?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thanks for your question. I think Mark will take one and three, and I will take the one in the
middle.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

In my remarks, when I talked about the adjustments due to prior storms, what I really was
talking about was not from prior years but from prior quarters. In the stat supplement,
we've added something new this quarter, where we break down Cats by line of business
and we actually show how much of the Cat is due to prior years.
There was what I would consider a fairly small Cat adjustment due to prior years, sort of in
the CAD1 million sort of range. But about half of the incurred Cats this quarter, I would
consider more accurately reﬂected to prior quarters.
So the sort of things I talked about in the -- if you look at the CAD27 million of Cats, about
half of that, I would say, you could view as having maybe been more accurately reﬂected
in prior quarters, as opposed to this particular quarter. And the net result is about 2% to
3% higher -- better combined ratio.

Q - Andre Hardy
Okay. That's helpful.

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

FINAL

On the last one, let me make one other comment on the -- and one reason this is -- we say
things like until this settles, it is sort of unclear what the results will be. There's the
required capital levels and what we consider as excess capital is a function of many
things, including, for example, rating agency requirements.
And the rating agencies have their own formulas. Many of the rating agencies already
reﬂect duration of assets. So it is not a one-for-one thing, that if OSFI changes a formula, it
would have a one-for-one impact on our particular situation. Because it depends, for
example, on how the rating agencies react, if at all.
But clearly, one of the -- for our particular business, which tends to be short-term, one of
the things we do look at is the extent to which perpetual prefs, which do have long
durations, would impact the capital requirements. And obviously, it changes the relative
attractiveness if -- depending upon where the OSFI rule ends up.

Q - Andre Hardy
And does it change it enough that the Company might incur some realized losses that
today are unrealized as a result of these new capital rules?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I would say it would reduce the relative attractiveness. It doesn't necessarily follow that it
would make them completely unattractive, and --.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I don't anticipate meaningful realized losses at all, in fact, on that front. And I would like to
point out, Andre, that our exposure to ﬁxed rate perps is roughly a third lower at the end
of this year than it was at the end of last year.

Q - Andre Hardy
Okay.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

The second question, the shareholders' rights plan, I think -- ﬁrst of all, let me say that you
shouldn't read anything into that, other than when the Group sold its shares in 2009, I
think there is a number of things we had to tackle as part of that look that -- what it meant
to be an independent company. Did a fair bit of analysis on that, had lots of discussions
with the Board.
Felt that this shareholders' rights plan is good for shareholders from the point of view that
it gives you more time to assess proposals when proposals come in. And therefore,
decided to go ahead with it and will present it to the shareholders at the upcoming
annual general meeting. Nothing to read into this, beyond just updating our toolbox
here.

FINAL

No.

Q - Andre Hardy
Thank you very much.

Paul Holden, CIBC.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. A question for you regarding distribution. In particular, regarding the
Desjardins acquisition of Western Financial and how that may or may not impact the way
you distribute product in Western Canada.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

We have a multichannel distribution strategy, Paul, which includes Intact Insurance, which
distributes to brokers, which includes BrokerLink, which is a broker that we actually
manage ourselves and own 100%, which is meant to grow at the speed of a direct writer,
which also includes in the Alberta marketplace a business called Grey Power, which is
100% owned by ourselves. So when I look at our toolbox in the Alberta marketplace and
in the West, we really have a fulsome, multichannel distribution strategy.
The reason why we have this strategy is twofold. First of all, because consumers change,
their demands change, their approach changes, and we want to make sure we can
distribute our product through a number of channels. The other reason why we have a
multichannel distribution strategy is because we expect that over time, new entrants will
come into the marketplace and that the landscape will change, and that is why we are a
team, in advancing that strategy.
So the change -- or the acquisition of Western Financial Group in Alberta at the high level
will not change the strategy that we are currently pursuing, because it is because of things
like that, actually, that we are developing our multichannel distribution strategy.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. So it won't necessarily change the way you've approached the direct market in, say,
Alberta -- selling insurance through a direct channel?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Page 8 of 19



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

FINAL

Well we have Grey Power in Alberta, who sells product to people that have been driving
25 years or more. And we have BrokerLink, who is developing rapidly in that marketplace
through advertising and through the web. And I think as the market evolves, we certainly
will calibrate our distribution strategy to be best-equipped to deal with new entrants. But
this acquisition is not changing our strategy much, no.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Then maybe a somewhat related question in terms of consolidation in the
brokerage community. Is that something you are still pursuing through Canada
BrokerLink, and how robust do you think the opportunities are there?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

That is a good question. The focus when we talk to investors is of course about large
manufacturing opportunities. But BrokerLink has been developing pretty quickly. And just
to give you an example, BrokerLink in the Fourth Quarter actually closed an important
transaction which will bring more than CAD95 million of direct written premium to
BrokerLink -- not necessarily to Intact Insurance, but to BrokerLink -- which grows that
business unit by close to 25%.

Bloomberg Transcript

That is an example of the fact that there are consolidation opportunities in distribution,
and clearly, BrokerLink is one of the players with strong ﬁnancial backing. So it is in the
cards to grow that business like that.
However, I want to point out that our core strategy with BrokerLink is to build a strong
organic growth machine, with a strong footprint, a strong technology platform and an
ability to generate response through marketing, similar to what direct writers could do.
And I think we've talked about that at the Investors Day. I talked at the Investors Day about
a desire on our part to participate in distribution consolidation, and clearly, that is what
BrokerLink has been doing.
I also would like to point out that, as you know, we have equity participation or
partnerships with a number of other brokers, from coast to coast, and we tend to line up
with very strong entrepreneurs who want to grow their business, and we will keep doing
that by supporting these guys through ﬁnancing and equity participation.
It is very clear to us that in personal lines distribution, scale is very important. We repeat
that to brokers as often as we can. Because in personal lines, to compete eﬀectively in the
future, one has to be able to invest in technology, one has to be able to invest in
response, and that is clearly what we're doing with our own business units, and we want
to help brokers keep doing that.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Final question, one of the other parts of your growth strategy is potentially expanding
outside of Canada. I realize that is going to take time. But is there any update you can
provide us with since the last time you spoke about it?

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

No. I think -- just one thing to put things in context. When I talk about our growth strategy,
I've outlined in the past what would pay oﬀ in the short-, mid; and long-term. And I've
talked about the need to invest now to build a long-term pipeline. This is what the
strategy is all about.
I would say that we spent a fair bit of time last year doing research in terms of where the
opportunities could be. We have identiﬁed a number of opportunities which we are
studying at the moment, but not prepared to give speciﬁcs this morning.

Q - Paul Holden

Charles, the improvement in your personal property, the claims ratio, excluding
development and Cats, certainly, it has improved a lot if you look at it over the last, say, 12
months or so. But the improvement -- it is becoming clear that the improvement is starting
to moderate, as you've essentially successfully implemented all those strategies.
When you think -- when we look going forward -- ﬁrst of all, is that a fair statement, that
the improvement is moderating? Then secondly, have you exhausted all the options you
have available to you to take that claims ratio down? Or is there more that you probably
could announce at a later date?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Let me pass this one along to Martin Beaulieu, Mario.

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

Clearly, 2010 is a good year for the industry and for ourselves in personal property. I see
the pressure though continuing to build on that line of business, as the trends and costs,
mostly due to water losses and also weather-related losses, is not going away. So we've
had a good First Quarter in terms of weather, but I think it is not the end of it.
So we are foreseeing that the market conditions will remain hard for 18 to 24 months still.
And we have middle of the range of our 10 to 15 points improvement plan achieved. But
we are not letting the ball drop on this, so we are continuing to invest in prevention claims
and product changes, such that we would maintain a focus on the combined ratio. We
don't expect, though, that the combined ratio itself will go much lower than it is right now.

So you would feel like you have accomplished -- you'd feel successful in this endeavor if
you were to maintain things at current levels?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

I think that a fair statement -- I would say, Mario, if you look at -- ﬁrst of all, when Martin
says middle of the range 10 to 15, he is referring, I think, to 12, 13 points at the moment.
I think if you look at 2010, we have improved our combined ratio by about 13 points over
that period. You have seen the improvement in that line of business moderate a little bit.
And the question is, is there much left in the pipeline. I would say if you look at the direct
written premium, this -- the rates in the direct written premium in the Fourth Quarter were
up 7%. I don't think there is 7% inﬂation in the system at the moment. So clearly, from my
perspective, there is still some room there. Certainly not at the pace we've seen in the
past year, but I am hoping for marginal improvement.
The other thing, as Martin is referring to, is that we still have initiatives in claims, we still
have supply chain management initiatives that will support our performance in home
insurance in the coming period.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Thank you for that. A question perhaps for Mark. While this call has been going on, I've
been trying to look at the yield you disclosed, the dividend interest yield, and just
compare it to any external metric, whether it is like a ﬁve-year -- Canada ﬁve-years or 10year yields. And you can see some relationships, but nothing -- not as strong as I would
have expected.
With rates -- and I acknowledge more on the US moving higher, not so much in Canada -is there anything you might point us to to help us understand how quickly that yield
would change in relation to the broad interest rate environment?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

So I think a couple of things. The yield curve in the US has tilted more so than the one in
Canada. And as you know, we invest 100% Canadian. So unless there is similar yield curve
movement in Canada, we wouldn't be as aﬀected by much.
The other thing is the average duration of our bonds is fairly short. So changes in what -- I
believe what has mostly happened in the yield curve is the very long-term bonds have
gone way up, and there has been less movement in the sort of short to mid bonds. So I
would say unless there is an increase in the ﬁve-year rate, I wouldn't see our bonds being
impacted that much.
You know, we have a fairly signiﬁcant amount of our investment income from shares, so
dividend yields obviously have an impact as well. I think the comments I made at the
beginning, during my prepared remarks, that in the short term I don't see much change in

Page 11 of 19



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2011-02-09

investment income is -- whatever -- relatively small changes in the yields are more or less
oﬀset by the relative changes in the amount of investments.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

I would like to add, Mario, that we are certainly not pricing for higher yield at the moment
--

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

I understand.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

-- when it comes to the product.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

And Mark, the short term means what -- 12 to 18 months?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Yes, during the coming year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Okay. Then a ﬁnal question. Going back to the preferreds for a moment, or any ﬁxed
income securities, to the extent that these are securities issued by the banks -- and take
into consideration what we learned from OSFI not long ago -- there could be some -- the
banks could certainly be motivated to buy back or call these preferreds.
And I'm not referring to any innovative Tier 1 capital, where there could be an early call.
I'm just suggesting that -- could Intact beneﬁt in terms of the value of some of these
preferred shares or any other securities issued by banks, to the extent that the banks truly
are motivated to buy these back earlier? Are you seeing any kind of lift as a result of that
OSFI announcement?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

That's one possible scenario Mario. I think when we look at what we are doing here, we
are looking at that as one possible outcome, versus other outcomes, where prefs could
become less attractive, back to your original question in terms of capital requirement.
And we are trying to weigh all of that information in terms of assessing what is the optimal
ﬁxed rate perpetual position here. But it is deﬁnitely one scenario, indeed.

FINAL

A question about your comments about the P&C industry, talking about despite the
potential combined ratio improvements, don't expect the industry to earn an
underwriting proﬁt in the next 12 months.
Well the industry combined ratio, as you said, is around 101 or 102. So under that scenario,
it doesn't look like you are talking about much improvement in the industry combined
ratio. And so why don't you think, given the fact that you are seeing some pricing
improvements overall, how come you do not expect to see an industry combined ratio
improvement? Then do you expect to see a combined ratio improvement for Intact, and
why would Intact expect to have any combined ratio improvement over and above what
the industry would?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Let me talk about the industry, because I don't -- when we talk about Intact, we are
basically saying that we are pretty conﬁdent we will outperform the industry's ROE by at
least the objective we have been pretty consistently stating over time.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm just talking about combined ratio here, more than ROE, right?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, I know. Let me talk about the combined. So at the end of September, it is indeed 102.
I anticipate, all else being equal, mild improvements in the combined ratio of the industry,
based on the outlook. I think there are a couple of factors that I would like to put in
perspective for the industry.
The ﬁrst one is that, overall -- and I think we've said it in 2010 -- 2010's First Quarter was
pretty good. And in fact, if you look at the seasonality on page 11 of our MD&A, you see
that for us -- and I would suspect that compares for the industry -- from a seasonality point
of view, the First Quarter was at 98% of the year, while the average -- the six-year average
First Quarter combined ratio relativity was about 101. So I think that is one source of
caution, Tom, that I am bringing for the industry.
The second source of caution that I am -- that was implied in my remarks there is that
when you look at the reserve development patterns of the industry, it has been much
closer to 1% to 2% -- or 1% historically, while in the recent years, '08 and '09 at least, the
industry's favorable reserve development has been in the 3.5% to 5.5% range. I personally
don't see that continuing for the industry.
And you might say we are getting into some details, but this is what is bringing my
caution in relationship with the industry's combined ratio improving by more than 2
points. I would be -- it's possible. I would be surprised.

FINAL

When it comes to Intact Financial, deﬁnitely the First Quarter of 2010 was very strong
because of the weather -- in part because of the weather; in part because of our action
plan. So I think that comment applies. I think that from a favorable reserve development
point of view, I do think we are in a better position than the industry, if I just look at the
historical standard.
Third of all, I think that while the industry is catching up slowly on pricing, I do think that
our action plan, which has paid oﬀ in terms of combined ratio expansion in 2010, will
continue to pay oﬀ in 2011.
I would rather stick to my statement that I feel pretty conﬁdent we will outperform the
industry's ROE by more than our stated objective.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

But you don't have an objective in terms of how you would outperform the industry
combined?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

And the reason for putting in comments about what is happening in the industry, is that
because, in part, your results would have to be related to the industry's -- the movements
in the industry? Is that what you are trying to ﬂag here?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well what I am trying to ﬂag is to give some context for my view on the industry's ROE.
And that is why we talk about the various components of the industry. But as you know,
we've been very cautious since becoming a public company of being too speciﬁc about
our own performance per elements of the P&L. I think that is the right approach, and I
intend to stick to that.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. Then one quick follow-up, maybe Mark. On the operating earnings that you've put
in there, was the tax rate somewhere around 18% on the operating earnings? And what
should we be looking -- should we be looking at something closer to 20% going forward?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Yes, from memory, so there was a decrease of about 2% vis-a-vis last year. And we actually
-- there is a reconciliation in the ﬁnancial statements. I think it is Note 9 or something like
that. But just a couple of (cough).
There was a reduction in the statutory rate, which is the base rate of about 1.5 points this
year. So some of the reduction year-over-year, the biggest driver was basically the

FINAL

reduction in base tax rates. And as you know, a few years ago, there was a reduction put
in place that is scheduled to reduce a little bit more over the next couple of years. So I
would see a little more reduction in the base rate.
But the big thing that drives the movement generally from year to year or quarter to
quarter is the proportion which is represented by dividend income. This particular
quarter, quarter-over-quarter, the big driver was the reduction in the statutory tax rates.
And that is -- we would consider that a permanent reduction, unless, of course, they
change the tax regime again.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

So what should we be looking at more like -- on an operating basis? Closer to something
under 20% going forward -- possibly under 20%?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

You know, the way I look at it -- because I don't look at it as operating; I look at it as
dividends and then everything else. And again, it is -- yes, I guess you can expect a little
bit of increase -- or a little bit of decrease over from where it is this year going forward. But
the statutory rate should reduce slightly next year.

Q - Andre Hardy
Just two cost-related questions. The ﬁrst, if you look at page four of your supp pack, you
had an increase in commissions-related expenses, even though the claims costs also
increased. And I was always under the impression that some of the commissions are
based on proﬁtability, and there is often a bit of an oﬀset where if the proﬁtability
deteriorates, commissions tend to go down. So if you can help me understand what
happened, that would be helpful.
And the second one on costs relates to fraud prevention. Have you put in place the
people and the systems that you need -- presumably it is more people -- to prevent fraud?
And if not, how much more cost should we expect the Company to incur?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Why don't you start, Mark, with commissions? And I will take the fraud question.

A - Mark Tullis

FINAL

Sure. So you are right about the -- I would say other things being equal, the commissions
do tend to go up when the proﬁtability goes up. There are reasons in the short run you
can have apparent dislocation, if you look at it in total.
One is the proﬁt scheme changes. It is diﬀerent in every province, and it tends to be either
two-year or three-year averages. The other thing is diﬀering proﬁtability between direct
business and the brokerage businesses. So if you have a quarter where the brokerage
business does relatively better than the direct, and then you're looking at total proﬁtability
numbers, the premium could do diﬀerent. If you have situations where one province does
better than another, you can have diﬀ --.
So it is tough to look in total and draw a conclusion, other than over the long term.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

But I think the most important driver here -- and I think your observation is very good,
Andre -- is driven by the fact that there has been a divergence in the last year between the
direct performance and the brokerage performance. That is what explains this
observation.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think on the fraud thing, we've got people in place, and this is part of the cost of doing
business and I wouldn't expect a meaningful bottom line that you would see from that.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well the work that they'll do, I certainly expect a loss ratio improvement. But I would not
anticipate meaningful cost pressure as a result of that. We have put as -- we've talked
about 40 people in place earlier this summer. And we beefed up a bit in the fall, invested
in technology. But nothing that will move the needle from an expense point of view in the
coming period.

Q - Andre Hardy
And your expectation is you would save more than what you've put in, presumably?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Deﬁnitely.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

FINAL

Just a couple of quick follow-up questions then on personal auto. If you look at the
change in direct written premium per insured risk in personal auto, over last few quarters,
that number has been a fairly strong number, 5%, 7%-ish. In this quarter, it kind of sinks
back to low single digits, the way we've seen in the past. Is there anything you can point
us to that would help understand why that would sink this quarter?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. I mean, the main reason is that we have slowed down marketing and advertising in
the fall in the GTA, basically. As reforms unfold, I think we want to make sure that we want
to give more credibility to the initial signs that we are seeing.
As I've said, I think the reform is sort of turning out as we anticipated, but it will take some
time to assess. And we have been cautious in terms of putting ourselves out there from an
advertising point of view. And this is, I think, one of the drivers in terms of why the unit
growth has suﬀered in Q4.
And you know what? I do expect, Mario, that for the coming three to six months, we will
have a bit of pressure as a result of slower advertising activity in the GTA.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

I see what you are talking about from a units perspective, but the direct written premium
per written insured risk, also the year-over-year growth there, we are not seeing what we
saw in the past. I would've expected the pricing increases to still be in the system and take
that higher.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. Well let me talk to that speciﬁcally. I think that one of the elements that we've
observed -- and I've talked about that a number of times before -- but in personal lines,
when you look at the mix, you recall the notion of average size of account.
So this is not rate-driven, because from a rate point of view, we are seeing, as I mentioned
earlier, close to 7% in personal prop, close to 3% in automobile insurance. But the mix in
personal prop is down 3.6%. So what it means is that we insure more condos, more
tenants and smaller houses.
Then we are seeing a mix shift of about 2.7% in automobile insurance. And I don't know,
Martin, if you want to comment on that. But I suspect this is one of the drivers of the
question that you are asking, as well.

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

No, but that is exactly the mix that does that then. And on top of more condos and
tenants, I think even in the home insurance. The premiums that -- the way we have

Page 17 of 19

restructured our pricing algorithms, we are driving away more of those -- we increase the
price more, and they tend to be in the higher-premium band.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

FINAL

I was referring more speciﬁcally to personal auto. Is there -- there's a mix element there as
well that would --?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

2.7%.

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

And for the year, it was more in the just below 1%, so --.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

The mix in personal auto.

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. That's right.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

So just less -- cars that are less expensive.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well it goes beyond that. If you look at the young driver growth we would have, for
instance, in the direct writing operation, if you slow down the speed at which you grow
your direct writing operation, in theory, the average age goes up a little bit. And as a
result, your mix goes down a little bit in that.
But Mario, I think that I'm giving you one example of what might drive mix. There are a
number of other examples, such as provincial mix as well. The speed at which you grow in
the provinces, where the average premium is lower -- so we are now talking outside
Ontario -- would have been greater in relative terms this year. So that would be another
driver.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks for your help.
