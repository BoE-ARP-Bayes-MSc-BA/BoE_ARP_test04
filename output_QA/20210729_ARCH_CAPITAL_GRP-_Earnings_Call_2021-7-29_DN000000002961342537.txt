Thanks Liz. Good morning and thank you all for joining our Second Quarter 2021 Earnings
Call. At Arch, our playbook remains simple yet effective. We protect our capital through
soft markets and on lease, our underwriters during hard market. We believe that this time
tested strategy gives us the best chance to generate superior risk adjusted returns over
time. You should expect then from us at this stage of the cycle come straight from that
playbook. As long as rate increases, support returns above our threshold, we will continue
to grow our writings. We have seen this video before and the hard market of 2002
through 2005 when P&C results generated a sustainable stream of earnings for several
years after market prices peaked and were fully earned. And so again this quarter, the
power of Arch's diversified platform is evident in a strong underlying earnings in each of
our operating segments. We delivered a 13% annualized operating ROE and aided by
good investment returns and annualized net income ROE of 21% this quarter. One item
that stands out this quarter was our strong P&C underwriting activity, Our P&C insurance
results demonstrate significant improvement in underwriting performance. Better market
conditions allowed our teams to expand their overall positioning and grow net written
premiums substantially over the same quarter last year. We are now in the sixth
consecutive quarter of rate increases at plus 10% this quarter, comfortably in excess of
loss cost trend estimates. The higher level of premium earned from the post-2019 policy
years is a primary driver of our improving underlying accident year combined ratio. About
2/3rd of the combined ratio improvement was due to lower loss ratios attributable to rate
increases and underwriting actions we have taken over the past several years. The
balance of the improvement was driven by a lower expense ratio. Production increased
across most lines of business and geography areas as pricing improvements spread.
While rate increases have tapered off from previous highs in some lines, we're seeing
increases in lines that had been immune to meaningful changes and in lines where price
increases are eased. We're still getting rate on rate increases and improving margins. We
estimate that approximately 30% of our insurance premium growth reflects rate
increases. About 50% is from higher net retention level and the remaining growth comes
from new business and exposure growth with existing clients. Both our international and
US insurance platforms continue to excel in the current market with substantial growth in
professional lines, programs, property and travel and A&H writings. Our reinsurance group
also had a quarter of strong growth while producing strong underwriting results. A large
portion of this growth, results from our ability to leverage our expertise and historical
experience as a writer of quota share business. When markets dislocate, our clients need
capacity and capital as they seek to reshape their portfolio. That's why since 2019, we
have been increasing our participation in side by side quota share arrangements. This has
always been part of our reinsurance playbook and based on historical patterns, we
believe a good place to deploy our capital for the next few years. As you may have heard,
this market is notable as rate increases in traditional XOL reinsurance lag, the insurance
rate increases. So our current preference is to be closer to the primary rate increases
through a quota share with our clients. Property CAT excel is one of the few areas where
we have reduced premium writings. They are down 26% as we are not finding enough
opportunities that meet our return expectations. However, as you can see in our
supplement, premium writings grew substantially in property, other than CAT and

specialty segments. Casualty and Marine also produced excellent levels of growth. As with
insurance, we expect the ongoing rate improvements to be reflected in our underwriting
results over the next several quarters. The Arch arrangement story is want to providing
creative capital solutions during hard markets that enables us to leverage our growth
faster than in our primary insurance markets. We have considered this a core capability
throughout our history. Our reaction to this market is no exception.
All in all, it was a very satisfactory job of seizing hard market opportunities by our team.
[Inaudible] as they say. From a strategic standpoint, it's worth noting that we, along with
our business partners, successfully completed the purchase of Watford at the beginning
of the third quarter and are focused on working to build a sustainable reinsurance
franchise. Allow me now to switching inflation fears, which continues to be a hot topic for
our industry. I want to reiterate our perspective on how we view inflation at Arch. As
underwriters, we study inflation on a line by line basis to price the business and
established reserves and some lines like Workers' Comp, inflation remains low at this
stage, I'd say 0% to 1%, however, in other lines like high excess general liability, we're
estimating inflation to be in the 8% to 12% range. As a point of comparison, loss cost
inflation from the ground up, has been in a 3% to 5% range for around 5 years, broadly
across our portfolio. It's important to consider line of business specifics when we discuss
claims inflation. Second, it's worth noting that in every line of business, the inflation rate
increases as you move up attachment points. The key in pricing or reserving for an excess
policy is to start with the proper ground uptrend and then applied the best curve to select
a range for the trend in the upper layers. As is often the case in insurance, we are
estimating and there is a lot of uncertainty around the correct number. Our philosophy is
to keep this methodology consistent through the cycle. Third, we also supplement our
analysis with some subjectivity. In the current environment and in certain lines, we add
trend to try and account for the increased uncertainty, including the possibility of the socalled social inflation. We are typically more willing to adjust a trend above our indications,
then we are to reduce it, all with creating a margin of safety in mind. This is not a new
concept at Arch but a time tested philosophy that has allowed us to navigate both soft
and hard markets through our opportunistic cycle management approach. Let's turn now
to our mortgage group, which continues to operate as a well-oiled machine generating
$250 million of operating earnings in the quarter.
Our insurance in force remains steady at roughly $278 billion for US primary MI. Refinance
activity has slowed and we expect improving persistency throughout the remainder of the
year and into 2022. Delinquency rates are decreasing across our portfolio and we still
expect a large portion of delinquencies to cure based on many factors, including the
strong equity position of our current inventory, where more than 95% of delinquent
policies have over 10% of equity. New notices of default continues to decline and at 7400
in the second quarter are better than pre-COVID levels. Outside of the U.S., we increased
our writings in Australia as a housing market remains strong. We like the long-term
opportunity in Australia as demonstrated by our announcement to acquire Westpac's LMI
business, which we now expect to close later this quarter. Pricing remains competitive but
rational across the MI industry has rates now back to 2019 levels. However, the credit
quality of borrowers remain strong similar to 2016, supporting our confidence in the
continued earnings from our mortgage insurance portfolio. As I close my prepared
remarks, this quarter I'll borrow from cricket which is top of mind because this weekend
marks Cup Match here in Bermuda when the entire island goes cricket crazy for four-day

holiday weekend. I think of the current P&C market like being the first team to bat during a
cricket test match. Test cricket is one of the few sports that isn't governed by a clock.
Unlike games that must be completed in 60 or 90 minutes, test cricket is about scoring as
many runs as possible as long as you are getting favorable balls or pitches for baseball
fans and for as long as it takes for all of your batsman to be out. The details are not critical
but the idea is that similar to this market, we're waiting for the right ball and scoring as
many runs as possible while we can rather than swinging aimlessly we'll do what we
always do, play defensively when we have to but become aggressive and score as many
runs as possible when the opportunity arises. We're not as worried about the clock
running out, we'll just keep scoring runs. Now, I bowl it over to Francois to run through the
financials.

{BIO 5980907 <GO>}

Thank you Marc and good morning to all on this first day of the Bermuda Cup Match
Classic. Thanks for joining us today. Before I provide more color on our excellent second
quarter results, I should remind you that consistent with prior practice, the following
comments are on a core basis which corresponds to Arch's financial results excluding the
other segment, i.e., the operations of Watford Holdings Limited. In our filings, the term
consolidated includes Watford. As you know, we closed earlier this month on the
transaction we announced late last year to acquire Watford in partnership with Warburg
Pincus and Kelso. Concurrent with the closing, we will be making changes going forward
and how we report our equity interest in Watford results which I will share with you in a
few minutes. As Marc shared earlier, we had an excellent quarter with each of the three
legs of our stool performing very well in our investment portfolio also producing solid
results. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $407.2 million or $1 per share,
resulting in an annualized 13% operating return on average common equity. Book value
per share increased to $32.02 at June 30, up 4.8% in the quarter. In the insurance
segment, net written premium grew 43.3% over the same quarter one year ago, 38.5% if
we exclude the growth due to the COVID related recovery in our travel accident and
health unit from the same quarter one year ago. The insurance segment's accident
quarter combined ratio, excluding cats was 91.4%, lower by 470 basis points from the
same period one year ago. The improvement in the ex-cat accident quarter loss ratio
reflects the benefits of rate increases achieved over the last 12 months and changes in
our mix of business. In addition, the expense ratio was lower by approximately 180 basis
points since the same quarter one year ago, primarily due to the growth in the premium
base. As for our reinsurance operations, we had strong growth of 63.6% in net written
premiums on a year-over-year basis. The growth was observed across most of our lines,
but especially in our casualty and other specialty lines or strong rate increases and growth
in new accounts health increased the top line. The segment's accident quarter combined
ratio, excluding cats stood at 87.1% compared to 87.5% on the same basis one year ago.
As we have discussed in the past, we believe the underlying performance of our
reinsurance segment is better analyzed on a rolling 12-month basis, which typically
smooths out the impact of certain large transactions and-or claims that can have an
impact on quarterly results. On that basis, the ex-cat accident year combined ratio stood
at 84.3% over the last 12 months, lower by 660 basis points from the prior 12 months with
the improvement almost entirely reflected on the loss side, as a result of the rate
increases we have observed over the last 6 plus quarters. Losses from 2021 catastrophic

events in the quarter, net of reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums stood
at $46.5 million or 2.4 combined ratio points compared to 13.5 combined ratio points in
the second quarter of 2020. The activity in the quarter was the result of a series of small
events across the globe and some late reported claim activity from the North American
winter storms Uri and Viola in February. Following up on the trends we have seen in the
last few quarters, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our mortgage segment remains
very manageable. In particular, the delinquency rate, which came in at 3.11% at the end of
the quarter is now close to 40% lower than it was when it reached its peak during the
pandemic, at the end of the second quarter one year ago. We had another solid quarter
in terms of production, and with refinance activity coming down from prior levels, we saw
the insurance in force for our U.S. MI book remained relatively stable. Of note, this quarter
was the exercise of calls features by the GSEs on certain vintage credit risk transfer
contracts, reducing the insurance in force for a non-U.S. MI portfolio. The overall impact of
these calls was an approximate one-time $31 million benefit to our underwriting income,
approximately two-thirds of which came from the release of prior-year loss reserves, and
the rest from the call premiums received. The combined ratio for this segment was 26.5%
reflecting the lower level of new delinquencies reporting during the quarter. Income from
operating affiliates was strong at $24.5 million, mostly driven by an excellent first quarter
at Coface. As a reminder, we report our ownership interest in Coface's results on a
quarter lag into our financial statements. As regards to Watford, the closing of the
transaction on July 1, gave rise to a reconsideration event and as a result, we revisited our
VIE analysis. Based on the new governing documents of the entity, we have concluded
that while we will retain significant influence, we will not control the entity going forward.
Accordingly, we will no longer consolidate the results of Watford in our financial results,
starting with our third quarter financials and our 40% share of Watford results will be
reported in the income from operating affiliates line along with our proportionate share of
other operating affiliates such as Coface and (inaudible). As a result of the closing of the
transaction, we also expect to report a one-time non-recurring gain of approximately $65
million in the third quarter. Total investment return for our investment portfolio was
positive 150 basis points on a US dollar basis for the quarter. Net investment income was
$89.4 million during the quarter, up $10.7 million on the sequential basis, driven by lower
investment expenses and interest received on funds withheld transactions. The duration
of our portfolio remains at one of its lowest levels in our history, 2.31 years at the end of
the quarter, reflecting our internal view of the risk and return tradeoffs in the fixed income
markets. Equity in net income of investment funds accounting for using the equity method
returned approximately $122 million during the quarter, a key contributor to the growth in
our book value. The effective tax rate on pretax operating income was 7.6% in the quarter,
reflecting changes in the full year estimated tax rate that geographic mix of our pre-tax
income and a benefit from discrete tax items in the quarter. Turning briefly to risk
management, our natural cat PML on a net basis decreased to $676 million as of July 1, for
the Northeast peak zone down to approximately 5.6% of tangible common equity and
well below our internal limits at the single event one in 250-year return level. On the
capital fund, we issued $500 million of 4.55% perpetual fixed rate preferred shares in
June. We expect to use the proceeds to redeem all or a portion of our outstanding Series
E non-cumulative preferred shares in September 2021 and to use any remaining amounts
for general corporate purposes. Separately, we repurchased approximately $7.8 million
shares at an aggregate cost of $306 million in the second quarter, bringing our year-todate share repurchases to over $485 million or approximately 45% of our year-to-date
net income, all while growing our book value and top line. As we have said since our
formation 20 years ago, we are strong proponents of active cycle and capital

management. We believe this quarter results demonstrates our ability to execute on this
philosophy and leads us to invest in opportunities where we believe the returns are most
attractive. At current prices and with the prospect of improving returns, we believe buying
back our shares represent another compelling value proposition for our shareholders
without compromising our capital flexibility. With these introductory comments, we are
now prepared to take your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. If you have a question at this time, (Operator Instructions) Our first question
comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, thanks, good morning. My first question is on capital (inaudible). Francois, while you just
said right, you bought back less than half of your earnings to start this year and I believe
going into the year, you guys thought you had more than enough capital to support your
growth, the growth that you thought you would see, so should we think about a pickup in
potentially capital return if that statement is true in the back half of the year? And can you
just update us, would you be willing to be active buying back their stock during wind
season just given you know that it seems like you have a good level of excess capital.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 5980907 <GO>}

Sure. On the second question, Elyse, yeah, we're--while in our early days and I'd say premortgage years, we were somewhat more careful with share buybacks during the wind
season. We're not--we're now, as you know, a lot more diversified so I think that constraint
or that reality is maybe less applicable than it used to be. But yeah certainly as we think
about share repurchases or capital deployment throughout the second half of the year,
we certainly think that we could be buying back more shares. I mean, our top priority is still
to invest in the business and grow the business as best we can. But as you saw this
quarter, I mean, we were able to do both and then some--and like to think that if things
stay where they are or within reason, we would be doing the same in the second half of
the year.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, and then in terms of your insurance segment, so you guys still seem pretty positive
by 30% of the growth came from rate increases in the quarter, positive on pricing, a little
bit concern of that inflation which we heard throughout the industry. So broadly, as you
guys are thinking about the pricing environment as well as just what's going on with
inflation, do you have a sense of for how long you think pricing should continue to exceed
loss trend broadly across insurance recognizing obviously it's many different lines that
come together?

Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2021-07-29

There is a question that will lead all of us, if you get the right answer to riches, Elyse. But I
think it's fair to say that the market momentum is clearly there. I think you heard on other
calls that that push for rate and increase the rate adequacy and getting to a better level is
shared among most in the industry. I think there's a recognition between some of the
losses that have occurred in the past and cat losses included some uncertainty and social
inflation, cyber risk as well as no property cat events, obviously that have occurred. I think
there's --and the interest rates being lower, I think there is a recognition that the prices
need to go up. I think I will just give you a quick anecdote, some of our folks are doing file
audits on the reinsurance side, that is, with some of our clients who are competitors of
ours as well and the common threat of theme that seems to come through the audit is
that the-- the underwriting community is recognizing that more needs to be done and you
can see this evidenced in a discussion that they have with brokers. So we're very--we're
very secure. I think there's going to be quite a bit more runway to this--to this pricing
improvement.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

And then one last one on the reinsurance side, it sounds like Francois while from your
comments that it's true duration in the quarter was more just kind of one-off. I guess, as
we think about going forward, my question more is, as we've seen the shift to more of
longer-tail lines within that book and away from property, would you expect the underlying
loss ratio to deteriorate or is it just that there was just some one-off factors in the
quarter? We could still see improvement in that on a go-forward basis?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 5980907 <GO>}

Yeah. In terms of modeling, I think it's going to go up and down right? And I would say the
numbers we quoted in terms of the rolling 12 months is probably as good, it's a good
starting point. The business mix, yeah, there'll be some fluctuations here and there. But
yeah, we want more casualty but we wrote also a lot more other specialty which is maybe
combined ratio is there a bit better. So it's hard to pinpoint exactly where everything, I
mean what's going to happen obviously, in the next few quarters. But I'd steer you to the
kind of the rolling 12-month number that I quoted to be - that should be a good starting
point.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Elyse, if I may add to that point and we also bear in mind at Arch, we tend to be prudent
in reflecting all the margin improvement (inaudible) on. So we'll have to wait and see what
it is, I just want to make sure we keep that in mind as we go forward.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful, thanks for the call.

Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. So first this is the question on pricing and obviously your comments are
pretty positive, but can you sort of compare and contrast what you're seeing on the
primary side versus what you're seeing in reinsurance broadly?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah, so on the insurance side, there's a lot more activity, more price pickup on the
insurance side and that's why on the quota share basis, even though the ceding
commissions have not decreased as much as they would have otherwise in other hard
markets, I think that if you're in a quota share basis, you essentially taken - you are
participating alongside your clients in terms of rate increases. So whatever rate increase
that would have included in my remarks on the insurance, you could ascribe to the quota
share reinsurance participation. On the excess of loss, it tends to always lag a little bit
behind the some benefit from the underlying rate because the excess of loss pricing
typically, is a percentage of the underlying portfolio. So to the extent that some rate
increase at the primary level, the excess of loss would get presumably a bigger
percentage, but I think that it would be safe to say that the softer markets probably gave
a bit less adequacy or it's probably more of a need for price pickup in the excess of loss,
in general and would probably expecting this to start to happen soon. I think there will be
some recognition that is sort of a second derivative of typically of a hardening market.
Hope that helps.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

And are you equally optimistic or are there are signs - you mentioned property cat may
be slowing down a little bit, but are you equally optimistic about the sustainability of the
trend on pricing in both reinsurance and in insurance?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes, on the excess of loss because like I said, I go back to 2002 to 2005 market. I think
that the excess of loss market got probably a lot better, it took like 2004 to get there. So
you need a couple of years of primary rate increases to start to find its way with their way
onto the reinsurance excess pricing. It's a very normal hardening market. So I'm very
encouraged actually.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Yeah. And then just lastly, you mentioned, credit quality on the MI side being strong. How
are you -- and obviously, the labor market is very good as well. But how are you thinking
about high property prices and just inflated values for homes and how that factors into
your view of the business that you're writing now?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

If you were in a equilibrium in terms of supply and demand or the supply was plentiful,
we'd be worried. That would take us back to the 2006 and 2007 period, but the supply
and demand on the housing is such that it should help maintain the pricing for quite a
while. We have 1.5 million to 2 million homes missing in the marketplace and it takes a
while to find their way to the market. It is also under build as you know, as we all read in
the press. So from our perspective, the house price appreciation, is there, we look at over
or under evaluation. We also have these metrics from our economist and not seeing
significant national over-valuations, so that's not another - yet another not a concern and
the interest rates are still pretty low at 3%. The mortgage rates, i.e., at 3%. So the
affordability is still pretty high compared to historical metrics. So all of these put together,
it's never one dimension, right, you mean that you look at, I think overall if you crossed
across everything it tends in the positive direction.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.

Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

So I think I'm asking the same question from the last two conference calls, so I'm going
ask it again. I look at the reserve releases in mortgage and I look at the reserves per new
case in the 2Q '21 numbers and you are reserving more than ever for new defaults or
delinquencies as you're releasing the reserves, yet the housing prices are appreciating.
I'm trying to figure out what the math is about why the potential claim for loss keeps
getting worse?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 5980907 <GO>}

While you're asking a very good question Josh, I think big picture as you know, we're still-there is still a lot that has to happen before we have more visibility into how the--in how
the forbearance loans are going to--are going to pan out, how they're going to -- whether
they're going to cure, whether they're going to turn to claim. And as you know those are, I
mean, that's an 18-month process, so we--if we look at the peak months of April and May
of last year, their 18 month period will expire unless things change should expire in the
fourth quarter of this year. So that's one, we'll certainly have again more visibility and have
a more definitive view on how to, I mean whether reserves were too high or not. And so
that's where we sit on that at this point. We're reacting a little bit to the data but again, we
still feel there is quite a need-- a lot that needs to be settled before we--we take, I'd say
action on the current reserve levels. In terms of the new delinquencies, there's always
tweaks that happen every quarter. You look at the average, the incidence rate and how
severities and frequency assumptions that we put on the new delinquencies that get
reported this quarter. Again, it's a smaller inventory of new delinquencies so I wouldn't-there is a bit more leverage and how those numbers play out but big picture, I think we're

Page 9 of 16



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td

Date: 2021-07-29

still very comfortable with our reserve levels. Yes, I think in implying maybe that we got
too much, that's a possibility. But again, we'll know more in the second half of the year.

FINAL

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

So when I look at the reserves, I guess the $55 million reserves were current accidental
year period put up in the fourth quarter. Is that a strengthening of average claim for the
entire portfolio or is that a--is that a--we think the new claims being put on 2Q 2021, have
the potential to be worse in terms of severity then the average claim currently on the
book?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 5980907 <GO>}

Yeah, I think it's the latter. We didn't-we didn't really make any adjustments in terms of
prior notices, so notices that were on the books before the quarter started. The thinking
on the new notices is that the fact that they became delinquent kind of this late in the
game, I'd say given that forbearance programs have been available for some time over a
year. We think that there is a possibility that they could turn out worse than the ones that
we got earlier. So there is a bit of mindset, there is philosophy that and time will tell but
given that they might have gone through all their savings and they might have tried a lot
of things and now they finally turn delinquent. So that's a little bit of the, I think the
rationale behind these numbers.

Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey, thanks, good afternoon guys. Marc, this is my first question. Can you hear me? Guys
can you hear me?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes, we can go ahead man.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Sorry about that. So, I had a cycle management question with property cat, yeah I'm not
being critical. I'm just curious. So a year ago, it looks like you wrote $118 million of premium,
in this year you wrote $88 million. So you wrote less. I get the property cat is not the best
place to be but it feels like the rate environment was incrementally a little bit better. So
I'm just - I guess a little bit curious like what goes into the decision to, as conditions

2020?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah, its a really, really good question. So I think a couple of things happened, right.
Number one, we probably, like everyone else have different perception of the riskiness of
the cat book, right. We just had a windstorm in January. So, that will definitely make you
take a different look at the non-model losses, right. There's a lot of non-model losses that
seem to have percolated way more and we expect it over the last two, three years. So,
there's an element of loss cost expectancy. And also as a result of that meeting a higher
margin of safety for your return. That's clearly the number one consideration. And second
one that is not to be forgotten is also, it's an allocation of capital. The same (inaudible)
better use of capital is a risk adjusted of X in cap worth as much as a Y in other property,
for instance, or in casualty. And those decisions are made on a quarterly basis, I would
almost say almost daily. So as you get a broader range of opportunities on the
reinsurance side, specifically, you are able to manage a portfolio and re-optimize the
portfolio as you go at least maybe in a quarter or two quarters ahead. That's sort of the
thinking behind stock of [ph] management with the view of optimizing your return, not
necessarily bidding all out-all out, right. I mean that's sort of a one thing that (inaudible)
told me way back one is that you don't want to be unlucky, property cat[ph] if you have all
these great opportunities and not excluding outside of the cat realm, you probably
(inaudible) a manager to taper it down a little bit also provided because it's not as juicy
perhaps as the other lines are appearing at this point in time. So it's a bit of a window how
we think.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Yeah, that makes sense. It's interesting. And then I guess just in mortgage insurance, in
the attritional loss ratio, I mean, yeah, pretty much at pre-pandemic levels. I guess I was a
little bit surprising just given there are some new notices. And I felt like back in '19 there
almost none. So is this sustainable kind of 15% to 20% attritional or is it something this
quarter that was an unusual tailwind?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 5980907 <GO>}

Well I mean attritional excluding BYD that's-that's how we think about, I mentioned it in
prior quarters where 20% loss ratio was kind of plus or minus that should be what you
should get over the cycle. And there is a bit of noise with the CRT transactions. So I mean
there is moving parts within that, but yeah, 20% is absolutely sustainable.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Got it. And then just lastly, just had a curiosity, I was wondering if you guys would be willing
to share like an internal view of what your excess capital position is?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 5980907 <GO>}

Well, that's something we've made public in the past and I think we are - because it's a
daily, again a moving target, right? I mean there is, we don't know what the market is

going to give us, so we could give you a number but then next tomorrow will be different.
So it just - we rather, we want to keep the flexibility there and that's.

Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. Two, I think basic questions. First, I know there's a lot of commentary at Arch and
elsewhere about if that was prudent reserves because of current uncertainties with
regard to in place. And is that - let me say differently, are you releasing reserves more
slowly now than you would have in the past because of that issue, or is that an at current
accident year, this issue?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

No, I think. Meyer, you and Arch [ph] I am. So you know that inflation impacts current
accident year and prior accident issue, right. So clearly we are - it's part of the-it's part of
the recipe, if you will, of establishing reserves. So we're trying to peg the historical trend
as you know in triangles the best we can to the extent not captured within the loss
development factors. So I think it's on both sides. Does that mean that we are releasing?
Yes, I think that probably means that we historically have been a bit more careful in
establishing our loss pick. If you look back at our history of combined ratio, the insurance
grew specifically, you'll see that we were very much higher than most people were in the
industry. So I think that tells you that we were reserving at that point with the view of the
loss inflation that was one in 3% to 5% and we haven't changed (inaudible) at this point,
except for, like I said in my comments certain lines where it's probably appropriate to do a
bit more.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. No, that--I think that's right (inaudible) it makes lot of sense. Second question in
reinsurance. How should we think about the catastrophe exposure in the non-property
CAT property book?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Well, it's part of this $76 million that Francois mentioned we're accounting for that but it's
definitely less of the cat exposure. There is some in there. But it's definitely not the driver
of the exposure at all. So, you know it depends on what kind of business you look at, the
cat load on these premium is anywhere from 5% to 10%, sometimes a bit higher
depending on the quota share you're writing. But in a lot of our other specialty for sure
have some, but again much, much smaller. So I would say that, still the large--the larger
contributor to our PML is through the cat XL portfolio.

Our next question comes from Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank.

Q - Phil Stef ano

{BIO 18965951 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks and good morning. I wanted you to focus on the MI business. So of the $44
million in favorable development, it seems like just shy of half of that was due to the GSEs
and the cancellation the CRT deal, the other $24 million give or take, can you give us a
sense of the vintage years associated with that or--or what's driving that development?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 5980907 <GO>}

Well, I'll be--I'll give you a bit more specific. So yeah, you're right, just about half--just
slightly under half of the total was from the GSE call deals and about a third I'd say is little
tweaks again in, call it COVID assumptions that we kind of brought down a little bit and
that--that's across - it's across all our book. So it's like a primary USMI, it's across some
CRT deals that are still around that we've made some adjustments on those reserves and
also on the international book so that gives you a perspective. And then there's just, call it,
just under 20% of favorable development on run-off businesses or second lien and
student loan businesses that have been in run-off for--for quite some time. So hopefully
that gives you the split (inaudible) and answered your question.

Q - Phil Stef ano

{BIO 18965951 <GO>}

No. Yeah, that's great, that's great, Thanks. I think the--the PMIERs sufficiency ratio is
pushing up near 200% and maybe you could talk to us about the ability to upstream
capital when the GSEs might let you do that or do you go to the state regulators and
contemplate getting special permission for a special of some sort?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 5980907 <GO>}

Yeah, that we discussed last quarter, that's in the works. Second half of the year, we are we've begun the process already to upstream as you mentioned a dividend from our
regulated entities to the holding company in the US. Some of it will have to be
extraordinary, some of it is ordinary dividend. So there is -- we'll will have to have some
discussions with the regulators on that, I'd like to think that we can get them comfortable
that with our current levels of total capital and some of it, as you know, a lot of it being
trapped and-or within the contingency reserves, I think we'll be able to get them
comfortable that the level of dividends that we're talking about will be - will meet their
needs and ours, so stay tuned. But I'd like to think that we'll be able to extract some
dividends in the second half of the year.

If I can address for one second Phil, the GSEs are allowing you to do dividend without any
approval at 150 or above right now of (inaudible)

FINAL

Correct.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

So, and at the end of the year is going to go down to 115. So we think we have flexibility
even from that perspective, you think you consider them as another gatekeeper of that
dividend payout.

Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes, thanks. Couple of quick questions here. First, the decline you saw in your property
CAT reinsurance. I'm assuming that was just reduction in Florida exposure. And I guess on
that question, what is your Southeastern kind of golf exposure look like today versus last
year?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

It's down versus last year, but the first question of Florida, we had some decrease in flow.
But if you look at premium, it's not as, it's not a one to one thing, Brian. I think that the
reduction was also as a result of buying a few things too, if you will round of the portfolio.
So it's not necessarily all like you know, if we get into this market trying to get our net
exposure to a different level because the returns, we use also some reinsurance buying
to (inaudible) So it's not only in Florida decrease.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you, got you. And then my second question is, now that the Watford deal is closed i t
is in private hands, no longer public company, any material or any meaningful changes in
strategy here that you're anticipating with Watford here going forward, different types of
business they could write etc., etc.?

FINAL

Yeah, I'd say at a high level, I mean still early days, but at a high level, I think you should
think more of Watford as a closer clone to Arch re-business or underwriting than what
Watford was. Watford was - didn't necessarily do all the same classes of business, it was
very much focused but more in the longer-tail stuff because of the additional pick up, the
assumptions that were in terms of investment returns that we're going to get. So the, call
it the 2.0 business model of Watford makes it more similar to what the Arch Re-portfolio
or book looks like.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. So results should actually trend towards - ultimately trend towards what Arch Re
looks like?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 5980907 <GO>}

Much more so, correct, yes.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. And then I'm just curious on Watford, is there ability or any contemplation of
maybe taking on some of your mortgage insurance exposure going forward?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

We actually write some mortgage on Watford. Yes, there is some already existing, it's
actually been one of the things they have done for quite a while. That's also something
that Watford shareholders were very pleased with getting in the opportunity to have
participated.

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 5980907 <GO>}

The only - I mean it's an issue with ratings too Brian. So that's something that the ratings
do matter for, in terms of getting GSE and regulators comfortable. So that's something
that they're going to look into as well. Yeah.

Q - Brian Meredith
