Eilard Friese
Yeah. Good morning. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this conference call to
discuss NN Group's results for the second quarter of 2015. Very good to know we're
hosting this call for the ﬁrst time from our new head oﬃce in the Hague.
I will begin today's presentation by looking at the highlights of the second quarter results,
the progress we have made to deliver on our strategic targets and other key
developments in the past quarter. Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo, our Chief Financial Oﬃcer, will
then talk you through the ﬁnancial details of the second quarter results at group level and
for the individual operating segments. I will then conclude the presentation with a wrapup, after which we will open the call for Q&A. We also have our Chief Risk Oﬃcer, Doug
Caldwell, here with us to answer your questions. So, let's dive in and go to the ﬁrst slide,
slide number three.
NN Group is reporting a very strong set of results for the second quarter of 2015. The
operating results of the ongoing business was up 90% on the second quarter last year.
This was supported by several favorable items in the Netherlands, including a large
private equity dividend. But even excluding these items, we saw healthy performance in
all of our operating units. We realized further cost savings in the Netherlands of €34
million in the second quarter, bringing the cumulative cost savings to €198 million
compared with 2013. So, essentially, we have achieved our €200 million target originally
set for 2016, ahead of schedule.
Although, I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter, there are areas where we
can do even better. That's why we will continue to focus on eﬃciency in the Netherlands,
improving the combined ratio at Non-life, strengthening the capabilities at our asset
manager, as well as increasing the proﬁtability of our international businesses.
The net operating return on equity of the ongoing business of NN Group was 14.9% for
the second quarter of 2015, thanks to the improved proﬁtability in all segments.
Market movements in the past quarter were unfavorable for our capital position. Despite
this, our IGD ratio remained strong at 306% at the end of the second quarter. As part of
our dividend policy, we already expressed our intention to pay semi-annual dividends.
We are today announcing our 2015 interim dividend of €0.46 per share, which equates to
€156 million in total to be paid either in cash or in shares at the election of the
shareholder.
As this is NN Group's ﬁrst interim dividend, let me explain the calculation method. We
intend to pay interim dividends calculated at approximately 40% of the prior year's full
year dividend. Please note that our dividend policy remains unchanged, and for the full
year, we intend to pay an ordinary dividend in line with our medium-term ﬁnancial

performance, envisaging a payout ratio of 40% to 50% of the net operating result of the
ongoing businesses.
Let's move to slide four. Let me run through the three ﬁnancial targets for NN Group as a
whole. Firstly, we set ourselves a target to reduce administrative expenses in the
Netherlands unit by a total of €200 million by 2016. As I already mentioned, total cost
savings to-date are €198 million. So, this target has essentially been achieved ahead of
schedule.
Secondly, we aim to realize an annual growth rate of the operating result before tax of the
ongoing business of 5% to 7% on average in the medium term. The operating result
before tax of the ongoing business for the ﬁrst six months of 2015 of €792 million
represents a 44% increase compared with the same period last year. This growth rate
obviously reﬂects the particularly high results to-date this year, which were supported by
some large favorable items. Given that this is a medium term target, we intend to measure
our average growth rate over a longer period. Lastly, we aim to increase the net operating
return on equity of the ongoing business in the medium term, measured against the pro
forma of 7.1% for 2013. The net operating return on equity of the ongoing business for the
ﬁrst six months of 2015 was 11.8%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's move to the next slide, slide number ﬁve. Aligned with the three targets on the
previous slide, we expect, over time, to generate free cash available to shareholders in a
range around the net operating result of the ongoing business. In 2014, the free cash ﬂow
adjusted for the IPO related items was €450 million compared with a net operating result
of €806 million.
In the ﬁrst six months of this year, the free cash ﬂow of the holding company was €688
million, which included a total of €840 million of dividends upstreamed by our
subsidiaries, including NLI. This compares with a net operating result of the ongoing
business for the same period of €630 million. As you can see, we are making progress.
But please bear in mind that this is an over time target, and there can be volatility in both
the operating result and dividend ﬂows.
Delﬁn Rueda, our CFO, will go into the details of our free cash ﬂow later in the
presentation. Now, on the following slide number six, I would like to go through some of
the important developments in the second quarter of 2015.
As you know, one of the main objectives of our equity story is to return capital to our
shareholders. We have been delivering on that promise since the IPO through share
buybacks and dividend distributions. In February and May this year, ING Group carried
out two sell-downs of NN Group shares. We participated in both of these transactions,
repurchasing shares for a total amount €350 million.
At the Annual General Meeting in May, our shareholders approved the distribution of the
2014 ﬁnal dividend totaling €193 million, which was paid on June 30. About 27% of our
shareholders elected to receive the dividend in newly issued shares. To neutralize the
dilutive eﬀect of this, we repurchased shares from ING Group for an amount of €53
Page 3 of 25

Date: 2015-08-05

million. We also announced today, a 2015 interim dividend of €156 million in total, which
will be paid in September.

FINAL

Taking all these transactions together, the total capital return to shareholders since the
IPO amounts to almost €700 million. We remain committed to returning excess capital to
our shareholders in the most appropriate form, unless we can deploy that capital in other
value-creating opportunities.
Total capital ﬂows to and from shareholders also include a $57 million injection from ING
Group pertaining to NN Bank. Delﬁn will go into this transaction in more detail later in the
presentation. Finally, we have decided to cancel 15.3 million shares that we have
repurchased from ING Group as a result of the various transactions. Our outstanding
share capital consists of just over 338 million shares, of which ING Group's stake is
currently 37.6%.
Let's move to slide seven.

Bloomberg Transcript

Slide seven shows the three pillars of our capital framework and the key metrics that
underpin our strong capital position. The Solvency I capital ratio of our biggest unit, NN
Life, decreased to 281% at the end of the second quarter of this year due to credit spread
widening and higher interest rates, partly compensated by positive revaluations on
private equity and real estate investments.
Please note that NN Life paid €125 million dividend to NN Group at the end of July this
year, and this is already reﬂected in the Solvency I ratio. Our holding company cash
capital increased to €1.6 billion as the free cash ﬂow that was generated in the current
quarter, mainly in the form of dividends we see from our subsidiaries, more than oﬀset the
amounts returned to shareholders in the form of the 2014 ﬁnal dividend and the share
buyback in May. In terms of ﬁnancial leverage, our ﬁxed cost cover ratio went up to 12.9
times. The leverage ratio remained stable at 22.1%, as did the gross ﬁnancial leverage
position of €3.7 billion.
The IGD ratio decreased to 306% at the end of the second quarter due to market
movements. This ratio already reﬂects the 2015 interim dividend of €156 million that we
will pay in early September. Regarding Solvency II, we submitted our application to the
DNB for the usage of a Partial Internal Model for NN Group and the insurance entities in
the Netherlands in May. The Solvency II capital ratio remains subject to signiﬁcant
uncertainties, including the ﬁnal interpretations of the regulations and the regulatory
approval process.
And with that, I would like to hand over the microphone to our CFO, Delﬁn Rueda, who
will take you through the ﬁnancial details of the second quarter 2015 results. Delﬁn?

I will start with the consolidated results. NN Group posted an operating result of the
ongoing business, which excludes the Closed Block Variable Annuity business in Japan of
€488 million in the second quarter of 2015. This is up almost 90% on the same quarter in
2014. As Lard has stated earlier, all of our operating segments showed improved results
this quarter. At Netherlands Life in particular, the operating result was up signiﬁcantly,
supported by a large dividend received from a private equity investment and provision
releases in the technical margin. The cost reductions in the Netherlands also contributed
to the higher consolidated result.
In the right hand side, you can see that the net result for the second quarter increased to
€392 million. This increase was largely driven by the higher operating result. The net
result also includes capital gains and positive revaluations, oﬀset by a negative movement
in the provision for guarantees on separate account pension contracts.
Before going through individual operating segments, please turn to slide 10, which gives
more details on the cost savings in the Netherlands.
As Lard has explained, one of our ﬁnancial targets is to achieve an absolute reduction of
the administrative expenses in Netherlands Life, Netherlands Non-Life, and at the
Corporate and Holding entities of €200 million by 2016, measured against the 2013 cost
base.

Bloomberg Transcript

I am pleased to be able to report that we have essentially achieved our overall cost saving
target ahead of schedule, having realized cumulative cost savings to-date of €198 million,
of which €142 million in 2014, and an additional €56 million in the ﬁrst half of this year.
Having said that, we will continue to progress with the expense reduction program at
Netherlands Life, which we have previously indicated is more backend loaded over 2016.
In the meantime, we will be vigilant of our cost levels, whilst we continue to see upward
pressure on our cost base, such as inﬂation and rise in regulatory cost. And we will invest
in our business where necessary.
Let's now look at the individual segments starting, as usual, with Netherlands Life on slide
11. The operating result of Netherlands Life amounted to €332 million in the second
quarter of 2015, which is signiﬁcantly up on the same period last year. The result for the
current quarter can be largely attributed to a number of items. Firstly, the investment
margin beneﬁted from a €61 million private equity dividend, as well as higher public
equity dividends, which are traditionally received in the second quarter of the year.
As you can see in the far right chart, the investment has spread consequently in Greece to
127 basis points in the current quarter. Secondly, the technical merger includes €27 million
of non-recurring beneﬁts primarily related to our provision release, as well as €28 million
release of the unit-linked guarantee provision due to an increase in interest rates during
the quarter. And lastly, administrative expenses were down, as I showed you on the
previous slide.

On the other hand, fees and premium base revenues remain under pressure, mainly
because of the run-oﬀ of the individual life closed book.

FINAL

I will turn to slide 12 for the results of Netherlands Non-Life. The operating result for
Netherlands Non-Life went up to €45 million, supported by a €9 million private equity
dividend. Administrative expenses went up as we recognized €4 million in restructuring
expenses this quarter. Excluding this, administrative expenses went down almost 4%.
Looking brieﬂy at the two business lines within Non-life separately, we can see that the
operating result in disability and accident was higher, driven by the private equity
dividend, which I mentioned already, which was partially oﬀset by less favorable claims
development. The operating result in Property & Casualty also improved following better
results in Motor, which were oﬀset by large claims in Fire. For Non-life as a whole, the
combined ratio increased slightly to 99.7%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving now to Insurance Europe in page 13. Insurance Europe also reported a higher
operating result, driven by increased fees and premium based revenues, as well as higher
technical margin. The increase in fees and premium based revenues reﬂects higher
traditional life insurance premiums across the region, and higher fees on assets under
management related to the pension businesses in Spain and Romania. The improvement
in cost income ratio is the result of the higher income, combined with administrative
expenses, which remained more or less stable. New sales were down slightly due to lower
pension sales in Turkey, partially oﬀset by higher life sales in Greece and Spain.
Moving now to Japan Life on slide 14. The operating result of Japan Life was broadly
stable at €25 million for the second quarter of 2015, excluding currency eﬀects. The 7%
increase in fees and premium based revenues was driven by continued strong sales and
larger in-force volumes. This was oﬀset by a decrease in the technical margin and the
investment margin.
Administrative expenses were up 5% mainly due to IT expenses. New sales of €124 million
were stable based on historical currencies, but down almost 4% at constant currencies
versus a strong second quarter last year.
Now, turning to Investment Management segment, we can see in slide 15 that the total
assets under management decreased to €184 billion at the end of the second quarter.
This was mainly due to higher interest rates during the quarter, decreasing the value of
ﬁxed income assets, which is the largest asset class in the portfolio.
We also saw net outﬂows of €2 billion in the Proprietary and Other Aﬃliated businesses.
The operating result for the Investment Management segment was more or less stable at
€38 million compared with the same period last year. Higher average assets under
management during the past year led to fee income going up almost 11%. However,
administrative expenses also increased as the second quarter last year beneﬁted from a
€5 million expense release, and we continue to invest in the business.

FINAL

The segment Other, which comprises the holding company, the reinsurance business and
NN Bank, is covered on slide 16. The total operating result of the segment Other
improved from a loss of €42 million in the second quarter of 2014 to a loss of €7 million in
the second quarter of 2015. Let me go through the various elements within this segment.
The better holding result was driven mainly by the following two items: ﬁrstly, funding
cost. Funding cost were down on last year as we used the proceeds of the undated
subordinated debt issue in July 2014 to redeem hybrid debt. As I have highlighted
before, this undated subordinated notes are classiﬁed as equity under IFRS. And so the
interest is not recognized in the proﬁt and loss account, but is taken directly through
equity.
Secondly, holding cost were lower, reﬂecting, among other things, the cost savings that
we have achieved in the corporate and holding entities. At the reinsurance business, the
operating result was down due to lower results in the Variable Annuity Europe portfolio,
partly oﬀset by better underwriting results in the current quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, the result of NN Bank increased. The bank continues to grow in both mortgages
and customer savings, which led to a higher interest margin. On the other hand,
administrative expenses were also up as investments have been made to support this
growth.
I will now move to slide 17 to cover our last segment, Japan Closed Block VA. Japan
Closed Block VA reported a result before tax of €43 million, down from €79 million in the
second quarter of 2014 due to lower hedge results. The current quarter also reﬂects a €12
million reserve release, following an update on observed lapse experience of out-of-themoney policies.
The portfolio continues to run oﬀ. The lower account value caused by the decreasing
number of policies is reﬂected in lower fees and premium-based revenues. The net
amount at risk decreased to €76 million at the end of the second quarter, primarily as a
result of equity markets appreciation.
And with that, I complete the results of our operating segments. On the following slide, I
would like to take you through our free cash ﬂow, capital generation and value of new
business.
Lard already talked about the free cash ﬂow and the capital ﬂow to shareholders during
the ﬁrst six months of 2015. Let me focus on the movement in the holding company cash
capital during the second quarter of the year. In the second quarter, free cash ﬂow at the
holding company was €459 million, which is the sum of the three elements within the
yellow box in the chart. As you can see, this was mainly driven by dividends of €480
million received from our subsidiaries. You will remember that most of our international
units traditionally pay an annual dividend in the second quarter of the year.
During the second quarter, we made a capital injection into NN Bank for an amount of
€57 million. This was done using the proceeds of our capital contribution from ING Group
Page 7 of 25

FINAL

for the same amount, which obviously is reﬂected in the above graph as a capital ﬂow
from shareholders.
These transactions were done to fulﬁll a commitment to the European Commission. The
capital ﬂows, which are holders of €286 million, includes a further two items. First of all,
the €150 million share buyback following our decision to participate in ING's sell-down in
May 2015 as a way of returning excess capital to our shareholders. And secondly, the 2014
ﬁnal dividend paid in June of €193 million.
Altogether, the cash capital position at the holding company increased during the second
quarter to €1.6 billion.
Turning to slide 19, we'll cover the capital generation. This slide shows the capital
generation of our subsidiaries and for NN Life separately for the ﬁrst half of 2015. As you
know, we report on these numbers on a semi-annual basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

The total capital generated by the subsidiaries was €847 million over the ﬁrst half of the
year. This was predominantly generated by NN Life for an amount of €759 million. This
reﬂects positive revaluations of both public and private equity and real estate investments,
as well as ﬁxed income securities following the tightening of credit spreads.
Finally, I will discuss our value of new business numbers on slide 20. In the ﬁrst half of this
year, the value of new business and the internal rate of return were down at both
Netherlands Life and Japan Life when compared with the ﬁrst half of 2014. This was
largely due to the lower interest rates in the period. Insurance Europe was also impacted
by the lower rates, but this was more than oﬀset by higher term life insurance sales in
Belgium, as well as repricing and product mix changes in Belgium, Spain, Hungary and
Turkey.
And with that, I will pass you back to Lard.

Eilard Friese
Yeah, thanks, Delﬁn. So, let's – thanks, Delﬁn. So let's move to slide number 22 and wrap it
up. So, let me ﬁnish oﬀ by saying that we are happy to report this very strong set of results
for the second quarter of 2015, and I'm particularly pleased that all our operating
segments are reporting improved results, and that despite market headwinds, our capital
position remains strong. All-in-all, we continue to make good progress to deliver on our
equity story and achieve our strategic ﬁnancial targets. We have realized cumulative cost
savings to date of €198 million, which means that we have essentially achieved our €200
million target originally set for 2016 ahead of schedule. Our purpose at NN Group is to
help people secure their ﬁnancial futures, and in doing so, delivering an excellent
customer service. If we do this right, this is good for all stakeholders. It also allows us to
deliver on our promise of returning capital to shareholders, and today, we are announcing
our ﬁrst interim dividend as a listed company of €0.46 per share.
And with that, I would like now to open the call for your questions.

Q&A

FINAL

Ladies and gentlemen, we will now start the question-and-answer session. And ﬁrst
question is from William Hawkins of KBW.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 17918548 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Hi, guys. Can you tell me ﬁrst how much of the Dutch Life
investment margin came from public share dividends in the second quarter 2015 and
2014? And more broadly, I'm just trying to get an angle of what do you think the full
underlying ﬁgure was against the €260 million headline in the second quarter, because I
know that €60-odd-million was the public – sorry, was the private equity dividends, but
that still leaves a very high number and I'm trying to work out how much has been
distorted by other dividends and how much is the genuine increase, because it seems to
be coming out nicely, €20 million or so higher than what you've been reporting in
previous quarters. That's question one.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then question two, yeah, if you could just – this may be excessive detail, but did you
tell us on this call that the buybacks you're doing from ING include your view of the
buybacks that are neutralizing the dilution on the dividends you're paying? I had kind of
previously assumed that any dilution from dividends will be oﬀset by just buying in the
market, and the ING buybacks are kind of the additional incremental repatriation of
capital. That sounds like I may have been wrong in that assumption.

A - Eilard Friese
Thanks, William. If I ask that just, Delﬁn, that you take these two questions, multiple
questions really.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Hey. Good morning, William. So, three questions on the investment margin. The public
equity dividends were also much stronger than in the previous quarter by approximately
€16 million higher in the quarter. In terms of the – that investment margin and how much is
sustainable or if there is one-oﬀs, obviously, we have highlighted that the private equity,
private equity can be bumpy. So, but it's true that we have had very good results from
private equity in the previous quarters as well with our €43 million in the ﬁrst quarter, €24
million in the last quarter of last year.
So, it's very diﬃcult for me to talk about a normalized amount for private equity. Public
equity, we saw that increase. But if this might continue or decrease is also very diﬃcult to
establish. Obviously, the element that also show a signiﬁcant improvement in Netherlands
Life is the technical margin, and the technical margin basically has had some positive
eﬀects. We talked about the provisioned release, which is I mentioned explicitly, also the
positive impact on the unit-linked guarantee, that, as you know, that ﬂuctuates with
interest rates. This time, it has been positive in the previous quarters, and last year, we

Page 9 of 25

were seeing the opposite direction. There was also some higher results in mortality in the
quarter and some smaller provision releases in one industry-wide fund.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 17918548 <GO>}

FINAL

Delﬁn, may – sorry, may I just butt in. I got the €16 million is the increase in the public
equity dividends. What was the absolute dividend impact in 2Q?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

I don't know by top of my head, but we'll come back to you with the (29:59).

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 17918548 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

So, then in terms of the buybacks, indeed you have to – we both have shares three times
as you like, €200 million in February, ﬁrst buyback, €115 million in May, but also €56
million or €57 million in 2013 (30:21) by memory, which was the shares that we bought in
order to neutralize the dilutive eﬀect of the stock dividend. So, the neutralization of the
stock dividends are done separately from the other buybacks, and we will continue to do
that. That's the intention.

>: That's great. Sorry if you are misunderstanding. Thank you.

Operator
Next question is from Mr. Cor Kluis, Rabobank.

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Good morning. Cor Kluis, Rabobank. I had a few questions. First of all, on the cost-cutting
program. You ﬁnalized around 99%. Probably today you'll ﬁnalize everything. When – if so,
when could we I think get a new cost-cutting program, what would be an appropriate
moment to talk about – to talk about that, that's the ﬁrst question. Second question is
about dividend upstreaming from subsidiaries, which is year-to-date, of course extremely
strong. That's €40 million I think and including the one in the €25 million from the Life
business, it's €965 million. Can you give an idea of what we could expect, not ﬁgure wise,
but more from subsidiary wise in the remaining of the year of -- or is this mostly EBIT? And
my last question is about Solvency II. You highlighted that or you (31:45) that you also ﬁled
to the Partial Internal Model. Could you give some comments on, you set up a statement
that this (31:53) your standup model was around 200%, is that still the case? Those were
my questions.

FINAL

Yeah, thanks Cor. I'll take the ﬁrst question, the cost savings and then I'm going to ask
Delﬁn to take of that other two questions. So ﬁrst on the cost saves. So with the
cumulative expense saves of €198 million, we indeed essentially achieved our overall costsaving target of €200 million in the Netherlands.
However, that's, let's say, on a group basis, but we also note that we've always indicated
savings also for the operating units in the Netherlands and they're not done yet. Because
in the Netherlands Life for instance, we've always mentioned that the programs that they
have are back-end loaded towards the 2016, and we have not yet completed all those
programs. So that's what we still – what's still be going on.
Netherlands Life target as you may know 15% reduction by the end of 2016 versus 2013
cost base. They've done a lot, but there is still some work that they – that they need to do.
And beyond that, well, our focus remains on unit cost reductions in the Netherlands.
Eﬃciency is crucial in a competitive market, not only from an expense reduction
perspective, but also from a customer experience perspective as eﬃcient processes also
leads to higher customer satisfaction. So we continue to focus on this. We also see
upward pressures on expenses from inﬂation and from increased regulation, especially in
the Netherlands, and if we needed to make some investments to capture eﬃciencies, we
will do so. When it comes to an update on this, we expect to – on our Capital Markets Day
on November 19, to provide an update on the cost evolution. And with that, Delﬁn.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, of course. So, starting with the dividend upstream from subsidiaries, and in particular,
what to expect for the remaining of the year, I think one dividend, of course, which is
certain is what we have already paid in July for NN Life, which is €125 million. And I think
that the other thing that you need to take into account is that the dividends are coming
from mainly Europe and Japan, they tend to come in the second quarter of the year,
because normally, it's more of an annual dividend and not interim dividends. And
therefore, from the €480 million of dividends, actually €470, you excluded €10 million
being – are the coupon on the subordinated debt mainly to NN Life. For this amount, the
majority of it is coming from Europe, but all the segments have been contributed with
exception of Netherlands Life that did not pay a dividend in the second quarter, although
they did in the ﬁrst quarter with €350 million. And as I said, the €125 million already paid
in July.

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

On Solvency II, obviously with the performance so far,. we still feel very comfortable with
Solvency II. We disclosed that with the fourth quarter results that the standard formula was
estimated to be in the range around 200%. And it's fair for you to assume that the factors
which aﬀected Solvency I also impacted Solvency II during the second quarter, albeit in
diﬀerent proportions. Mainly on the greatest spread movements with under Solvency II
have less of an impact because of the application of the Block. So directionally and

despite the capital returns to shareholders, our Solvency II ratio based on the standard
formula has moved up from the estimate calculated at the fourth quarter of last year.
Obviously, there remain some uncertainties, but I think that based on this guidance so far,
we feel comfortable with Solvency II.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I'm just wondering if you could
give a little bit more color or a bit more of an update on the approval process for your
Solvency II Partial Internal Model, if there is was just any additional comments you could
add? And whether you anticipate any delays in the process while given where we are
now, and I think previously you expected some news kind of beginning of Q4, so.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then second one, could you just remind us, I think last year you were saying that you
had about €900 million capital in the Japan Closed Block VA business that would pay out
-- be paid out overtime or must be paid out potentially overtime? Could you give us an
update on kind of how much has been paid out of that business to the whole (37:17) so far
as of end of Q2?

A - Eilard Friese
Yeah, David. So, I'm going to ask Doug to comment on the internal model approval
process and then Delﬁn on the capital of the Japan Closed Blocked. So Doug, over to
you.

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

Sure. On the Partial Internal Model, I think the process is, as we follow, there's not much in
detail we can give as an update. The process runs forward. I would say that at this point,
our expectation of a ﬁnal result from the DNB would be in the – around early December or
in December. So, I would say late fourth quarter would be the time that we would expect
something at this point. But the process will continue and if we have any material news,
we will share it.

A - Eilard Friese
And Delﬁn?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, on the Japan Closed Blocked VA, as it is reﬂected in the press release and the
presentation, we see the run-oﬀ progressing very much as expected, probably with – not

probably, with a bit more redemptions than initially envisaged, but that doesn't change,
you know, the overall pattern over the next couple of years. So, in terms of the capital
distribution, keep in mind that already as of – in the fourth quarter of last year, NN Re paid
€100 million of dividend, and actually I don't think it is explicitly disclosed, but in the
second quarter of the year, NN Re also paid €85 million of dividend to the holding. So
that means that since the IPO, €185 million has already been capital distributed to the
holding company. So, that shows that gradual evolution of the release of the, at the time,
estimated €900 million of capital.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi there. Thank you very much. I just want to ask, I guess two plain questions. Firstly, I just
want to understand exactly what you're saying about the cash ﬂow. So, you got a ﬂow in
your presentation showing how your ﬁrst half of the year the cash ﬂow is close to net
operating earnings, but then there are lots of timing factors.
So, just wondered, I mean, are you going to be close. I mean, does this suggest that
you're going to be close to net operating earnings this year and that you could reach your
target of being around operating earnings quite quickly, so you got at least the medium
term, or is there some sort of major timing issue that you think actually take into account if
you want to make that segment. So, that's question number one. Question two is on
private equity dividends. My experience – my limited experience is that, you get these
dividends mainly, these really big dividends when you have a maturity or closure of funds.
So, you must have a pretty good idea of the likely timing or sort of the envelope of when
you're going to get elevated product equity dividends? So, are we looking for the next
one year, two years, three years? I mean, what can you say about that? Thank you very
much.

A - Eilard Friese
Thanks, Farooq. I'm going to hand over to Delﬁn to answer your questions.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, Farooq. In terms of the mid-term target, we have always focused on these mid-term
targets, because we know that capital generation is volatile and we have emphasized that
every single – in every single color are discussion. Obviously, the dividend distribution
from subsidiaries, as well as our external contribution to shareholders, we're trying to
stabilize that more and have more after the full fund is stable evolution. So, that means
that quarter basis or even on an annual basis, there will be times on which the cash ﬂow
will be below from the operating result in order that it will be higher. So, I don't think it is
right to assume that now going forward is always going to be at the level or above.

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

FINAL

But may I just drop perfectly, so it might just take this year, with all the – do you normally
get some major countries paying dividends in the second half of the year? I mean, you
could just have a Life and then Re, what will be the main contribution in the second half
that will contribute?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

I mean, as I said, it's more within Insurance Europe and Japan where we tend to
concentrate in the second quarter. So, that leaves the other segments, been Non-life,
Investment Partners, NN Re, NN Life, as potential distributors of dividends. Also, we're not
excluding that from the others, but it's not normally what it would be expected.
As a consequence, obviously, the cash ﬂow in the second quarter and for the total of the
ﬁrst six months has been very good. So, that obviously will have the weight for the total
evolution of the cash ﬂows for the year. More diﬃcult to predict it that on the 2016
onwards, although we, of course, keep committed to our midterm target of being in the
range of the operating result after tax of ongoing business. In terms of the private, is that...

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Yes, that's right. Thank you very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Okay. In terms of the private equity dividends, keep in mind that these dividends are
usually related to some disposals of private equity stakes in some of the funds where we
are invested. So, and that in itself, for us, is very diﬃcult to predict when that might
happen as it is a decision of the private equity managers, as well as when these
opportunities materialize, not in private equity, but (43:39) is uncertain and can be bumpy.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

That's true, but I just – they tend to be terms over this three-year exit, ﬁve-year exit. So, I
know there's always going to be diﬀerences in timing, but certain other companies (43:57)
able to give a little bit more certainty over the timeline. So I was wondering, is it going to
be – I mean, is it likely, in your opinion, to be elevated for more than just this year?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

No. Over the last three quarters, it has been good dividends coming from private equity. I
don't have in mind anything in particular that I should ﬂag in terms of giving you guidance
on the size or timing of future private dividends.

Next question is from Mr. Matthias de Wit of KBC Securities.

FINAL

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. I had three questions. The ﬁrst is on the interim dividend policy.
Could you just comment why you decided to – David, on last year's dividend, as opposed
to your ﬁnancial performance in the ﬁrst half of the year. So, you'll now probably pay a
disproportionately large part of the full year dividend in or over the second half of this
year. So, could you comment on how you decided on the split and whether or not it
would inﬂuence with the – or by your discussions with the regulator?
And secondly, I wondered whether you could comment on the potential for balance sheet
optimization. I think you leverage both on a gross and a net basis, it's quite low for the
(45:19) rating requirements you're targeting. So I just wonder how you look at that,
especially in light of the low interest rate environment. It seems highly ineﬃcient to
operate with huge gross cash (45:30) and lower debt levels. And maybe lastly on Japan,
just wonder whether there will be any impact on sales from the recent cutting and
corporate tax rates speciﬁcally on the COLI business. Thank you.

A - Eilard Friese
Yes, Matthias. So I'm going to hand over to Delﬁn and I'll take the Japan Life question
later.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Indeed. And what we have is – we know that the capital generation and Solvency is
volatile. And we know that the main driver for our ability to distribute capital is related to
Solvency capital. So we have tried to basically provide some stability in relationship to the
dividend not being completely dependent on operating result, but more on the current
and expected evolution of Solvency. So based on that, ﬁrst, our objective was to give
creditability, and I think that we have done that, as we ﬁx the interim dividend based on
40% of the prior year total dividend for the year. That obviously, at the time of announcing
the ﬁnal dividend, give you a clear indication of what we expect on the interim. Obviously,
this is guidance, it's not complete ﬁxed rule, but to the extent possible, we will try to
maintain this guidance going forward.
And I think that's the – I think that, that answers your question. And certainly, this is not
related to any regulatory pressure or inﬂuence on that front.

Company Name: NN Group NV

Yes. And maybe if I can just follow up on that. How do you look at your capital position
and leverage combined? So what's currently the binding constraint to Solvency II?

FINAL

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. Well, I think that it is fair to say, when we look at the evolution of our Solvency capital
and our break-in performance, that we have some surplus capital, if you like, which we're
not prepared to identify, and obviously, the ﬁnal results of Solvency II is an important
factor into it. But I think that we have approved with the distribution of capital to
shareholders before Lard made reference to the around €700 million of capital
retribution, 50% of that in the form of ordinary dividend, the other 50% in the form of
buybacks. And that, indeed, we're delivering on that basis. So, we basically are looking
into performing – I mean focusing in our operating targets, keeping a close look at our
Solvency, and together with that, providing, as much as possible, a stable retribution to
shareholders. In terms of the balance sheet optimization, we do not intend at this point of
time to change the total leverage of €3.7 billion. Once the rules for Solvency II are more
clear, we might consider then if there is need to rebalance or do anything there on that
respect.

Q - Matthias de Wit

Yes. And about Japan Life, our life insurance business, so our insurance in Japan is very
well positioned in a niche area in Japan – a large niche area in Japan, which caters for the
retirement solution needs of SME owners. And over the – and that those underlying needs
have been there for a long time. Over the years, we see now and then, the tax rules
changing. But we also see that our company easily adapts in its products and its services
to those changes. So, at this point in time, we don't see any impact, material impact on
the quality of the business as a result of the recent tax changes.

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Couple of questions. First on Dutch Life business,
could you just come back to the investment margin? I think when you sort of IPO-ed, you
gave an objective of, over time, keeping the investment margin ﬂat with re-risking at high

yields on the back that ran oﬀ. I mean, given how strong the second quarter seems to be,
even if we take oﬀ the lumpy eﬀects and – so seasonal eﬀects was – I mean, is that still a
sense for reference point in terms of calibrating our models going forward? And then
related to that, just in terms of understanding the movements in Dutch Life general
account invested assets, that, I think, was eﬀectively ﬂat over the second quarter at – so
€61 billion, €62 billion.
I was just wondering what the moving parts in there actually are because the reported
traditional life technical reserves were down quite sharply over the quarter, I think, to €55
billion from €58 billion the previous quarter. And I just want to know what the leading part
is going forward. Secondly on the Dutch P&C business, I just wondered if – are there any
particular movements in the claims ratio we should be aware of in terms of prior year
releases or unusual level of losses? And then ﬁnally, in terms of the Solvency II ratio, I
mean you seem very comfortable with your position there. But I saw some commentary
around Dutch tax ﬁscal unity maybe (51:51) seem to be going your away. Could you just
sort of talk around that a little bit more and the magnitude that eﬀect could have on the
kind of ratio coverage you've given?

A - Eilard Friese

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, so let me comment on the Non-life area. I'll ask Doug to comment on the Solvency II
question that you have, and I'll ask Delﬁn to comment on the NN Life investment margin
and the general account assets.
So, ﬁrst in the Non-life area, any particularities there? What we basically saw is that our
attempt – our attempts or management actions over the last years to bring the combined
ratio of the stability and action book in the right place, I think, have continued to bear
fruit. So, it's not – the combined ratio is now at 97% for that business.
On the Property & Casualty side, I ﬂagged earlier that we feel that – especially the Motor
book, needs improvement, and the management team has indeed implemented
management actions that have led to an improvement at ﬁrst – ﬁrst improvement of the
combined ratio of the Motor book. It's not – it's a good improvement, but, of course, more
work to be done to run those management actions through that book. Having said that, in
this particular quarter, we were – we had some ﬁres that – some claims in the Fire book
that have elevated the combined ratio. So there's still work to be done to get the
combined ratio to its target of 97% for the entire Non-life company as of 2018. The Fire, by
the way, claims that we've seen are diverse in cause and not really a clear pattern visible.
They are diﬀerent in nature, et cetera. So, that's basically what it is. No very material other
releases, et cetera, are included in the Non-life results other than in the investment result
of the Non-life company, a €9 million dividend private equity.
And with that, I'd like to hand over to Delﬁn for the Life and the general account assets,
and then we'll go to the Solvency II question.

So, on the investment margin, obviously, the second quarter has been very high. It's
diﬃcult to provide a clear guidance on that respect. So, so far, we have been very
successful with maintaining the investment margin despite the low interest rates.
Everything will very much depend on how interest rates also evolve going forward. So, I
would say that our objective to keep the investment margin ﬂattish an objective, but there
is some pressure on that direction if interest rates continue to decrease or to stay at very
low levels. On the general account assets, it's a bit more diﬃcult to explain over the call.
So expect that from the ﬂows that occur from the separate account to the general account
on a per yearly basis, so that decreases the size of the general account, you also need to
take into account – well, sorry, with a separate account moving assets to a general
account, the general account assets increases, and obviously, you have the eﬀect of the
value of the assets in that due to market performance. Maybe we can provide you with a
little bit more explanation oﬄine.

Q - William H. Elderkin

A - Eilard Friese
Yes, indeed. So Doug is ready to answer that.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

Yes. So I think the – so are the Dutch regulators taking a particular position on how taxes
should be treated for Solvency II related to this ﬁscal immunity. We are – we've been
examining that because it's not the way the taxes are technically paid here. But we do
believe that this will likely be the way this goes.
It's also one of several areas that you have to work through in order to sort out taxes for
Solvency II, which is a very complicated area, and many companies are still working
through that. But in short, I think to get to your ﬁnal point, we don't really believe this
would change our guidance. We don't – this would not change our guidance that we've
given of around – in the range of 200% on the standard formula.

And the second question is related to Solvency II. And so (57:03) recently about the
European Systemic Risk Board. It's pushing for a revision to (57:08). Do you have any
thoughts or comments about what this may – how this may impact your business or
whether you've heard about any of these possible changes to (57:21) coming as the ESRB
kind of goes head to head with (57:26)? Thanks.

A - Eilard Friese
Yeah. So, ﬁrst – well, thanks, Steven. So, ﬁrst, on the expenses, when we took the company
public, we gave speciﬁc targets that we aim to achieve. One was an expense reduction
target of $200 million by the end of 2016 for the operating units in the Netherlands and
the overhead structure in the Netherlands.
Today, we've announced that we essentially have made that overall target. However, also,
at the time of the IPO, we also had speciﬁc expense targets for the Dutch operating units.
And for the Life company, we said that the Life company aims approximately a 15%
reduction by the end of 2016 versus its 2013 cost base.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, if you then look at the – if you do the math on that, you're looking at an overall
reduction of €70 million. They've done around €45 million or so, so far, so they still have
the remainder to go. We've said that it was backend loaded in the three-year program.
So, those programs will run through. I also want to again reiterate that we do see upward
pressure on the expense levels from inﬂation, and especially new pension regulations that
are in the Netherlands. And also, we will not shy way to make some necessary investments
if we can capture more eﬃciencies on a running basis. When it comes to the other
question of Solvency II, so, Delﬁn, can you please discuss your (59:01) there?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, Steven, I think there is a lot of ink written on the UFR and what might happen with it.
And I'm not so much in the business to speculate of what could happen. Maybe just as a
clariﬁcation that there has been some news about a diﬀerent UFR to be applied
speciﬁcally to pension funds, but that is a completely diﬀerent regulatory regime than the
insurance companies. And even on that, the interpretation of the VNB was to (59:40) that
this could not be translated to a regulatory regime of insurance companies because to
remove one element of the Solvency II framework from its context created the risk of
cherry-picking and no understanding the overall. So, until the UFR, which is ﬁxed by
Europe changes, this is an integral part of Solvency.

FINAL

Good morning, gentlemen. Just one very quick question, unfortunately coming back to
the ﬁscal unity discussion on Solvency II. From what I recall, the 200% Solvency II
invitation for full year 2014 assumes ﬁscal unity. So when you indicate that the Solvency II
ratio is kind of up in the ﬁrst half, does that still assume ﬁscal unity or has the assumption
changed within the half? Thanks.

A - Eilard Friese
So, Doug, can you – so, thanks, Farquhar. I'll ask Doug to...

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

It still includes that assessment of excluding the ﬁscal unity. So, pertaining to that one
statement that Delﬁn made, if we'd include our assessment of adjusting for the ﬁscal unity
as the regulator has asked.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Okay. And basically, on the ﬁrst half, if you – did it not assume ﬁscal unity, essentially, the
guidance still wouldn't change, would still be around 200%?

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, the guidance would go for either way.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

And then why is the impact of ﬁscal unity so low? Is that just an oﬀset of low interest rates
currently or what's the dynamics?

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

Well, the issue is that – I don't know how this expands in other countries in Europe, but in
the Netherlands, you can group multiple companies together from a parent into one tax
ﬁling. And that's what NN does and, I think, many other companies do. When it comes to
Solvency II, you have both group ﬁlings, and we go into the ﬁlings. And so the question
tenders around, how should all we go into the – and then, ultimately, the group, as they
consolidate, usually go into these – consider the deferred tax oﬀset in the owned funds,
but also in the SCR. And this is what the discussion is about.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Okay. And why is it so low though if those interest rates have an impact on that number?

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

I don't know what you mean about so low. There is no speciﬁc interest rate consideration

. And the next question is from Mr. William Hawkins from KBW.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 17918548 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. And I'm sorry to come back. But I just wanted to follow up again on the
dividend from insurance Europe, because it does strike me as remarkably high. If you've
got €480 million of dividends from all your subs, and if I were to guess that about a third
of that was from Insurance Europe, that will be implying you've got about €150 million out
of that division, which is more than last year's net operating result, for example. So for the
growth business, that seems like a remarkably high payout ratio. And this time last year,
you were saying the risk was more that you'd be downstreaming capital for Solvency II
and the rest of it. So if you could add up just a bit more color on that. And I mean, are you
implying that the 2Q dividend for Insurance Europe is now sustainable in future years or is
there something one-oﬀ that helped that ﬁgure?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, William. The dividends from the Insurance Europe are quite split. So, the largest
dividend is coming from Poland, and circling Poland, there is some extraordinary coming
of one-oﬀ because that was related (01:03:27) pension fund, where approximately half of
the assets under management were taken away due to the pension reform.
And that, obviously, had the negative impact that reﬂect into our operating result at that
time and going forward, but also have the possibility to having some impact there. We
have not explicitly mentioned how much dividend is coming from Europe, but to give you
an order of magnitude, maybe you could consider approximately €40 million or so being
extraordinary on that respect. But then, you also have strong dividends coming from
Spain, from Belgium and from other entities over the segment.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 17918548 <GO>}

And are we now through the risks that Solvency II may require you to downstream capital
or is that still something that could happen over the next (01:14:18) or 18 months?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

So, we'll have to see, but, yes, there is a risk that we could have in a particular days to
downstream capital. But in the – let's say in relative terms to the group and what's going
on within Insurance Europe, that's not a particular concern at this point in time.

Good morning, everybody. Just one follow-up question, please, on Solvency II. Has the
DNB clariﬁed its position on how we look at transitionals – maybe I can expand that to
include the UFR in relation to capital in the Solvency II. Yeah, the PRA in the UK has made
it very clear that transitionals will be uses, too, on capital and it will be included in the
assessment to dividend paying capacity. I'm just wondering whether the DNB has made
an equally clear statement on that. Thank you.

A - Eilard Friese
Yeah. Thank you very much. I'm going to ask Doug to comment on that. Doug?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Doug Caldwell

Yeah, I think the situation is a little diﬀerent from the UK, but in the sense of the nature of
the regime going ahead of time, the DNB has made no (01:05:29) the statements that I'm
aware of on transitionals, but you can follow the – in essence, we can follow the general
rules of Solvency II, which allow them under certain circumstances. But because the Dutch
companies have generally been on a mark-to-market curve already, there is less
discussion about the topic. And in terms of the UFR, I think U.S., it's just a matter of we
take this into account and looking at our current and future capital generation and our
ﬁnancial position. But as Delﬁn has said, it's one part of many parts of Solvency II, so we
don't overly isolate one element versus the others.

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

And just can I just follow up? Would you say the UFR is one of the creators (01:06:12) of
uncertainty that you ﬂag in your comments this morning about your Solvency II position?

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

No, not necessarily. And I think it's a pretty clear part, it's well deﬁned. So in that sense, it's
not one of the uncertainties.

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

I'm thinking (01:06:31) the absolute level that the...

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

I think Delﬁn answered that question earlier, we're not aware. I mean, we're aware of
discussion, of course, as the question was asked earlier. But we're not aware of any
change underway, and if a change comes, then we will manage it at that point.

And the next question is from Mr. Archie van Riemsdijk of Dow Jones

Q - Archie van Riemsdijk
Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could give some more detail
on the Dutch Life book and particularly what part of your business and season premiums
are from the closed book with unit-linked and position, and what part is from the rest?

A - Eilard Friese
So, Archie, the – if you look at the Life company in general, and I will just give you the split
– I'll just give you a split, a rough split as of the end of 2014 numbers because of – due to
the size indication. Let me just see that. It's a total balance sheet of roughly €40 billion –
sorry, roughly €73 billion at that time. So, roughly €40 billion – here we go.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, the total business at the end of last year, we had our technical reserves around €44
billion of the – for pensions and about €29 billion for the individual life closed block. So,
the closed block is about €29 billion at the end of last year and pensions around €44
billion. So, to get the overall technical reserves, you need to add the two, which gives you
a total of €73 billion – €72 billion.

Q - Archie van Riemsdijk
Okay. Great. And what part – can you also give us some color on the extra cost reductions
expected? Is that mainly in the pensions or for a larger degree in the closed book?

A - Eilard Friese
Well, as I said earlier, this is just part of something that we've announced already earlier at
the time of the IPO, which was an overall cost reduction of €200 million, and then we split
that out at the time to cost reductions done by the Life company and the Non-life
company, and the overhead structure. Now, for the Life company, we said that they would
likely reduce their expenses, that was our target, by 15%. They are well underway. So,
they've already done a lot, but they still have some to go. They've done around €45
million, €46 million of the €70 million that they need to do, and that they are on progress
to do in the coming period. And they will just continue to do so to ﬁnalize their expense
reduction program.
Please note, we're doing this to make sure that we remain competitive, that we are an
eﬃcient platform in the Netherlands and compete well, but at the same time, also ensure
that the processes improve, and as a result, our customer satisfaction goes up.

Q - Archie van Riemsdijk
All right. Thank you.

No more questions. Mr. Friese, over to you.

FINAL

A - Eilard Friese
Yes. Thank you very much, operator. Before I close oﬀ, there was one follow-up answer
that Delﬁn would like to give to one of the questions.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. There was a – the follow-up question from William Hawkins on – earlier on the public
equity dividend level of NN Life. So, the total equity – the total dividend coming from
private – from public equity was €50 million in the second quarter of 2015. That compares
to €34 million in the previous year, and this is why I gave the €16 million higher public
equity dividend in the quarter versus last year. Please keep in mind that also, for the
receiving dividends from public equity, this tends to come in seasonal, it tends to come in
the second quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Eilard Friese
So, with that, I would like – with that note to ﬁnalize, I would like to ﬁnish oﬀ by saying that
we are happy to report this very strong set of results for the quarter. I'm particularly
pleased that all our operating segments are reporting improved results, and that despite
market headwinds, the capital position remained strong. So, all-in-all, we continue to
make good progress to deliver on our equity story and achieve our strategic ﬁnancial
targets. We have realized cumulative cost savings to-date of €198 million, which means
that we have essentially achieved our €200 million target, which was originally set for
2016, ahead of schedule.
Our purpose at NN Group is to help people secure their ﬁnancial futures, and in doing so,
delivering an excellent customer service. And if we do this right, this is good for all
stakeholders. It also allows us to deliver on our promise of returning capital to
shareholders, and today, we're announcing our ﬁrst interim dividend as a listed company
of €0.46 per share.
And with that, I would like to thank all of you for your questions, and I wish you a very
good day.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the NN Group analyst call. You may now
disconnect your lines. Thank you for attending, and have a very nice day. Thank you.
