Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Gjensidige Q3 2016 Results
Presentation Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to
turn the conference over to Janne Flessum. Please go ahead.

Janne Merethe Flessum

{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

Thank you, and welcome to this third quarter presentation. As always, our CEO, Helge
Leiro Baastad, will start by giving you some highlights from the quarter before our CFO,
Jostein Amdal, will continue with some details around the numbers.
And then we will, of course, have plenty of time for questions afterwards. So Helge,
please.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Janne, and welcome from me as well. I want you to look at page two in the
presentation. We report strong result in this quarter. Proﬁt before tax NOK 1.5 billion and
underwriting result of NOK 712 million, with combined ratio 87.5%, but adjusted for oneoﬀ provision relating to the restructuring, it's 85.4%.

FINAL

The underlying underwriting result is only NOK 89 million lower than in the same quarter
last year, which was a record strong quarter, as you can remember. Jostein will come back
with more details on the ﬁgures and the waterfalls related to the underwriting result.
Growth in premiums was 4.3%. Underlying growth is 1% adjusted for currency and
acquisitions. Growth in Norway, both private and commercial was 1.3%. All the main
proﬁts in the private Norway portfolio had positive growth except for motor, which had a
slight decrease in premiums despite an increase in the number of customers in the
quarter.
The growth in commercial is driven by new business initiatives. The growth rate is in line
with the expectations we have communicated earlier given the general slowdown in the
economy, and thereby slightly increasing competition.
Growth in the Nordic segment in the quarter was 14%, driven by acquisitions. We are on
track in Sweden, coming to be proﬁtable in 2017 and we are on track in the Baltic States as
well, we will breakeven 2017 and become proﬁtable in 2018.

Bloomberg Transcript

Claims expenses this quarter are somewhat aﬀected by a short period of heavy rain in the
parts of Norway early in the quarter. However, we still have a good underlying frequency
claims development, and when it comes to run-oﬀ and large losses, it were at expected
level in third quarter.
The cost ratio was 17.3%. Adjusted for the restructuring provision of NOK 120 million, it's
15.2%. The retail bank and the pension company in Norway together contribute with NOK
178 million in proﬁt before tax expense in this quarter. And the ﬁnancial result was NOK
700 million, return on ﬁnancial assets 1.3%; and altogether, the annualized return on
equity is 21.7%.
If you turn to page three, the Board has adopted a dividend of NOK 4 per share related to
excess capital release. We have further optimized our capital structure during this third
quarter by successfully issuing a Tier 1 loan of NOK 1 billion. In addition, we recently sold
more than half the stake in SR-Bank, releasing capital of around NOK 300 million.
Distribution of excess capital over time is in line with our dividend policy. And as you can
see, the share will trade ex-dividend on November 1.
Then moving on to page four, we have made our good strategy even more targeted. Our
customers' preferences and ﬁnancial targets govern our strategic priorities. One, we will
deliver the best digital customer experiences in the Nordic general insurance. Secondly,
we will enhance insight and analytics-driven insurance operations with more analytical use
of data. And thirdly, we will further develop the organization by knowledge sharing, job
rotation and a ﬂexible organization. Analytical and digital skills will be reinforced
throughout the organization.
And as you heard in connection with our second-quarter presentation, we will strengthen
our presence in the growing market for accident and health insurance in light of the
expected gradual shift to less motor insurance and more accident and health and
Page 2 of 19

technological development, changing demographics and a less-sustainable welfare
system in the Nordics.

FINAL

Value-adding services, product simpliﬁcations and new partnership distribution models
will be increasingly important for growing and development going forward.
Then turning to page ﬁve, we are taking measures to ensure continued good
competitiveness and delivery according to unchanged ﬁnancial targets. In order to
underpin our strategic priorities, eﬃciency measures will be implemented, as
communicated in September. Our Executive Vice President Catharina Hellerud will now
lead the area, analytics, product and price, where we gather all data and analytics capacity
to form a dynamic center for better utilizing analytical insight in product development,
tariﬃng and customer servicing, to mention some.

Bloomberg Transcript

Martin Danielsen, who has played a decisive role for several years in our eﬀorts on
advanced risk pricing and risk selection, is now leading senior group management to
dedicate all its time to lead the Company's commitments on analytical-driven assurance.
And as mentioned, Jostein Amdal is our new CFO. He has previously been in charge of
risk in the Group, and for the past two years, has been Head of the Capital Management
and M&A department.
Krister Aanesen is Acting EVP for the private segment, while Hege Yli Melhus Ask is on
maternity leave. Continued focus on cost eﬃciency throughout the business is crucial to
create room for investments in technology, the brand and skills that will strengthen our
position going forward. So during 2017, staﬀ and support functions will be reduced by
about 190 FTEs.
With this, I leave the word to Jostein for more details on the numbers.

Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Thank you, Helge. Good morning. I'll start on page number seven. We report a good
underwriting result of NOK 712 million for the quarter. The development from the
corresponding quarter last year is aﬀected by a few one-oﬀs that I will return to in more
detail. The retail bank and pension and savings have a positive development, and
contributed a total of NOK 178 million in the quarter, NOK 36 million more than the
second quarter, and just over NOK 100 million than the same quarter last year.
The positive development in pension and savings in the quarter is due to our growing
customer portfolio and increased assets under management, combined with the higher
ﬁnancial results. The retail bank's good result is largely driven by growth and a positive
ﬁnancial result. The investment portfolio yielded a satisfactory return of 1.3% in the
quarter, corresponding to NOK 700 million, which is up NOK 130 million from the
previous quarter.
And the proﬁt before tax expense thereby amounted to NOK1.5 billion compared with
NOK 0.95 billion in the same quarter last year. And the proﬁt before tax expense for the
Page 3 of 19

FINAL

year-to-date is then NOK 4.8 billion, which reﬂects improvements in all the group's
business areas.
Turning to page eight, we report a strong underwriting result this quarter, underlying only
NOK 89 million weaker than in the same quarter last year, which was a record strong
quarter. Overall, the reported result is aﬀected by a few one-oﬀs and increased level of
large losses. Last year, the underwriting result was aﬀected by a one-oﬀ related to a
review of actuarial models for the calculation of claims submissions. This had a positive
eﬀect of approximately NOK 100 million in the third quarter of 2015. In the third quarter
this year, we have a one-oﬀ of NOK 120 million related to restructuring costs, which Helge
has already commented on. The provision is expensed to the corporate center.
If you also adjust for changes in run-oﬀ and large losses between the two quarters, we see
an underlying weakening of the underwriting result of NOK 89 million. Some of the
underlying change can be related to one short period of heavy rain in parts of the country
in August which aﬀects both private and commercial. The remaining weakening is well
within what we would expect in variations in an industry as general insurance.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our long-term annual combined ratio target is in the corridor of 90% to 93%, and
adjusted for run-oﬀ gains in the next two to four years, the target is 86% to 89%. Adjusted
for one-oﬀs, combined ratio this quarter is below this level with 85.4%, and the 12-month
rolling, normalized combined ratio is also at the lower end of the corridor with 85.9%. As
previously commented, the annual combined ratio will be at the lower end of the corridor
in the time ahead.
Turning to page nine, the loss ratio was 70.2% this quarter, 4.6 percentage points higher
than the corresponding quarter last year. Adjusted for changes in run-oﬀ and large losses
and the change in the actuarial model from last year, the underlying loss ratio related to
frequency claims was 1.6 percentage points higher than in the third quarter last year.
And as mentioned, some of the deterioration can be ascribed to the heavy rain which led
to a weaker frequency claims development, especially for property, which otherwise
shows good underlying proﬁtability in the quarter. The motor portfolio in private Norway
shows continued good proﬁtability, on par with the same trend last year and better than
we normally expect. We do see signs of a somewhat increased claims inﬂation, and
monitor the development closely to ensure appropriate pricing initiatives.
Claims level in commercial Norway was also aﬀected by the heavy rain. In addition, we
saw an increased proportion of large losses related to commercial property in this quarter.
Over the long-term, proﬁtability trend is still good for this product. The accident and
health products saw stable, good development. We see signs that the economy in
general is stabilizing, but we're still experiencing price pressure in the market, as we have
previously communicated.
The Nordic segment had an increase in claims this quarter compared with the same
quarter last year. This is mainly due to a higher proportion of large losses and lower runoﬀ gains. The underlying proﬁtability in the Danish portfolio was, however, also somewhat
Page 4 of 19

FINAL

weaker than the corresponding period last year. The Vardia portfolio aﬀected the
proﬁtability in Sweden negatively, but proﬁtability in the rest of the Swedish portfolio is
developing in a positive direction and we expect to reach proﬁtability in Sweden in 2017.
In the Baltics, we are on track to reach breakeven during 2017 and proﬁtability in 2018, as
previously communicated.
Moving to page 10 on premium growth, we have a good premium growth in the quarter
4.3%, 4.2% adjusted for currency eﬀects, and 1% adjusted for appreciations and currency.
Helge has already commented on the growth in Norway. The Nordic segment reported
growth of 14%; 2% when adjusted for acquisitions and currency. The growth in premiums
in the Danish portfolio wasn't particular driven by growth in the commercial property
portfolio.
In Sweden, we saw good growth in the private portfolio, while growth in the commercial
portfolio is still subdued due to repricing. The Baltic segment reported growth of 86%,
including the acquisition of PZU Lietuva, and approximately 4.9% when adjusted for
currency and acquisitions.
The underlying growth is aﬀected by repricing and implementation of new tariﬀs on the
one hand, and increased strength in distribution and customers increasing by more than
one product on the other hand.

Bloomberg Transcript

Over time, we generally expect to grow organically, in line with normal GDP growth.
Although the underlying growth rate is somewhat lower at the moment, disciplined
structural growth is still on the agenda.
Turning to page 11, you can see the cost development per segment. Cost control is still
good while we continue to focus on eﬃciency measures to create room for strategic
investments. The increase in nominal cost is driven by current operations and the
restructuring provision of NOK 120 million. The cost ratio, excluding the Baltic and
adjusted for one-oﬀs, was 14.1% in the quarter.
And if you adjust the cost ratio for the provision for restructuring, it was 15.2%. As
previously communicated, the cost ratio will be slightly above the 2015 level both this year
and next due to integration activities outside Norway, but it will still be at the 15% level.
On page 12, you will see that large losses amount to NOK 321 million this quarter, which
accounts for 5.6 percentage points on the combined ratio. This is in line with expected
level, but higher than the third quarter last year with large losses amounted to NOK 259
million.
(14:13) for most costs the large losses this quarter and increased frequency is considered
to be random, they were limited by the related large losses this quarter.
On page 13, we show the run-oﬀ gains. The run-oﬀ gains of NOK 234 million had a
positive eﬀect on combined ratio of 4.1 percentage points in the quarter, against 4.4
Page 5 of 19

FINAL

percentage points in the third quarter last year. And as earlier communicated, the run-oﬀ
gain in the Norwegian segment is primarily related to motor TPL and workers comp, and
we expect run-oﬀ gains in the region of NOK 200 million per quarter in the next two years
to four years.
Turning to page 14, so, details from the investment portfolio. The investment portfolio
yielded a return of 1.3% in the quarter. The portfolio amounted to NOK 56 billion. The
match portfolio of NOK 36 billion continued to make a stable contribution to the ﬁnancial
result with a return of 0.9% against 1% in the second quarter. Portfolio at amortized cost is
a large part of the match portfolio. The running yield in this portfolio was 4.6% at the end
of the quarter, and the average reinvestment rate has been 2.9% year-to-date.
Unrealized excess value amounted to approximately NOK 1.7 billion. The free portfolio
amounted to NOK 19.6 billion and yield return of 2% in the quarter. The result was driven
by positive development of our stake in SR-Bank, while the narrowing of credit spreads
also has led to positive contributions from the investment grade, convertible, and highyield bonds.
The property portfolio also made a positive contribution to the result in the quarter partlydriven by our re-evaluation of the portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

Since the quarter ended, we have, as you know, sold 14.5 million shares in SR-Bank. We
have now hold 12.3 million shares in the bank, which represents 4.8% of the company's
shares. The sale will not have a big impact on the result for the fourth quarter as the share
price as of September 30 was 45.6 and the sales price was 46 (16:19)
On page 15, you can see our capital position in the three relevant perspectives. The rating
model is still the most binding. Available capital before dividend increased in all three
perspectives, which is mainly due to the issuing of a Tier 1 bond of NOK 1 billion and
retained earnings in the last quarter.
The capital requirement increases slightly in all three perspectives, which is primarily due
to increased balance sheet value on the investment side, mainly equities, which results in
a small increase in market risk requirement. There are only minor changes in the
requirement relating to insurance risk. The capital margins from the rating perspective is
104% which gives a strategic buﬀer of NOK 0.6 billion adjusted for the adopted dividend,
and also adjusting for the sale of shares in SR-Bank, the strategic buﬀer is NOK 0.9 billion.
This is a strategic buﬀer level which we consider to be reasonable in relation to the
purpose it's intended to serve and given the current situation. The solvency margin is 141%
based on the standard formula, and 179% based on the internal model adjusted for the
adopted dividend. And based on our understanding of the guarantee scheme, the
solvency margins were 144% and 183%, respectively.
In summary, we have a solid capital position in all perspectives, and we'll continue to
further optimize our capital structure in a disciplined way in order to support the target of
a high return on equity. Helge?

Then it's me again to brieﬂy sum up, then on the last page 16, we have and will and (17:54)
competitiveness combined with stable market share development and good proﬁtability
going forward.
Secondly, we will continuously focus on cost discipline, and we are implementing
eﬃciency measures in making our strategic eﬀorts more targeted. This creates room for
strategic investments in the integration and brand and skill.
And ﬁnally, we have a strong capital position, we are disciplined and committed to deliver
on the ROE target of minimum 15% after tax, and are again distributing excess capital to
our shareholders. So then, Janne.

Thank you. We take the question now from Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Hi. Yes, good morning. Matti Ahokas from Danske. Just one question regarding the extra
dividend. Could you a bit elaborate how you came up with the NOK 4? Should we see the
kind of NOK 900 million as the S&P strategic buﬀer as the absolute minimum, or what was
the thinking behind the NOK 4? And could you see yourselves going below the NOK 900
million, or should we expect that that is the level where we should see the S&P strategic
buﬀer? Thanks.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I'll try to answer that question. The Board continuously monitors the capital position and
there is no strict limit that we have stated on how large the buﬀer should be. We do
regard everything in between NOK 0 billion and NOK 1 billion that's perfectly normal as a
buﬀer to the S&P requirement. So the NOK 900 million does not represent a strict
minimum requirement.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

If I may have a follow-up on that. Just when looking at the partial internal model and the
standard formula, do they play a role in this at all, or is it basically just the strategic buﬀer
on top of the S&P rating requirement which we should look at?

FINAL

They do play a role since we need to consider all three perspectives, and they
communicate as buﬀers on both the partial internal model and the standard formula
where we -- there are buﬀers above the 100% solvency margin level. But for a long time,
and we expect also in the near future, the S&P requirement or the rating requirement will
be the most binding.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. Thanks a lot.

Operator
We take our next question now from Jakob Brink from ABG. Please go ahead caller. Your
line is open.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you and good morning. I have two questions, please. The ﬁrst one is regarding also
the capital after you have sold the 14.5 million shares in SR-Bank. Just to make sure, it
sounds very much like you have decided not to reinvest the money. Is that correctly
understood? We should not expect you to invest in other equities or similar?
And basically, a follow-up on that one as well, I don't know if you could maybe help us a
bit. There's also been some quite big movements between the diﬀerent types of ﬁnancial
assets since Q2. So could you maybe help us, guide us a bit your normal investment result
for 2017? It seems like consensus is NOK 1 billion between high and low, so some help
would be nice. Thanks.
And then my second question. You're writing a small cheque (22:22) about this new tax in
Norway of 5 percentage points on salaries, NOK 60 million. You also mention that you
hope to be able to oﬀset part of it. Could you maybe give us some more detail on what
exactly you expect to do to oﬀset this NOK 60 million, please? And also when should we
expect you to be able to oﬀset it? Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Okay. I'll start on the ﬁrst one, the use of the proceeds from the sale of SR-Bank. As you
know, (22:55) there is no covering of money (22:57) you can't follow them, the cash from
that sale to other asset classes. But when we now distribute in a very short time NOK 2
billion kind of goes that the money from SR-Bank is not reinvested in equities as such. The
asset allocation is within the boundaries stated by the Board and our risk capital (23:24)
very constantly changing, especially when you look at the free portfolio, whereas the
match portfolio is more or less stable because it's tied to our insurance technical
liabilities.
So I'm afraid that's a precise answer to the ﬁrst part of the ﬁrst question, and it's also
going to go to answer the second question that on the free portfolio, we take the liberty

Page 8 of 19



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2016-10-26

of trying to meet what we see as the market development, and within very controlled risk
environment take tactical views on asset classes.

FINAL

On the second question about the tax situation, and it's – this is a proposal from the
government. It has not been approved or decided yet. So it's a bit early date. We have
estimated the fact that if the government's proposal is actually approved, then we have
stated a NOK 60 million eﬀect.
The other part of the proposal is not to lower the corporate tax rate, which doesn't have
an eﬀect compared to the historical result, but it would have a positive eﬀect if we were
allowed to have a reduced tax rate. That's the other part of the service (24:59) in Norway.
Our metrics to be taken to mitigate this, it's a bit too early to comment on, but if there's
any real cost increase for us, will need somehow to be shared with our customers.
Because we have the same proﬁtability targets as we have before. Yeah, I think that's for
us (25:22).

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. But, sir, just to follow-up on the tax, so I understand that you would like to pass it
on, but how would that be done? Is that by increasing premiums? Or (25:35) mentioned
something about a base or stand-out premium in Norway that could quite easily be
increased. Is that what you're thinking? And would it be from the 1st of January or is it kind
of more down the road?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I think we'll wait in answering that question until we have the actual decision made by the
parliament that this will actually take place. But it's two ways. Either we ﬁnd some
mitigating cost measures, or we pass it on to the customers, and that means premiums.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Or a combination.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah, hi, there. Thanks for my questions and ﬁrstly, I just wanted to touch on the level of
competition in Norway. I mean, you mentioned again today that the growth rate is going
to be somewhat subdued in Norway in part due to competition. Has there been any active
change in that in the quarter, or is it just a continuation of the themes we've seen before?
That's question one.
And then the second question was just looking at the potential for further bolt-on M&A. I
think you've spoken before about the fact that you're currently integrating, obviously, the
Baltics and Vardia, so you're quite busy on that front. Is that still the case, or are you
actively looking for additions to the portfolio still? Thanks.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

It's Helge Baastad. I can start on the growth and competition in Norway. Just to remind
you what we have said, overall long-term expectation is premium growth in line with the
GDP growth. At the moment, the insurance growth is lower than GDP growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

Short-term, we will expect slower growth in the overall insurance market, and that's in line
with what we have communicated before. It's the meltdown in the Norwegian economy
and intensiﬁed competition. So it's actually no diﬀerent. I do not have any diﬀerent
communication regarding that compared to last quarter.
Our situation is that we have a stable, more or less stable market share in the Norwegian
market. Just to comment on pricing going forward, as you know, we have to look at the
long-term claims inﬂation to ﬁnd the right curve for pricing going forward. Regarding
properties, it's the same communication as before, around 4% going forward. It's volatile,
as you know, the property part of the business.
Regarding motor insurance, you know that we have communicated that the inﬂation has
come down from historically 3% to 4% down to 1%, but we see signs now are increased
claims inﬂation going forward. So, we – that's the most important analytical part of the
business, is closely monitored the claims inﬂation for motor and of course, we have to
secure that we can price in line with any tick-up on the inﬂation side.
The main competitors last quarter have been the large one, actually. We lose fewer
customers to the small competitors, and we are competing more with the well-known
brand names like Tryg in the last quarter, Arno in Norway. Outside Norway, it's -- yes. The
question was about Norway, so I leave it with that.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Okay. I'll try to answer the second question on M&A integration. And is of course, as you
point out, extremely important for us that the decisions we make are well-integrated into
the business and they deliver on the targets they set and when doing this, these
acquisitions and that's number one priority now, both in Sweden and the Baltics, to get
this business proﬁtable in line with what we've already communicated.

FINAL

But we are able to do two things at the same time so we are always on the lookout for
good acquisition opportunities that ﬁt into our business in a good way. It needs to be
easily-integrated, and we managed that with our previous acquisitions, and that will be a
criteria for any new acquisitions we would like to make. As always, we would never
comment on any speciﬁc opportunities or anything like that.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Excellent. Thanks.

Operator
We take next question now from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for the question. On the special dividend, please, could
you also remind us of the – when last year in 3Q you had mentioned you had started
talking about the motor reserve were basis of the lower motor inﬂation. The expectation
was that some of that would be continuing to come as future special dividend. Is that still
part of the plan, or is – I mean, because at the moment, you seem to have funded the
special somewhat with the Tier 1 debt, and obviously the state of banks. So I'm just trying
to understand how you think about any future special based on the motor reserving
patterns you imagine or you proposed.
And second question is just on Sweden and Vardia. When you say Sweden is on track for
2017 proﬁtability, is that guidance including Vardia or excluding? Because we don't yet
have a number, and I would obviously appreciate a lot more if we could get a combined
ratio for Vardia, but if in case we don't, could you guide us what this guidance includes?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I can take the latter ﬁrst. When I am saying that Sweden are on track, it's of course
including all our business, and that includes Vardia as well. And the ﬁrst one is a more
elaboration, so I'll leave it to Jostein, actually.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Helge. There is some – since I communicated the strategy of releasing
reserves over a number of years going ahead, this is part of the total dividend potential
that we consider, and it's both the normal or the ongoing dividend which is supposed to
be high and stable and grow in line with our underlying proﬁtability, and special
dividends that we, from time to time will pay out to be in line with our capital strategy of
paying out excess capital.
That will be paid out over time. There is no kind of automatic calculation of that. It's based
on judgment of where we are and what we see on the – going ahead. These reserve

Page 11 of 19



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2016-10-26

and the ordinary dividends.

FINAL

Okay. Another way to put it is that if it is -- sorry?

A - Janne Merethe Flessum

{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

Vinit, if I just may add to that, we have also said before that we need to calibrate these two
dreams. We want to avoid a clip in the regular dividend scheme after the two years to four
years ahead. So meaning you should use then 60-40 (34:05) as a starting point when you
think of the regular dividend. And if we're beyond any excess capital over time, you could
also expect specials from time to time, but I still can sense no irregularity around that.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Sure. And just a quick clariﬁcation, the zero to 1 billion strategic buﬀer range that you just
said is reasonable, shall we assume that is kind of the cut-oﬀ for these decisions? So if it's
above NOK 1 billion, you're happy to pay. Is that a good interpretation?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

We are more happy if it's above than below NOK 1 billion, that's for sure, but there is no

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

And there is some general (34:48) eﬀects that if we go NOK 1 billion that there will be a
special dividend. That will be a judgmental call at every point of time.

A - Janne Merethe Flessum

{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

Remember, again, that the purpose of the buﬀer within it is threefold. We need to have
ﬂexibility to do small bolt-on acquisitions or medium-sized acquisitions; we want to
stabilize the regular dividend; and also, we need to look into regulatory uncertainty. And
we need to look into these three issues at all times, so we can't aﬀord varying (35:21).

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi, thank you. I've got three questions from my side, please. So ﬁrst one, I have a question
on the comments you made in terms of the strategic priorities for the next few years. You
dropped a couple of priorities compared to your previous statements, speciﬁcally, multichannel distribution and value-adding services for loyalty and preference. I was
wondering what the reason behind this is, is this just a simpliﬁcation of priorities, or are
there any other thinking behind this? That's the ﬁrst question.
The second one is on the Norway private business. If you could break out how much of
the top line of the 1.5% growth is price and how much is volumes, just to get a better idea
of what the price eﬀect is there.
And thirdly, on the investment portfolio, so could you help us here on the match portfolio
speciﬁcally on two parts? What is the expected, let's say, decline in the yield you would
see on the bond at amortized cost part? Because that's – based on your current
investment yields, how fast year-on-year will you expect that to drop oﬀ from the 3.6% at
nine months, for example, that we just saw?
And then secondly, what's the market yield on the current bonds at the moment, so that
we can get a better sense of where it should be on a normalized basis? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yes. Regarding the strategic priorities, I think it's like a simpliﬁcation. Multi-channel
distribution, that's the way of doing business in this type of business. We have actually
said that the main channel going forward will be the digital channel, but we, of course,
have all kind of call centers and branches as well.
This is for sure the situation in Norway. Outside Norway, it's about keeping up in the
Nordics with all their expertise and their systems and their surplus we have in Norway with
higher speed in the Nordics.
And ﬁnally, talking about the Baltics, that's a completely diﬀerent distribution model. So
what we actually want to do there is to destruct that model, sooner or later, with a modern
also there multi-channel distribution system. So I think the strategic priority is that's more - it's a simpliﬁcation.
It's more or less the same going forward. But digital is increasingly important also in the
multi-channel perspective, so we want actually to invest more and we want to speed up,
actually. The split between price and volume in Norway, have we actually commented on
that before? Not speciﬁc, I think.

A - Janne Merethe Flessum

{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

No, not speciﬁc, but its main is still price-driven, so the volumes are relatively stable and
ﬂat. So it's mainly price driven, as it has been for a while.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

FINAL

Sorry. Just to follow-up, if I can, on the volumes. The one thing I want to check is that
you're not yet at the point where you have to give up volumes to maintain price?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

No.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Okay.

The third question was about the Match portfolio, and reduction, of course. As I
commented, the running yield is 4.6% whereas the reinvestment rate, so far this year has
been 2.9%. This means that over time, the running yield of portfolio will decrease.
Your guess is as good as mine as where the investment interest rates are going this year.
It's about roughly you can see the 2.9% that we have reinvested so far as a kind of an
approximation of the level that it will move towards over time. But remember, the average
duration of the portfolio is 3.5 years, so it will take some time to actually run through and
get kind of all these portfolio repriced.
And when we reprice our products, we price that according to current market rates at all
times. So that's the kind of expected (40:09) that we look at when we price the products
to the customers.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

And what is the market yield that you have on the current bond portfolio at the moment?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Are you talking about the match portfolio, or ...?

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Yeah. Within the match portfolio, the current bond portfolio, which I guess is mostly the
Danish part.

A - Jostein Amdal

Yeah.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

Just wondered because we have a lot of quarter volatility, so just trying to understand
what the current spot yield is on that portfolio.

FINAL

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I think if you kind of look at the match, if you talk only about the Danish part, it's around
0%.

Around 0%, you said?

We take our next question now from Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. I think I've got three questions. The ﬁrst is really a clariﬁcation.
Just at the restructuring charge you've taken in the quarter and the initiatives that you've
talked around costs and eﬃciencies. Those are entirely in line with previous guidance.
There's nothing new happening in this quarter, I just want to get some clarity on that.
Secondly, you mentioned a NOK1.5 billion hybrid capacity. I just wondered if you could
share some thoughts around the intention to use that and if you can give any indication of
timing. I guess not. Thirdly, just talking about the underwriting conditions, there was a 1.6
point change in Norway. I think you mentioned that on slide nine. You talked about the
variation, the underlying variation being in line with a normal range, I think, is what you
said and just checking that that 1.6 percentage point is in line with the normal range. It
seems on the high side to me.
And then with apologies, ﬁnally, you mentioned, Helge, I think, there will be some
deterioration in claims inﬂation in motor. Could you comment on that with respect to your
expectation that claims inﬂation will be around 1%, which is the assumption behind your
guidance on future reserve releases? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Page 15 of 19



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA

I can start with the latter, Blair. As I said, we have communicated for the last three years, I
think, that we have come down from historically 3% to 4% down to around 1%. But as I
said, we see signs of increased claims inﬂation going forward. I also said that we are
closely monitoring this, just pricing accordingly to this eventual (43:17).

FINAL

It's uncertain level going forward, of course. We see mix of eﬀect from safer cars and
roads, and more expensive repairs and claims increase for small coverage.
So actually, we see an uptick now for small coverages. It's also, of course, lots of
uncertainty related to the fact that we see more and more hybrid cars in Norway due to
favorable prices, and all these hybrid cars, they have more horsepower compared to what
we have seen before.
So this is one of the areas we are most closely monitoring going forward. And as I said,
(44:08) secure that we also adjust our prices going forward. But...

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

I get the point about adjusting the pricing, Helge, but is that something that would impact
your assumption on the appropriate inﬂation assumption for the reserves that are held, or
is this something purely that's going forward for new cars and new experiences?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

It's not?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

No, It's no historical impact. Blair, its pure related to new cars and what we gradually see
during the quarter. We do not have any ﬁgure, but we expect this claims inﬂation ﬁgures
to tick up from 1%.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. That's clear.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

And no eﬀect related to releases, absolutely not (44:54). That trend...

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yes. Okay. That's what I wanted to check.

Is it related to small coverages ﬁrst and foremost.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

(45:04) and you're right, there's nothing new communication on this. This is the same
what we communicated on September 26, I think it was.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Your second question about hybrid capacity. It's really the same comment that we've had
before. The hybrid capacity that we have remaining of NOK 1.5 billion is in the way of
theoretical capacity.

Bloomberg Transcript

It would never go as high as utilizing that full capacity because the capacity itself is a
function of the available capital. So we get a double leverage eﬀect there if things start to
turn sour. But we do have more capacity and we will over time utilize more capacity. But
as you correctly guess, we will not say when.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. Understood.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yes. And the third question was about the 1.6% eﬀect on the loss ratio and if that's a
normal change. My comment was that the NOK 89 million underwriting result deviation
from third quarter last year, it's equal to 1.6 percentage points. And part of that is
explained by heavy rainfall in the Oslo area, really, between August 6 and August 8 this
year. And if you take away that eﬀect as well, the remaining uncertainty is well within a
normal volatility of claims or of a general insurance business of approximately NOK 5
billion in premiums every quarter.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yes, yes, yes. Okay. That's great. Thanks for that.

FINAL

Hello and good morning everyone. Could you just conﬁrm a couple of things for me?
When you talk about proﬁtability in Sweden and the Baltic regions, are you talking about
just on solely on the underwriting side of this, or do you include any associated
investment returns in these businesses? And then in terms of the 190 employees
reduction, can you say which regions these are coming out of? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I can start with the ﬁrst one. When we talk about proﬁt, we talk about underwriting proﬁt.
And with a 0% interest rate, unfortunately, there's not that much diﬀerence between the
two at the moment. But, yes, we're talking about underwriting proﬁtability. (47:39). The
second question I don't understand. Yes. It's related to staﬀ functions. It's not related to
any – in the distributions. We have separate programs for claims going forward. As you
know, on the Capital Markets Day, we said that we are going to -- lots of eﬃciency
measures on the claims side, but this is related to staﬀ in Oslo and Copenhagen and in
Stockholm.
