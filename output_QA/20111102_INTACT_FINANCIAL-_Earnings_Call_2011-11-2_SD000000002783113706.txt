Thanks, Dennis. This morning we reported Third Quarter net operating income of CAD111
million, or CAD0.97 per share, 23% higher than the prior year, as personal auto results
improved signiﬁcantly. The resilience of our operations was illustrated by our solid
combined ratio of 94.2% despite incurring CAD53 million of catastrophic losses, which is
about twice the estimated normal quarterly run rate.
Net income for the quarter was CAD101 million, or CAD0.87 per share, down 9% from last
year. Excluding the impact of integration and restructuring costs as well as amortization of
intangibles, adjusted earnings per share were CAD1.11, or 13% higher than a year ago.
From a top-line perspective, the 2% increase in our premiums is, as I've indicated
previously, not a pace with which we are satisﬁed. Growth of 1% in personal lines reﬂect
slower growth in our direct businesses, notably in Ontario, while commercial lines grew
5% year-over-year. We have restarted our growth eﬀorts in the Ontario auto market as a
result of the reforms unfold in a positive manner and our eﬀorts to curb fraud and abuse
prove successful.
Overall, our underwriting performance and steady investment income resulted in an
operating ROE of 14% for the last 12 months, while strong investment gains from
continued portfolio rebalancing resulted in an adjusted return on equity of 17.8%.
Turning to Ontario auto, we are more optimistic that the beneﬁts from the reforms will
materialize as originally outlined but remain disciplined in this market despite the
continued improvement in our loss ratio in the quarter. Apart from the government
reforms, we have taken action to combat fraud and abuse in the system. We continue to
be encouraged by the results of our actions to date and maintain our expectation for a
combined ratio improvement of close to 12 points within 18 months post-reforms. Overall,
we estimate that the current accident year results in that province improved by about 9
points in the quarter.
Although Ontario auto industry results for the ﬁrst half of 2011 show meaningful
improvement in the loss ratio, we estimate that the combined ratio of the industry in that
province is still close to 110%. And therefore, that premiums remain inadequate. As such,
the level of approved rate changes for the industry announced in the past few quarters is
a positive sign but does not fully address the inadequacy in the system.

FINAL

That said, should results continue to improve at the industry level, the pace of future rate
increases could potentially diminish. Our proﬁtability gap with the industry in this
province remained strong at more than 15 points, which aﬀords us the ﬂexibility to
consider actions to improve growth. Outside Ontario, conditions remain stable.
In personal property, losses related to cats were elevated for a Second Quarter, driven by
the remnants of Hurricane Irene in Quebec and numerous wind and hail storms across the
country. I think it is important to keep in mind that these types of losses tend to be lumpy.
We continue to monitor and adapt to the increasing level of severe weather occurrences
in order to create a sustainable competitive advantage, though we have not changed our
view of the adequacy of the cat loading in our pricing.
Finally, while we do not believe this quarter's elevated level of cats is a new norm, I think it
is further evidence to support our view that pricing will remain ﬁrm in this line of business
in the coming periods.

Bloomberg Transcript

Pricing conditions in commercial lines remain soft, although we've beneﬁted from ﬁrmer
prices in the past 18 to 24 months in a number of segments where we operate. Empirical
evidence in the quarter continues to highlight that our focused approach is paying oﬀ in
our commercial P&C business. We were able to grow units 4% in conjunction with putting
through 2% higher rates while our reported top-line growth was 5%.
Let me make a few comments about the AXA acquisition. In conjunction with the
announcement of the close of the transaction in late September we also announced some
changes to our senior management team. One of the things that came apparent in the
integration process was that both companies had very similar values, including a common
goal to be the best P&C insurer in Canada. In the month or so since the close, we have
largely completed the integration of our close to 10,000 employee-strong workforce in a
fashion that is best suited to provide an exceptional customer and broker experience. In
my view, our team of insurance experts and professionals is not only the strongest in
Canada. But one that I believe will enable us to become a world-class P&C insurer.
Shortly after the close of acquisition, we also announced an agreement to sell AXA's life
insurance business for CAD300 million. Finding a buyer for this small but proﬁtable
business was important as it allows us to focus on the parts of the business to which we
can add the most value. The sale also improved the already strong economics of the
transaction, as Mark will expand upon shortly. Lastly, it will improve our leverage position
once it closes by early 2012.
On the product front, we have been very clear from the beginning that we intend to
maintain the full suite of AXA capabilities, which allows us to expand our reach and oﬀers
the potential for revenue enhancements. The product design is complete. And within
days of closing was presented to brokers from coast to coast. This refreshed oﬀer, in
addition to our structure that aims to provide strong local presence and maintain existing
employee-broker relationships, has been favorably received by brokers.

As I mentioned last quarter, we were targeting to begin the integration of the AXA
business on our platform before year end. I'm proud to say that we accomplished this
objective earlier this week and we are on target to complete the conversion within 15
months. This is a testament to the hard work of countless individuals from across the
organization who came together to combine these two best-in-class companies into a
world-class P&C insurer. Although much work lies ahead, I'm conﬁdent that we will deliver
on our goals to achieve $100 million in after-tax synergies and 15% earnings accretion post
integration.
In conclusion, I believe the importance we place on underwriting results will serve us well
in the current low interest rate environment. Given the quality of our operational
platforms, the ﬂexibility provided by our ﬁnancial position and the synergistic
combination with AXA Canada, we believe that we will continue to outperform the
industry and strengthen our leadership position.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Tullis.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Charles. Today we announced operating earnings of CAD0.97 per share, up from
CAD0.79 in the Third Quarter of 2010. These include one week of AXA Canada results
with CAD3.8 million of underwriting income included in other operating income and net
investment income of CAD2.1 million. Beginning next quarter, all underwriting measures
will fully incorporate AXA Canada results.
Slides 9 and 10 show results by line of business. In personal auto, top-line growth
declined 0.5% as units and rate increases were oﬀset by the mix changes. Growth was
also hit by reduced marketing of our direct business as we waited for the Ontario situation
to develop. As underwriting results in Ontario have improved, we have increased
marketing throughout the province, included selected areas within the GTA. And we
expect auto sales to be back on track by the end of the Fourth Quarter.
In personal property, top-line growth remained at 3% and commercial P&C was a solid
5.2%. On the underwriting side, our personal auto results continued to be strong as the
combined ratio improved signiﬁcantly to 86.4% from 96.3% a year earlier. Results in both
personal property and commercial P&C were impacted by the level of cat losses in the
quarter, resulting in combined ratios of 110.3% and 100%, both above last year.
On the investment side the beneﬁt of CAD2.1 million in additional income from AXA
Canada masked the full impact from declining yields, resulting in net investment income
of CAD74 million, ﬂat from a year ago. With a portfolio concentrated in ﬁxed-income
assets, the declining interest rate environment will continue to negatively impact our
market-based yield in the coming quarters.
Our ﬁnancial position remained strong at the end of the Third Quarter with an MCT of
202%, CAD534 million in excess capital even after putting CAD400 million toward the

Page 4 of 21

AXA acquisition and book value per share of CAD28.97, 13% higher than a year ago. We
ended the quarter with a debt to total capital ratio above our target level.

FINAL

However, we intend to allocate a portion of the CAD300 million proceeds from the sale of
AXA Canada's life insurance business toward paying down the term loan used to ﬁnance
the acquisition. As a result, our debt to total capital ratio is expected to be back in line
with our target early in 2012.
As Charles mentioned, we have made excellent progress on the integration of AXA
Canada. For example, a good portion of the synergy will come from combining the
businesses onto one common platform. We will not fully realize these savings until we
have stopped issuing policies on AXA systems and until we have gone through a cycle of
renewing all of the AXA business on Intact systems.
This process has begun this week and will continue for the next 15 months. As a result, we
feel that we are still on track to progressively realize the CAD100 million of after-tax
synergies within 18 to 24 months of close and potentially half of them in calendar year
2012. As we progressed with the integration, we also identiﬁed a need to increase
reinsurance coverage. However, we expect to more than oﬀset this with short-term supply
chain beneﬁts.

Bloomberg Transcript

In summary, we maintain our CAD100 million target with opportunities for more synergies
in the midterm relating to actuarial and further supply chain beneﬁts.
Now that all the pieces of the acquisition are in place, the ﬁnancial metrics of the deal
look all the more attractive. The book value at close of the AXA business was over CAD1.6
billion, taking into account the fair value of a life insurance business. This means that our
purchase price was 1.6 times the book value, much better than originally estimated.
With the progress made to date on the integration we are well on the way toward
building a world-class P&C insurer. With that, I will turn the call back to Dennis.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Stephen Boland, JMP Securities.

Q - Stephen Boland

{BIO 5546446 <GO>}

I guess the ﬁrst question a little bit diﬀerent, I guess, is just on your funding status with
your pension plans. I guess there's a large deﬁcit in your pension plan now and there's a

Page 5 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2011-11-02

lot more focus on that with a lot of industries. What's the impact of that or how do you
narrow that deﬁcit, or do you have to narrow it over a certain period of time?

FINAL

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Sure, let me take that one. So I think there's a couple of things going on here. One was, at
the end of the Second Quarter on an accounting basis the pension plan was 92% funded.
And at September 30, including the AXA pension, the plan was 80% funded. And this
widening deﬁcit from the 92% to the 80% was due to both the decline in discount rates
and the acquisition of the AXA pension plan, which was approximately 70% funded on an
accounting basis at the date of acquisition.
I will say that as we -- this was not a surprise. As we negotiated, we were aware of the
deposition of AXA plan and it was one of the things we took into account during the
negotiations.

Q - Stephen Boland

{BIO 5546446 <GO>}

Okay. And is there a requirement that you get this funded to par? I know you said you
have to fund -- or you are going to fund CAD43 million in 2011. Does this impact your -- I
guess the question -- does it impact ratings, your ability to buy back stock or increase
dividends, if you have to fund this?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Yes. So I think the answer is we don't -- this is something we will do an evaluation at year
end, we'll determine the need then based on how our interest rates fall out at year end.
But at this point, we consider it still relatively well-funded compared to what many of the
other companies in the Canadian universe. And we don't see impacting our capital
position. I would view it as a manageable situation in our case.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Absolutely. And Stephen, we have introduced a couple of years ago a number of risk
management measure on the BB front to make sure that we have levers going forward to
mitigate the impact of a low interest rate environment for a tough capital market
environment. So it's something that I think we have been on top of for a number of years.
We are continually reviewing our position on this. But this is not a concern or a major
concern at this stage. It's something we manage on an ongoing basis.

Q - Stephen Boland

{BIO 5546446 <GO>}

The second question just on -- I know you probably get a lot of questions on Ontario auto.
If I go right to the reserve development, it appears that at $76 million on a 2010 year basis,
it's coming out well above your expectation, or a little bit better than your expectation.
What does that do in terms of ﬂexibility for you pricing products going forward?

FINAL

I think it's worthwhile to comment on the favorable development in the quarter itself,
which is pretty much in line with the historical average would be the ﬁrst point. Of course,
the favorable development in a quarter can come from a number of places. This quarter,
Ontario certainly was a good source -- a good contributor to the normal favorable
development in the quarter. When you look at the favorable development in Ontario in
the quarter, I would like to make a couple of points.
It's coming as much from BI as it is from AB. And the reforms, as you know, where ABdriven. And it's largely coming from the case incurred, in other words, what's happening
the ﬁeld as opposed to shift in actuarial judgment. So that's the ﬁrst point there.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think what is more relevant to us is the fact that we are seeing the anticipated beneﬁts
stabilizing, gaining credibility as we go along. And therefore integrating that into our
planning process, our growth marketing strategies and our pricing strategy is becoming
more and more relevant as time passes and we are one year into it at this stage.
I think some people might say, well, your combined ratio is improving. You keep talking
about being cautious. If you recall during the last quarter, I expressed a number of areas
where caution was warranted. And for me, when I look at the reforms today, while I'm very
pleased, the piece of the reform that we are still watching very closely -- well, we are
watching all pieces very closely. But one on which we're spending more time is that I've
talked about mediation before. In other words, things aren't falling out as we anticipated.
There's as much claims in the minor injury category as we thought originally. The number
of demand for payments has dropped very nicely. We see no surge in BI. But there's a
process by which people can mediate or challenge, if you want, the claims adjudication.
And we've seen at the industry level in Ontario an increase in the mediation, which led to
a backlog in the mediation process.
And the backlog creates, to a certain extent, a bit of certainty as to the ultimate impact of
the reform. And I would say that there's probably one claim out of ﬁve open claims, a bit
less than -- around 20% that could be subject to mediation.
So when you keep that in mind. And we certainly keep that in mind in reserving, we keep
that in mind in pricing, this is where we think we have not fully reached the level of
stability in Ontario. We are pleased with what we're seeing. But one has to understand all
the mid-to long-term implications. And mediation is the thing we have to keep an eye on
at this stage.

Q - Stephen Boland

Okay, that's great, thanks.

FINAL

Good morning, everyone. A question on personal property -- I think the combined ratio
shown obviously have the impact of cats in there. I was wondering if you could give us
what the accident year would have been excluding the cats and how that would look yearover-year. And maybe elaborate a little bit more on what kind of premium increases you
are getting and if we are able to see any more incremental beneﬁt in terms of that home
insurance action plan that you launched a while ago.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Let me take the ﬁrst part of your question, Tom. And then I will pass it along to Martin to
comment further. So personal prop -- core combined ratio excluding cats would be 98.8
in the quarter, last year, same period, 97.5. Okay?
When I think about that, I tell to myself, well, this is a high combined ratio excluding cat,
as far as I'm concerned. And one thing we've seen in the quarter is an increase in
frequency of about 11% in the quarter, excluding cats. And so we don't think it's
necessarily precipitation-driven. But likely the wind event leading up to the cat has put
upward pressure on frequency.
So upper 90s year-over-year basically is the ﬁrst part of your question. Then, Martin?

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sorry; that 98.8 and 97.5 -- is that excluding any prior development? Is that correct?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

So when we look at this year versus last year, excluding the cats, I think this is roughly a
point up from last year. So I think we are about in line.
In terms of premium increases, we are still processing at renewal close to double-digit
increases, or roughly 9% increases both in terms of amount of insurance and rate
increases at renewal. I think this is partly oﬀset by a change in the mix of business of just a
bit over 3 points that is related to we are writing less homeowners than we were in the
past, changing towards tenants. And we are also seeing consumers increasing their
deductibles as a reaction to the premium increases that they are facing at renewals. And
we are losing roughly 1% in terms of units. So that's how you reconcile the 3% of growth
that we have. So from that front, we are satisﬁed with the level of increases we are getting.
In terms of our home improvement plan, I think we were satisﬁed that we were reaching
the close to 15-point level in terms of improvement in the past two years. I think this year,
Page 8 of 21

Date: 2011-11-02

FINAL

we have a lot more catastrophe activity than we had in the past two years. So that shows
that there is still some volatility there that we have to better manage it. We are constantly
monitoring the activities that we have implemented. But we are also increasing the focus
on that line of business to see how we can, through product design and claims
management, continue to improve that line of business.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And maybe, Tom, I can come back to the ﬁrst part of the question. I commented on the
Third Quarter. And I think it's probably better to look at the ﬁrst nine months through the
core combined excluding cat and prior-year development was closer to 96% this ﬁrst nine
months this year. And it was pretty much at the same level ﬁrst nine months last year,
despite a 6% jump in frequency this year, which gives me a sense that the home insurance
action plan actually continued to gain traction this year.
It's clear, with a year like that, that our outlook for upper-single-digit rate increases in
home insurance is there to stay beyond the outlook period, in my view, probably another
12 months.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Doug Young, TD Securities.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

First question -- I think I ask this probably every quarter. But just on the commercial
market, I'm just curious as to what you are seeing. You mentioned it's a soft market
environment. I guess I'm surprised that we are not seeing more hardening trends and I'm
just wondering why you think that is and what you're hearing from the brokers on that
front.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think it's worth asking the question every quarter. We ask the question every week we
are here. So don't worry about it. Soft for new business, for sure. Now, the commercial
market is very big market. And the comments -- and there's a lot of (inaudible) in the
commercial lines market in terms of size, in terms of industry, in terms of province. And
sometimes you hear broad brush comments that apply to certain segments of the
industry but don't apply to other segments of the industry. And this is where our strategy,
which is highly segmented, in my view pays oﬀ.
And so when I look at the metrics this quarter, we were able to get rate increases close to
2%. We've had good unit growth. Retention has been pretty steady. And there are
pockets of the market opening up from time to time. And we are not going into what
these pockets are because we like to enjoy them. But our approach there to get rates has

Page 9 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

Date: 2011-11-02

FINAL

been to be focused on individual risk characteristics. We have segments where we are
getting upper teens, low 20s type increases. Small segments -- and then there are broad
segments where we are getting a low-single digit and segments where we are getting
nothing, just to maintain our retention.
We have a very clear view of the ROE by industry classes, by type of business. And we are
managing our pricing strategy based on our assessment of the return segmented by
class, industry as well as territory. I think that we've seen a change in the past year. We've
mentioned we don't expect acceleration, necessarily, in the coming 12 months. There's
two factors for me that will be relevant in the coming 24 months. I think the yield impact is
likely to support a better environment if you take a 24-month perspective. I think we
talked about reinsurance before. The world will change on that front. And especially for
insurers who are heavy users of reinsurance in commercial lines, which is many of the
reinsurers we compete with. That is likely to put upward pressure as well.
So results in commercial lines have been good historically at the industry level. But 4 or
ﬁve years of soft market, lower yield environment, potential mild upward pressure on the
reinsurance front should help if you take a 24-month perspective.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

And can you quantify -- have you made much progress in the midmarket at this point in
time? And if so, can you give us some numbers around that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. I think we have made progress. In the quarter our midmarket segment premium was
up 6.2%, which is higher than the overall book. And therefore that's very good progress
as far as I'm concerned. We are seeing that on the submission side, that is, the number of
demands for quotes in the midmarket segment were up 25% from last year. So we are
making very good progress.
I would say that the mother, though, of all progress is deﬁnitely the AXA acquisition,
where we are picking up very good midmarket expertise that will be a good complement
to ours. We're picking up specialty niches as well. And our overall commercial portfolio
goes from CAD1 billion premiums to CAD2 billion of premiums, which is close to twice
number 2 in commercial lines in segments, which is really small to mid commercial lines.
We did not reach outside the sort of size target that we had before the transaction.
So I think this is a great step forward and it's certainly -- I've mentioned to investors in the
past year that our objective was to double our market share in midmarket. That's done. So
we're working on a new objective there. But that's a good step forward.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay. And just on the personal property side, or I guess maybe just generally on the
weather, it seems like the weather conditions are being more consistently bad. And I think
you mentioned that you haven't changed your cat loading. I'm just curious as to why you
haven't taken that step.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Because we changed it last year. We changed it as a result of our home insurance action
plan. And I think -- Martin, was it at the end of 2009 or the end of 2010 that we did a
complete review?

FINAL

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

Yes; that was at the end of 2009. And what we are targeting in terms of cat loadings is that
they would be right two years out of 3. So we are not just choosing a mid -- median
approach. So we are using some conservatism in there. But there's this one year out of 3
where they will not be suﬃcient.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

You said you changed that in 2009?

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

That's right.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

And how has that kind of matched up relative to actual experience?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. So we have updated the analysis in October, actually. And I sat down with Martin and
some of the actuaries to go over these cat loadings. And it seems to be getting the job
done.

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

Now, exactly when we look at the longer period like 15 years or when we look at the
period of the last ﬁve years, I think we see that our cat loadings are reacting well to that
time span, both those time spans.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

This is not -- we are not implying that we are satisﬁed with our rate position. We're just
saying, from a cat point of view, I think we have refreshed our view based on the
assessment we did a couple of years ago. I think we are at the right place. But we are still
pushing rate increases in the system.

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

Yes. We know what we are chasing. We're not pushing the target further ahead of us.

Q - Andre Hardy
The ﬁrst one is for Mark. Can you help us understand how much more integration costs
you expect in upcoming quarters?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Sure. So I think the initial indication we gave, which we are still generally comfortable with,
is that we would expect total expense roughly equal to one times the ultimate savings.
And as far as -- obviously, what we would have loved to have done is accrued all this
quarter and run it through. But there's accounting rules; a certain thing has to happen
before you can actually book it.
Our expectation is we'll get roughly two thirds of that out of the way in 2011 with about a
third of it left to come probably in the early quarters of 2012.

Q - Andre Hardy
So just to paraphrase you, about CAD100 million, very roughly, of integration costs?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

After-tax.

Correct, including the CAD29 million that we took this quarter.

Q - Andre Hardy
Okay.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

CAD29 million was a before-tax number.

That was the before tax, right.

Q - Andre Hardy
Thank you. Then on Ontario auto, I think, like Doug, this is a question I've asked before.
You are doing much better than the industry. But the industry is not doing well. A 95%
combined ratio, which is what you implied Intact is currently seeing in its Ontario auto
business -- is that something that satisﬁes you for getting the competition? And the reason
I ask is, you are being very clear that you want to increase the premiums written in Ontario
auto. And when do I have to start worrying that your growth objectives will supplant, if
you will, your proﬁtability objectives?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. Two good questions -- ﬁrst of all, Andre, I think what you assume to go from, to come
up with 95% is 110% minus the 15% I talked about. So I think it's close to 110%; slightly
below 110% is our assessment. And second of all, you assume we have the same expense
ratio as the industry. So I have never commented in terms of what our combined ratio was
by province. And we are not going to start this morning. So let's just say it's probably a bit
below that level at this stage.
And when you look at what is satisfactory or not in automobile insurance and in other
lines of business, I look at the expected return that we get on that. And you need to keep
in mind that in relative terms, the Ontario automobile businesses a longer-tailed business
than the automobile business in the other provinces or that -- than property business.
So I think a combined ratio in the mid-90s, assuming that's what it would be, would be
satisfactory in the Ontario market, given the investment income proﬁle, though I don't
want to comment on our speciﬁc combined ratio.

FINAL

I think the way -- when should one get concerned about our desire to grow overtaking
our desire for underwriting performance? There's two or three things that I think I would
put on the table. The ﬁrst one is our track record about performance. The second one is,
as you know, we have two core objectives in running the business and we've presented
that to investors before. The ﬁrst core objectives which drives our strategies our
compensation and how we manage the business, is are we out performance by at least
500 basis points every year.
The growth objective at Intact is to grow our operating earnings per share. That's how we
-- over time. So that's how we fortify our operating earnings, our growth ambitions, with
an earnings growth ambition as opposed to a top-line growth ambition.
And the third point I would make is that we could be criticized, in fact, for having waited
too long before restarting growth in Ontario, given the improvements that we've seen
recently. We have shrunk our direct business, I would say, meaningfully, which was
concentrated in the GTA.
So hard to answer this one, when you should get nervous. But I can tell you that the
drivers of how we run the business are very much bottom-line driven.

Q - Andre Hardy
Thank you.

(Operator Instructions) Paul Holden, CIBC.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Just one question -- so you've already made some good progress with the AXA
integration. And quite quickly. Maybe you could just provide us with a roadmap of the key
action items that still need to be completed and the associated expected time lines with
those items.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Paul, at our upcoming investors day on -- when is it? November 15 -- that's in a couple of
weeks from now. A big portion of the time there will be used to provide updates on how
far we've gone, what is left in the pipeline. So ﬁrst we'd invite people who want to hear
more about the integration to join the Investor Day.
Lots has been done already. And if I think about the big-ticket items for me in the coming
12 to 18 months, when we announced the transaction we talked about getting everything
done within 24 months. That was the time line we had put on the table. We clearly worked
really hard this summer, during the spring. Everybody really jumped in there. And that's
why we are able to start the conversion probably a bit earlier than what most would have
anticipated.

FINAL

The teams are in place right now. On the day of the closing, we announced senior
management, the top 120 jobs in the organization have been communicated to the
outside world on the day of the closing. And I would say that by November 1, which was
yesterday, we had conﬁrmed pretty much to all employees what their role would be and
whether there would be a role or not. So from a team point of view, from a product point
of view, as I've talked in my remarks, from a system point of view, we are well on our way
there.
So what are the big ticket items going forward? Well ﬁrst, renewing policies on our system
will take us 15 months from today because the business that we are currently uploading
on our systems will be renewals eﬀective in January, because you need to give 45 days at
least to brokers to process the renewals. New business is processed on our system these
days.
So there's a time line that comes with the length of a policy here, Paul, that's important.
On the people front, we have created the team, we have identiﬁed who is doing what. We
had a fair bit of similarity between our footprints from coast to coast. But people are not
all under the same roof at this stage because as you run a business, you have to take into
account the practical and economic implication of leases and those sorts of things. That
for me will take many months, still, to come.

Bloomberg Transcript

Another important item here is deﬁnitely the closing of the life co. So we entered into an
agreement; that is not closed. We are hoping we will be able to do that very early in 2012
and we are working hard to make that happen.
Then the other element from an operational point of view is that when you acquire a
business as opposed to a portfolio, it comes with open claims from the past. And so the
conversion process for these open claims -- we normally wait a bit for the conversion of
the claims to take place. So as to reduce the volume to be converted in terms of open
claims. And that will be done in the latter part of the time line that we've put on the table.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

I think that's one of the main reasons we talk about 15 months for the conversion but 18 to
24 months to realize the synergies because what we've done in prior transactions is we
wait until everything converts, then we take the few claims that are still left on the original
system and turn oﬀ. So the claims system is typically the last thing to get migrated.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. And if I continue on claims, Paul. And what we are busy doing at the moment, I've
talked about the beneﬁts of managing claims ourselves, managing legal ﬁles ourselves.
So we are in the process of hiring additional resources so that we can run the combined
organization at 99% internal management of ﬁles or close to 100%.
So there is some work left to be done here. We don't want to leave anyone with the
impression that we are done. There's a lot of work left in the coming period.

Page 15 of 21

Then the most important thing and the ﬁrst principle in the integration process is to
maintain an exceptional service for customers and for brokers. And we are hiring
additional resources to manage the conversion so that the service experience remains as
strong as it was before the transaction during the conversion period.

FINAL

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Maybe we should talk a little bit more on that last point, particularly with respect to policy
retention. What kind of actions are you taking to minimize attrition. And if you can give us
a sense of what kind of attrition rates you do expect?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. So on the last part of your question, I'm not going there this morning, Paul. I think our
view is that since we have most the best products in the industry now, very good price
position, we are managing price dislocations to minimize dislocation as much as possible.
We've got, for brokers, the best team in the industry, very strong local presence. We're
there for brokers in good and in bad times. And brokers know the people who make the
ﬁnal decisions in Canada, which is not something you get -- so these attributes you don't
ﬁnd in that combination with any other insurers in Canada.
So as far as I'm concerned, for brokers and for customers, our goal is to keep the
business, all the business. Let it be very clear to everyone. So far, the reception has been
good. I think there are brokers who will or have decided to move their portfolio if they are
called. They manage their business the way they want. But the reception has been very
good. So far, from coast to coast. Pockets here and there that we are managing at the
individual level. But we see no reasons for people not to take what we think is an
exceptional value proposition.

Thanks, that's helpful, no more questions.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

The question ﬁrst -- Charles, to ﬂesh out what you said on mediation. You said about 20%
of the ﬁles -- I think that's the way you described it -- 20% in mediation. How does that
compare to what it has been in the past? You refer to a backlog. So what was it like in the
past?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

This was -- I don't have an average number over a given number of years. But in the past,
it probably would have been less than half of that.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

FINAL

So that really takes -- what are you implying, then, by saying that the backlog is -- and then
I guess maybe twice what it used to be that, if the mediation falls out and it's not in your
favor, how would that manifest itself in your results? Would it be weaker development, or
how does that play out?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

This is where, Mario, when you look at how we reserve for the business, there's what we
call the casing curve, which is what every adjuster does. And the adjuster establishes the
reserves with the knowledge that there will be a mediation, obviously. So that is partly
reﬂected there. Then the actuaries then take a position as to what they are observing in
the ﬁeld, their understanding of the fact that there is a mediation backlog and adjust their
reserves accordingly.
And so, while the results have improved, if you look at the IBNR as a percentage of our
premiums, it has been pretty steady over the past couple of years. In other words, our
enhanced view of the environment has not been really translated into less actuarial
provisions, in part because of this uncertainty. So I am cautious as to what this means. But
I believe that our ﬁnancial position and our approach to reserving reﬂects the caution
related to the mediation that's in the pipeline.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

So in describing, in alerting us to this idea that mediation is -- or the backlog is 20% -- in
highlighting that all, what message are you sending us, that while you feel good about the
way the claims are developing and you feel good about the reforms, you are not yet
ready to give us the all clear signal that this is sustainable? Is that the message?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

That's exactly the message, Mario. I brought up mediation, I believe, last quarter. And you
know me; I'm putting it on the table as we see it and as we manage the business. Results
in the ﬁeld are improving, as we anticipated, if not better. The thing one needs to watch is
the outcome of these mediations. And the things that we are watching we are providing
for in reserving and in pricing.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Maybe just a ﬁnal question on this topic -- why do you ﬁgure mediation has spiked the
way it has, or the backlog as?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Do you want to comment on that, Martin?

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

Well this is a change in environment. So people will test the system. And there is
uncertainty as to what the interpretation of each of the rules that have been put in place
Page 17 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

really mean. So I think we are in that phase where people are trying to see where are the
loopholes in the system and how this will settle into more certainty.

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

You are exactly right. I think that with the minor injury guidelines, for instance, which
introduced a cap at the -- I believe it's at CAD3500 level -- that's a major change in the
product. A large proportion of the claims fall in that basket. That percentage has held very
steadily, as I have mentioned earlier. But that's a big change in the system. And a number
of operators are testing. So to speak, or trying to get out of the minor injury guidelines or
receive a payment if they have been denied a payment. So it's not abnormal activity. It's
just the change is so big that the activity has spiked up.
So this is a thing to watch in the overall reform that's panning out, in my view, as
anticipated if not better.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Another 12 months, then, before you could give us anything conclusive? Is that fair?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

You know, Mario, I talked about 18 months following the reforms to get the 6 anticipated.
And maybe as much as 6 for the actions we've taken. We are saying, in the quarter, we are
at 9. There's caution in our approach in part because of mediation. I think at six months
from now we will have a better grasp on the stability.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

That's helpful. One ﬁnal thing, then. You referred to some supply chain beneﬁts in the
medium term. You haven't built that into any of your -- into your 15% accretion
commentary. Is that true?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. It is.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

That is true? So you anticipate something; you haven't built it in yet. Could you just talk
maybe about the nature of these supply chain gains you would expect?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. There are a few. In our remarks this morning, we talked about the fact that the $100
million we felt still pretty good about. We talked about the fact that the reinsurance cost
could go up. We also said there would be short-term supply chain management. Let me
comment on that ﬁrst. And then I will talk about the midterm supply chain management
gains.

Page 18 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2011-11-02

Short-term supply chain is just the upside of taking the new claims from AXA to our
existing contracts. And so -- in part of the preparation for the integration, the claims team
did a great job and identiﬁed that they could move new claims to our contracts over the
coming -- over 2012-2013 with relative ease. I shouldn't say that. But that's what I picked
up.

FINAL

So we think that will upset the additional reinsurance cost over that period.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Start moving to your contracts?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Things like car rentals, glass, paint, that kind of stuﬀ.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

What is midterm supply chain for us is to say all of a sudden you are 40% bigger as a
company, as a customer for many people. And you ought to ask yourself whether the deal
you have in place is reﬂective of the fact that you are 40% bigger.
And so this is an exercise. Once the integration is well on its way, once we are satisﬁed
that the service remains top notch, the claims folks will start to look into that and work with
suppliers to make sure we get the deal that we deserve, given our size.
Now, this is important. But this is less tangible a beneﬁt; it's less tangible in terms of how
you can assess it. That's why we didn't put it in the model or in the numbers. But that's
clearly something we will work on.

amortized over a sort of 10-year type horizon. The other CAD820 million we consider
indeﬁnite intangibles and basically will not be
