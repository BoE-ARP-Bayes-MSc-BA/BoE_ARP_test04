Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the First Quarter 2014 Activity Indicator Release Conference
Call.
I will now hand over to Mr. Andrew Wallace-Barnett. Sir, please go ahead.

Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Okay. Good evening to all of you and welcome to the AXA conference call, covering the first
quarter 2014 activity indicators. Gérald Harlin, the group CFO will lead you through the main
messages included in the press release which was issued by the company just a few minutes ago
and which is available on the website. This will be followed by a question-and-answer session.
Gérald, the floor is yours.

Gérald Harlin
Thank you, Andrew and good evening to everybody. Before moving to the Q&A, let me give you a
quick recap of the main figures for this quarter. Overall, I would say that the trading conditions
were quite positive, with total revenues up 2% on a comparable basis.
I would like to remind you of the strong ForEx impact compared to last year, the euro, the strength
– the euro strength and against the yen, the U.S. dollar, and other Asian currencies. It explains,
again, the difference between the reported and comparable basis. You will see that the year has
started with further improvement in product mix across all segments. We are continuing to be very
selective in the business. We are right in line with our Ambition AXA strategy.
Let's start with Life. From the Life side, the revenues are up 1% to €15.8 billion, APE down 6% to
€1.6 billion, mainly due to the product repositioning in Switzerland and some exceptional sales in
the first quarter of 2013, principally in Germany and the UK. In the quarter, NBV was up 1% to €0.5



FINAL

billion and our NBV margin continued to increase, up 3% to 33%, driven by the improved product
mix.
One feature of the quarter was a decrease in Protection & Health APE, largely due to the
repositioning of our Group Life product mix in Switzerland towards pure protection products with
lower premium and higher NBV margin. These declines were partly offset by continued increased
volumes in France, U.S., MedLA, and high-growth Asia. We remain confident about our overall
growth momentum for the year 2014. And we are well-positioned to increase our Life & Savings
APE compared to last year.
Let's speak now from the P&C. On the Property & Casualty side, revenues were up 3%, mainly
driven by 2% average tariff increases and higher volumes in high-growth markets plus 10% and
Direct plus 8%. Personal lines grew by 2% and Commercial lines by 4%. We believe that this good
momentum should continue through the year and translate into higher growth in 2014 versus last
year.

Bloomberg Transcript

On Asset Management, revenues were up 2%, thanks to both AXA IM and AllianceBernstein. Net
flows amounted to plus €1.5 billion for the period with plus €4.8 billion inflows at AXA IM and minus
€3.3 billion outflows at AB. AXA IM benefited from strong net inflows in fixed income, while AB had
limited outflows driven by the loss of two large contracts in the institutional channel, partly offset by
net inflows in the private clients channel.
Note also that our economic solvency ratio continued to improve during the quarter and was
estimated to be around 210% as at the end of March. So, overall, we had a sound quarter with
revenues up across all segments, good performance across the board in P&C and a further
improved product mix and a higher NBV in Life. We did see a decline in Life APE due to the product
repositioning in Switzerland and the non-repeat of exceptional sales in Q1 2013 in Germany and the
UK.
As I said, we are confident about the growth momentum for 2014 and expect to increase both our
Life & Savings APE and P&C growth compared to last year.
I'm happy now to answer your questions.

Q&A
Operator
We have a question from Paul De'Ath from RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Paul C. De'Ath
Yeah, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of questions, please.
Firstly, looking at the performance of Tian Ping because I note that this isn't actually included within
your numbers due to the change in the accounting methodology and it would be good to get an
idea of how that business is operating.
And the second point is just on the U.S. variable annuity buyout. Obviously, you note in the release
that a large part of the outflows that you're seeing have come from that buyout. And just a bit of
an update, please, on how that's going. Is it now finished? And kind of what level of take-up did
you get overall on that project? Thanks.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. The first point about Tian Ping, Tian Ping is not in these figures. It's not consolidated.



The second point is about the net inflows. Net inflows amounted to €1.8 billion. But you are right,
that means that the buyout of the VA explains minus €0.9 billion, which means that excluding this
element, we'd have net inflows of €2.7 billion, which is quite a good number.

FINAL

Q - Paul C. De'Ath
Okay. Thanks. And just on – and I register that Tian Ping's not included in the numbers, but, if
there's any kind of anecdotal comments you can make on how that business is going.

A - Gérald Harlin
No, it's going well, in line with our expectation, nothing specific to mention. The growth is quite
nice.

Q - Paul C. De'Ath
Okay. Thanks.

Operator
We have a question from Farooq Hanif from Citigroup. Please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi there. Hope you can hear me clearly.

A - Gérald Harlin
Yes.

A - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Sure.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi there. So, firstly, you're talking about being confident about APE growth for the full year. Can you
explain what's going to get you there, given that you have the FX effects and various others that
you've already seen in Q1, so is it because of comparables later in the year or is there something
else that you can point to that's concrete?

A - Gérald Harlin
No.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

And in particular, I noticed that your new business margin in the U.S. is up quite a lot. That's
obviously before interest rate adjustments year-to-date. So, I was wondering whether you're still
willing to be more aggressive in growing in the U.S. That's, just growth is one question.
And second question, you talk about your mix being better, but Protection & Health has been very
weak in APE. So, just kind of wondering where you see that going. Thanks very much.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. Let's be clear. What I said is – clearly, is that our APE are expected to be positive for 2014.
That's what I said. You are absolutely right saying that Protection & Health is at minus 15% on the
first quarter. But, as I said, it's due to one-off elements that are not expecting to be recurring
during the year.



FINAL

Let's explain why. The first element is due to Switzerland. As you know, we have two type of – you
know that, in Switzerland, the most important part of our Life business is Protection, its group
Pension. And we have two different type of contracts, full protections. That means that we are
covering biometric risk plus investment risk and semiautonomous, which means that we're
covering exclusively biometric risk. That means death and disability, excluding savings part.
What we decided to do, as you know, in Switzerland, we have the SST, which is the Swiss Solvency
Test, which is Solvency II, but even tougher. And that means that, in a low interest rate
environment, reinvesting as we did in the past CHF3 billion to CHF4 billion a year is some – in a low
interest rate environment, is something which brings here this dilution, which is not favorable for
the policyholders but also for the shareholders.
So, what we decided is that, for no change, I would say, on the traditional tied agent side because
it's mostly full protection that we sell there. But, on the broker channel where we deal with medium
and large companies, which are exposed to, I would say, price competition, there, we decided
mostly to move to the semiautonomous part. Why? Because it saves capital, and the return is
better. And that explains why the Switzerland case explains most of the negative performance of
the APE.

Bloomberg Transcript

On top of this, we have Germany. And in Germany, in fact, what happens is that we had –
remember maybe that, last year, we had a strong production in health due to the non-repeat of –
and we had – and we didn't repeat the strong sales of the first quarter. Why? Because there was a
change in regulation. And during – up to mid-2014, we had strong sales due to the anticipated
switch to unisex tariffs.
Last but not least, we had strong one-offs or strong production I would say, new business sales in
the UK due to the pension – what we call pension tips (11:28). So, these three elements explains
most of what I would call, as I would say seasonality effect plus some one-off effect in the first
quarter. And that's why we are confident in our ability to post a positive APE growth for 2014.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

And just going back on the U.S. business...

A - Gérald Harlin
Yes.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Some of your competitors, who are making very strong margins in the U.S., is seeing this as a good
time to grow. What's your attitude toward the VA market right now and willing to grow?

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. What I can tell you, Farooq, is that, in the first quarter, Annuity grew by 8%, which is quite
strong. And Life was down 19%. And Life is much, much smaller. So, that means that, yes, on the
Annuity side, we are growing, and we still expect to grow during the whole year. So that means
that we – the U.S. posted a plus 5% growth on an APE basis in – no, it was 4%, sorry.
We posted plus 4% on an APE basis. You'll notice that our NBV margins went up from 24% to 32%,
plus eight points. And this compares with an average NBV margin for 2013 of 27%. So, you can see
that we are growing, point number one. Also, this growth is slowed down because the Life
business is not so profitable so we prefer to be down in Life. And the profitability is going up quite
strongly.



And as you can imagine, last point, most – we had a very strong growth in products like Retirement
Cornerstone which are Accumulator type of products, VA type of products, but which are less
difficult to hedge because we benefit from – we propose a viable guaranteed interest rate.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thank you very much.

A question from Nick Holmes from Société Générale. Please go ahead.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you very much.

A - Gérald Harlin
Hello.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, I have a couple of questions. The first one is just coming back on the variable annuities. A lot
of U.S. players are backing away at the moment. And just interested if you could elaborate a little
bit more. I know you've given some commentary on this already, on the risk reward profile that you
see in this business. Is it, do you think an opportunity to get back into the top five in that type of
product, or are you more sort of circumspect about the risk appetite?
And then, secondly, just on France, just looking at Unit-Linked production, you've been making
progress there. And I just wondered what scope you see to really improve Unit-Linked production
further. Do you think there's a sort of level above which you can't go in France because of cultural
sort of preferences, or do you think there's quite a good story for the Unit-Linked possible in
France going forward? Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. Nick, answering the first part of your question related to the U.S. VA sales, of course, we
manage a certain level of risk appetite. That means that what we did in the past, and we have
been among the first one to do – to revise the conditions of the products, to update them and so
on and so forth. It's not in order now to go back to the top of the league table of the VA sales, not
at all. That means that we have strong growth. But as I mentioned before, answering Farooq's
question, we take care that we – our growth is on less risky products. Also, they are extremely
profitable. So, we are combining growth, monitored growth with high profitability. But, our intention
is not to be back, as you said, in the first five, for example. And nevertheless, we still are quite
ambition in our global growth of the U.S.
About France, as you know, we are at a level of Unit-Linked which amounts to 30% of our savings,
which is a good level, not very far from twice the average level for France. Last year, we were much
lower. So, that proves that we have gradually an improvement. Do we see a limit to this? I would
say that depends also on the financial markets. But, globally speaking, we are encouraging –
including with our commissioning, we are encouraging our sales force to sell more Unit-Linked
because the profitability is much higher.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

And, Gérald, just on that point, is it still correct that profitability for Unit-Linked is about three times
higher than for traditional?



A - Gérald Harlin

FINAL

No, because we improved the profitability of the traditional. I would say that it's – today, it's – we
could say that it's between 1 to 1.5 and 1 to 2, something around this because we significantly
improved because you know that – keep in mind that, in a country like France, we kept our
expenses flat during the last years, which means that, gradually, when you have growth, we benefit
from a unit costs which are going down. And even for the general accounts, this makes – this is
quite helpful. And it enhances our profitability.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Okay. Very good. Thank you very much.

A question from Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you very much. Can you hear me okay, Gérald?

A - Gérald Harlin
Yes, yes, hello.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. Good evening. A couple of small questions from me. Can you talk about the Unit-Linked
net flows? I think there was a €2 billion swing from one year to the next. Now, obviously, half of that
is the U.S. Can you just talk about what the other half is? Does it relate back to these exceptional
items you talked about?
The second question is Japan, quite a lot of volatility in the volumes there. Is the €82 million you've
printed for Q1 2014, is that a good run rate for the business going forwards now?
My third question is, just looking at the Mediterranean region, volumes up, but margins quite
heavily down. And I just wonder what's going on there if you can comment on that, please.
And the final question is in the P&C business, I see that price increases are starting to come down
from the level we saw last year. I just wonder what impact, if any, that's going to have on your
growth strategy in P&C. Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. Let's start with Japan. And I'll cover all your questions. Let's start with Japan. Your question is
are you satisfied with this level. You know, the decline in Japan is mostly explained by the lower
sales following the redesign of our – some of our protection product, which is long-term Life
products. And it was in April 2013, so we had strong sales in the first quarter of 2013, so the
reference is pretty high.
Does it mean that we are – that we expect during the whole year to be at a level which is so much
down because, as you know, we had APE, as you said, at €82 million, minus 15% compared to last
year. The answer is no. And we consider that this NCTP (20:11) high sales volume in the first quarter
of last year means that, there again, we have a seasonality effect that should disappear during the
year.
On the MedLA region, which was your third question, on MedLA, yes, you are right. You said – your
remark was to say that we had APE growth which was quite strong, but NBV margin which was



FINAL

down. Just look at the relative level of sales that means that we are still at high level of profitability
and that's mostly due to the fact that it's due to the business mix. That means that, at the scale of
MedLA, last year, we had a level which was low. And the business mix meant that we moved down
from, on average, 32% NBV margin to 28%, but no worry on that side. We still are focusing like in
other country on Protection and Unit-Linked.
The P&C pricing increase, yes, indeed, we can say that the price increase was 3% last year. It went
down to 2.2% in the first quarter. But I would say that it's – I would say that the P&C outlook is quite
good. As you remember last year, we were at zero in the mature countries. We are at plus 1%. And
we consider that price increases at 2.2% is an absolutely good level. So, we're quite positive, as I
said, on the P&C. And we don't consider this lower price increase as poor news.
What was your first question? Yes, it's mostly the UK. So, that means your question was about the
net inflows in Unit-Linked. It was the U.S. and the UK.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Can I come back on a couple of those, please, Gérald?

A - Gérald Harlin
Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

So Japan, I wasn't implying that you'd be down 15% for the full year. I'm just wondering, is the €82
million, is that a good run rate in absolute terms going forward? There doesn't look to be a huge
amount of seasonality in Japan, looking over the years. There's some, but not huge amounts. Just
wonder – that was my question more on Japan.

A - Gérald Harlin
Yeah, but you – I believe I answered your question. But sorry for that. No, that means that we – I
cannot consider that it's a good run rate. And you can see on – I believe that in the appendix, you
can see that it's in currency. Yes, you can see in the appendix the run rate and you have the – that's
the revenue. So, it's not the APE. But we could offline give you a bit more detail about this. But the
run rate – I hope that the run rate will be higher, yes.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And on the MedLA – sorry – I just didn't quite get what's actually changed in the
year. You've had volumes up, margins down. I don't think there's – unless I'm wrong, there's not
been any change in the product strategy over that time, has there? I would've thought that, just
naturally, with volumes going up, your margins should be going up, assuming the product mix is
staying the same.

A - Gérald Harlin
We had a relative higher share of G/A Savings, mostly in Italy and in Portugal. That's the reason why.
So, we had G/A Savings which was extremely low in the past. Why? Due to the economic situation,
especially in Italy. So, on a relative basis, no specific change. What I meant in my answer was that
there was no specific change in our philosophy and in our approach. But, on a relative basis, there
is a bit more G/A Savings.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Gérald. And finally, sorry, just on P&C pricing, is the 2.2%, is that enough to cover
or to offset claims inflation at the moment?



A - Gérald Harlin
Yes.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin

A question from François Boissin from Exane BNP. Please go ahead.

Q - François Boissin
Yes, good afternoon. A question on the outlook for Life margins, please. You reported 33% NBV
margin in Q1, which is healthy. I just wondered what the outlook was for this number for the
remaining of the year 2014. Basically, what is the, I mean, in what – in which geographies do you
expect to potentially raise this number and in which business lines?

Bloomberg Transcript

And I guess the other question is, to what extent are you worried by the current interest rate
environment? And how could current interest rates impact this number?
And as a follow up, I would like to know if you release an internal rate of return for Q1. Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
No, we don't. And first of all, we don't release any internal rate of return. We do it once a year.
The second point is, at the NBV margin, my comment was more to say that the – I was expecting
the top line to grow NBV margin at 33%. Last year, we had 35%. So, it's already an excellent level.
What I'm expecting and that's the message I wanted to convey is the fact that we were not
expecting to be on an APE basis at minus 6% for the year, but that will be positive.
And your question was, where do we expect growth? We expect growth in the U.S., we mentioned
already. So, we started the year at 4%, but we can expect to be higher for the whole year.
Southeast Asia, China, the UK as well, in France, we should be positive, and Japan. Japan, as I
explained, answering a previous question, we started at minus 15%, which is quite low and we
expect to be positive this year in Japan. So, that's mostly.
On the reverse, I could say that the situation I described for Switzerland, since as you know, most
of the significant part of the new business is slow during the first quarter. We'd still be significantly
negative in Switzerland for the reason I explained before, i.e. the fact that we move for some part
of the contract to semiautonomous products.
And also, in Germany, but we can expect that, progressively, it will – the effect of this first quarter
and the high sales in Health in the first quarter due to change of the regulation will go fading. So,
that's mostly it.

Q - François Boissin
Okay. And on the current interest rate environment and the potential impact on margins?

A - Gérald Harlin



FINAL

I don't – what I said is that, of course, we don't publish margin. But, in the first quarter, we don't
publish our earnings. But what I can say that we are still managing a long duration. It's more than
seven years in Life. We didn't change. So that means that we're quite well. We don't have any
mismatch between assets and liability, which means concretely that I don't expect that this might
have a small effect, but I repeat a small effect. I'm not expecting a large effect coming from this
low interest rate environment, at least for this year. We'll see after.

Q - François Boissin
Okay. Thanks very much.

A question from Farooq Hanif from Citigroup. Please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi there. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Sorry to prolong this. But just wanted to know, firstly,
going back again to the growth question, so you think APE will be up, and presumably in local
currency terms. Is that going to come from Protection & Health? Obviously, you've given some
regions, but what about products?

A - Gérald Harlin

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

And secondly, can you tell us what your early thoughts are on the EIOPA stress test? Thanks.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. Two different questions. On the first one about – my comment on the global APE is valid for
Protection & Health. That means that we expect Protection & Health APE to be positive this year.
On the second question, it's on the stress test. I have no specific worry for the stress test of the
EIOPA. So it's part of the exercise. We did it last year, so, no worry.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

A - Gérald Harlin
Again, as you noticed, we have a strong solvency position, so no specific worry.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Except that, though, when you look at the test, it looks fairly harsh and, if I may say so, not very well
thought out. But you obviously seem comfortable, so that's fine.

A - Gérald Harlin
Yeah. No, we still have a discussion on the test, on the curve, on the yield curves. We have some
open questions. But, again, I don't have any specific worry.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

A question from Andrew Crean from Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

FINAL

Good evening, Gérald.

A - Gérald Harlin
Hello, Andrew.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Couple of questions. One, if you look back over the last seven years, on the Life net flows, over
half the net flows in the year appear in the first quarter, which suggests there's a level of
seasonality there. Is that – do you see that as likely to recur this year or do you think that there are
special factors this year which may change that pattern?
And secondly, going back onto the EIOPA stress test, the more you've looked at your own
economic capital which sort of crystallized base (30:59) relative to the Omnibus II stuff which was
put out at the back end of last year, do you think there will be – if you were to do your economic
capital on the current long-term guarantees, do you think it would change the numbers and the
coverage significantly?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. And your first question related to the net flows. I would say that, if I exclude the U.S. impact
and the €0.9 billion I mentioned before, we would be at €2.7 billion. Last year, we posted €1.1 billion,
and excluding the exceptional last year, we were at €4 billion – slightly above €4 billion. I can expect
this year to be better than last year in term of net inflows, but it's a bit premature to tell you
exactly where we will be.
But, on your second question, which is a question on QIS...

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Could you repeat your question, Andrew, perhaps?

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Yeah. The economic capital coverage ratio which you publish is – doesn't bake in some of the
Omnibus II sort of long-term guarantee issues. What I was wondering – I know Alliance have
spoken on this at length. What would happen to your economic capital coverage if you were to
sort of bake in all the sort of newer sums (32:28)?

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. I see your question, which is an important one. But I remind you that I cannot precisely
answer your question yet. I know that Alliance mentioned 20 to 30. And I'm sure that you're
referring to this.

Q - Andrew J. Crean
Yeah.

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}



A - Gérald Harlin

FINAL

A 20 to 30 points impact. As I said in one-on-ones to some of you, my initial feeling was that it was
high. But I cannot be more precise. As you know, we will review our models with – the SAPR (33:08)
will review our models in – by the end of the year. And we'll get a full clarity, I would say, next year,
most probably mid of next year.
So, I have no – I'm not at all anxious starting from a position of 210. No doubt that there will be
some adjustment and adjustment which concerns all the companies. And you can see that, starting
from a comfortable point, that level, that 210, is that I'm quite comfortable for the future. On the
magnitude of these adjustments, unfortunately, it's too early.

Q - François Boissin
Yes, actually, my follow-up questions have been answered. Thank you.

We have no more questions. We have no more questions. We have a question from Daniel Bischof
from Helvea. Please go ahead.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Yes, good evening. Just on the Group Life business in Switzerland again, I'm a bit surprised about
the timing of your to reposition your product offering there. I mean, AXA Winterthur was growing
the BVT (34:40) strongly in 2013 when interest rates were quite a bit lower. And since then, the
SST (34:46) has rather been relaxing for pricing (34:48). And so, why did you plan the repositioning
right now? And did the proposed pension reforms or did (34:57) guarantees play a role there as
well?

A - Gérald Harlin
I would say that, as you know, our profitability is quite good. I'll remind you that we have, on
average, an IRR in Switzerland which should be around 13%. For a country where rates are below
1%, it's quite good. That's on average. But, as you can imagine, the marginal impact, and we take
care of the marginal impact of the new production. And what we said is that we have two type of
business, as I said. We have the business with the tied agents; we have the business with the
brokers. And the margin on profitability of business with brokers is lower. And that explains why we
prefer to optimize our capital.
Such type of decision is absolutely in line with; I would say Ambition AXA and what we call
selectivity. That means that – and more and more going forward, we will have to take care of
capital and marginal return on capital. And that's the reason why we decided this year to do it.
It doesn't mean that it's impressive because you have a decline in the APE ratio. But, you know –
keep in mind that the semiautonomous type of business makes that the NBV will be above 100%.
NBV margin will be above 100%. So, this explains why.
And beyond Switzerland, we could expect in the future to be faced in the Solvency II world
research type of move, which will be aim – which will aim at optimizing the return on capital. And



from time-to-time, it's at the expense of the top-line. But, what is important in the bottom line and
the return on capital.

It's just I assume that the returns were probably quite a bit low last year. And you took this decision
early this year.

A - Gérald Harlin
No, no, it's only because, progressively, – look, I mentioned that, among the reasons that I
mentioned just before, we have also the fact that, progressively, we have to invest at lower
interest rates. So, that's mainly the point. And keep in mind as well that some part of this business
of the investment part will be done with AXA IM. And on top of this, we will benefit from this new
improved business at AXA IM.
