Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, ACE had a very good First Quarter and a
strong start to the year. The quality and balance of earnings were excellent with solid
contributions from both underwriting and investments. Every division had strong revenue
growth. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $746 million, up 6.5% or $2.17 per
share, and our operating return on equity was 12%. Book value per share grew 1.6% and
now stands at $82.17.
Our underwriting results were simply excellent. We produced over $360 million of P&C
underwriting income, up 16% and a P&C combined ratio of 88.2%. This strong calendar
year underwriting performance was driven principally by current accident year
underwriting income, excluding catastrophes, that was up 37% from prior year and
generated a combined ratio of 89.4%. That's almost 2.5 points better than the First
Quarter last year. Our current accident year results reflect the excellent underlying health
of our current business, including overall growth in earned premium and a lower expense
ratio, as well as margin improvement in North America as a result of better pricing and mix
of business, and margin improvement internationally as a result of product and
geographic mix.
We produced $531 million in investment income in the quarter, down less than 2.5%, as we
benefited from an increase in partnership income. This is a good result given the
historically low interest rate environment in which we operate today and which will
continue to pressure investment income results for the entire industry for the foreseeable
future. As I pointed out in our shareholder letter, this challenging rate environment is a
direct consequence of the fed's quantitative easing efforts to stimulate economic growth
and bring down unemployment. While these efforts are well-intentioned, they penalize
long-term savers, including insurance companies, and encourage greater risk taking as
investors feel pressure and reach for yield, something we will not do. Phil will have more
to say about our investment portfolio and results.
Total Company net premiums in the quarter grew 6.3%, with growth coming primarily
from the US, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. In North America, with the exception of

agriculture, net premiums were up across the board, with retail commercial P&C up 8.5%,
wholesale P&C up over 13.5%, and our high-net-worth personal lines business up 12.5%.
Net premiums for our agriculture business, which we now break out for you as a reporting
segment, were down about 5% due to a modest amount of additional proportional
reinsurance protection we purchased for the '13 crop year, which means we had to trueup back to the Fourth Quarter. If you recall, crop premium volume is concentrated in the
second and Third Quarters.
Internationally, net premiums for ACE International were up 8% in constant dollars. We had
good growth in almost every territory. The UK was up 7%, Asia was up 14%, and Latin
America was up 12%, while the continent of Europe was relatively flat at 2%. By major
product area, commercial P&C overseas was up 7%, personal lines were up 21%, and A&H
was up 6.5%, all in constant dollars. We fully expect international A&H growth to
accelerate as the year progresses. Premiums in our London-based excess and surplus
lines business were up 5% with strong gains in energy in particular. Premiums at combined
insurance were essentially flat, and fundamentals there are improving, as predicted,
including number of active agents, which were well ahead of last year and resulting, in
annualized new business sales in our large US-core agent book of business that are up
nearly 14%. For our Global re-business, premiums for the quarter were up about 6%, and
net sales for our international life business grew 26% in Asia and Latin America, again, on
a constant dollar basis.
I want to say a few words about the current market environment. Our commercial P&C
business in the US continued to benefit from an improving price environment with another
quarter of rate-on-rate increases. Overall, North America pricing was up 3.5%, with retail
rates up 3%. By way of example, retail property rates were up 6%, and commercial D&O
rates were up 3% and trending higher during the quarter on a month-by-month. For risk
management business, rates were up 3.6%, and excess casualty rates were up about
4.5%. For our retail business, new business writings grew 27% year on year, and our
premium renewal retention rate, as measured by premium, was over 96% in the quarter,
with account retention at 86%.
On the US wholesale side of our business, ACE Westchester rates were up over 7%
overall, with property rates up 7%, professional lines rates up 6.3,% and casualty rates up
about 9%. The retail commercial P&C rate environment internationally remains
competitive but reasonably stable, with retail rates up 1% overall. Loss-making accounts
are getting rate. Otherwise, when business comes to market, it is competitive. In the UK
retail market, we're seeing modest firming in the primary casualty area. International
wholesale lines were up modest single digits in the First Quarter, but we're seeing signs
of greater competition in London wholesale that may not bode well for future growth in
that business. My colleagues and I can provide further color on market conditions and
pricing trends.
Earlier this month, we completed our acquisition of Mexican surety company Fianzas
Monterrey, and we just received regulatory approval for our acquisition of ABA Seguros,
Mexico's fourth-largest personal lines company, which we now expect will close in very
early May. With the addition of ABA and FM, ACE becomes a top-five P&C insurer in
Mexico.

In summary, we are off to a strong start to the year. Our underwriting results were
distinguished, and from a top-line perspective, we are taking full advantage of the
improved commercial P&C pricing environment in the US and our broad product capability
and geographic presence internationally.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil, and then we'll be back to take your questions.

Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Thanks, Evan. Tangible book value grew 2.1% for the quarter, and our cash and invested
assets grew $1.3 billion to $62.2 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $913
million. Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $112 million after tax, and
included $121 million realized gain from our variable annuity reinsurance portfolio.
Investment income for the quarter included $14 million of higher-than-expected private
equity and other distributions. Current new money rates are 2.3% if we invested in a
similar distribution to our existing portfolio, and our current book yield is 3.7%. We
estimate that the current quarterly investment income run rate is approximately $515
million, which is subject to variability in portfolio rates, private equity distributions, and FX.
Our net loss reserves were down $60 million in the quarter on a constant dollar basis due
to payments related to Sandy and last year's crop losses. Our paid-to-incurred ratio was
107% for the quarter. When we normalize the First Quarter ratio for Sandy and crop loss
payments, the ratio is 88%. Cat losses were $28 million after tax in the quarter, and we
had positive prior-period development of $62 million after tax. The prior period
development was split, with 60% coming from short-tail lines and 40% from long-tail. The
long-tail development related principally to accident years 2007 and prior.
Our underwriting income in the quarter included two partially-offsetting one-time items
which netted to a positive $14 million benefit to underwriting. There was a pre-tax benefit
of $29 million relating to a settlement of a workers' compensation class action lawsuit in
which ACE was a plaintiff and a $15-million expense adjustment going the other way. Our
unusually low tax rate in the quarter was impacted by favorable adjustments to prior-year
tax accruals. Our tax rate also fluctuates based on where our earnings emerge. During the
quarter, we issued $950 million of 10 and 30 year senior debt at an average cost of 3.4%.
The proceeds will be used to redeem debt maturities in 2014 and 2015. During the
quarter we also repurchased $150 million of our shares.
As you will see on our supplement, we plan to show North America in two segments; P&C
and agriculture. Our 10-Q presentation will be changed to reflect the new segments. Our
press release issued last night included our updated guidance for 2013 to account for the
positive First Quarter prior-period reserve development, lower-than-expected cat losses,
and also better-than-expected ex-cat current accident year results. Our range is $7.10 to
$7.50, in after-tax operating income per share for the year. This includes cat losses of
$330 million after tax for the second through Fourth Quarters. Guidance is for the balance
of the year and is for the current accident year only.

Before I turn it of over to Helen, I'd like to address the subject of annual earnings
guidance. Over the years, we've provided two components to our guidance, operating
earnings per share and an estimate for catastrophe losses. More recently, we've also
provided you with an investment income run rate. After giving considerable thought to this
subject, including a number of discussions with analysts and shareholders, we've decided
that we will stop providing explicit operating EPS and catastrophe loss guidance after
2013. We believe that our disclosures are sufficiently detailed and clear. We will, however,
continue to provide an investment income run rate that a sustained low-interest-rate
environment in which we have strong positive cash flows offset by an investment portfolio
that is rolling into lower new-money rates. We will continue to evaluate our disclosures as
we go forward. Of course, we will remain open and accessible to you when you have
questions or need clarifications.
With that, I'll turn it over to Helen.

Thank you.

And we'll take our first question from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Hi, thank you. I had just one question here, Evan, on the relationship between retention
and rate gains. If I look at you guys over the last few quarters and some US peers, it looks
like retention is for you much higher. The rate gains coming through seem to be a bit
lower. I'm just trying to understand, is there a relationship there that we should
understand, or is there something else that's somewhat obscuring that comparison? And
just one followup, thanks.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I think you're making a -- you're drawing a compare -- you're drawing two facts together
that aren't directly linked.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay.

FINAL

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

There is not -- whatever we're achieving in rate gains is not driving our net retention
increases or not. Our mix of business will drive it, number one. And secondly, in North
America in the quarter, the gross is not up as much as the net is, and that drives it a little
bit. There is a large transaction that will get reflected in the Second Quarter, wasn't
reflected in the First Quarter. It's a timing question. That drives a little bit of that. But
overall, I don't see that rate change and net retention, except on the margin, are linked
together.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

I might have -- I should have been a little bit clearer. You mentioned account retention was
89% and retention in North America was 96%. Is that net retention, or are you talking
about account?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Oh, no, that's retention of business. That's retention of business, and that is directly
related, sure.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

More business -- number one, you see growth in new business, and retention, more
business is priced at a place that will earn a reasonable return to us, and we're retaining it,
and the market is more disciplined in competing for it.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. And then just one follow-up. As far as if we were to look at old-fashioned primary
agent-placed business or the more broker-involved primary excess markets, is there a
difference in terms of whether the competitiveness or the rate that you're able to take on
in either of those markets, specifically about North American P&C?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

You mean is there a difference between the broker market and the agent market?

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Just in terms of the -- is there a differential in terms of your ability to extract rate gains?
Obviously the markets are very different. That's not my question.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes, it really -- I think it's by size of account, type of account, and type of coverage that's
being purchased where you're going to see more variability than it is necessarily related
to the distribution.

And we'll take our next question from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Thank you. First, in regards to margins, so if I strip out the one-time
expense ratio benefit, I'm seeing accident year ex-cat loss ratio and expense ratio
improvement of over 100 basis points year over year on a combined basis. So I'm curious
if there are any one-time items such as maybe benign non-cat weather which we should
take into consideration when thinking about a run rate?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No, it's 200 points -- basis points better, and when you take out the one-time items and
you strip out cats and prior period, so the current accident year on that 200-basis-point
improvement was the mix of business that we had in the quarter that earned its way in,
and it was our growth in earned premium both, and that mix is product line and
geography related.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. Got it. And then lastly, Evan, I appreciate the comments in the annual report
addressing your thoughts on the tradeoff between acquisitions versus share repurchases.
You point out the IRR on acquisitions has been 17% versus 11% versus buying back shares,
so clearly the math has been superior using M&A. So that said, it's my understanding that
ACE has been operating with a material level of excess capital for quite a while now. So if
I'm thinking about this correctly, wouldn't it have been better if ACE had been employing
a dual M&A and repurchase strategy over the recent years?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I don't think so. When I look at our ROE of over the period of time, frankly our ROE was
excellent. There's no such thing as just-in-time capital management, as we say, and
opportunity, you can't -- it's opportunistic by its nature, opportunity. And so it comes at
times in a lumpy way, and so part of strategy is being ready for what you don't know,
good and bad.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. That's fair. And would you be able to give us an update on what you think if there is
an ROE drag from excess capital currently? Thank you.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Sure. You're welcome. On an ROE drag, I don't have an exact number in my head. The last
time we were about 1.7 points on the ROE. Right now, I think we're bouncing around 1.5

points.

1.5 points is what I would say, Evan.

Operator
And we'll take our next question from Jay Gelb of Barclays.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Good morning. Just wanted -- how are you? I just wanted to touch base first on the share
buyback, the $154 million in the quarter. It's really the first time ACE has bought back stock
in meaningful size since 2011. My sense is it's related to Management compensation, but
just wanted you to clarify that and also get a sense of what we should expect on that
going forward.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, Jay, it's -- it is related to dilution that we say we buy back. We don't buy it back -- we
don't match the periods exactly of when we experience dilution and when we buy back.
We thought from an intrinsic value point of view it was a good time to buy back stock, and
that's why we did it. As we go forward, we will periodically come into the market and buy
back shares when we think it's attractive, but we don't have a set plan and a set amount
that we're going to do on any quarterly basis.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Understood. Okay. And then on the underlying combined ratio, based on going back in my
model, it looks like this is the best overall underlying combined ratio for ACE in four years.
My sense is, as you touched on previously, business mix shift is having an effect on that.
Can you discuss that in a bit more detail?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes. And then I'm going to -- I might ask one of my colleagues to also pitch in. We've
talked to you a long time about portfolio management, and as we have really worked on
it for quite a long time and we think in advance of others, we were really taking action,
and you'll know before the market turned, we were shedding business because we had
pretty good insight into within any given line of business, the cohorts that were producing
reasonable returns and those that weren't, just more granular portfolio management.
That just continues to improve. It's an iterative process. Continues to improve, and in a
pricing environment like this, it has positioned us well because we can distinguish that
which is better cohorts, better priced, from that which is more marginal even at the same
or higher rates. And so our selection becomes better, more insightful, and the business
we're writing is, therefore, producing a better margin within -- and that's where we're
getting the growth. More of our growth is coming from the higher-margin business.

I'll ask John Lupica if he's -- he's out at RIMS, and so it's very early for him, but I'll see if he
wants to embellish on that.

A - John Lupica

{BIO 4213297 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, Jay. And just to support the comments that Evan had made, it certainly
is showing itself in North America. When I say it, the portfolio management strategy,
margin strategy over the last several years. We really have focused on ensuring that we
grow our high-margin business, we de-emphasize our lower-margin business, and we
look at our new business selectively in terms of where we're able to get it. That addition
to differential and rate between our high-performing business and our lower-performing
business, really has helped us on not only mix, but on the earned basis as the growth has
come in the right spots. It really has been our targeted strategy over the last year, and it's
really shown itself in a better current accident year number this year.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thanks, John, appreciate that.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

John Keogh, you want to add anything?

A - John Keogh

{BIO 2104739 <GO>}

No, I -- that same approach we've been taking internationally as well and implementing
portfolio management in our markets abroad, and you look at the current accident results
for our international business and the improvement year over year. There, too, we're
identifying the portfolios, whether it's in Asia or Europe or Latin America, that have
performed best, emphasizing those opportunities and growing those businesses at a rate
that is showing through now in terms of our earned premium on those better-performing
businesses. At the same time, I've been talking to you guys for, gosh, quarter after
quarter for the past few years about the wholesale business in London and how certain
lines of that business just wasn't meeting our underwriting threshold and have been
shutting that business, and as that business runs off, you've seen improvement in our
current accident years on our wholesale business as well.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Excellent. Thanks. And then just a last one on North American agriculture. First, thanks for
breaking that out. The premium volume for 2013 versus 2012, I know it's early to
determine how that will shake out, but any initial thoughts?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes, it will -- it is early. It'll be lower. It'll be lower by a $200 million. It's both a combination
of commodity price driven, because that's what goes into the base of determining
Page 9 of 24

premium performer per crop, and we bought around -- we brought a modest amount of
quota share reinsurance, and that will impact the net premium as well.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

So a few hundred million dollars less --

A - Evan Greenberg

And we'll take our next question from Greg Locraft of Morgan Stanley.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Great start to the year. Just wanted to ask -- or get color on the
international pricing environment. One of the things I'm wrestling with is just why it's
lagging North America so much. And your data is similar to what we're seeing marketwide.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

It's very curious to me to a degree. I haven't seen a global market behave this way
before, but every period is different. In the US, with investment income pressure and
combined ratios rising, there's more ROE -- the insurers respond to ROE pressure and
lower ROEs with greater underwriting discipline. And the structure of the market is such
that the larger players who have greater insight are one at a time. They know that they've
got two sources of income, and they are practicing greater underwriting -- they've
determined to practice greater underwriting discipline to address that.

Page 10 of 24



FINAL

Company N ame: Chubb Arabia Cooperative I nsurance Co
Company Ticker: ACE AB Equity
Date: 2013-04-23

Internationally, there is a tremendous amount of surplus capital. The reinsurance market,
by the way, is not following the insurance market. The reinsurance market is more
competitive in my judgment. There is a tremendous amount of capital internationally and
more capital that enters, whether it is in London or it is in the emerging markets as they
grow wealth, more local companies are being formed that compete, and you're not
seeing the same reaction to a lower interest rate environment of greater underwriting
discipline. And that's -- it's as simple as that, and they're maintaining and more market
share driven.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Okay. Is it actually -- is the ROE internationally just higher as a starting point and therefore,
in a way, the US has to come up more, or is it maybe, as you're alluding to, that the
competitive landscape internationally, competitors are willing to accept a lower ROE?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

There's always a great distribution around the mean, and if you couldn't outperform the
mean, I could tell you I wouldn't have interest in being in this business. But when I look at it
from the point of view of just that, it varies by territory, but I wouldn't -- you look at the UK,
you look at the continent, I would hardly be proud of overall market ROEs in those
markets. When I look at Latin America and Asia, those are tough territories. You've got to
really know what you're doing, and when you look at market returns in those territories,
ROEs on underwriting results are not that much better, and in some markets they're
worse.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

And then investment income -- investment income can vary, portfolio rates, by territory.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Right. Okay. Last from me is just I think that taking away the guidance beginning of next
year, I think it's going to make all our lives a lot easier just given the nature of how you all
have done it. Maybe it's a good time, then, to just revisit how you think about ROE. Right
now, rates are low. You're doing a low double digits. If rates were to go up -- well, how do
you think about the ROE goal, and then what's the sensitivity of that to rates improving
from here? And I'm talking interest rates, not pricing.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Understood. We're -- we have not changed our objective and target, which is a 15% ROE
over cycle. That is exactly where we are, whether it is pricing or interest rate cycle, our
governor is always to earn on the underwriting side a combined ratio in lines of business
of under 100, and depending on the product and the territory, we set goals that are
substantially below that. And then the investment income, we're not going to take undue
risk, and it is mostly going to be in our invested asset in fixed income portfolio with
Page 11 of 24

FINAL

repeatable income, and when you add all that up, the ROE will be what it will be, and we
think ACE will continue to produce a superior ROE to the industry. And our goal is to
achieve that 15%, and we think in more normal times we will. You might have seen in the
shareholder letter, every 100 basis points of investment income is 2.5 points of ROE for
us, and -- as things stand at the moment, and so if interest rates were up another -- you
get it. If they were up 100 or 200 basis points, we're behind -- we're ahead of that 15%
number.

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Good morning, Vinay.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. The first question is on the gap between large commercial and small
commercial. Would you say that that's starting to narrow now?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

The gap in what? I'm sorry, in pricing?

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Pricing, sorry, yes, yes, pricing.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, you know-- I'm not sure that you're seeing it the same as we're seeing it. I think you
have to think more of a byline-of-business basis. The greatest rate increases through '12,
and then when you look at '13 First Quarter, the greatest rate increases come in workers'
comp and in guaranteed cost workers' comp, which is a line of business that we're not
really engaged in to any great degree, and that casts a big shadow over the smaller and
medium-size business. The second area that was getting substantial rate was property.
And then commercial auto, particularly in that medium-sized, smaller account arena.
Property is beginning -- got some rate in beginning quarter. It's beginning to flatten out,
which given the rate on rate that you've seen for a while on property, is not irrational to
me. So that's maybe more how I see it than simply a large account, small account
construction. Make sense to you?

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Yes. Just because the large surveys out there show that small commercial pricing seems
to be stronger than large commercial -- than large commercial, so I'm just trying to square

that.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

FINAL

Right, and you have to -- and I'm trying to give you the reasons to look behind that and
understand what's driving it. And I think that's the -- at least in my judgment, those are the
-- those are more the markers to look at.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. That's fair. The second question is on the insurance North American side. Your net
premiums are up 9%. That's great. The gross premiums were roughly flat. Just curious
why that's happening, and if you're seeing price improvement, how are you changing your
reinsurance purchases to grow the net premiums.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes, reinsurance purchases on the margin, the change in reinsurance purchase, the net
grows faster than the gross for two reasons. One, as I mentioned, there was a quite a
large transaction that it's a timing question that'll get booked in the Second Quarter,
wasn't booked in the First Quarter. That has an impact, a substantial impact on the
difference between gross and net. And the balance is really in mix of business where we
grew businesses that just had a higher net retention to them than the year before, and
they are attractive classes to us. Our reinsurance purchases changed on the margin.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. And then one last thing, if I may. Just on the ag reinsurance, you said
you bought some more pro rata reinsurance, but you said the impact on the bottom line
would be negligible. So would that be because you had better pricing in terms and
conditions?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

The protection that we purchased, the additional protection from a balance of exposure
and terms, we consider to be favorable -- a favorable buy for ACE, and that's why we
executed the transaction.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Couple questions here for you, Evan. One, could you talk a little about
loss trend and what's happening with loss trend, and how much is that contributing to the
improvement in the underlying combineds, particularly North America?

FINAL

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I'm going to ask John to talk about loss trend. But more mix of business in growth and
earned premium contributed to the increase in underwriting income, and to margin, more
of the mix to lines of business and within lines, cohorts, that had a better combined profile
than it is that we actually cohort by cohort lowered our pegs materially at all.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Well, Brian, Evan said it well, so I'll just add a couple quick comments of color on that. As
far as Q1 goes, it's obviously early in the year, but as we look across the portfolios at
frequency, we see most of -- well, all the lines there pretty much within our expectations
that we set during the planning process, so don't see anything unusual there. Obviously,
you've got some noise bouncing around, but the overall theme is nothing unusual there.
And the second, in our planning process, we do remain vigilant on the loss trend. So while
inflation has been relatively benign and loss trend has been relatively benign, we remain
relatively conservative in (inaudible) or pegs, particularly for the higher excess casualty
line.

FINAL

Okay. And then Evan, just quickly here on, in the North American P&C business given
where your combined ratios are right now, you got, what, 3.5% rating you said in North
America? Do you think your returns and allocated capital in that business are acceptable
right now given the current interest rate environment, and is that why we're not seeing
any more acceleration in the rate activity there?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, acceptable. The current accident year is hardly running a 15% ROE, and that's where
I'd like to see us, somewhere between that, maybe a little less than that would be rational
given interest rates. But I think that the ROE is still a little under pressure, but the
combined ratio -- but that's because of investment income. I think the combined ratios on
the business are pretty good. And that's why if you added -- as I say, if you looked at the
illustration of what 100 basis points does, on the investment side, that adds 2.5 points to
your ROE. So you just take that with the combineds we're running right now, and you're at
approximately 15%, which is a good number.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think that the rate environment right now is with that in mind. I do see property flattening
out because of where pricing is right now. I do see casualty bumping along at this level of
increase. It's nothing overly exciting. It's hardly a hard market, but it's a rational response
to the pressure that insurers are feeling, and I don't think it's going to be enough for the
industry in aggregate to, at these levels of increase of rate, to ameliorate the impact of
investment income declines. So I think you're in a place for the industry overall where ROE
may improve a little bit but it's hardly double-digit.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

FINAL

No, the decline in underwriting -- sorry, Paul. Last year in the First Quarter you'll recall the
'11 crop year was a bumper crop year, and so the true-up of profit and loss from the '11
year in the First Quarter produced that very good income last year. This year, the true-up
in the First Quarter from the '12 crop year is the result you see.

Q - Paul Newsome

Okay. Great.

A - Evan Greenberg

You're not getting benefit of -- you're not seeing like winter wheat or corn or soybeans
from this year yet. That's all in front of you.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

Right. And then a bigger picture question. There's been a lot of talk this last quarter or so
about the reinsurance business being heavily impacted by the capital markets, and it
didn't seem to impact your business any more, but do you have any general thoughts as
to if that's going to impact your business in the future?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Look, we're of the market, too, but we're highly rated. We don't write and outsized cat
book as you know. We are highly rated. We have years of reputation and experience in the
business and with clients and [ph], so I see a direct impact in terms of crowding us out of
line size as minor. I see -- more capital coming into the market impacts the rate
environment, and whether that means that we'll find business -- more business
unacceptably priced or not in the future, we'll see as we go forward in the year. Right now,
I see it more on the margin.

Company N ame: Chubb Arabia Cooperative I nsurance Co

Date: 2013-04-23

Good morning. Just a couple questions. The first is, you issued some debt in the quarter.
It looked like interest expense went down versus the Fourth Quarter. I'm wondering
what's behind that.

FINAL

A - Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Well, first, the debt was issued in the last two weeks of March, so we had very little debt
expense relating to that in the quarter. We also had a reduction in some of the collateral
that we hold and pay interest on with respect to our fund-to-deductible programs, so that
dropped the interest a little bit. And then we had a deposit insurance contract that had an
adjustment to interest and lowered interest expense a bit. So net-net, it was down a little
bit.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Should we look at the Fourth Quarter as more of a normal run rate, ex the new debt you
issued?

A - Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

I would say the Fourth Quarter plus the new debt that was issued, offset, of course, by the
investment income on the proceeds for the debt that we've retained to repay the debt,
redeem the debt when it comes due in '14 and '15.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Exactly. Okay. The second question, it's very helpful that you broke out the agriculturalrelated business. I'm just looking at some of the numbers that you showed for last year,
and just from a modeling standpoint, can you give us any sense what administrative and
acquisition expenses look like because the numbers on the administrative side were
negative last year, and the acquisition side, they kind of go all over the place. Any sort of
rough guidance you can give?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I'm going to let Brian talk about it. But good luck figuring that out precisely because you
have a couple of things going. You have a government reimbursement of expense and
the timing of that, and then a lot of the profit and loss true-ups and formula, at the end of
the day, whether it's government or agents or any of that stuff, it comes through that line.
And Brian, do you want to --

A - Brian Dowd

{BIO 4210015 <GO>}

The only thing I would say is a negative expense ratio isn't normal. It was a function of the
year, crop year and calendar years coming together with a big profit from the '11 year. So
don't think of normal run rate as a negative expense rate. Our normal run rate is a modest
positive expense cost, both administrative and acquisition.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you have any thoughts regarding the balance sheet
and strong dollar economics or a bear market for bonds and whether it you affects your
business, how you write it, whether you'd be buying any hedges to protect from that,
realizing capital gains, whatnot?

A - Phil Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

We wouldn't expect to do that. We've said for a long time that we take our risk on the
liability side and we've got a conservative investment portfolio. We don't expect to take

Page 18 of 24

any significant additional risk. We would on the margin, changes that we make to the
portfolio, but we don't see any significant changes to our investment profile.

FINAL

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Let me just add this to what you just asked, and that is that it's a buy-and-hold portfolio
mostly. So any accretion that comes in the beginning from a realized gain -- an unrealized
gain or the other way, an unrealized loss will amortize its way over a couple years. So it's
an accounting versus an economic, and we don't hedge that.

And we'll take our next question from Thomas Mitchell of Miller Tabak.

Q - Thomas Mitchell

{BIO 22121384 <GO>}

Just two short questions. The first is, does the incident that took place in Boston last week
drive any change in the dynamics of underwriting the kinds of risks that are associated
with events like that?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No, it does not. We measure terrorism-related risk, man-made events no differently than
natural events. We are thoughtful about aggregations. We're thoughtful about pricing and
the kinds of exposures. This is a risk that is real, and what an unfortunate event, and it just
reminds us all that that risk doesn't go away. And we've been underwriting it for the last -since 2001, consistently and with that in mind, that there is a real risk. And so we, again,
manage accumulations, pricing, type of risk with that in mind and with -- it reminds us,
again, while this was a terribly unfortunate event, the destruction to property and the
magnitude of the event overall was relatively modest compared to what you could
imagine and particularly in settings of great concentration of values. And it reminds you
again of the importance of TRIA and the government back stop that comes up for
renewal next year because that tail, that the government provides cover for that tail that
allows insurers to more widely offer and underwrite terrorism-related exposures.

Q - Thomas Mitchell

{BIO 22121384 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thank you. That's a good answer. I was also wondering about, shifting to other
government pictures, that there at least has been a proposal put on the table in
Congress to reduce the amount of reinsurance available from the federal crop insurance
program, and I'm wondering if that were to take place, whether it would be more of an
opportunity or make the business less attractive for you.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, Tom, from what I've looked at, the government -- the budget for the most part has
been talking about -- that was put on the table -- and by the way, isn't really different than
the proposal the administration put on the table last year, which didn't gain any traction in
Congress. But it really -- the two broad elements were that the farmers, themselves, the
buyers of insurance, crop insurance, pay a greater share themselves. Right now, it's
subsidized by the government 60%. And then the other part of the proposal as it relates
to insurance was to cut back the amount insurers are reimbursed for administrative
expense. Those are the two main -- those are really the two main elements in the
administration's proposal that, again, didn't gain a lot of traction with either party in
Congress.

Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Had a question about the growth and

think at this time are particularly attractive from a growth or regulatory perspective for
next moves for you guys?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, you see the growth -- well, I don't want to get too specific. You see our growth in
Asia and Latin America in particular, those regions. That's where we see the most
attractive environments from both an economic and an underwriting point of view across
a broad swath of product and a broad range of customer. You see that we grew doubledigits in Asia and double-digit in Latin America, and that's both in non-life and in life.
I would say at this time, the world is a dynamic place. Those are the most attractive
regions of the world for us, and we just concluded two acquisitions that we're -- we pretty

much -- we haven't closed on the second one. It will take a couple of weeks. But two in
Mexico that really significantly increase our exposure both in Latin America and Mexico in
particular, and we view that as a quite attractive country today, and what we see, the
government's actions in Mexico to improve economic growth and regulation, will have -should have a great benefit to the insurance marketplace in that country, and ACE has
now positioned itself quite well to take advantage of that.

Q - Charles Sebaski

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. I had a couple follow ups. But first, just on the life insurance business, it seems
that the results were a little weaker than -- at least weaker than they have been. They

Page 21 of 24



Company N ame: Chubb Arabia Cooperative I nsurance Co

seem to be trending down over the last year. Can you just give us a little update? Is that
the VA runoff ? Is there FX? Or is there some pressure on the ongoing businesses?

FINAL

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes, Ian, there were two items this quarter that don't really bode towards trend. Last year,
we had some one-time items in the life insurance business internationally that was a
benefit that didn't repeat this year. And secondly, combined is in two places. Combined
had very good earnings, but combined is in two places. It's in ACE International -- or AOG.
It's in ACE Overseas General for the international part of combined, and the US part of
combined, which is on life company paper, is in the life segment. While the international
portion grew in income, the US portion went down in income. It's not a run rate question
or any of that. Some of the prior period development last year was in the US combined.
Those two together is most of it. The underlying trend that does continue quarter on
quarter is a decrease in the VA exposure as that runs off. That was a modest amount of
the income difference this quarter.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Got it. Perfect. And then just a follow-up on Paul's question on alternative cat capacity. I
was actually thinking about it from the other side, which is as a buyer of reinsurance, it
would seem, to the extent that it's getting cheaper than traditional paper. Is that an
attractive option to you, or are you a little wary of essentially the collateral versus
traditional paper?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, you've got to be careful about it. First of all, is it on an indemnity basis, or is it on a
parametric basis, and so are you getting the same protection? When it's collateralized,
that's not a bad thing because you're holding the money; you're not chasing it. And -- but
the biggest issue, it does have a place and has a place in a -- particularly for a company
like ACE -- against traditional reinsurance. Traditional reinsurance, though, gives you
reinstatements, and generally capital market solutions do not provide you a
reinstatement. So there are differences. And so it's one shot and you're done, and where
that fits within your program, it has an important place, but it doesn't simply replace
traditional reinsurance.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Got it. And then just my last one, I think it was Tom's question about TRIA. I think before
last week, it seemed like that was facing long odds of renewal. Do you have any changed
expectation, or is it too early to tell?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I didn't subscribe. I haven't subscribed to that it has long odds of renewal.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

FINAL

I -- it's hard to imagine that based on a standard of rationality that things get done in
Washington. However, I think from any rational point of view, TRIA is really a no-brainer to
renew. It provides a backstop of certainty that allows businesses to continue on. It's not a
benefit to the insurance industry. It's a benefit to business overall because if there wasn't
TRIA, you wouldn't see much terrorism insurance sold.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Got it. That's was going to be my follow-up is to what extent we might see disruption a
year from now if this thing ends up being like flood insurance where it always gets
extended six months after it should get done.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, what you'd see -- look, and I hate to forecast, but the rational response would be
you'll only take risk to the extent you're comfortable with the net exposure on your
balance sheet or the limited amount of reinsurance you can buy in the traditional
reinsurance market, and that'll be based on what they're comfortable just simply holding
on their balance sheet. And that tail grows very quickly when you think of concentrations
of economic exposure in a geographic area.
