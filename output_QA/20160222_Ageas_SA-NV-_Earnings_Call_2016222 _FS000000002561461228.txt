Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ageas Conference Call for the Full Year Results
2015. I am pleased to present Mr. Bart de Smet, Chief Executive Officer; and Christophe
Boizard, Chief Financial Officer. For the first part of this call, let me remind you that all

I would now like to hand over to Mr. Bart de Smet, Mr. Christophe Boizard. Gentlemen,
please go ahead.

Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all for dialing into this conference call
and for being with us for the presentation of the full-year 2015 results of Ageas. As usual,
I'm joined in the room by my colleagues of the executive committee: Christophe Boizard,
our CFO; Filip Coremans, our Chief Risk Officer; and Antonio Cano, our Chief Operating
Officer. Hans de Cuyper, the CEO of AG Insurance, is also in the room, as well as our
Investor Relations team.

FINAL

Ladies and gentlemen, 2015 was the last year of our strategic cycle, Vision 2015, which
started in 2012. We used this period well to reshape our portfolio of activities to reflect
our strategic priorities, more specifically strengthening our Non-Life activities in the
purchase in emerging markets. With respect to the financial targets, the picture is a mixed
one. But if we extract certain external factors related to the financial markets, we actually
made significant progress over the past years. And I'm pleased with our performance. But
at the same time, I acknowledge that there are still room for further improvement.
Let me start with a brief look at the most important key figures for 2015, and I'm on slide
1. Net insurance profit for the year amounts to €755 million, slightly up to 2014. The net
result in the fourth quarter amounted to €142 million, seriously impacted by the cost
related to the December floods in the UK.
The inflows at 100% almost reached the €30 billion mark. As in previous years, growth
mainly came from the non-consolidated Life activities in Asia and from the consolidated
entities in Continental Europe. And we're also helped by the large stake we took in our
Portuguese and Italian operations. The technical liabilities in our consolidated Life entities
stayed fairly flat, if we exclude the impact of shadow accounting.

Bloomberg Transcript

The operating performance in Life and Non-Life were healthy with good margins in Life
and an excellent overall combined ratio in Non-Life below our 97% target, and this despite
the negative impact of the already mentioned UK floods.
The group net profit compared to last year was up 62% at €770 million with a net profit
for the general account of €50 million. This last figure is to be compared with the loss of
€261 million in 2014. The positive change year-on-year relates to the evolution of the
RPN(I) liability, and the legal provision accounted for in 2014.
With respect with the balance sheet, I'd like to highlight our first disclosure under the new
Solvency II regulation, which became effective as of January 1 of this year. Ageas passed
the position smoothly with a Solvency II ratio according to the Ageas view of 182%,
comfortably above our strategic target of 175%, and in line with the already reported pro
forma levels at our Investor Day end of September.
And lastly, the management and the board of Ageas are pleased to propose to
shareholders a gross dividend in cash of €1.65 per share, which is an increase of 6.5%
compared to last year. This amount aligns with the Ageas dividend policy and maintains a
position of consistently growing dividend for the fourth consecutive time, as you can see
on slide 2. Since 2012, our net profit increased with 21% while our dividend showed a
substantially higher increase of 37.5%.
On slide 3, you will the upstream cash from the operating companies over 2015. The full
dividend but also the corporate costs are entirely covered by the cash upstream by
biggest segments which underlies the group's healthy cash flow position.
2015 was also a very busy year in terms of strategic prepositioning of our portfolio of
activities. We strengthened our presence in the emerging market of Asia through new
Page 2 of 26

FINAL

partnerships in Vietnam and the Philippines. At the same time, we are in the process of
selling Hong Kong, which we consider a mature market in Asia and thus not fitting within
our portfolio. The acquisition of the non-life activities of AXA in Portugal is an important
strategic move to strengthen our market position, making us a top three player in the
market.
And lastly, the start of our internal reinsurer Intreas also makes sense from a strategic
perspective.
With respect to the divestment of the Hong Kong activity, we can confirm that we are still
on track to close in the first half of the year.
On slide 4, you will find the overview of our performance against the Vision 2015 targets.
As I already mentioned, at first sight, the picture seems mixed. However, taking into
account some external factors, I believe we have performed satisfactorily over the past
four years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our net insurance profit has, as already mentioned, grown by 21% since 2012. In terms of
return on equity, we were unable to apply the full benefit from this as the shareholders'
equity grew by 36%, mainly because of the increased annualized gains from fixed income.
If you exclude the unrealized gains from the occasion and also taking into account the
upcoming divestment of Hong Kong, our return on equity largely exceeds the 11% target.
Our operating performance is strong with a normalized combined ratio being consistently
below 100% for the fourth consecutive year and has a very strong 96.8% in 2015 despite
the floods in UK. The Life operating margin especially in guaranteed products also show
resilience at 90 basis points and unit-linked margin at 36 basis points.
With respect to the 60/40 split Life/Non-Life and the investment of at least 25% of our
capital in emerging markets, the disposal of the Life activities in UK and Hong Kong,
together with the selective acquisitions in UK, Italy, and Portugal, and new partnerships in
Vietnam and the Philippines, are structural elements that contributed to reach all those
targets.
I would also like to take this opportunity to repeat total amount of cash distributed to our
shareholders via dividend or share buybacks, which amounted to €2.2 billion over the full
period 2012-2015 or roughly €10 per share.
So, ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to give the floor to Christophe and will come
back to you for the Q&A and some closing remark.

Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Thank you, Bart, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. As usual, I will comment on the
operating research by insurance segment and then, the general account. So, first, our
insurance operations – I am on slide 5. As Bart already mentioned, the net insurance result
Page 3 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2016-02-17

FINAL

for the full year amounted to €755 million, compared to €737 million in 2014. Similar to
2014, the exceptional weather impact amounted to €64 million. At this year, it was purely
related to the UK, whereas last year, it was spread over the UK and Belgium.
With respect to the net realized capital gains, we had some €65 million additional net
gains in the Asian segment compared to 2014, more than offset by €67 million lower
capital gain in Belgium, UK and Continental Europe. In addition, the 2014 results benefited
in the UK from almost €50 million of exceptional positive results. The positive currency
effect at group level of €21 million this year was more or less offset by the exceptional tax
credit in Belgium in 2014.

Bloomberg Transcript

If you take into account all those items and look at the underlying performance, the net
result for 2015 is roughly 12% better than last year, which largely relates to the improved
performance in Non-Life, illustrated by the good combined ratio of 96.8%. The result in
the fourth quarter amounted to €142 million and included the negative impact of €64
million of the floods in the UK. I would like to flag here the fact that we realized a good
result for the fourth quarter in Belgium, and that we took indeed the benefit of the
favorable position in our equity portfolio to realize some additional capital gains.
Referring to my speech at the Q3 results, the closing of the planned contraction in real
estate foreseen in Q4 was slightly delayed and took place at the beginning of February of
this year. The press release from our real estate subsidiary, AG Real Estate, has been
recently issued to announce the deal with a Taiwanese group. You may assume that this
contraction will generate in the first quarter of 2016 a very substantial amount of capital
gain, and it will be a contractual intervention segment. And this will be reported in the Q1
result later on in the year, in May.
I also remind you that we are living in volatile markets, so, for the Q1 results. I will not
comment on slide 10 in detail, but there you have overview by segment of the realized
capital gain within the insurance results. And you will see that in total the amount realized
in 2015 is not very different from the one we had in 2014, only the breakdown is different
between Asia and the rest of the group.
Some brief comments by segment now. First, Belgium. I am on slide 6. Our Belgian
operations reported again a solid net result at €384 million. A lower Life result compared
to last year is explained by a significant lower amount of realized capital gains, but also by
the exceptionally low level of taxes in 2014, which was partly explained by a non-recurring
tax credit. The operating margins both in guaranteed and unit-linked were healthy at 86
bps and 32 bps, respectively.
The Non-Life result nearly doubled year-on-year, and this is due to more favorable
weather conditions, good prior year results, and the positive impact of pruning actions
and tariff increases. Motor and Household, in particular, the two largest business lines,
performed very well.
The UK net result – I am on slide 7 now. The UK net result was disappointing at €30 million.
As already mentioned, though, corrected for the €64 million flood impact in December,
Page 4 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2016-02-17

the net results would've been closer to a normal run rate of €100 million.

FINAL

With respect to the market dynamics, we are seeing some encouraging evolutions in the
Motor segment, while the pricing pressure has now clearly moved to the Household
segment. Whereas our overall inflows in the UK at constant exchange rate are down 2%,
they are down 8% in Household.
The combined ratio in AIL and Tesco underwriting stood at 102% and 105.7%, respectively,
caused by the adverse weather but also suffering from a combined ratio in Motor, but still
too high.
With respect to the segment, Other, which includes the retail business and the holding
costs, I would like to stress that the net result is broadly flat year-on-year if we exclude the
one-off elements. In line with our current strategic plan to have a fully-integrated business
model in the UK, I would also like to flag here our intention to redact our reporting and to
merge the segment Life, Non-Life, and Other into one segment, Non-Life, as of the first
quarter 2016. We do not expect this change to have a material impact on the combined
ratio going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

The third segment, Continental Europe, slide 8 of the presentation. The net result
improved to €70 million compared to €56 million last year, and this is entirely related to a
better Non-Life result. This comes from a scope change as a result of the acquisitions in
Italy and Portugal but also from an improved operating performance in all entities year-onyear except in Turkey.
In the Life activities, the operating margin under guaranteed business improved to 88 bps
while it remained low at 7 bps on unit-linked. The net Life result declined because of lower
investment result in (15:35) in Portugal.
Lastly, Asia, slide 9. A net profit of €272 million, up exactly €100 million on last year, driven
by excellent results in China where we benefited from higher net realized capital gain
compared to 2014. The solid profits in China are also related to inflows, which grew yearon-year by some 40%, marked by continuous improvement in terms of quality. 76% of the
total inflows came from regular premium business or renewals, which is the result of the
continued effort to anchorage the sales force to focus on the sale of regular premium.
The Non-Life activities in Malaysia and Thailand are also performing well. Combined
inflows smoothly moved towards the €1 billion-mark, generating a net profit of €13 million,
with a combined ratio of 91.1%.
This brings me to the general account on slide 11. Here, the picture is completely different
compared to 2014. Whereas the general account generated a loss of €261 million in 2014,
2015 showed a net profit of €15 million. The difference relates first of all to the €130
million provision for the FortisEffect case, which was booked in 2014; and secondly, to the
value of the RPN(I) liability that decreased from €467 million at the end of 2014 to €402
million at the end of 2015, generating a €65 million positive impact this year versus a
negative one of €97 million the year before.

FINAL

I would like also to – I would like here to flag the good result of Royal Park Investment,
amounting to €18 million, of which €15 million has been upstream during the year 2015. On
the cost side, higher staff and operating expenses are explained by higher lawyer costs
and consultant fees, and also by the start-up costs related to our internal reinsurer,
Intreas, which took off at the end of August. The net cash position stood at €1.6 billion
including the €300 million of, what we call the liquid assets.
Before opening up the call for Q&A, I would like to end with the first official Solvency II
figures for the Ageas Group, so slide 12. As already mentioned by Bart, you will see that
the reported figure are based on the so-called Ageas view, which is the standard model
adjusted for the Non-Life Partial internal model and the internal view on spread risk. The
total insurance Solvency II ratio amounted to 182% at the end of 2015, which is almost in
line with the pro forma figures presented last September at the IR Day.
Going forward, Ageas will report on a quarterly basis on Solvency II, based on the Partial
internal model and the Ageas view. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to end my comments
here and to hand over to Frank.

Q&A
Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

The first question is from Matthias de Wit, KBC Securities.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. I've got three questions if I may. First on the Solvency II ratio. At the
Investor Day, you provided an internal model-based group Solvency II ratio of 221%. This
dropped to 212% by year-end. Just wonder whether you could provide a bit more color on
this H2 decline. So, what part was linked to the change treatment of the sub-sovereign
bonds and the ancillary services? What part was organic capital generation and maybe
also the other part linked to market impact?
Then on Asia, I wonder whether you could provide an update on the capital position of
Taiping Life, and also if you could comment how sensitive is this to equity markets and
bond markets, so just to get an idea whether there's any need to inject additional capital
in 2016.
And then lastly on the holding company free cash flow generation, can you disclose the
amount of dividend which will be paid by Ageas to the group over to 2015 earnings? And
also I wonder whether there's any room to distribute any of the Belgium excess capital to
the holding company in 2016. Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. I'll pass the first question to Filip, the third to Christophe and the second one.

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thanks, Bart. Filip Coremans here. Relating to the evolution of the Solvency II ratio, I
believe that we did not report 221% but 216% from the group level during the Investor Day
as the Solvency II Ageas figure. We mentioned the higher ratio there in the context of the
anticipated impact of the transaction in Hong Kong. And indeed, when the Hong Kong
transaction would go through, these solvency ratios on a group level would go up with
around 20%. That is...

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

No. Sorry, Filip. If I look at the slide, so you reported 216% for the group at yearend 2014
and 221% at the H1 2015...

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Okay.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

...as we enter the first semester. So, I just wonder how you can reconcile the 221% with the
yearend ratio of 212%.

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Okay. So, it's (22:37) that you're referring.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Yes, yes.

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Of course, part of the explanation is related to the inclusion of the two or three items
which we mentioned during the Investor Day. That is the fact that the ancillary services, as
mentioned on slide 13, the exclusion of the interparking and the full consolidation of
interparking, and putting the value at the same time of the parking concession to zero.
These two components have about an impact of 3% to 4% on the group solvency ratio
which, in fact, year-on-year, explains most of the evolution.
Negative effects, which have reduced the solvency ratio a bit during the second half,
mostly relate, in fact, to the UK where the flat (23:40) obviously has prevented us from
upstreaming the dividend and also the impact on the loss absorption of deferred tax. You
will note that also for the UK on slide 12, on a full-year basis, that ratio comes down
noticeably from 139% to 130%. So, the effect is also reflecting on the group level.
The third one is that in Continental Europe – and that's the third major development, I
believe. In Continental Europe, you will also note that the ratio came down. There, the
main impact is the capital restructuring in the wake of the acquisition of our operations in
Italy. We dismantled the holding structure in the intermediate holding. And I believe €135
million was upstreamed from Continental Europe towards the group.
Page 7 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2016-02-17

So, this obviously only affects the insurance ratio and explains also the drop from 186% to
182% on a yearly basis but does not have an impact on the group. Other than that, I think
mostly related to the yield curves and the spread, which at the end of the year, were at
the same level at the beginning of the year where half year, they were slightly higher.

FINAL

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

The second question, capital position Taiping Life. As you know, Taiping Life is part of a
listed company, CTIH. At the Investor Day they held in December, the solvency published
was above 200%. We cannot provide new updates. But I also want to mention what we
said in the past that's after the €200 million investment we made end of 2013, we have
no capital injection in 2014 and 2015, and we do not expect it either in the short term.
Two reasons for that. First of all, the introduction of (25:47) as of the 1st of January of this
year where, okay, there are a number of mechanism in it that let us expect a positive
impact on the ratio. And secondly, still quite high capacity for hybrid debt in the Taiping
Life entity. So, no expectations from our side that in the short term, capital increases will
be needed, let's say, short to medium term.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Very clear. And on holding company free cash flow?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yeah. So, I'd like to take the slide 58, the presentation where you have the net cash
position and you have the different flows. And I'd like to highlight the fact that we have
met the objective in the sense that upstream €454 million minus the dividend pay, €329
million, and minus the holding cost, €100 million, where still we have positive margins
which means that we are well covered with incoming dividends. So, you are interested in
the future obviously and the impact of Solvency II.
In the group, we have the capital management and dividend policy which sets the
different level of dividend according to the solvency position and the result. Since we
don't have – if you exclude Asia with the big growth, if you take the average segment, not
a lot of need for capital, it means that most of the result is distributable. But at this time,
we are in a transition period. We are deploying the new capital and dividend policy within
the group following Solvency II.
You have seen with Filip that we have, let's say, still some adjustments. It is not mature.
But as we said before, it will be a smooth transition for the inflow coming from the entity. I
cannot see any risk.
Then if I understand your question, you'd like to know if there is additional room for
upstreaming capital from the subsidiary. At this stage, I would say it is too early to give a
Page 8 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2016-02-17

comment. And we will come back on this in future communications. But at this stage, apart
from saying that there is no disruption with this change of regulation, I cannot say more on
this.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. I understand. Thanks a lot.

Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Albert Ploegh, ING Bank.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good morning. A couple of questions from my end as well. Maybe first on the
Solvency II. Do you see basically room, for example, to optimize the ratio by making some
changes, let's say, in your investment portfolio, for example? Second question also
related to Solvency II. You might be aware that in the Netherlands, there's a lot of
discussion on the loss of solvency of Texas basically. Is there anything you are aware of on
the level of the NBB as well on this topic?
And then basically, also coming a little bit back also to Matthias' question on the cash
flows and basically also the dividend-paying capacity, you have been growing your
dividends quite nicely the last couple of years, but without, let's say, further growth in the
cash flow generation, it seems a little bit hard to sustain this space. I know you have a little
bit capacity to move to a 50% payout ratio still on the insurance profits. But my question
would be more, are you, for example, against growing your dividends even if it means
that you need to use a bit of your holding cash and so that it will not be completely
funded out of the insurance profits? How do you look at that dilemma? Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. I'll pass question one and two to Filip, and take question three potentially to be
completed by Christophe.

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Okay, Albert. Regarding the Solvency II optimization, of course, we are studying various
options there, not only the investment portfolio. But let's first and foremost say that for
instance, the setup of Intreas, we have certainly not fully exploited all the opportunities to
maximize diversification benefits. This is one of the pillars and one of the reasons why we
have good Intreas in our portfolio. And we will definitely try to make use of that. Obviously
also, in terms of investment optimization, we may have certain instance in certain markets
look at that, but let's not forget that we had a lot of time already to prepare for Solvency
II, and that our investment portfolios are actually already setup with Solvency II fully in
mind.
For instance, in our main portfolios, we have tried and we have done so rather effectively
and well in time given the low interest rate environment now to have a full match between

Page 9 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2016-02-17

FINAL

our assets and liabilities, and I think our Belgium operating entity has put some stellar
performance there, also a reason why you see that our ratios are relatively stable in
comparison to figures released by some of our peers. So, yes, we will, here and there,
look at the investment portfolio optimization maybe more in the peripheral countries than
in our core country. But we might study opportunities of entering, and that is more from a
professional base into market risk modeling domain in the future.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Okay. And on the deferred taxes?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yeah. Sorry. And on the deferred taxes, we had, like many of our friends and foes, I would
say, discussions with the various regulators in all the countries. And you know that we have
this concept of the meeting of supervisors, the college of supervisors which meets on a
yearly basis. And in fact, we have discussed at length. Now, this is an industry matter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let me be clear that the trend now is that we will follow local practice and regulation,
meaning that on the level Ageas, we do exactly as been agreed on a local basis. That
means that the loss absorption of deferred tax will follow the guidance of local regulators,
and we do that at this moment, and there is no outstanding discussion. So, we are not
trying to at least optimize at a group level beyond what is accepted on the local domain.
So, there is no real discussion.
In the case of Belgium, where it is the most important, in fact, the rule is more or less that
the loss absorption of deferred tax is, to some extent, limited or kept by the availability of
deferred tax losses, I would say, for instance, and the unrealized capital gains on the bond
portfolios in the (33:47) in Belgium are quite material. And that's, of course, a huge
deferred tax liability implicit in them, to that extent deferred tax asset. The loss
absorption of it can be used in the SCR calculations. That is more or less the way the
Belgian regulator looks at it and is the way we have applied it.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Okay. Very clear. Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. On the third question, permit me to repeat, since as I read in my introduction where
I said that the dividend of this year is in line with the Ageas dividend policy and maintains a
position of a consistently growing dividend for the fourth consecutive time, as you can see
on slide 2. And if you look to that slide 2, you can see that the profit of the group, the
insurance profit has been increasing and reached the highest level ever in 2015. So we, on
the one hand, have the intention to further see increase our profits.
Secondly, we have a dividend proposing that we will very seriously implement and respect
(34:59) being between 40%, 50%. And we have even had one year, because that was

Page 10 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2016-02-17

FINAL

your question, a year in 2011 when we had the huge impairment of hybrid debt. That year,
we paid the dividend out of the funds in general account.
But let's say that this is more the exception on the rule. We are confident that we will be
able to continue the policy of paying a dividend out of the upstreams dividends from the
operating companies. An example – and maybe that is a supplement to Christophe's
answering on previous question on the AG insurance capacity for dividend taking into
account the solvency levels on the Solvency II. And of course, we also have to look to local
accounting, but we expect AG Insurance to be able to pay a dividend between 75% and
100% of the profits. So, no reason for us to believe that we will not be able, in the future,
to continue our dividend policy and also the track record that we have set so far.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Okay. So, thank you very much.

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Maybe one comment from my side. We are very much aware of the concept of
sustainability of dividend. So it's the reason why we have a dividend which is closely linked
to the insurance result, and we want to ensure that this dividend is covered by incoming
dividend.
I understand from your question that you wonder whether we could pay exceptional
dividend out of the cash at the holding level. This is a different concept, and that would be
an exceptional dividend. And sometime, we do exceptional dividend. You remember that
some years ago we did this exceptional dividend and declared in September and paid in
December, but it was a different concept. So, we have the sustainable and operational

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everyone. So, just like (37:39) couple of questions. First of all, can you
give us any thoughts on what's going on the M&A front? I mean clearly, one of the main
reasons why I think you were deferring is Solvency II. But now, given we are, more or less,
know where Solvency II lies for the industry for you, I mean it's a bit more certain than,
let's say, last year. So, how should we think about any M&A here? That is number one.

Secondly, Bart, you did touch base briefly on Hong Kong disposal. Can you (38:07) clarity
on do you think that it's going smooth at the moment? Or do you think that the current
market volatility is still something to keep an eye on? So, how should we think about the
Hong Kong disposal closure in the first half this year?
And lastly is how should we think about Belgium business now? I mean clearly, we are in
an (38:28) which is very tough to light, say, new spread business, i.e. how should we think
about this Belgium business? So, should we be thinking about stable Belgium business a
bit running off at 2%, 3% a year or a bit of growth? So, how should we think about Belgium
going forward? Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. I'll take question one and two and give question three to Antonio. M&A front, also
there, you correctly refer to the now Solvency II environment, the view on that. But let's
underline that our ideas and our approaches with respect to M&A (39:14) compared to
what we did in the past. It means that we are not withstanding cash position running
behind files because we have the cash. We really want (39:25) strategic logic and that the
financials are at least when we move into a file, the ones that fits with our criteria. So, we
have had a very busy year 2015.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I'll come back on part of it with your second question where we are starting up in the
Philippines. We have been selling the first contracts. We are in the process of getting the
necessary licenses in Vietnam. We are hardly working on the closing of the deal in Portugal
which we can expect in, let's say, in the coming, I would say, one to two months. And we
are selling off the Hong Kong activity.
So next is that we stick to our guidelines which is, first of all, look to end-market
opportunities and look to maybe one still country of interest in the Asian growth markets,
which is Indonesia. But we are not running like hell behind files. And you could say that the
activity of looking for new files is rather low at this moment because we want to
concentrate fully on the implementation of all the files signed in 2015.
And for Hong Kong, we announced when we did the deal that we expect the closing in
the first half year of 2016. I believe that we can say that we have no indications that we
would not reach that, so everything seems to be on track and is more a question of
waiting for the last approvals. We would be able to close the deal, but, okay, we stick to
this timing of first half of the year without being able to say whether it will be June, May or
April nor earlier but expect it maybe more in the second quarter of the year.

So you appreciate our matching position in the book and also that we continue to apply
the same matching discipline and also discipline with regard to the guarantees we give
and the profit sharing, which we have also slightly reduced this year. So we're pretty
confident that the margin going forward will continue to be stable. In terms of the volume
of the technical provisions, we believe that there's going to be a slight increase, not
major, but certainly stable, so pretty confident looking forward. And also on the positive
side, we've seen that as we announced also in Q2, Q3, the Unit-Linked business is
gradually increasing, which also gives us a stable margin going forward.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Just on that, I mean, you remain comfortable that whatever near book you're writing to

matched. So you still remain comfortable on that thing?

Hello, thank you very much. First of all, realized gains on slide 10. Could you just give us an
indication? I know the figure is being now stable for two years, but do you think that level

Page 13 of 26

FINAL

of realized gains we're seeing in aggregates is a sustainable figure and what do you think
about the mix between countries? And specifically on Belgium Life, when you talked about
this real estate gain that's now in the first quarter, can you just confirm what should be the
net profit impact of that event? And how should we think about that? Is that something
which is incrementally going to boost 2016 because it's basically delayed 2015 profits, or
is it likely to get lost in the rounding of all the other investment management as the rest
of the year progresses?
And then secondly, the three combined ratios, if we exclude the UK floods, do you think
that those are good underlying basis, so thinking about the outlook for 2016 and 2017? Or
is there anything else we should be adjusting for? And specifically, how do you feel about
the UK flood loss? I mean, it's a big number, but I suppose it was a big event. Are you
comfortable with that losses within what you would've expected, or has it raised any
underwriting questions in your minds? Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. Christophe, you want to take the first question?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Sure. So on slide 10, I will give you more explanation. So here, you have a breakdown by
segment. And you will see that for UK and Continental Europe, figures are low. Why?
Because what we call the risk assets real estate and equities are concentrated in our
Belgium portfolio and are concentrated in Asia, mainly in China. What we can see here,
and that was part of my comments, is the amount, year-on-year, is quite stable. We add
€186 million in 2014, €183 million in 2015. So we've a different breakdown, more on Asia,
less on Belgium.
So your question, is it sustainable over time? I would say this sounds sustainable in the
sense that we can say Asia is slightly above what we could see at least on the right and
Belgium, slightly below. Why? It's mainly because of the delay we experienced on the real
estate transaction. And as you know, the real estate transaction are necessary, and they
are – and very often, we sell big blocks and big things. So, it was more a timing delay on –
a timing issue on Belgium. So now, to be really precise, you asked for the size of this. It's
in the range of €42 million to €45 million, the net impact on the result for Q1 of this
transaction on real estate. But it's kind of the sale of the program of 2015, which means
that for 2016, the budget for real estate needs to realize other sales, but the sale of
2015, what we did in Q1.

A - Antonio Cano

{BIO 16483724 <GO>}

Maybe just two more words on the Belgian real estate. As we shared also in the past, be
aware that our real estate operations also includes a development activity, which means
that, now and then, we will always realize sales of real estate objects. Most of them are
real estate objects that we've developed. So it's very much intrinsic in the operation.

Okay, the questions on the combined ratio and more of the view on 2016-2017. So at the
Investor Day, we confirmed our targets of being below 97%. So if we look back to 2015,
we had an extremely good result in Belgium but also have been saved by absence of real
weather events. So also in Belgium, we cannot guarantee that this will be level year-afteryear, but we are quite sure that the capacity to be consistently below the 97% is there,
right? One of the reasons also of the very good combined ratio is the immediate impact
over the number of actions that have been taken in 2014 with respect to third-party
liability. And part of the benefits of that will be further, let's say, increase in 2016. In
Continental Europe, the combines are in the consolidated entities extremely good. We
were at 85%. We have an attention point as a whole market in Turkey. However, changes
in legislation over the last years has increased the claims but mostly in motor insurance.
And then for UK, you could say that the impact of (48:10) was something like 4%. It was, in
many case, at the end of the year, higher than what we expected beginning of December
that we see now. It's very, very early day, but we see now that next to the start of increase
of rate in motor that there is a soft (48:30) decrease of the rates in household in the first
month going to slight increase at 1%. We are there. Also note that the markets will react
positively in the sense that rates will be coming through the correct levels. So 97% – below
97% core combined ratio targets for 2016 and 2017 is definitely something we expect.

Lovely. May I just come back? Thank you. Just one, I'm getting really excited about capital
gains in Belgium. Are you able to put a similar number on the risk of impairments you may
be taking in Asia or anywhere else if the markets stay at the current level? I don't want to
get too excited.

Q - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

So, Will, I want to give you a lot of comment on this because this is related to Q1. And Q1 –
the release will take place in May. So you have to do your own homework, your own
consideration, but let me help you. So you can read in the presentation that on the equity
portfolio, we had €500 million unrealized capital gain. Then we had an asset allocation,
which is – but we have equity mainly in Belgium or let's say €2.5 billion to €3 billion. So, we
have a margin. And then we look at what the market have done. And then, you take into
consideration the fact that the threshold for booking impairment is at 25%. And with all
these figures, you can derive the risk. I think the risk exists, but it is not enormous. And
that's the maximum I can tell you.

Q - William Hawkings

FINAL

Yes. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of questions left now. Could you just give us
a sense of how the insurance Solvency II ratio has moved thus far over the quarter? Again,
we've had a lot of macro volatility. Perhaps related to that, give us an idea of the
sensitivity of the insurance Solvency II ratio to credit spread widening. I find the sensitivity
spread disclosure you gave in your presentation a little bit difficult to interpret, so any help
on that would be very useful.
And then, secondly in terms of the Turkish Non-Life business, that doesn't seem to be
going terribly well. Can you see light at the end of the tunnel and really what's happening
on the ground to improve the covenant rate of earnings? And finally, just to – what sort of
reinvestment rate you're currently getting in the insurance business rather than over the
full year of last year?

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Maybe starting on Solvency II, of course, you were talking about what you expected the
Solvency II ratio movements are now in the beginning of the year. I must say, we will not
start making predictions on that. I mean, Solvency II sensitivities we disclosed at the
Investor Day and that is as far as we want to go. It's not because Solvency II ratios are
going to be slightly more volatile that every time our market rate moves, we should go
into recalculating old ratios. That is not the purpose. And the fact of the matter is that we
defined our risk appetite. We have assessed the sensitivities that we can tolerate and
would tolerate in our business and that is the way we have settled our Solvency II
management framework.
But referring to what we disclosed during the Investor Day regarding sensitivities on
solvency, of course, you can see that there – I cannot refer to a slide, but it's in the pack of
information that we distributed during the Investor Day – that sensitivities to equity
exposure from the Solvency II ratio of Ageas Consolidated Insurance is actually quite low,
yeah? It's quite low. It's actually almost nil for the simple reason that the exposure of our
main portfolio within Ageas is not as high. That's one, two because part of the impact on
Solvency II of equity movements is absorbed by the non-transferable part belonging to
the BNP share. So that dampens that quite significantly.
On the yield curve and the spread, the sensitivity is higher. We even said that, if we – if
interest rates would go down 1%, we could see a drop in Solvency ratio of about 20 bps.
Also, that is not related so much to mismatch because we know that our books are
matched. So it's not related to the own front loss. It's more related through the increase
of the SCR because of the low portion of loss absorption in there, not the profit-sharing
feature. So it is more an increasing SCR than a lot of old funds because the Ageas book is
matched quite well. And, of course, after a while, that would recover.
The third one on spread, we did a test and we disclosed that, saying, okay, if we stress
test our ratio with 75% of the standard form and the capital charges, if we say, okay, let's
(54:43) us with 75% of that to have a reference, then we would see the ratio come down
with about 10% on spread. That spread, of course, if it does not materialize – I mean, if it
does not materialize in real losses, it will come back after a few periods. In the next year, it

Page 16 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2016-02-17

will add to the profit and loss. And so, these sensitivities are still the relevant ones and can
still be referred to. Maybe once a year, we will consider updating these sensitivities.

Can I just do one follow-up? Just in terms of (55:22) benchmarking your (55:22) to others,

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

I'm afraid I do not have that detail with me. But what we exactly did is we try to simulate a
1 in 30 event, yeah? So, they relate with what I believe is a 1-in-30 shock because our risk
appetite and our risk acceptance in the group is based on 1-in-30 events. But I do not
have exactly the details. In fact, it can be looked up because it's 75% of the standard
formula. But that's quite a full table depending on term and rating.

Q - William H. Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

(56:15) Turkey maybe?

A - Antonio Cano

{BIO 16483724 <GO>}

Maybe some color on the Turkish markets, two remarks. I think that the results have
suffered namely because of the Motor TPL business. If we look at the other lines of
business, it is not that dramatic. It's actually quite satisfactory. But Motor TPL is the issue.
Underlying is actually the fact that there has been some legislation. The changes
introduced by the Turkish government, without going into detail, has to do with things like
minimum wages. So that increased which has an impact on the existing book of claims
reserves in Motor TPL. That has led to an increase of these claimed reserves, and that's
the main reason why results suffered. And having said that, already in the course of 2015,
we have significantly increased our rates for these product lines in Turkey, I think quite
faster than most of our competitors. Consequently, we've also seen our market share in
this product line tumble. I think we're now like the 15th Motor TPL writer in the Turkish
markets with relatively low market share.
So going forward, this line of business will not hurt the P&L as it did in the past. But having
said that, it remains a challenging market. But we see all our competitors actually following
the same routes and rates going up. But I think the macroeconomic situation is difficult.

So on the new money yield, so we're at – each call, we provide you with some info and
quarterly figures. But I'd like to take the slide 38, (58:18) where you have some info. And
what you can read here is that for the full-year 2015, the new money yield was 2.11%.
And since I always give the quarter review, I'd like to remind you all the (58:39)
achievement we had during 2015, so Q1, 2%, 2.01%; Q2, 2.02%; Q3, 2.19%; and Q4, 2.25%.
And the average is the 2.11% I was just mentioning. So then, you may ask how come you
can achieve such a high number with your present asset allocation. And then, I'd like to
give you maybe some more clarity on this.

Bloomberg Transcript

First, on the (59:15), which is a substantial part of the asset allocation, we don't invest a lot
in (59.23), which have been consistently below 1% during the year 2015. We invest in
regional loans, government guarantees. So we are in term of risk in a quasi-government
environment. And here, you have 1.63% for Q4, which means that you have 100 bps of
spread vis-à-vis the pure sovereign loans. Then we invest in corporates, investment-grade
corporate and high yield.And this here, we make, too, 70%. And then we have loans. You
remember that we are very active on loans. And there, we have, too, 44%. All in all, you
justify the 225% of Q4. So, we are well above the 2% all over the year with – I remind you –
the minimum guaranteed rate for the main products up to 1%.
So, this is review for Belgium. This is a good indicator for the group in percent, but the
portfolio of Belgium is quite big compared to the rest, and that the CIO of Belgium, the
chief investment officer, he's also head of investment for the whole group, and his
influence is still all over the group. So, it's a very good indicator for the group policy. So,
above 2%.

Hi. Morning, all. Can I ask two questions, please, based on the credit portfolio? Firstly, I

how important is that for you? Thanks.

FINAL

So, we usually don't discuss the breakdown by sector, but I can understand why you are
interested in the energy sector. We have some exposure, so, around €1.3 billion in
corporate bond, almost no equity, and we have carefully selected and that's something
which is managed by an asset manager who has consistently delivered very good
performance. So we are not concerned by this, and in any case this amount is limited to
€1.3 billion, all in bonds.

Q - Abid Hussain

{BIO 20229932 <GO>}

Great. And just generally across the portfolio, I'm deeply worried about the rating
migration risk, so, a single A being migrated to a lower class. I mean how do you manage
that risk?

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Obviously, the risk of down trade is very present in the energy sector. This is managed by
the asset manager. And you can be sure that it's one of his main concern. In term of
quality, we have selected high quality company in the range of, let's say, AAs, or even if
we have some down trades, we have margins. So, no specific concern this year so far.

Q - Abid Hussain

{BIO 20229932 <GO>}

Understood. Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Now, maybe one thing to add there. It's clear that we have in terms of protecting or
committing to the risk appetite limits that we have set, we have cascaded within the
organization a quite clear set of limits which apply on certain rating classes, and of course
we will monitor the exposure in these baskets. So, if there is re-rating or rating rolling
downhill, this will trigger assessment of the exposures in these various baskets and
investment managers are – in principle, have to adhere to the overall composition of that
portfolio.

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi there. Thank you very much. Just one question remaining. Going back to the comment
you made about cash flow and your intention to upstream between 75% and 100% of
earnings from Belgium, can you also give us a guidance on the other segments? So, can
we assume that for example, Continental Europe and UK where there is some growth,
but obviously, they are very cash-generative, that we can also assume a 75% to 100%

Page 19 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2016-02-17

intention? And Asia being the growth area, we just have to assume that there's a big
reinvestment of earnings. Could you give us some more color? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

So, on cash flow, the percentage of the net profit upstream to the group is (01:04:51) by
the – as I said, the capital management and dividend policy. So, we have some limits, and
when you reach a certain limit, you pay 100%; when you are below the following tranches,
75%; and then you have 50%. So, the same policy applies everywhere.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Right. Just wanted to get a little bit more guidance on numbers. We see your capital
position by group and you've (01:05:27) a disclosure, but just trying to understand how to
forecast that number is sometimes tricky.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

I think we, of course, cannot exactly forecast each element there. The cash is being
marked with (01:05:47) the different identities. But what you see also on the slide 20 – no,
it's not 20. There is a slide in the pack with the upstream per operating company where
you can see that most of the Asian activities have a dividend payout: China, Malaysia,
Thailand, to mention them, and Hong Kong, of course, but that will go out of the group.
And that in the European countries, all companies contributed. Of course, one year to
another, it can change. We have had, for instance, in the past two years, some
restructuring activities. There has been a higher payout in Portugal than what would be the
recurring one. So, we have, as Christophe mentioned, this capital management policy
where the payout ratio is linked to the solvency level and that's something that we will
consistently apply within the group.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

And then in the UK, maybe you wanted some specific comment on the UK. So the
dividend on the UK was not the one expected. It is due to the fact that we had this flood
at the end of the year and we prefer to defer the payment of the dividend knowing that
we were already in a comfortable position for 2015 and that the targets were met. But UK
should resume paying the dividend. We have a business model there with not a lot of
volatility, so UK will pay dividends in the future.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning, gentlemen. Just two questions, if I may. Firstly, on the Solvency II ratio and
kind of Solvency II capital more generally, you indicated that it's still a little bit too early to
clarify the ability to shift capital around between the subsidiaries, specifically, obviously
with regards to Belgium. My question there would be when do think things will become
clearer and which issues specifically are – kind of need to be resolved or clarified?
And then, secondly, on litigation, please, can you just give an update on where matters
are with regards to the VEB case? I think that probably starts in March, so I just wonder
what the positioning is around that. Thanks.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Right. Regarding the capital transferability, there is, obviously, various things at play there.
First, there is the ability, and that does not only depend on the Solvency II capitalization
levels, but also on local gap constraints. So, you also – and that is maybe not that
transparent. You have to look at the local profit of these operating entities.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, even from a Solvency perspective, we would be 100% confident. We have to ensure
that the capital that the retained profits on local gap basis are also of the same level. And
so, that, from time to time, that may mean that you cannot just stream up in the form of
dividend, and you would have to go to capital reduction, et cetera, et cetera, which we
are not envisaging at this moment.
The second thing also relates to the legacies where we say, okay, we have always
committed that we will keep our insurance companies as independently well-capitalized
as they deserve, and that is still our policy today. It puts the responsibility for making that
money sweat and make a decent return on it also with the local entities. And it is part of
our management model. We really want to leave a lot of local autonomy and authority, but
that comes with the responsibility to make a decent return on it. So, that is the way we
manage the operating entities.
Re-upstreaming of the capital, we can consider that opportunistically, we said also at the
Investor Day, in case we have a reason and a use for it. So, we have to allow a group
strategic degrees of freedom to make best use of this capital base. We commented on
that during the Investor Day.
Regarding the legal proceedings, the VEB pleadings are just around the corner. They will
start in the second half of March, as scheduled. Till then, there is nothing much to
comment upon it. Although developments on the legal front, you are obviously aware
about the outcome in the (01:10:37) case, which was favorable for us, but we will not
throw a party for that. The outcome, however, confirms, more or less, the points made by
the IFM on IFM II proceeding which is positive. But it does to some extent take into
account the fact that the counterpart was a professional.
Other than that, the main – other proceedings you may expect are mostly pleadings.
Aside from the VEB, we also have the pleadings in several small cases in the Netherlands,

and in terms of, how should I say, older events that you may expect, there is two
judgments that could come, maybe one relating to the high court appeal, FortisEffect,
which may come in the next quarter. I think that sums it up and you have the nice overview
of it as usual on slide, I think 61 of the pack.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Okay. Just to follow up on the answer you gave on Solvency II transfer, can you just clarify
when do you think those issues around local gap and kind of independent legacy issues
can be resolved? Is that something you think can be resolves by the end of this year, UK?

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Can you please repeat the question? I didn't fully grab it.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Yeah. Sorry. Just to follow up on the answer you gave around the transferability of capital
under Solvency II, you obviously opened up a discussion around local gap constraints and
also, some degree of legacy discussions. Is that something you think you can resolve by
the end of the year?

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Your answer on that is as good as mine. The legacy discussions, the legal litigation
discussions can go on for many, many more years. That could be up to 10 years if we see
everything run. So the answer, that is an answer I cannot give, without question.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks much.

Thank you. The next question is from Bart Jooris, Petercam.

Q - Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Bart Jooris, Degroof Petercam. Two questions left. Regarding your
investment portfolio, is there any CoCo exposure in there? And then, regarding the flood
damages in the UK, has the bulk of them been taken? Or could we expect some more
that were still only brought in the first quarter?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

So, the first answer is very simple. It is non-material. So, we can say, almost zero on the
CoCos.

And the second question, so, what we see is that the provision that we made by the end
of the year, or with respect to the end of the year, appears to be quite precise, even
slightly conservative. So there are no new cases, no, let's say, inflations on existing cases.
So, we are quite confident that not only the bulk has been taken, but that the reserving
that we made for 2015 will be correct.
And even in the reinsurance duration where you have this 21-day views, you could say if,
nevertheless, the total charge would go up, we're very close to the involvement of the
reinsurers. So, additional cost would not impact our results heavily. But I repeat, the first
answer is that we have rationale after mid-February that the reserving has been rather
conservative.

Q - Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

That's very clear. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. . We have a follow-up question from Albert Ploegh, ING Bank. Mr. Ploegh, your
line is now open for your follow-up question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. I had one follow-up question on the oil and gas exposure. I understand,
indeed, it's externally managed. But can you maybe give a little bit rating overview on,
let's say, how much of that amount is at BBB or below BBB? And if we talk more about
your P&L (01:15:11) U.S. exposures, et cetera. Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

No, (01:15:15) I am sorry, but we don't disclose this kind of information. Sorry.

But you may expect the low investment grade is extremely limited. This is in the mandate.
So, the below investment grade is rather marginal.

Hi there. Thank you very much again. Just going back to cash flow, at what level of capital
ratio in, let's say, the UK and Continental Europe has obviously been under a bit more
pressure? Would you say that it becomes, yeah, more difficult to upstream capital from
those – obviously, UK has been hit by one-off factors. But just wondered if you give a little
more guidance about the threshold for the upstream. Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

So, maybe I'll give a start and then leave it to Filip. First of all, when we set our solvency
ratio, it was a case of Solvency I. The same in Solvency II, we set the Solvency ratio on an
Ageas level for the insurance activities as a whole. So, it means if you move back in the
history over the past seven years that you will always have seen differences in levels in
between Belgium company, Europe, UK and so on. So we manage it as insurance as a
whole. That's one.
The second one is that our capital management policy relates to the solvency level of the
local entity. So if we are somewhere below a certain level, the level that we aim for in the
local entity can differ from one country to another. If we are below a certain level, we will
probably say no pay dividend. If we are above, it could be 25% or 50%. If we are very
comfortable, it can be 75% and 100%. So, this is something where we want to keep some
flexibility. And maybe, Filip, you can add something.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. Look, when we look at what is required on the level of the group during the
Investor Day, we actually also commented on that. What we want to achieve is that our
costs of the holding, as well as our dividend commitment are comfortably covered by our
upstream. And that is something that is almost guaranteed only on the basis of the
Belgian company, in fact. If you look at what we said and what we said before about the
available capabilities at AG, that almost covers that. So the dependability only other
entities is less an issue.
That being said, on the UK specifically, I think Bart mentioned it before or Christophe
might even, the volatility of the results in the UK are not as high. You may have concerns
about the profitability this year because of the floods. But in fact, the business line there is
rather predictable in terms of capital needs.
Therefore, in the UK we do not need to hold such high levels of capitalization such in the
other countries. And in the range that we are, maybe 130, 135 (01:18:40), we could
consider upstreaming part of the profit in any case. Whether that will the full amount or
50% or 25%, it depends on it and we will consider. But there is upstream ability in the UK
even at these capitalization levels.
Continental Europe is not one country. So, although the ratio now came down a bit
because of the restructuring in Italy, which in fact implicitly meant that we have upstream
traditional capital out of Continental Europe, if you think about it, we will look at the
various countries. And also there, we know that we are relatively comfortable in our core

FINAL

businesses in Portugal, whereas in France and in Italy we are slightly thinly capitalized and
we will consider the situations in the countries opportunistically in the context of where
they are. So, you could have upstream out of certain countries. We surely expected that
out of our Portuguese operations, not out of France at this moment because they depend
a bit more on the low interest rate, but it is a mixed bag of beans. But we do expect a
reasonable dividend upstream out of Continental Europe as well.
And then on Asia, of course, that business is still growing. But what we more and more
notice is that certain of these countries – and that's already the fact in Thailand and in
Malaysia – have actually reached the capital sustainability. Moreover, they actually generate
surplus. So, we see the dividend payout out of these countries move up year-on-year, and
so that it becomes also a more or less reliable source of dividends.
And as you may have noticed also last year, for the first time, in fact China started paying
a dividend which is a very good news if you think about it for those who doubted about
the fact that if ever capital could flow out of China that it would only flow in. Last year, we
had for the first time dividends, I think about €80 million of them coming out of China.

Thank you. We currently have no further questions in the queue.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. Then, ladies and gentlemen, I propose we go to the closing remarks. Thank you for
your good questions, and let me summarize the main conclusions.
First of all, we ended Vision 2015 era with a satisfactory final result. We did not realize all
our objectives but we made significant progress on most of them, and the internal focus
around the financial targets have been especially crucial.
Also in 2015, we have clearly delivered for our shareholders the annual dividend that's
been increased by 6.5% to €1.65 per share gross and in cash, and we are executing our
fifth consecutive share buyback program that was announced in the summer of 2015.
Since January 1 of this year, Solvency II is in place. After many years of preparation, the
transition went smoothly, and we can confirm the message given last September, our
insurance Solvency II ratio exceeds our target of 175%.
And finally, Ambition 2018, our new plan has officially taken off. We are working intensively
to put in place the cornerstones of our future strategy to respond to the new
technological and societal challenges impacting our business.
