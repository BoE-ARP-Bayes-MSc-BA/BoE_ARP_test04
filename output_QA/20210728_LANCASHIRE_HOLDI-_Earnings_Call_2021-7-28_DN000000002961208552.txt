{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you everyone. We will just over our presentation. Slide 3 please. In the half -in the first half of 2021, we've got strong premium growth in line with our long-term
strategy of capital deployment and expansion at this point in the underwriting cycle, as
the underwriting opportunity grows. RPI remained strong across our portfolio of risks with
premium growth rate healthily in excess of rate change, which demonstrates our business
moves forward. We have executed the plan we articulated when we raised equity capital

12 months ago and then raised further debt in Q2 to fund further growth demonstrates an
active capital management policy.
Our strong underwriting performance in the half year despite Winter Storm Uri. We have
an excellent combined ratio with a strong underwriting profit and have reserve releases
are benefiting from our robust reserving process. Winter Storm Uri loss estimates remain
within our previously announced range and our COVID-19 loss estimate is stable with
most of our -- with the majority of our loss estimates still be an IBNR. One of the most
pleasing things that we've done in the half year is to continue to hire new teams and
continue to build out Lancashire's book of business.
So lots of progress in high quality talent acquisition, the Lancashire bench strength has
significantly improved and these new teams will bring pipeline organic growth for the
2022 underwriting year. On capital, we remained strongly capitalized and continue to put
more capital to work. Our regulatory capital ratio was 254%, as at the 31st of March '21. As
I said earlier, we completed a highly successful long-term debt refinancing project in Q2
and the surplus debt capital is available for further growth. Our interim dividend of $0.05
means that our dividend policy remains unchanged by 2021 earnings will be retained to
fund further opportunity for '22.
In summary, we're deploying our strategy, building our business and we have the
strongest bench strength in our history. I'll just now hand over to Paul.

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

As Alex has mentioned, it's been another strong quarter, bringing year-on-year growth to
about 41% at the midpoint of the year. We're very pleased that we were executing our
underwriting strategy of actively managing the underwriting cycle and delivering strong
levels of premium and earnings growth in an improving market.
A combined ratio of 80.7% represents a very solid start to 2021, particularly given the
heightened catastrophe activity during Q1. We obviously have the remainder of the year
to navigate, but this puts us on a strong underwriting footing, as we start to see the
benefits of the underlying rate increases feed through into underwriting profitability.
The writing environment remains favorable with more business hitting adequacy levels,
albeit it does remain a market, where you still need to maintain underwriting discipline.
Some subclasses have seen rate rises for numerous quarters now and the trajectory
remains positive. As you know, we are strong believers in the insurance cycle, so it's
inevitable that the pace of increase in some of these lines will slow at some point, so we
continue to focus on the cumulative rate movement and rate adequacy.
Unsurprisingly and in line with the first quarter, most of the premium growth is derived
from our property and casualty reinsurance segment. We had highlighted this segment as
an area for growth, as we look to deploy the additional capital we raised last year. We've
successfully grown our property catastrophe and retrocession portfolios over the past six

months, growing with existing clients, starting relationships with new clients, and
benefiting from positive rates.
Our re-insurance segment also includes our three new lines of business for 2021 being
casualty reinsurance, specialty reinsurance, and accident and health. All three have started
successfully and ahead of initial expectations in terms of the premium written. Last
quarter, we guided to the top end of the $40 million to $60 million premium range for
these three classes. Given the start to the first six months of the year, we are confident
the top end of the range will be achieved and could potentially be exceeded.
As always, the underwriting will be driven by the opportunity and not any preordained
premium targets. The other segment, we anticipated utilizing the additional capital with
the property and casualty insurance segment and more specifically, the property direct
and facultative subclass within that.

Bloomberg Transcript

The growth in property D&F is always going to be more focused in the second quarter,
the busiest quarter for this product. Utilizing both the Lloyd's and company platforms,
we've successfully grown property D&F premium as rates continue to improve. The
growth in property D&F is the driver of growth for this segment. Also within these
segments, it's terrorism and political risks, the terrorism subclass is experiencing a more
benign writing conditions, as it remains ample capacity that prevents any significant rate
improvement.
The flat rate environment negatively skews the overall segment RPI. In both terrorism and
political risks, we have been able to grow premium year-on-year. As we say every year,
the first half is not overly significant for the aviation portfolio given the majority of this
renews in the second half of the year. It is still, however, pleasing to see continued rate
improvement and delivery of year-on-year growth ahead of rate.
We will remain alive to the obvious demand headwinds the sector could face given the
aviation industry dynamics, but thus far our portfolio has managed these challenges very
well. Our energy portfolio is experiencing different pricing dynamics dependent upon the
sub-class, downstream, power, and liabilities are all seeing good price momentum and we
have grown in all of these areas.
Upstream energy rates remain positive albeit in the low to mid single digit range and lots
of business within this segment remains pricing inadequate in our opinion. Within
upstream, we have not renewed some business, where we felt renewal terms were
insufficient. The only segment of our portfolio that was reduced year-on-year is marine.
This is down to two key drivers. Firstly, there were a small number of high premium
accounts on either a non-annual or multi-year basis, not yet due for renewal. Assuming
acceptable renewal terms, these policies were renewed later this year or in future
underwriting years.
Secondly, there were a select few large premium accounts that we chose to not renew, as
we did not believe that renewal terms based on performance of those accounts were

Page 3 of 20

FINAL

acceptable. This just highlights that despite our stated intention to grow, we will -- we will
still fundamentally believe underwriting discipline needs to be maintained.
In general, we believe the writing in our marine subclasses is the best it's been for a
number of years and continues to improve. In light of that, we will certainly be looking to
grow our marine footprint further where possible. To aid future growth, we've continue to
add underwriting talent to the group, both in the existing lines of business and new lines
of business.
Most recently, our new Head of Marine Liabilities has joined and just started underwriting.
In addition to this, we expect to welcome at the end of this year a new Head of Energy
Liabilities as well as a new Construction and Engineering Team, further to this, we have
employed two underwriters who are based in Australia to expand our D&F offering in the
region. You'll start to see the premium associated with these initiatives in 2022 and this
along with the continued build-out of the other new classes will support our 2022
premium growth. As always, the pace of growth in these lines will be driven by the market
opportunity.
I'll now pass over to Natalie.

Natalie Kershaw

{BIO 21394441 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. I'm going to talk through some slides, detailing the overall performance for
the half year with some additional flavor on the loss environment, our investment
portfolio, and capital position. Our financial performance for the first half of 2021 is
detailed on Slide 5. As Paul has noted, our strong gross premium written growth in the
first quarter was maintained into Q2.
Our outwards reinsurance spend has reduced as a percentage of gross premiums written
from 43% to 38.6%, as we retain more risk in the improving market. We are starting to
see the benefit of increased net premiums on earnings coming through, which benefits
our expense ratios and we are very happy with the overall combined ratio of 80.7%. The
absolute increase in dollar terms in G&A expenses is largely due to higher employment
costs, reflecting the new lines of business we have entered into.
Other income is higher than in H1 2020 due to more profit commission coming through
from LCM relating to the 2019 underwriting cycle. The overall change in fully converted
book value per share of 3.4% was negatively impacted by one-off cost due to the debt
refinancing in H1. These costs totaled $18.7 million, of which $12.8 million related to the
direct redemption costs for our existing senior and subordinated debt.
The remaining one-off costs largely comprised open interest payments, prior to the
original that being redeemed plus some of the incidental financing cost. These costs were
one-off that have given us a simpler and more efficient capital structure for the future. As
a reminder, our new subordinated debt has the benefit of regulatory eligibility and is also
at a fixed rate protecting our financing costs against any future rates inflation.

Slide 6 please. Slide 6 details our loss ratio performance H1 2021 and increase of
reconciliation back to the underlying attritional loss ratio of 38%. Excluding Winter Storm
Uri, the first half of the year was relatively quiet from a loss perspective, resulting in a loss
ratio of 38.4% compared to 57.4% for H1 2020. It is worth noting that the unusual run of
risk losses that we saw across most segments and geographies in 2020 did not continue
into the first half of 2021. For Winter Storm Uri, we followed our usual Cat loss reserving
procedure that brings together representatives from across the business and assesses
potential exposure on a policy-by-policy basis to come up with an overall estimate for the
group.
The favorable prior year development for the half year $53.6 million was positively
impacted by the release of two large risk claims from the 2016 year on prior in our favor
as well as releases across the 2017 Cat losses. Conversely, the 2018 and 2019 accident
years, so some unfavorable impact of prior year claims. As we've noted before and given
the lines of business that we write, we can have lumpy quarters or even half-year
numbers.
The remainder of the releases largely occurred due to the reduction in IBNR on the 2020
accident year, due to a lack of reported claims coming through. The waterfall diagram on
this slide illustrates how we think about the underlying attritional loss ratio. As mentioned
last quarter, our traditional specialty lines such as marine and energy are exposed to
irregular larger losses such as tank sinking or explosions and so on, which are
unpredictable in nature and have always been excluded from our attritional ratio guidance.
We classify this type of claim greater than $5 million as a large loss. As mentioned, the
first half of 2021 has been relatively quiet for risk losses. So we haven't seen a material
impact from this type of claims so far this year.
Slide 7 illustrates a relatively conservative portfolio structure with an overall credit rating of
A plus. We aim to invest in largely low risk, short duration, and liquid investments as well as
taking more risk on the underwriting side of the business. So far in 2021, our investment
performance is marginally positive at 0.3% overall return. The fixed-income portfolios
have been negatively impacted by the steepening of the yield curve with some of our risk
assets performing well to offset these losses. We do not intend any material changes to
our investment strategy in the medium term and we'll keep the overall portfolio duration
short to help mitigate inflationary impacts. We are looking to increase our allocation to
floating-rate assets, again to mitigate potential inflationary impacts.
On Slide 8, the workflow chart shows how our regulatory capital position has developed
since the end of 2020 incorporating the impact to the debt raise and new business in the
first quarter of 2021. Most importantly, this diagram shows that we still maintain a strong
regulatory capital position following a one in 100-year Gulf of Mexico wind event. As
mentioned last quarter, we expect our BMA solvency ratio to be comfortably over 200%
going forward, dependent on market conditions.
And I'll hand back over to the Operator.

Okay, fine. So just to summarize on outlook. Our core strategy has not changed, will not
change. We firmly believe in the insurance cycle and we'll continue to navigate the cycle
and manage our business for the long-term. I think it's important that we -- I think Paul said
earlier we are incredibly focused on rate adequacy and the majority of our portfolio
seeing 3 to 4 years of of rate hardening and all the time adequacy is there, we're going
to grow our business, we're in a strong position to do that. We have the capital and as we
said earlier, we've been employing more -- more and more very good people to come to
our business.
So we believe we're in a very strong position, we will grow. I think the growth for us as
well, if we believe in our strategy that we do take, less risk when market conditions are
difficult, it's equally important that we grow now and we believe over time that's what will
give us a better return for our business and improve our returns over the longer-term
cycle.
So I think we're balanced, we're positive about the opportunity, but we do believe that as
we go into '22, we've -- with the teams who are bringing in the opportunity, be say there's
going to be further growth coming through '22.
So we'll now go to the operator for questions.

Questions And Answers

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Kamran
Hossain from RBC. Please go ahead, your line is open.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi, everyone. Two questions, the first one is just I guess rate doing really strong were on 3
or 4 years of as you said of prices going up, what's the message to underwrite at the
moment, you're still going to push as hard as they can or are you willing to kind of ease
off slightly and just take a bit more volume.
So that's the first question and the second question is I guess on the the G&A expense
ratio, which has improved pretty substantially year-on-year or compared to the full year
2020 run rate. Could you give us an idea of kind of what that should look like as you
continue to grow. I think you've talked about one to two points benefit coming through,
but that's clearly been -- were there any one-offs or is this just an acceleration given the
very strong topline growth so far this year. Thanks.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

So I think the message to our underwriters is that we want to grow as the underwriting
opportunity improves. I think the point of clarification is if you look at our product lines and
what we've consistently said about this market opportunity is that some classes of
business are better than others and we have got classes of business that are 150% of
Page 6 of 20



FINAL

Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2021-07-28

adequacy and we've got our classes that we would probably I'll give are not adequate
enough. So it's all about making sure that we -- we're putting heavy expansion into the
classes of business that are the most profitable and the classes that still require some
attention, when moderating our view there. And I think we have consistently said that
about this opportunity. We haven't subscribed to this is the best market we've ever seen,
but it's materially better than what it was and I suppose the beauty of our business is the
line of sight we have as Management is we cannot push our underwriters in the right
direction.

A - Natalie Kershaw

{BIO 21394441 <GO>}

Hi Kamran, it's Natalie. On the G&A question, what we've said previously is that we expect
some increase in premium to give us a lower G&A ratio in line with 2016, 2017. And we're
now currently seeing the benefit of that premium coming through and around in line with
2016, 2017 ratio, I'd expect us to stay around that level for this year and into next year.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Let me just clarify that, so that's sort of kind of the sub 20 G&A ratio?

A - Natalie Kershaw

{BIO 21394441 <GO>}

Yeah. That's around 20.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Brilliant. Thanks Natalie.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Freya Kong from Bank of America.
Please go ahead, your line open.

Q - Freya Kong

{BIO 20097488 <GO>}

Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First question, just a clarification point on the dividend
comment you made earlier Alex. You said, 2021 profit would be retained, is that just in
excess of the regular dividend that you pay. Second question, how should we think about
the rate, the really effective rate increases that we're seeing through into the attritional
loss ratio over time. And just a third question, if possible, on the new hires that you've
announced that will be draw in 2022, how should we think about the expense growth
outlook from here. Thanks.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Yeah, on point one, that's exactly what I was saying. So any -- any earnings in excess of
our normal dividends will be retained for growth into '22.

A - Natalie Kershaw

{BIO 21394441 <GO>}

Page 7 of 20



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2021-07-28

So on the attritional ratio, we're keeping the guidance 35% to 40%. As we said before,
we are reserving conservatively for the new lines of business that we're entering into.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

FINAL

And sorry Freya, what was -- could you clarify the third question, please.

Q - Freya Kong

{BIO 20097488 <GO>}

How should we think about the G&A expense growth I guess in absolute dollar terms
rather than the ratio, because it's impacted by how much growth coming in.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

We don't tend to give out dollar numbers for hires that we're making. But I think we
probably refer you back to Natalie's answer to Kamran on kind of forward-looking G&A
ratio, but sorry we don't just tend to give out dollar numbers for new hires that are
coming in.

Q - Freya Kong

{BIO 20097488 <GO>}

Okay. That's fine. And just following up on the rate question that I had. Now that I guess
most of the premiums for 2021 has been written, how should we think about that any
through into next year.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Natalie Kershaw

{BIO 21394441 <GO>}

Yes, I wouldn't say most the premiums this year have been written. We are anticipating
further growth in the second half of the year, which will be mainly in the specialty lines. I
don't know if Paul wants to add anything on that.

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Yes, Natalie, I mean, the obvious area that's is up for renewal in the latter stage of the
year is the aviation portfolio, which is now a reasonably material part of our overall
portfolio. So there's certainly and it's also 1st of July renewals that will come into Q3, so
whilst we all premium heavy in Q1, sorry, half one, there's certainly a fair amount of income
still to be written in the second quarter.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

And then for '22, we expect to grow for '22 again, obviously that will be driven by how
good the underwriting opportunity is.

A - Jelena Bjelanovic

{BIO 16398596 <GO>}

Freya, sorry, this is Jelena, just to come back to you on rate increases earning into the
attritional loss ratio next year. So you have already seen that from last year to this year, if
you look at the underlying loss ratio, you have seen the benefit of rate comes through. It
takes us roughly about 12 to 18 months to earn the rate through on exactly the same book
of business. But given the level of growth we've been seeing and as we talked about with
Page 8 of 20



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2021-07-28

our Q1 presentation, in terms of the changing business mix, it's very hard for you from the
outside to track that in the attritional loss ratio.

Q - Freya Kong

{BIO 20097488 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay, thanks.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Iain Pearce from Credit Suisse.
Please go ahead, your line is open.

Q - Iain Pearce

{BIO 19522835 <GO>}

Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Couple on retrocession spend, just in terms of how we
should think about the retro spend in H1. If we say you will need the core program with
rates up sort of 10% to 15%, it's the remainder of that retro spend coming from new
teams and then sort of following on from that thinking about retro spend for 2022, I mean
if the plan to renew the core program again, what are the expectations around rates and
retro and similarly, how do you expect the retro spend on the new teams to develop
going forward. Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Hi Iain, I'll take that. Yes, look, I think if you -- I'm assuming when you say retro spend,
you're assuming all of our reinsurance spend, I will answer it. Yes. So, yes, we definitely on
some -- on some parts of the business had to pay up, because that's -- the market's
going up, so you've -- some of the increased dollar spend is obviously associated with
rate. You've then got the spend associated with the new teams. But what you also have is
when you're growing your portfolio, there's increased spend associated with that
increased exposure, just like we have clients of ours that increase our exposure year-onyear. There's premium associated with that increased exposure.
So the kind of increase in dollars is made up of those three parts, but as we said earlier in
the year. We expected the dollar amount to come up with the proportion versus the
premiums to reduce, which is exactly what happened. Looking into 2022, in terms of how
we are going to buy that's the kind of decision, we won't make until we come through
wind season. We'll see where the market fits. We're always going to buy large chunks of
what is our core programs, because you know that's part of the reinsurance program that
we tend to renew you pretty much every year. But in terms of overall strategy, we tend to
look at that later on in Q3 and come out with a plan for 2022, assuming the market
continues as we expect it to, we would expect to see that proportion of spend continue
to reduce into 2022, but obviously we will revisit that later in the year when we know
underlying market conditions are like.

Q - Iain Pearce

{BIO 19522835 <GO>}

Perfect. And just -- on following up on the new teams as well, are you buying sort of
higher levels of reinsurance on these new team expect that to reduce, are you expecting
to run with sort of the current levels of reinsurance going forward.

FINAL

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Each team will be different and there will be different levels of reinsurance purchase. We
don't necessarily by increase levels of re-insurance just because it's new teams, but what
you do get is the proportion effect, where you have to buy a reinsurance program, which
costs us a certain minimum amount of money and obviously, you haven't got them with
income to start, which proportionately is always quite high in the early years when you're
building out, but I wouldn't say that necessarily reflects us trying to overprotect it need on
the business.

Q - Iain Pearce

{BIO 19522835 <GO>}

Perfect. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous.
Please go ahead, your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi there, could you just update, Paul, I think you talked about expected premium from new
teams, I got on the call slightly late, I mean I think specifically in reinsurance, you've given
the figure in the past of $40 million to $60 million, I think you suggested it would be at the
upper end of maybe just update on that number. I think that $40 million to $60 million was
for various specialty classes in reinsurance. Second question, obviously when we talk
about attritional loss ratio, we kind of need to think of it also in terms of reserve releases
that might result from a conservative attritional booking. I was quite surprised to see the
extent of 2020 accident year releases in the first half, because I saw on some of the
newer business, where you're booking some of the more attritional less cash-heavy
business, it was -- it was a longer seasoning pattern in more like 12 months to 18 months,
not sort of 6 months maybe could you just clarify how should think about that.
Sorry, two other questions, I can see in your updated PMLs, the growth in the 1 in 100-year
and 1 in 250-year exposure, can you just qualitatively give us a sense as to what's
happened on more frequent return intervals, 1 in 50, 1 in 20, I'm just trying to understand
the shape of the book. If the growth has been shaped because of the higher -- the lower
returns or is the lower -- 1 in 50, 1 in 20 done similar types of growth.
Final question, just update on LCM of third-party interest, where sort of you're seeing
potential flows with respect to third-party capital given that market seems to have
somewhat picked up again.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay, Thanks Andrew. I'll take -- yeah, I'll take the first one and then the third one on PML.
So yes, we've guided on -- so on these three kind of new lines of this year, which were
casualty reinsurance, specialty reinsurance and accident and health, our initial guide was
$40 million to $60 million, last trading update, I said we are reasonably confident we'll be
at the upper end of that. If you jumped on the call late, you'd have missed in my scripts, I
Page 10 of 20



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2021-07-28

said, we're very confident of achieving that top end and could potentially exceed that top
end of the range. Obviously, we'll be able to give a more of the same update later in the
year, but the start on all of those has been really positive. So we're obviously happy with
that.

FINAL

I'm afraid, on the PML just had quite sure down stuff and Jelena would -- he'll make -- we
don't publish the 1 in 50s and the 1 in 20s, so unfortunately, I can't answer that question.

A - Natalie Kershaw

{BIO 21394441 <GO>}

Hi, Andrew. I'll take the reserve releases question. So there has been no change to how
we run off in particular the attritional IBNR from previous years. And actually the release of
the attritional from the prior year was relatively similar last year, it was just masked by
some one-off larger claims that had adverse development on them. So I wouldn't say that
this year is particularly any better. It's just that last year the run-off of the attritional IBNR
was kind of masked by one of risk losses. Does that make sense?

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Yes, I still thought some of the newer business, especially still small, which had the sort of
longer or partly because it's newer, partly because I think it's not going to short tail. That's
why I was thinking it would be some drawn lengthening as it were of the recognition
pattern.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Natalie Kershaw

{BIO 21394441 <GO>}

Yes, but you're right the impact of the new business on 2020 wasn't particularly
significant.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Natalie Kershaw

{BIO 21394441 <GO>}

So you're still really saying on the 2020 year, most of our kind of traditional business
coming through this year, the majority of the new business lines have been written this
year and into next year.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

A - Darren Redhead

Hi Andrew, it's Darren. Regarding your question on mid-year and increased appetite from
[ph]ILS investors, it's a couple of comments. We just completed at mid-year draw from
last year, which is a similar amount. Regarding others, which haven't seen a demand or an
increased demand from investors appetite, I think it's a bit of where people getting funds
released from prior years from COVID potential claims that they've had additional
capacity to draw -- I think it's a bit of a one-off.

I think similar amounts, yeah.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

So in other words, there is an even -- just on that topic, there's a big disconnect between
broader ILS appetite versus the -- what we've seen in the capital market, which I know is
just a fraction of the ILS.

A - Darren Redhead

Yes. The capital market has its own dynamics and you've seen tightening in the pricing
and we would take it offline and go through that.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of (inaudible) from J.P. Morgan. Please
go ahead, your line is now open.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Thank you and good morning -- good afternoon, everyone. Just a couple of questions I
have is I mean possibly get some thoughts on the recent European floods, I mean, do you
have any exposure to those, I mean what sort of course could be there, any thoughts on
that would be great.
And secondly, like if I look at the Property Capital reinsurance, I mean the exposure is now
going up, it's more than 50% of your total book, it was 40% last year, I mean, what is the
level where you would be okay to go with, I mean is it okay even if it's like 60% - 65% or
would you say, I know you don't want to go into that -- those sort of levels, because
clearly it looks like this is an area where you are looking to grow going forward as well.
And thirdly is with your capital that you have, I mean how should we think about how much
you can grow next year, I mean, let's say, the rest of this year remains benign, i.e.,
earnings are all right, there is no major hiccups, so how should we think about the
potential GWP growth for next year. Again given that, most of it most likely is coming from
the property cat business. Thank you.

Hi. On the European floods, obviously we write property cat business and have European
exposure within that. So it's certainly an event that we would anticipate having some
exposure to. At this early stage, all the information we have is anecdotal, so look, we can't
give any numbers based upon that, but that's something we look at as we get -- start
getting real information from clients and we'll obviously give an update on that later in the
year.
In terms of property cat percentage, I think one, you should always look at the full year in
terms of looking at the percentage, because obviously property cat is very heavy in the
first half of the year and we answer the question similar earlier there is a lot of other
business to be renewed during the course of this second part of the year.
In terms of, is there a hard stop on any percentages, we've never run the business in a
way where we have preordained percentages for any line of business, the way we look at
it is where do we think we can get the best return and if that meant that there was a great
opportunity in property cat and our percentage of premium in that area increase if we
saw the returns were there, then that's what we would do.
Conversely, if there was opportunity elsewhere, we would have no problem, reducing the
percentage. So it's just driven by the market opportunity that we see in front of us and
what returns that can produce for us.

A - Natalie Kershaw

{BIO 21394441 <GO>}

Yeah. I'm going on to the question three. On the capital, it's kind of similar to what P.G. has
just said that we've said we match the capital to the underwriting opportunity that we see,
so we will bear that in mind going into 2022. But also it's worth remembering that the
recent underwriting hires we've made those that started this year and those that where
we'll see more impact into '22 that predominantly in lines of business that need very little
capital charge. So all that element of the organic growth, we can actually achieve with very
limited additional capital. And then, as Alex mentioned at the start and Paul, we are
expecting to retain most of our earnings in excess of the ordinary dividend to help fund
any future growth into next year.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Sure. Thank you. Just like a one follow-up on the previous question about like there is no
bar for any say proportionate business et cetera, I mean how do we think about the cat
budget then 15%, because clearly there are other reinsurers, who are now talking about,
okay, they need to review their cat budget, because climate chain maybe it's real four
years in a row then we had Uri, then we had German floods, which are just unique
secondary perils, so I mean how do we think about your cat budget of 15%. I agree that
you will make a lot of money on the attritional side if you write a lot of property cat, but
should we need to rethink about the cat budget or would you say 15% is still a very good
number.

So I think we can't comment on other carriers and their actions and their view of climate
change et cetera and obviously, we -- we don't see ourselves as climate change experts,
but we're definitely experts in the world of assessing risks that we insure and the capital
we have to allocate for those and I'll get paid appropriately. But look, just to echo what
Paul said, we're driven by opportunity, so if we believe the opportunity in our cat business
or our non-cat business is great, we're going to grow the opportunity, but obviously
factoring in our view of frequency and severity and all again paid for the capital we're
deploying.
So, and lastly, a lot of that market opportunity will be driven out of this year's hurricane
season and we're not even at the peak of that point yet, so that would be premature to
try and make those kind of assumptions for next year.

A - Natalie Kershaw

{BIO 21394441 <GO>}

In terms of -- just to jump in and in terms of the cat budget, we don't have one as yet, so
the 15 points is the historical average combined ratio burden in any given year. It's never -we have never had a stated cat budget.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Okay, okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our net question comes from the line of Ben Cohen from Investec. Please go
ahead, your line is open.

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

Hi there, thanks very much for taking my questions. I had -- I had a few questions, I'll keep
them brief. In terms of the outlook for new teams, could you just recap in terms of the
new hires that you've announced today and maybe give some indication in terms of how
you see them contributing into next year. The second question was on the reduction
actually on the acquisition cost ratio, which has come down, I know it varies quite a lot by
different lines, but does that gives a good a good run rate going forward.
And the third thing was just to follow up on the German flood point, I don't think you've
quantified. A lot of European catastrophe exposure in the past, so I was wondering if you
could help us sort of put in in context what the potential loss could be there given the lack
of a track record for your business in terms of exposure. Thank you.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay, Ben. So yeah, on the new team, so we've recently hired a new Head of Marine
Liabilities, Marine Liability is something that we have underwritten, but it's an area that we
think we can expand into and Stella has recently joined and started underwriting, but in
reality you're going to start seeing the premium in 2022. We've also hired a new Head of

Page 14 of 20

FINAL

Energy Liability again, an area of the book that we've had relatively small exposure to a
market that's moving forward quite nicely, so it's an area that we can grow our presence.
We've also hired a construction and engineering team, which again they will join later this
year and then the last one I mentioned was we've hired two underwriters to expand our
D&F offering in Australia. In terms of premium numbers, what we'll do is we'll revisit that
and give some guidance a bit like we did this year for the three new lines that came in the
1st of January later in the year, one that's because these underwriters haven't actually
joined us yet, they join us later in the year. We'd obviously look to see how market
conditions play out but what we look to do here is give you a similar range to what we did
this year on the lines of come in recently.

A - Natalie Kershaw

{BIO 21394441 <GO>}

Hi, Ben. On the acquisition cost ratio, as you know it is highly influenced by the business
mix and as this year, we've got a significantly higher proportion of the property business
that's helping the ratio. It's also worth noting that you tend to get better terms and
conditions in the harder market, you tend to see a lower attritional rate acquisition cost
ratio in this type of market anyway, I think the next year, as Paul just said, we can update
later in the year when we got more of an idea of what we think our premium business mix
will be next year, that would obviously influence what the acquisition cost rate is as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

And just going back on the Euro floods Ben, obviously as I said to previous question, it's
not something that we can provide any kind of range on at the moment, very early and all
the information we've got thus far is anecdotal, but obviously we'll be working through
that in Q3, we have always had European exposure and if you kind of look up PML. PML,
there is -- there is a PML for European cat risk included within that, it generally falls within
our property catastrophe portfolio and that's both within the Syndicate and the Bermuda
platform.

Q - Ben Cohen

Sorry, just to follow-up, can you remind us the last material European catastrophe event
that you had and size that?

A - Alex Maloney

Q - Faizan Lakhani

{BIO 22154809 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Congratulation on a good set of results. I just had a few sort of follow-up
questions, most of my questions have been answered. On the operational expenses,
obviously that's been sort of increase due to the additional hires, just wanted to
understand, obviously the hires that have come in between the half year, how much would
be true run rate be if they were to start in January '21.
The second question, it's on the attritional loss ratio. Given that you've written $40 million
to $60 million potential premium, how much of that attritional loss ratio is down to
conservatism that you've put in, I'm just trying to understand as you right newer business,
what sort of drive would be on the attritional loss ratio.
And the third question is on the larger losses and you've had a few half years now, where
you've had sort of unexpected large losses that don't fit in the catastrophe bucket or the
attritional bucket, I understand that you run through in nature, but should we be allowing
for a low for those large losses. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Natalie Kershaw

{BIO 21394441 <GO>}

Yes, on the large losses question, as you know, it's just part of the business that we write
that we do have these occasional large and unpredictable losses that we can't really give
any guidance on. As P.G. said, we're not going to comment on the G&A impact of the new
hires, but we obviously expect the expenses to be higher next next year than this year,
given that the announcements that we've made.
And then on the attritional ratio, I think we've answered enough questions on that now, I
think you just need to keep the guidance for the moment, 35% to 40%.

Q - Daryl Goh

{BIO 4258857 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Thanks everyone. So few questions please. The first one, I guess just
sense of clarification around the unchanged attritional guidance, I know what you're saying
about the conservatism in new lines, but is there any conservatism that you're assuming
within property lines, given the short-term inflationary pressure, I mean I know there's a

FINAL

comment in your slide saying that you've had a loading -- you have an inflation loading in
your cat model maybe a sense around what the loading is please.
And the second question is just going on the outlook, so you sound pretty confident in the
outlook given that you still plan to build out the teams at this stage and that also you
intend to retain your earnings to deploy into next year, so conscious that your focus is on
rate adequacy rather than rate momentum. What gives you confidence in the
sustainability of the very favorable market conditions now? Thank you.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think that we do consider inflation on our cat models, that's something that's already
built in, but obviously we don't -- we don't give you that number, but inflation in any harder
business is considered, so that will always be factored into the numbers that we get the
market. I think -- I think on the outlook, I do think this year's wind season is key and I think
that I think if you have a benign wind season, I think the momentum in rate change
obviously slows quicker, because that will mean the carriers have made decent margins.
So you'd expect competition to increase, but I think you have to look that way you are. I
mean even if that happened and even this market is moving flat, you've had four years of
rate change, so you've built back up to a central level of market pricing and for us, we just
see that as an opportunity with the build out that we've had at Lancashire ever since the
market got better, the teams that we're bringing in and you see it from from some of the
changes that we brought in 3 or 4 years ago, all of a sudden they've got a $50 million
book, they've got a $75 million book and the build-out continues.
So that's why we are confident to stay abstinent, whatever happens actually in the rate
environment, we're still going to grow into '22, because we've got the pipeline of new
teams coming through and the maturity levels of the other teams will add to that. So
that's why we're maybe bolder than we normally are on growth into '22 at this early stage.

{BIO 17001429 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. And just two questions
please. My first question is that you are very upbeat on the growth into the full year and
2022. Would you give a split between how much of that will come from the rate and how
much of that is more organic or the business you're adding on.
And my second question is on your tax rate, it looks bit high for the half year, is there any
one-off there, what are you guiding going forward, giving other business costs you're
adding on. Thank you.

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

FINAL

So I think -- I think the first question and again, as we concluded demonstrate by these
results is you've got your RPI rate of 11%, so if our business was only growing at 11%, my
view is that we're not actually making any progress. So there is a very nice gap between
our actual growth rate and the RPI changes that you're just seeing and we believe that
that continues into '22.
Now we wouldn't give you a number today, because we don't know, but we would also
always remind everyone, which we always say, if the underwriting opportunity is greater
than we expect, we're going to grow more and if the underwriting opportunity is weaker
than we expect, we're going to grow less. But the point I keep coming back to is, I think
kind of whatever happens to the rate environment, we're grow in anyway, because you're
going to see the benefit of the investments that we've made at this point. And as Paul
said, even for the people that are currently in our business, it takes time to build these
portfolios out and some of these people that we've employed are not even here, but we
can that pipeline coming through for us.

Hi Ming, it's Natalie. On the tax, yes, you're right, there was a one-off charge in the half
year, so this is a one-off charge of $3.7 million and it related to the increase in the UK
corporation tax for 2023 to 25%. So we have to apply that increase to our deferred taxes,
which resulted in that one-off expense, so you can remove that one-off expense as you
think about tax looking forward.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Hi everyone, just a really quick one from me, I guess the PMLs have increased as we
would expect with the opportunity and we talked about market opportunity earlier. So just
trying to reflect that in to see where we are in the current status, you're increasing these
by somewhere between 60% to 80% versus the full year.
So maybe that reflects the opportunity, but if you can quick comment on that. But I guess
more importantly, what sort of percentage, I remember going back a decade or so that
you used to talk about when the market is at its absolute peak, we would be X percent of
our tangible capital exposure to a 1 in a 100 event. I guess, do you still think like that and
therefore, where do we think we are relative to history and opportunity. Thanks.

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

So we -- we definitely think the same, so nothing has changed there and just in simple
terms and if you're in, I know 6 on to market, we're going to deploy everything we've got.
But I think as we've said we're not -- we're not quite there yet. So I think again it will be
based on opportunity, I think we've been super clear about our view of this current
opportunity, which is materially better than our market was, but we haven't been in the
view of the cheerleaders of the market and it's the best thing I've ever seen, because
that's factually incorrect.
So look, our view hasn't changed and again, our view of '22 is we've got a lot of good
things going on in our business and a lot of investment that we see that's going to come
through, but it'll always be based on the underwriting opportunity and I do think this year's
wind season is absolute key to where this goes.
And as you would know, Will, better than anyone really, investors want evidence of our
game better, so people need to whatever happens for the rest of the year, people need
to remain disciplined and show to their stakeholders that we can make some decent
margins for the risk businesses that we are in. So look, all in all, we're balanced on the
opportunity, our risk levels will always be matched to the opportunity, nothing's changed
the way we think. And if you do end up in a market that's the best we've ever seen, then
you should expect us to think about capital and all the things you'd expect us to think
about.
