FINAL

Thank you, Ian. Good morning, everyone. [Technical Difficulty] (01:10) group bringing by
combining profitable growth, strong return on equity [Technical Difficulty] (01:18).
Slide 3, let's start with the expansion of the franchise. SCOR delivers excellent growth,
gross written premium, €7.5 billion in the first half of 2017, up 10.1% at constant foreign
exchange compared to H1 2016. This is driven by the strong contribution of our two
business engines, SCOR Global P&C continues to grow its franchise in the U.S. in line with
our Vision in Action strap (01:46) plan. P&C division pursues its selective growth with stable
pricing as witnessed during all of its renewal since the beginning of the year.
SCOR Global Life pursues its expansion in Asia-Pacific for both protection and financial
solutions and continues to deliver a strong track record in UK Longevity reinsurance. SCOR
records a net income of €292 million for the first six months resulting in a 9.1% return on
equity including the impact of the change in Ogden and the reserve release associated
with it, which were fully accounted for in the first quarter of 2017.

Bloomberg Transcript

First half 2017 net income would have stood at €350 million, and our return on equity at
10.9%. Solvency position of the group remained strong at 226%, and remains for the
present time above the optimal range. As announced earlier today, SCOR has
commenced the share buyback program with an amount up to €200 million over the next
24 months.
Buyback reflects the group's confidence in the underlying fundamentals. We can still
finance the present and future growth. We can still finance for increase in dividend. We
demonstrate good profitability and a robust solvency position. This buyback also supports
fact for us value proposition for shareholder remuneration is attractive.
Moving to page 4. I'd like to emphasize that both Life and P&C are performing very well,
and are delivering strong technical profitability in 2017. P&C combined ratio stands at
93.5% and the Life technical margin is at 7.1%. On the investment side, the asset allocation
changes that we implemented in the investment portfolio have been rewarded in terms
of yield, and we are well positioned to take advantage from any upside in interest rate,
especially in the United States.
SCOR Global Investments is delivering a solid return on invested assets of 2.7% for the
quarter, in line with the 2.7% to 3.2% range indicated for the full-year 2017. François will
confirm later on.
Going to page 6, despite a net income of €292 million in H1, shareholders' equity
decreased over the first half of the year to €6.4 billion, and the reduction comes from the
€308 million dividend payment in the second quarter, and a negative $333 million
currency translation adjustment, primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar in the
first half of the year. This translates into a book value per share of €34.09 at the end of
June. Financial leverage stands at 25.2%, marginally above our assumption, but we do
expect it to come back under the 25% level for year-end 2017.

FINAL

Let's move on to page 7, we're in line with our expectations, and SCOR generated
operating cash flows of €328 million for the first half of the year. SCOR Global Life cash
flows have shown some catch-ups since the first quarter as expected, but still reflect
claims payment and retrocession settlement timing differences. Cash flows are expected
to normalize in the second half of 2017. On the SCOR Global P&C side, cash flows
continue to be strong and in line with expectations. The total liquidity of the group stood
at €1.8 billion at June 30, with the rebalancing of the invested assets having commenced.
Now, let me hand it over to Victor, who will give you more details on the P&C results and
the June-July renewal.

Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Thank you, Mark, and good morning. As you can see on slide 8, if you remember the
comments that were made when the Q1 results were published, Q2 and H1 are right in
line with what we had anticipated that would be. On the top line, the rate of growth is
lower than what it was reported at the end of Q1, but it still benefits from the effect of the
large Proportional contracts that were underwritten in the second half of 2016.

Bloomberg Transcript

It is no surprise that this geography of the growth is dominated by the U.S. The three
components of the business being P&C treaties, Specialties and business solutions are
contributing to the growth. Having now gone through the June-July renewals, we can
indicate that the growth for the full year should be in the region of 7% to 8%, however,
with the subjectivity of what the impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the
euro will be.
In the bottom line, at 93.5%, the H1 net combined ratio remains excellent. And as is
illustrated by the normalized net combined ratio and the non-cat net technical ratio, this is
not only thanks to the favorable cap ratio, normalized net combined ratio stands at 94.7%.
The H1 non-cat net technical ratio, which is the sum of the net attritional and the
commission ratio is stable year-on-year when excluding the impact of the change in the
Ogden rate, which was fully taken into account in Q1.
This demonstrate that the quality and the performance of the portfolios are well
managed and maintained. Along the same lines, is also worth mentioning that the net
combined ratio for the first year of Vision in Action, normalize of net cat and Ogden,
stands at 94.5%. In fact, the normalized net combined ratio of Q2 stands at 95.4% is the
reflection of the prudent reserving approach, following the reserve release of Q1 and due
consideration given to the low quarter, low net, to the low quarter net cat.
As far as the June and July renewals are concerned, the main features are shown on slide
9. These renewals have been negotiated in market conditions and have basically stayed
the same since January and April, but for the reinsurance market for casualty lines in the
U.S. at the TS level bottom (08:20). The most noticeable measures have been the
portfolio management actions that were taken in the U.S. within the property segment
and in particular in Florida.

I will now hand over to Paolo for the presentation of the Life.

FINAL

Paolo de Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Thank you, Victor. I'm pleased to report that SCOR Global Life delivered stronger first half
year of 2017, both in terms of premium growth and profitability. We've recorded gross
written premiums of €4.4 billion, representing an increase of 9.7% at constant exchange
rate and 11.9% at current exchange rates. Excellent growth is the result of the positive
business flow across all our product lines, particularly in Asia-Pacific, one of our key areas
of growth of Vision in Action strategic plan, recorded a gross written premium growth of
around 40% (09:13).

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking ahead to the end of 2017, we expect premium growth for the division to
normalize at around 6%, in line with the top end of the Vision in Action annual premium
growth assumption. Technical performance for the first half of the year remains strong,
with technical margin of 7.1%, slightly above Vision in Action. We've been able to deliver
this technical margin, thanks to both the profitability of our new business underwritten in
line with the group profitability target, as well as the healthy performance of the in-force
portfolio.
In addition to the quarter financials, as announced with our press release of July 17, SCOR
signed an agreement with Fédération nationale de la Mutualité Française and Matmut with
a view to the acquisition of 100% of the shares of MutRé. The ratification of the
agreement by MutRé's other shareholders, which represent approximately 15% of
MutRé's capital, is expected in October 2017 at the latest. This acquisition will enable
SCOR to further strengthen its Life and Health offering to the French Mutual insurance
industry. (10:21).
I will now hand over to François de Varenne, CEO of Global Investments for more details
(10:30).

François de Varenne
Thank you, Paolo. Moving on to slide 11. SCOR's total investment portfolio reached €26.7
billion at the end of June, with an invested asset portfolio of €18.3 billion compared to
€19.4 billion at the end of March. This decrease is primarily due to the evolution of the
fixed rate and notably the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, as well as to
some cash outflows including SCOR dividend that happened during the quarter.
After an active phase of portfolio rebalancing executed during the first quarter of 2017,
SCOR Global Investments decided to put temporarily reinvestment on hold during the
second quarter of the year. Indeed, this quarter was masked by a more uncertain
economic and political environment as well as lower level of rates during the most
profitable quarter when compared to superlative levels of sales during the first months of
this year and which enable us to reinvest at very good condition.

FINAL

In that context, our liquidity is slightly reduced at 9% compared to 10% at the end of the
first quarter. Meanwhile, our exposure to government bonds and (11:44) increased by 4
points compared to last quarter, mostly at the expense of our corporate bond portfolio,
down 3 points compared to last quarter.
The duration of the fixed income portfolio was slightly decreased at 4.5 years, stable
compared to end of 2016 levels and slightly below end of March. Our fixed income
portfolio remains at very high quality, with an average rating of A+. At the end of June,
expected cash flows from the fixed income portfolio over the next 24 months stand at
€6.2 billion, which will facilitate the dynamic management of reinvestment policy as market
conditions permits.
SCOR Global Investments delivered a 2.7% return on invested assets in the first six
months of this year. Besides, our income yield continues to increase and stand now at
2.6% for the first six months and the second quarter of 2017, while our reinvestment rate
stands at 2.6% at the end of June 2017. We confirm our 2.7% to 3.2% estimated range for
the full year 2017 according to current market condition. This return should benefit indeed
from realized gains linked to the sale of the mature real estate building that should be
completed before the end of the year.
Finally, let me take the opportunity to remind that SCOR has published its first ESG report
on investments a few weeks ago, which is a further testament of our commitment to our
ESG policy.

With this, I would hand it over to Ian Kelly for the conclusion of this presentation.

{BIO 19976646 <GO>}

Thank you, François. On page 12, you will find the next scheduled events, starting on
September 6 with our Investor Day to be held here in Paris, as well as the conferences
that we are planning to attend for the remainder of 2017.
So with this, we can start the Q&A session and just to remind that (13:48).

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. And we will now take our first question from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca.
Please go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yeah. Sorry. This is Vinit from Mediobanca. I just want to understand two things here,
please. One is the duration of this buyback, which has been in focus this morning. Could
you comment a bit Mark on how you – what was the thinking behind announcing a twoyear frame of reference for this buyback?

FINAL

And second question is just on the normalized combined ratio that was mentioned by
Victor that there was reserve buffer fill-up, if you like, in 2Q, is this the run rate we have to
– we should kind of expect for the rest of the year in the sense of your actions increasing
this reserve or is it nearly then – I'm asking because last year 2Q also had this phenomena,
but then it calmed down in 3Q and 4Q. So I just want to understand. Thank you.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Thank you, Vinit. So on the first question for the buyback duration, I think the 24 months
represents a probably a more conservative figure than we might anticipate actually
executing. I don't see any reason why it couldn't be executed sooner than the full 24
months duration, that gives us some degrees of freedom in case any kind of uncertain
events were to happen in the marketplace. But I would expect something to occur on a
more timely basis with respect to the buyback.
Victor, on the second question for the combined ratio.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, as I said in my comments, we always are in a situation where Q2 is having a very low
net debt ratio or equals to one, during which we've made reserve release. So we've
adopted a pretty prudent approach of the reserving in Q2, and as with that sort of 94.5%,
we are still below 95% on a normalized for H1, but we think that we've done what we had
to do to protect the rest of the year. So for me, the run rate of the portfolio, I would say, is
below 95%.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

Operator
And we can now take our next question (17:02) from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I would have two. The first one is on
the buyback, and I'd like to consider a case where you have normalization in terms of
supply and growth, and what would be in your view, your solvency ratio at the end of this
year because that's the target you have in terms of top line growth. And in 24 months
period, would you still be above 220% in your central scenario? And if the capital
generation is higher than expected today, would you consider increasing this total €200
million, up to €200 million amount? So this is my first question. And the second question
is, François, can you maybe guide us for realized gains going forward, not only 2017, but
for the years to come? Are you expecting something to change on this side? Thank you.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Thanks. I'll ask Frieder to handle the first part on the solvency ratio evolution, and I'll speak
to the level of the capital. Frieder?

A - Frieder Knüpling

FINAL

Okay. Solvency ratios are obviously more volatile than other accounting statistics. So
interest rate movements, market movements in general, other changes (18:31)
assumptions so on make them more volatile. So a one point estimate, I think is difficult,
and it's going to be wrong in any case.
Having said this, the underlying trend of our solvency ratio has been good. In the past two
years, the operating performance and capital generation has been more than sufficient to
fund regular dividends, and the increase in capital requirements.
And as far as market volatility is concerned, the biggest sensitivity of our solvency ratio is
to interest rates, the Group is generally expecting interest rates to increase further. We
are well-positioned to capture this. So, that can provide a further upside. But as I said,
there is going to be some volatility around this on a quarterly basis. But based on
fundamentals, which should support our solvency position and are fully in line with the
buyback program.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

With respect to the €200 million level, that's something we identified firmly in 2017 as the
level of excess capital. We were prepared to address with respect to our share buybacks.
So I don't see that changing with respect to this program. However, 2018 is a whole new
year, so we'll see what happens a year from now with respect to that timeframe. François
de Varenne, would you like to?

Q - Operator
Just a follow-up on this one. I think you said that full year that you wouldn't intend to
remain above 220% Solvency II ratio, is this to look at the range is below 220%, right?

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

We like to remain in the optimal range. However, if we are marginally above, we have to
take into account several factors, not the least of which is the volatility that Frieder spoke
about that we are subject to and then the second thing is the evolution of the business
plan, operating plan for 2018, which could also require additional capital to support it.

Q - Operator
Okay.

A - François de Varenne
On the realized gains, understand that I am confident that we will – we are in the process
of filling a building – mature building in Paris and that the sales should be completed
before the end of this year, which would be more a Q4 event. Going forward, for the next
three years, if you move through slide 39 in the appendix of the presentation, you've got
the annualized gains analysis on our portfolio and you see that we have about €467 million
at the end of June, an increase by an amount of almost €60 million compared at the end

FINAL

of December last year, despite the fact that we took €68 million in the first six months of
gain on this portfolio.
If you look closely, you will see that on the fixed income side, we have, let's say, almost
nothing left, but the significant portion of annualized gains are on equity, real estate, and
other investments so which mean on asset classes where we will take gains when this
recognize the performance and the value creation since inception. So, yes, we have a
significant buffer to maintain our policy to realize gains by the end of the year.

Q - Operator
Thank you.
We can now take our next question from William Hawkins from KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hello. Thank you very much. Mark, sorry, just back on the, the buyback, given that there is
this 24-month time period, and taken what you've said clearly. Are there any fungibility
constraints that you guys have on getting capital into the center, and then distributing it
that we may not have talked about the in the past. We know your Solvency II ratio is very
strong and all the rest of it, but I'm just wondering if one of the reasons you've said
conservative timeline is just related to cash flows around the group. I don't think so, just
checking?
And then secondly, Paolo, your IFRS Life earnings, if we go to – I think you would gain
about a €190 million both first half this year and first half last year on slide 16. Could you
give us a number for what is the impact on your pre-tax IFRS earnings for the new
business you've written this period and first half 2016?

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Will. With respect to the buyback, there aren't any cash flow constraints with
respect to the 24-month period, I think that's more cautiousness in terms of external
events that may impact the group, but I wouldn't read too much into the figure. I think in a
normal situation, you'll see us execute sooner than that. As you know, through the IR Day
presentations that we've had before, the fungibility of the group is really quite good. We
have a strong set of subsidiaries in major countries, advanced economies with strong
currencies, and we have a fairly diligent dividend program internally within the group and
the ability to raise cash is of no concern at all to us at this point.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Sorry to be so bluntly explicit, but when you talk about external events, you're talking
typically about capital markets and large loss rather than anything else, right?

We can now take our next question from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Please go
ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi, there. Three quick questions. First of all for François, your reinvestment rate went up
30 bps in the quarter despite the fact that benchmark yields didn't move, your duration
reduced, your sold corporates and corporate spreads were ever benchmark or in the
ones I look at, all spreads are pretty much tightened 10 basis points to 20 basis points. So
how come your reinvestment rate went up 30 bps, maybe just to clarify was that spot
reinvestment rate and not indicative of the average reinvestment rate over the quarter?
Second question, Mark, you mentioned that you expected the leverage to be below 25%
by the end of the year. I'm assuming that's just because you assumed growth in equity,
and not indicating early redemption of any debt. But maybe on the point of this leverage, I
mean, you're clearly above your targets of Solvency II, but this is the actually constraint
isn't it, the fact that you're kind of at the upper end of your target leverage or is that not
the way to think about it? Thanks.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

François, on the...

A - François de Varenne
So the first question on the reinvestment rates, first, I come back and that's clear on page
11 in footnote 5 on definition of the reinvestment rate. So again, that's the picture as the

FINAL

last day of the quarter of – on the fixed income loans and real estate bucket of
reinvestment rates at – not the duration of the portfolio, but the maturity of the securities
we target especially in the fixed income portfolio.
If you look at the evolution of the 10-year history rate between the end of March and the
end of June, you've an increase of almost 20 basis points almost everywhere, that's the
case in the U.S. That's the case almost 18 basis points in the UK. And in Germany, that's 21
basis points. So you have an increase, if you take just the picture end of March, last day of
March, last day of June on the risk-free component, you have an increase of interest rate
in the magnitude of 15 basis points, 20 basis points depending on the currency. On the
spread, we have almost a stable effect and we have a small duration effect in our
composition, not the duration of the portfolio, but the average maturity of the security we
target.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Sorry, what – you're not investing at the 10-year end and you're not really investing in
governments. So what is the average duration of the new investment and what's the
average rating?

A - François de Varenne
Usually, on the corporate bond side, we target 10-plus years and the same thing on
(28:17). And it will be a little bit longer on agency, yet.

Yes.

A - François de Varenne
On both.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

But as I say, the average reinvestment rate would have been materially lower over the
quarter?

A - François de Varenne
No. Again, this is not an average of the quarter, that's again the future at-market condition
on June 30 compared to March 31.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay, fine.

FINAL

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

So, Andrew, on your second question with respect to the impact of leverage, I do expect
it to reduce below 25% just through the effects of retained earnings that are being
captured or generated from the net income that we expect in the second half of the year.
So that's a normal evolution. I don't look at it as a constraint at all on the buyback. Over
the last 18 months, we've had two significant hybrid issuances that were fairly
opportunistic where we captured coupon rates of 3% and 3.625%. So we secured longterm financing at a very attractive conditions, and that's what elevated the leverage ratio
towards the upper part of that 20% to 25% range. And I think we need 25% to execute
Vision in Action, but because we were able to lock in this kind of opportunistic low-cost
financing, this sets us up real well for the next 10 years. And that's the reason we've put
on a little bit more debt, and I don't view it as a constraint. With respect to calling any debt
or anything like that, there's certainly no announcements for 2017 on the debt front.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. Morning, everyone. Three (29:50) questions. Firstly, on the major renewals. Just give us
an indication where you've grown in the UK (30:01) 11% in EMEA and it's on UK Motor?
And secondly, in terms of the message for Monte Carlo this year and to clients, could you
maybe give us a bit of an information (30:11) on what that would be, whether that's going
to be a continuation of previous year's messages just given the buyback? Thank you.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Victor?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, first of all, the growth of UK you are talking about is in single digit millions or for the
division, it's not going to be material. It's not Motor UK. There is a slight growth in Motor
UK, but it's not there. It's much more on the liability. We have beefed up our underwriting
capabilities in London recently on the liability side and it starts to pay off. So most of the
increase is coming from five or six new contracts on the casualty side in the UK.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

FINAL

On the Monte Carlo message, I think Victor will speak to P&C growth expectations during
the IR Day that's coming up in early September. But overall, we've got strong
fundamentals right now in the business. I think you can see that in the first half technical
metrics for sure. I mean, the growth rate of both Life and P&C is on the higher side of
where we expected the assumption to be, the technical profitability, combined ratio and
technical margin is quite strong, and we were able to absorb the Ogden impact.
I think you would have seen stronger earnings in the second quarter if it wasn't for some
tax anomalies that we had in the distribution of the profitability. We could have very well
been in the €165 million to €170 million range for the quarter-to-date earnings of Q2

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi, there, good morning. Thanks. Just two questions for me. So firstly around the
deployment of liquidity in the investment portfolio. And I know that you've obviously
stopped redeploying the sort of cash and short-term investments, but what needs to
happen from here for further deployment or indeed for you to perhaps increase that
liquidity level? How do you think about the sensitivities?
And secondly, on the Solvency II ratio, I mean, you are saying that you are marginally
above the target range of 226%. I mean, how do you define marginally above? I mean, if
we were looking at 230% today, would you still be marginally above? I'm just trying to get
an idea of the buffer above that 220% that you're thinking about holding. Thank you.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

François?

A - François de Varenne
On the reinvestment of liquidity and the rebalancing of the portfolio to our, let's say, the
Vision in Action illustrative portfolio, we still maintain our roadmap and the redeployment
of this liquidity. But if you look at what we did since last summer, and I will give the full
update during the Investor Day in September, we were very active in September, October
last year. Then we post the rebalancing strategy with the uncertainty of the U.S. election at
the end of the year. We were very active and we locked interesting levels in Q1 due to the
political uncertainty and also the uncertainty on central banks. We post a gain (34:10) in Q2
and we should resume the rebalancing strategy (34:17).

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

On the second question on what is marginally above the optimal range. So, the 226% is
our best estimate right now, second quarter. It does not reflect the impact of share
buyback, and that could be up to five solvency ratio points probably just under that when
it's fully executed. But I think there's a lot of factors that go into the capital management
decision. It's not just what is the number of the solvency ratio, it's also the fundamentals
of the business, what are you going to be doing in the following years in terms of your
operating plan supporting growth, and what are the prospects for volatility from macro
factors. So, if we're in that 220%, 225% range, that's certainly marginal. I don't think that's
going to force a decision just on the basis of that ratio. If we start to approach I think the
230% number, there is clearly more solvency margin at our disposal that we would have
to efficiently use, and if we can't do it, then we are looking at an excess capital decision.
The other point to take into account, we do look at this over a medium-term timeframe.
So, it's not just a one-quarter or a one-year horizon in terms of our capital utilization. So
that's probably something that needs to be taken into consideration when we're talking
about what's marginally above.

FINAL

Yes. Good morning, everybody. I have two questions. My first question is on your tax rate,
and apologies if you commented on it in the beginning, I missed it, then. And could you
comment again on the challenge (36:45) behind this higher tax rate in Q2? My
understanding is that from one side it's coming from the dividend income that you had
generated. But there has been also some one-offs.
And my second question is for François, could you remind us on the realized gains that
you expect to come from this real estate disposable by year end?

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Okay. Frank, on the first part with the tax rate, I think we had two significant drivers. One
was, what we historically have in the second quarter, which is the withholding taxes that
are applicable to the external dividend payment. You'll remember that there is a 3% tax
charge in France for the external dividend. So that's a little over €9 million of P&L effect.
Plus, we also have withholding taxes applicable to the internal dividends that are
generated globally amongst certain subsidiaries. So that on its own is roughly €13 million
to €14 million of tax of – of P&L bottom line tax effect.

Bloomberg Transcript

In addition to that, what we did not expect this quarter was really the geographic
distribution on both Life and P&C of their profitability. We tended to have – just from a big
picture point of view, we tended to have more of our profits in higher tax jurisdictions and
more of our losses in lower tax jurisdictions, which led to this elevated rate of just over
30% for the quarter. So I don't see any of this as reoccurring. And I think the withholding
tax is well known as an annual issue for us, and we'll see how long this 3% tax is
outstanding given some of the recent activity in the legal system and its impact in France.
François, on the gains?

A - François de Varenne
On the gains. Okay. (38:47). So we are in a sale process of a major building in Paris, and
then considering that this sale should be completed before the end of the year and
should be a Q4 impact. And again, going forward, if you look at the appendix on slide 39,
we have a significant buffer of unrealized gains on non-yielding asset classes, such as
equities, real estate and other investments. So I am confident on the fact that we will
maintain a contribution through realized gains through other plans.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Okay. But the magnitude that we saw last year, this could be also the other to expect this
year?

A - François de Varenne
For the full year, I maintain the range 2.7%, 3.2% for the total yield on invested assets
(39:47).

We can now take our next question from Thomas Fossard from HSBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. Two questions for Victor. First question will be on the UK Motor side,
now the situation is starting to stabilize, have you started to engage discussion with your
clients and what could be potentially the opportunity for SCOR is next six to nine months
on the UK Motor? That's first question.
Second question is, I think in your introductory comments, you described the current
situation of the U.S. casualty. Could you just maybe rephrase and elaborate on what is the
situation currently and what's your view going forward? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, I wouldn't say myself that the situation on UK Motor has stabilized. I think everyone is
waiting for the outcome. And the next step which is basically whether or not this minus
0.75% was going to be the situation and was going to be the formula. So I think for the
moment we are still a bit in the uncertainty. Regarding the renewals, I mean, we have
renewed with existing clients. Well, the price increases have been probably putting us in
an equivalent of some realistic 0.5% to 1% equivalent discount rate. So we are not seeing,
of course, the price increases that will put us on the minus 0.75%. But both the size of the
book being what it is, we will continue to have discussions with clients. Most of our clients
are composite clients, they are not motor or monoliners. So those discussions are within
the global relationship and each client then is pretty specific.
Regarding the observation on the casualty on the reinsurance side in the U.S., well, this is
just an observation that is coming from the renewal of June-July where we've seen that
most of the programs have been renewed with no deterioration. And we have seen that
the renewal process has been such that, yes, we are quite convinced that the market is
trying to kind of stop to the deterioration of the terms and conditions, in particular of the
commissions.

Q - Ivan Bokhmat

{BIO 15378004 <GO>}

Hi, just a follow-up on the pricing question. We saw the industry comments of a stronger
decline into high-single-digits on the June-July renewals, mostly concentrated on U.S. Cat.
Page 15 of 21



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2017-07-27

Can you comment across your geographies on, what type of components came into your
minus 0.5% price decline? And where did you see more constructive discussions, and
where they're less helpful? So that's my first question.

FINAL

And the second question is to Paolo, actually. I didn't quite hear your comments on MutRé
, probably my line was bad. Maybe you could, you could comment again on the impact of
SCOR, and what do you expect to gain from that acquisition? Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

I will say that, overall well, if we take the world, I think, the difficulties have been definitely
around Middle East, Africa and Latin America for the most, plus U.S. Cat, and U.S. Cat with
really an emphasis on Florida, and this is where we have done ourselves quite strong
portfolio managements during the June, July renewals, that's what I mentioned in my
comments.
For the rest of the markets, well, I think, the pricing is still on the slight decrease trend. But
we are talking of reduction between zero and minus 2%, minus 3%. But we are no longer
talking of really meaningful decreases.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we think that, overall, I think, we are in for our own portfolio at least in a relatively
stable sort of situation and we are taking step-by-step the measures that are required to
manage the book, when it needs to be. And we've done what we had to in Middle East at
this renewal, unfortunately, because that's an area of the world where we have a very,
very strong track record and history of being a lead market.

Q - Ivan Bokhmat

{BIO 15378004 <GO>}

Would you say that, overall in the past six month the situation for you has deteriorated or
has remained stable on overall pricing?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, I mean, we report minus 0.5% on the weighted average. So whether you call it as
satisfactory or not, I don't think it is satisfactory, and it is marginally negative. But with that
sort of price decreases, while we are able to manage the portfolio, what I see more of
positive myself is the attitude of an increasing number of clients, where the discussions
are going beyond just the existing reinsurance programs, and we see a lot of clients
having real deep thinking on optimization, and capital utilization, and probably also
financing of business, fluidity of cash flow within their own groups.
But that really prompts discussion that are much more interesting and where a
reinsurance company like ourselves, I believe, and basically the deals that we are – have
been doing on structured contracts are proving it, I believe, that we are among the few
that can really entertain that type of discussions with clients, and that is positive, that
allows us to demonstrate differentiation, and that's what we need to be. I mean we need
to be relevant to clients and we need to be able to demonstrate that we are capable to
provide things that others or only a few can provide. So I'd would say, reasonably
optimistic on that front of the discussion.

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Yeah, my comments at the beginning of the call were really related to, what were the
next steps, what was going to happen next. The agreement has to be ratified by the
other shareholders, we expect that to happen as I mentioned during my speech, in
October 2017, at the latest. And at this point, we would expect the acquisition to close at
01/01/2018. Those were my comments are the only words, I said (48:25).

Q - Ivan Bokhmat

{BIO 15378004 <GO>}

Okay. Well, maybe then you can comment on what made this acquisition attractive for
SCOR, and what impact, if anything you would expect to see in the coming years?

A - Paolo de Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

French reinsurance mutual industry it's a very interesting industry, and that's why SCOR
originally invested in MutRé at the end of the 1990s. Situation had been created, whereas
the shareholder structure, we had participated for one-third. Some of the other
shareholders felt that it was not a good place for them to be any longer. And we still
thought business was very interesting for us.
So we decided to purchase it. We believe once the business is fully integrated, it would
be fully accretive for numbers. It is not massive acquisition, you can see the numbers of
MutRé on MutRé website, where you get all details and how big it is.
We already pick up some business (49:33) and probably some business will have to be
evaluated for us for our own (49:39) in terms of the completion, but that will happen
(49:41).

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning from my side as well. I only have two questions. The first one will be
on the reorganization of the subsidiary, something that you've talked about in the past. I
was wondering if you could actually give us some update about the timing and the level of
capital that could be released from this reorganization.

Page 17 of 21



Company N ame: SCOR SE

And then secondly, on the recent weakness of the dollar, I mean, we've seen the impact
on shareholders' equity through OCI, you've talked a bit about what that could potentially
mean for growth going forward. I was wondering if you actually hedge any of your FX risk,
and if we can basically see some kind of offset from the U.S. dollar weakness? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Paris, on the first part with respect to the three SE merger, so this remains on track. We
spoke about this, I think couple of quarters ago. So we've identified approximately €200
million of potential excess capital that comes out of that transaction by merging the three
SE entities that we have in France.
It's targeted for completion in the first quarter of 2019. There's a series of steps that
we're taking from a legal perspective, operational perspective and client perspective over
the next 18 months to secure that. We have to work in approximately 48 jurisdictions to
secure new licenses, branches, and portfolio transfers, which leads to the complexity.

Bloomberg Transcript

However, that's simply a timing issue, I think the amount is still good, and any kind of
decision on that capital level would be made in 2019. On the second piece, the U.S. dollar
weakening has had an effect, you can see that we've had almost a 9% decline over the
first half of the year, so the currency translation adjustment for the group was close to
minus €300 million for the second quarter.
We do hedging of monetary assets and monetary liabilities, but we do not hedge
subsidiary capital, rather we consider that really as a permanent source of capital, and
broadly speaking, it matches the underlying business flow from those countries, so we
have in the U.S., for example, roughly a commensurate level of capital in U.S. dollars
supporting a premium base in U.S. dollars.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hi, thanks for letting me follow-up, didn't expect the call out. Mark, I just wanted to check
at the 1Q stage, there was a lot of talk about SCOR being happy at 200% Solvency II ratio,
and you were very much wanting to operate within your range, that was what I took away
last quarter. I don't think there's been any mention of that this time and most of the
discussion has being anchored about how much you are above the top of the range
instead, so what's changed in terms of that language? Thank you.

FINAL

Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2017-07-27

Well, nothing's changed in the sense of – we still want to operate in the optimal solvency
range. What we said is that, we would feel more comfortable operating in the 200% to
220% level, and so, whether we're at 205%, 215%, you know those figures are fine. It
provides the level of security that our clients expect; it makes our board comfortable with
the execution of the plan and so on. It's not that we're targeting 200%, I think, we'd rather
be in the upper part of the range, and then deal with capital decisions and growth issues,
it certainly gives you more flexibility to be at 220% rather than 200%. But if we did have
some sort of event that took us down to 200%, we would be comfortable at that level as
well.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Just to be clear, if we're talking about managing capital, it is not managing capital to get
down to the top end of your range, it is managing capital to get into your range.

We can now take our next question from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca. Please go
ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Thanks once again for a follow-up question. One question on the FX, and how to
better understand it. There are several moving parts, so I appreciate that, it might be a
tricky question, but I mean, right from solvency, we heard once Frieder say that, the dollar
strengthening had helped the SCR (55:08), today we've heard obviously the FX move in
the asset, which is maybe €600 million, €700 million or something similar, I don't know.
Then there's a €12 million hit on the investment income, and then there's dependency on
the premiums. Mark, have you run a scenario of some sort, which just helps us to
understand that if the dollar weaken from now or even remains where it is, how much is
the hit we should expect, or how should we estimate in your suggestion? Thank you.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

I don't think it will be as material as you might think, partially because of the matching, we
do have a slightly more profitability coming from U.S. dollar jurisdictions, simply because a
lot of the corporate overhead is headquartered here in Europe, and so, there's a larger
euro expense base.
So you can take sensitivity analysis on FX rates on profitability as really a function of that,
assuming you have a normal claims distribution, but it's not really that much of a
Page 19 of 21

meaningful movement in terms of rising USD or strengthening euro.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. But it was on the investment income and an important number or it's not for that?

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Yeah. I think just to give you some figures. So if we had, I mean, U.S. dollar is clearly the
biggest impact that we have of all the other currencies we deal with. But a 10% movement
either direction in the U.S. dollar from a balance sheet perspective is going to give us
approximately a €350 million impact at this point in time, either direction. And on the net
income side, you're looking at something similar, so a €35 million FX impact, plus or minus
depending on the movement of rates.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

The €35 million for 10% for net income?

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}
