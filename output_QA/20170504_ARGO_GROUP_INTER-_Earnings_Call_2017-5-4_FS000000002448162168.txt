Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Argo Group's 2017 first
quarter earnings conference call.
Beginning in 2017, we had two significant changes in our reported results. First, we closed
the Ariel Re transaction and have two months of results included in our first quarter
numbers. Second, we changed our reporting structure to better align reported results
with the way we're managing our businesses and thinking about our operating structure.
Going forward, we think that reporting our results in the way we run the company is more
appropriate, which is by our U.S. Operations and our International Operations. Please note
that International is defined as where we underwrite risk, not necessarily where the risk
resides.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, getting to a few numbers. After the market closed yesterday, Argo reported net
income of a $1.19 per share for the first quarter of 2017, up nearly 34% from the prior year
and a return on average equity of 8.1%. For the past four years, our return on equity has
averaged 9.7%. Adjusted operating earnings for the first quarter of 2017 of $21.9 million, or
$0.71 per share was down from the same period in 2016, primarily due to some nonrecurring items that Jay will go into further detail in his commentary.
Like others, this includes the charge for Ogden. These charges do not reflect our
underlying business and we feel good to be continuing the momentum of 2016 and the
current year. We ended the quarter with book value of $60.84 per share, an 8.5% increase
from March 31, 2016, and a 10.1% increase when you take dividends paid into
consideration.
As I have discussed on these calls and in our meetings, we consider the compounded
annual growth rate of book value per share as the measure that most clearly
demonstrates value creation for our shareholders. For the last 15 years including dividends
paid the compounded annual growth and book value per share has been 10%.
These results demonstrate the continuous improvements we've made to the company.
It's been quite a busy few months with the closing of the Ariel Re transaction, and once
again I want to take the opportunity to welcome all of our new employees to the Argo
team. We're making good progress on integration and I want to thank everyone for all
their efforts to-date.
Having said that, I think we'll have a lot more to talk about at the end of the second
quarter.

FINAL

In our U.S. Operations over the last few years Kevin Rehnberg and his team have done an
outstanding job of evaluating and building this business and bringing on new additions to
our leadership team. Our U.S. Operations reported a 16.5% increase in gross written
premiums in the quarter to $335 million.
While all core of our reported business lines within the unit grew versus the 2016 first
quarter, the strongest growth was in our liability lines mainly programs, Rockwood and
Trident followed by property. In terms of premium rates in most of our business lines
they're headed in the right direction. Unfortunately, just not as fast as, we'd like to see.
On an overall basis in the quarter rates were up a little over 1% on our U.S. book. The first
quarter of 2017 loss ratio excluding cat losses and reserve development was 57.6% versus
56.2% reported in the first quarter, mainly from higher attritional losses in our property
lines from the few discrete claims including one fire claim that was for about $2 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

We continue to implement and utilize new technologies that help us better analyze and
select risk. As our digital and underwriting teams collaborate to improve the overall
underwriting process, it reduces the cycle time to quote, so we can respond to more
opportunities and underwriters have more time to focus on new business with the highest
probability of success.
To give you one example where the improvement in technology is working really well for
us is in our U.S. casualty business. By working with our clients, we've incorporated their
feedback to improve our process of responding to the 90,000 or so submissions we
receive annually, resulting in a reduction in cycle time of underwriting a policy from 10 days
to 2 days. Ann an increase in monthly quotes from 700 to more than double at 1,600.
With these types of initiatives, we'll demonstrate profitable growth rate at all phases
(06:41) of the underwriting cycle we believe.
If you're wondering why premium isn't growing faster, well with all of this ease of doing
business for our customers, it's because the market is even more competitive today than
it was a year ago, if you can imagine that.
Moving on to talk about our International Operations including London, Bermuda, Latin
America and now Ariel Re. These are being run by Jose Hernandez. As I mentioned on
our last call, Jose has considerable expertise in building and running successful operations
in several countries around the globe. Under Jose's leadership, these businesses are
collaborating to drive the growth globally. In the first quarter of 2017, gross written
premiums were up 13.5% primarily driven by the acquisition of Ariel Re in both our
property and specialty lines.
The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserved development was
54.7% compared to 54.5% in 2016 or relatively flat. Market competition remains fierce in
London market particularly Lloyd's, it's probably the toughest market in the last two
decades.

FINAL

In addition to price competition, the cost of acquiring business continues to rise. In my
opinion, at some point, the market as a whole will have to ask itself, is enough, enough? In
the meantime, our relationships inside the market deepened over time by collaboration,
solid underwriting and outstanding service should see us through with our profitable
partnerships.
Now turning to investments, Argo's first quarter return was 1.5% versus 1.2% in the first
quarter of 2016. Our core bond portfolio was up 0.8% and our capital appreciation
portfolio was up 3.6%, which continues the trend we experienced in 2016. Our reported
net investment income was $30.5 million for the first quarter, $9million higher than the first
quarter of 2016, and $5 million higher sequentially. Alternatives at $8.3 million in the
quarter made up most of the increase both year-over-year and sequentially.
As a reminder, we expect the alternative contribution to be lumpy by quarter as can be
seen in the table provided in our press release.

Bloomberg Transcript

During the first quarter, the strongest asset class performers were global equities and
emerging market debt. However, most of our asset classes held up reasonably well.
Recently, we began rebalancing our portfolio by trimming some of our risk exposure in
equities and high yield debt as the risk-reward becomes less compelling. And our risk
portfolio return has grown at over four times the pace of our core bond portfolio, which I
guess I would consider a high-class challenge.
We've talked a lot about in the past about capital management. This quarter, we did not
repurchase any shares as one of our uses of capital is to have it available for opportunities
as they arise, as we did with the closing of Ariel Re transaction.
Having said that, we did increase our quarterly dividend by 23% at our February 2017
board meeting. And I should point out that over the last six years, through share
repurchases and dividends, we've returned over a $0.5 billion in capital and repurchased
32% of the shares outstanding of the company.
With that, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Underwriting Officer, Axel Schmidt. Axel?

Axel Schmidt

{BIO 19499069 <GO>}

Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark mentioned, it has been a busy
few months. Through the first quarter of 2017, we have grown gross written premiums
compared to first quarter 2016 in all of our major lines of business. About 44% of our first
quarter GWP across group to generate some cash (10:44) products, we continue to
benefit from having a diverse spread of products across our major lines of business. In
fact, across the group, in Q1 2017, we were able to achieve a marginal increase in
premium rates. We maintain our proactive approach to managing the portfolio across the
cycle.
As key aspect of this is to ensure that we keep our underwriting discipline and we
underwrite for profit and not for volume. I'm pleased to comment that our underwriters
Page 4 of 11



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2017-05-04

continue to demonstrate this philosophy across all geographies. In those areas of the
portfolio that are more challenging, we seek to drive rate increases where appropriate or
address the issues by other underwriting actions.

FINAL

Where we see opportunities, we make investments in underwriting teams and
underwriting systems.
In professional lines, our first globally managed line of business, we strengthened our
offering. We added experienced leaders to our underwriting teams in Europe and U.S.
The teams across all geographies collaborate effectively to generate new opportunities,
such as our transactional liability risk program in the U.S.
Cyber is another area where we see significant market opportunities. In the first quarter
of 2017, our syndicated loans to cyber product, our dedicated expertise in London
complements our existing expertise both in the U.S. and Bermuda. And with our global
approach to cyber, we further leverage our expertise across all platforms to deploy our
capacity effectively. In the U.S., we have also built out our surety offering by introducing a
broader contract surety product where the team has made a couple of key hires as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, as Mark mentioned, we have made substantial strides to implement and utilize
new technologies, to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of underwritings across the
globe. Another area that this is significant is in our Brazilian (12:50) operation where nearly
40% of our business is now transacted digitally.
With that, I'll hand over to Jay Bullock to add some more commentary to our financial
results.

Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Thanks Axel and good morning everyone. I'll provide some detail on the financials and
then, open it up to questions.
As Mark highlighted and Axel discussed, we've made changes to our segment reporting
this quarter that reflect a simplification of our management structure, and we hope to
give investors a clear understanding of our business fundamentals. In this and future
releases, we will discuss our business in two reportable operating segments with detail
based on product lines relating to the underlying events.
As in the past, our consolidated results will include any impact from our run-off unit, as well
as expenses, now otherwise allocated to the business units. Additionally, as noted our
acquisition of Ariel closed in February and as a result the quarter reflects two months of
operations for the business.
As a significant portion of this business is written at January 1, the gross results do not
reflect the business written by Ariel in the quarter. Total gross written premiums for the

Page 5 of 11

Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2017-05-04

quarter for Ariel Re were approximately $125 million with approximately $30 million of
gross written premiums included in the two-month results.

FINAL

As we noted in a press release a few weeks ago, we did have some non-recurring items
in the quarter that impacted both our reported loss and expense ratio, while these
numbers are included in operating earnings, they do not reflect the underlying profitability
of the business.
Firstly, impact of prior year results on the loss ratio. We continue to benefit from positive
reserve development in our U.S. Operations. The $5.2 million of positive reserve
development was driven primarily by releases in our casualty and workers' comp lines.
And while reported development in our international segment was negative, the result
was impacted by $4.5 million related to the Ogden rate change in the UK and by
additional claims of approximately $5 million from Hurricane Matthew.

Bloomberg Transcript

Excluding these two items the development in the International business was slightly
positive and for the group overall very much in line with last year's first quarter result.
Catastrophe losses in the quarter were $1.8 million, compared to $3.3 million in the first
quarter of 2016. Losses in this year's quarter are primarily from U.S. storms and Cyclone
Debbie.
On the expense ratio, there are really three items that impacted results. The first is onetime cost related to the Ariel Re transaction of $2.5 million, primarily related to
professional fees. The second is $4 million of cost for restructuring and transitioning
certain infrastructure and technology services to outside third-party managers. We expect
this work to enhance our platform stability and lay the groundwork for further operating
efficiencies.
Finally, during the quarter we saw a meaningful increase in the stock price and recorded
approximately $1.5 million of expense related to equity compensation above what we
would have expected. Excluding these items, the expense ratio was 38.4%, compared to
38.5% in the 2016 quarter.
For the first quarter of 2017, the effective tax rate for the group was 14% versus our base
assumption of 20%. The lower than expected rate was mainly due to a higher proportion
of earnings from our Bermuda operations.
Finally on the balance sheet, as we mentioned, we've recently closed the acquisition of
Ariel Re, the acquisition was funded with cash on hand and a $125 million term loan. This is
reflected on the balance sheet under other indebtedness. In addition, we assumed $84
million of junior subordinated debt with Ariel Re acquisition. This debt is structurally very
similar to the trust preferreds we have on our balance sheet and offer some useful capital
advantages.
We ended the quarter with a pre-tax unrealized embedded gain of $131 million, compared
to a $116 million at December 31. Majority of gains relate to our equity holdings, our fixed

Page 6 of 11

income holdings remain very short in duration and the carrying value currently
approximates market value.

FINAL

Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks, we're now ready to take any questions.
Operator?

Q&A
Operator
Okay. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from
Arash Soleimani of KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. How – just going forward, how should we think about your net to
gross ratio. I mean, to what extent are you increasing or decreasing your use of retro?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

So, right now, I don't – we've been pretty consistent, well let me rephrase that, within a
couple of percentage points. I don't see that changing for the next few quarters as we
think about our capital structure for 2018, we may make some changes, we'll probably
highlight those in the November call. I say that Arash because our cat months were issued
on a multi-yeared basis and they expire at the end of this year. So, we'll be rethinking how
we want to use the capital markets to support our property cat underwriting program in
2018.
But other than that, I think the difference between gross and net will remain fairly
consistent depending upon reinsurance pricing and insurance pricing, but I don't expect
too much of a change between gross and net other than supporting our cat program.

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. And the other question I had, I don't know if this was mentioned in the
prepared remarks. But did you say, what specifically drove the strong performance in
alternatives?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

I think, it was just – it was across the board in all of our hedged strategies. Most of them
are credit you may recall. And we also did, I think, pretty well in some of our high-yield
portfolio which I also mentioned, we had sold off a part of it.

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much for the answers.

Operator
The next question comes from Jeff Schmitt of William Blair. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everyone. Question on the expense ratio in the U.S. Operations, it look
to be up a fair amount the 35%, or the transition – I guess $4 million for transition of IT
functions did that fall in there?

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

That was – those costs were retained at the holding company. What you see in the U.S.
Operation in the first quarter of 2016, we've divested off a portion of our non-risk bearing
business, so there is a gain on sale of about $1.5 million related to that. As Axel mentioned
we've made some few key strategic hires in areas like professional liability and surety that
also was reflected in the first quarter. So, I actually expect that number to come down a
bit, of course, that gain in the first quarter of 2016 was a one-time item. But I do expect to
see that number start to trend down as our premium starts to pick up reflecting those
new hires.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Yeah. In addition to that, some of the IT did flow through there, it's a little over a $1 million
and earlier Jay mentioned that – that with our share price moving up in the quarter that we
had more equity compensation expense than we intended and that was over $1 million for
the syndicate as well. When you add them all up that get you to a couple of points on the
expense ratio.

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Sorry, that was a more than a $1 million for the U.S.

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

For syndicate, yeah.

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Sorry, for the U.S.

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Page 8 of 11



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2017-05-04

Yeah, yeah. And then looking at the consolidated underwriting acquisition cost, it look to
be about $19 million higher than if you just add the two segments, $6.5 million one-time
cost which you showed one cost, which you showed, but that remaining $12 million, how
much of that was incentive comp versus I guess what else was in there?

FINAL

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Well, there is $3 million related to the incentive comp. There is a $1 million of IT that Mark
mentioned. You have to take into account the $1.5 million gain from last year, I'm not sure
what that gets us to now, fairly, fairly close. So, those are sort of the big identifiable items.
As I mentioned, there is a small impact from of the new people coming on board. But as I
said, we expect to see the earned premium pickup related to that.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Okay. And then, one quick question on losses in the U.S. segment. We're seeing accident
year loss ratio has moved up, 100 basis points to 150 basis points for a lot of competitors,
but it looks like yours was mainly driven by a property loss. Could you maybe talk about
loss trends, are you seeing any uptick in loss cost?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Yeah. Well let me start, and then I'll let Axel jump in. If you look at the trends of our
portfolio over the last four years now, I think you've seen a pretty steady improvement in
loss ratio, as we've rebalanced our portfolio, Axel, mentioned to that earlier actually. Loss
cost trends haven't really changed too much. I think that for our portfolio to move around
100 basis points here or there from one quarter to another doesn't worry me too much,
as we continue moving around the balance of our portfolio. Axel, do you want to add
anything to that?

A - Axel Schmidt

{BIO 19499069 <GO>}

Yeah. Kind of few things. Thank you, Mark. I think the really critical is that particularly with
regards to attritional losses that as we both Mark and I and Jay mentioned earlier, our rate
level has not gone further down. So, that's slightly up it's one good thing in terms of
operational loss ratio exposure.
Secondly, we have that same, I think very effective reinsurance program in place across
the board for the larger losses. And then if I compare our loss ratio Q1 to plan, we are
doing about 1.5 points better than planned. So, I'm pretty much and I see that, that's
going to continue over next quarter that we're in line, better this plan based on all the
actions and initiatives and mitigating actions we put in place. So, I'm comfortable that, we
will not be negatively surprised by loss trends.

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Yeah, let me say one – let me just say one last thing, notwithstanding the growth in our
P&L over the last few years, it's still, I find it's surprising to be honest that, that when we
have a $2 million or $3 million loss, it still impacts the quarter in terms of attritional losses.
So, it's – there is still a little bit of lumpiness to that sometimes.

We have a follow-up question from Arash Soleimani of KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

Thanks. Just wanted to follow-up on the loss cost trends. I was going to ask, I know on a
couple of previous calls, there were comments about, I guess, the plaintiff's attorneys
being more aggressive, and higher jury awards coming through, are you seeing any of
that in your book?

A - Mark E. Watson

No, not really.

This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference
back over to Mr. Watson for closing remarks.

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

All right. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. I know, it's a busy day, a busy week
and a busy couple of weeks actually with everyone reporting. I think, we'll have a lot more
to talk about at the end of the second quarter, particularly what things look like for 2018
and also I think, we'll have made a little more progress in the integration of Ariel into our
organization.
So, thank you again for everyone being on the call today. And I look forward to talking to
you again at the end of the second quarter. Operator, that concludes our remarks.
