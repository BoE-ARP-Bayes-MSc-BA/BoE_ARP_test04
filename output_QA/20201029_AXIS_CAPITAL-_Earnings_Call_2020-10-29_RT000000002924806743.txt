conference call.

Bloomberg Transcript

This has been a year of two stories for AXIS, one of exceptional catastrophe activity, but
also one, where our repositioning over the past few years, which continues into 2020 is
delivering demonstrably strong positive impact. First and foremost, our hearts go out to
all who've been impacted by the pandemic, storms, wildfires and other calamities.
We're committed to delivering on the promise we've made to our customers. To standby
them in times of need with our industry-leading claim service. On a reported basis, this
has been one of our more challenging years with the combined ratio of 150 on the
quarter and 110 for the year-to-date. The reasons are evident to all of us all of us. We're
experiencing the impacts from the global COVID-19 pandemic, and this was compounded
by a highly active year in terms of natural catastrophes. Indeed, with storms data 2020
has matched 2005's record in the number of named storms.
Our cat losses in the quarter were $240 million or 22 points. Whether year-to-date, we've
recognized $576 million in combined cat and COVID losses, contributing 18 points to our
year-to-date combined ratio. On the other hand, it's also a year of undeniable progress
for Axis. Our ex-cat combined ratio at 92.4 for both the quarter and the year-to-date, is
clear evidence that our repositioning is delivering tangible results. It's a five-point
improvement over the prior year, continuing the positive trends that we've been saying
for several quarters. On ex-cat basis, we're seeing improvement in almost every line.
Even in our property and catastrophe lines, our recent risk and volatility reduction activities
have served us well. By way of illustration, in 2018 industry cat losses were about $71 billion
and we lost 9.6% of common equity to cats. Last year, industry cat losses were about $50
billion and we lost 8.3% of common equity to cats. This year, we estimate year-to-date
industry cat losses at about $65 billion, excluding COVID. And while industry cat losses are
close to 30% higher than the full year 2019. Our common equity loss to cat this year was

Page 2 of 21

FINAL

down to 7.1%. Even if we had no further cat losses in the fourth quarter, that would make
2020 the fifth worst year for our industry cat losses in the history of our company.
However, in terms of common equity loss to cats 2020 would rank only 10th. This
improvement is primarily due to the ongoing reduction of our catastrophe related
exposures. Most recently, in the frequency end of the curve. While this naturally impacts
our overall premium growth, we believe it comes with a benefit of a stronger portfolio
that delivers both superior profitability and lower volatility.
We're confident that our improving trend can be sustained, as we were rigorously pushing
for improved pricing and growing where rates, terms and conditions are adequate. But
also continuing to exercise discipline and strengthening, reducing or exiting books of
business that do not offer sufficient profit potential.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our industry segment grew gross premiums written by 5% and we saw strong rate
increases as well as significant amounts of new business growth. This was offset by
actions we took to prune our portfolio, coupled with headwinds we faced due to the
economic climate. All in, we're confident that we're growing where we should be and
taking disciplined actions where necessary.
Our reinsurance segment had 23% reduction in gross premiums written in a lower volume
quarter. This is the continuation of the repositioning we've been reporting to you since the
beginning of this year, accentuated by some timing issues and premium adjustments. On
a year-to-date basis, reinsurance GPW was down 12% in line with the 10% reduction that
we reported in the six month period. Peter will speak more about the movements by line
in this report.
But before I pass the floor onto Peter, I want to highlight that we are effectively executing
on the COVID-19 technical response plan that we shared with you earlier in the year. You
will recall the plan had three operating priorities; the first, was the stand up the
organization to sustain operating capabilities and clients centricity. Our staff and IT team
have responded superbly and our customers are telling us that we haven't missed a beat.
We're receiving and processing more submissions and binding more policies this year,
even as a remote work conditions, a testament to the agility of our team.
The second operating priority was to minimize the downside. This was reflected in lower
PMLs across the curve and increasing our underwriting guidelines to reduce exposure to
industries that were most likely to be affected by the pandemic or its economic impact. A
material reduction in our credit lines is a natural consequence of these actions.
And the third operating priority is to prepare AXIS to participate strongly in the recovery,
and we're well on our way to doing just that, identifying and adding resources to lines and
markets where we expect attractive conditions. All the while, we remain on the sidelines
or continue to improve books that are not yet providing the desired results.
As I'll discussed later when I report on market conditions, this is a firming but not a hard
market. Lower levels of favorable development, social inflation, the pandemic, more

FINAL

frequent natural catastrophes and lower interest rates drive the need for substantial price
increases. And in many lines, it may take increases beyond 2021 before we reach
adequate the risk-adjusted returns. This remains and underwriters market. There are
excellent opportunities out there, but there are still many unattractive lines and markets to
be avoided.
With a strength of our talent our positioning in the markets showing the most impressive
corrections and our relationships with our producers and customers, we're confident that
AXIS is well placed to make the most of the attractive opportunities and to continue to
improve our book of business and results, as we build a global leader in specialty risks.
I'll now pass the floor to Pete, who will walk us through the financials. And I'll come back to
talk more about pricing and I'll have our Q&A.
Pete.

Thank you, Albert. And good morning, everyone. As Albert noted in his comments, this
was a challenging quarter for the company, but it also included strong core underwriting
results. During the quarter, we incurred a net loss attributable to common shareholders of
$73 million and operating loss of $65 million. High catastrophe and weather-related losses
overshadow the core underwriting results that continue to show improvement. The
company produced a current accident year combined ratio, ex-cat and weather of 92.4%,
which was a more than 5 point improvement over the prior year quarter.
As previously announced, the quarter pre-tax cat and weather-related losses, net of
reinstatement premiums were $240 million or 22.2 points, primarily attributable to
hurricanes Laura and Sally, the Midwest derecho, wildfires across the West Coast of the
United States, the Beirut port explosion and other weather events.
I'll provide a bit more color on a couple of these events. Hurricanes Laura and Sally were
combined $120 million event for us. Predominantly in insurance event, where we
experienced approximately $100 million of insurance losses versus $20 million of
reinsurance losses. The Midwest derecho was only an insurance event for us and
contributed $45 million to our cat losses in the quarter.
In the quarter, we kept our COVID-19 loss estimates steady at $235 million. As a reminder,
the COVID-19 loss provision is associated with property, event cancellation, A&H and
pandemic coverages. And as of September 30, the vast majority of the loss provision is
still IBNR, and the paid amount is de minimis.
During the quarter, the FCA test case ruling was decided. We took this information into
account as well as other data, as we continue to monitor the level of our COVID loss
provisions. While there was some movement between subclasses of business, we remain
comfortable with the overall loss provision. I would remind everyone that COVID is an

FINAL

ongoing situation and we will continue to rigorously and carefully monitor developments
across all lines of business and establish reserves if and when appropriate.
Moving into the details of the group level. During the third quarter, we continue to see
improvement in our underwriting results. Our current accident year combined ratio ex-cat
and whether decreased by over 5 points as the repositioning of the portfolios in both
segments starts to earn through. The consolidated accident year loss ratio ex-cat and
weather at 58.5%, a decrease of over 3 points with improvement attributable to both
segments.
We reported essentially no net favorable prior-year reserve development in the quarter.
We observed adverse loss experience in our liability and professional lines. And this was
offset by favorable releases and some of our short tail lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

In these times of social inflation COVID and economic uncertainties, we believe it is
appropriate to maintain a prudent approach to our reserves and to stay consistent with
our strategy which is to take bad news early and good news only after it has been
confirmed.
The consolidated acquisition cost ratio was 21.1, a decrease of 1.4 points compared to the
third quarter 2019. And again, this was attributable to both segments. The consolidated
G&A expense ratio was 12.8, a decrease of 0.6 point compared to the third quarter of
2019. The total general and administrative expenses decreased by $18 million. As we have
discussed in previous quarters, due to the pandemic, we continue to experience lower
run rate expenses in a number of areas. The temporarily lower run rate is helping our G&A
ratio by about 1 point this quarter.
Moving onto fee income from strategic capital partners, this was $16 million for the
quarter, compared to $18 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease is due to lower
profit commissions.
We'll now discuss the segments. Let me start with Insurance. During the quarter, our
current accident year combined ratio ex-cat and weather for insurance decreased by over
7 points, as a repeat positioning our portfolio continue to earn through.
Insurance segment reported an increase of gross premiums written $41 million or 5% for
the third quarter. The increased principally came from good growth and professional lines,
accident and health, and aviation largely attributable to new business and favorable rate
changes. This was partially offset by decreases in liability, marine, credit and political risk,
due to less opportunities, driven by the economic climate as well as the run off of our
discontinued line.
The current accident year loss ratio ex-cat weather decreased by 3.5 points in the quarter,
compared to the third quarter of 2019. This was due to the impact of favorable pricing
over lost trends as well as the improved loss experience in the short tail lines, largely
associated with the repositioning of the portfolio and the exit from certain product lines.
With respect to the longer tail lines, notably, professional lines and liability, given the

FINAL

uncertainty of the current situation we are currently not reflected the majority of excess
rate over trend pricing in our expected loss ratios.
Let's now move onto the reinsurance segment. During the quarter, our accident year
combined ratio ex-cat and weather decreased by 2.7 points, again, as we've reposition
this portfolio and it continues to earn through. Reinsurance segment gross premiums
written of $395 million for the third quarter was $116 million lower in the same period in
the prior year.
The third quarter is a lower GPW quarter for the reinsurance segment, typically
representing only 15% of your reinsurance gross premiums written in the year. This year
the quarterly gross premiums written was impacted by our decision earlier in the year to
exit the Middle East accident and health business, and the engineering line of business,
which we believe have a positive impact on the bottom line results.
In addition, gross premiums written decreased in motor lines due to premium
adjustments and other timing effects. As we look year-to-date, the reinsurance gross
premiums written is down 12%, and this is consistent with a trend we've seen earlier this
year as we rebalance our book with lower catastrophe, agriculture and credit insured ebusiness.

Bloomberg Transcript

The current accident year loss ratio excluding catastrophe and weather-related losses
decreased by over 2 points in the third quarter compared to the same period in 2019. This
was principally due to changes in business mix and improved performance in aviation,
professional lines and liability lines.
Net investment income were $102 million for the quarter, was $14 million lower than the
third quarter 2019, primarily due to the decrease in yields. Sequentially, we had a bit of a
rebound in our alternative portfolio in the quarter as it produced $25 million of net
investment income.
Our current book yield is 2.3% and our new money yield is 1.4%. The duration of our
portfolio continues to be approximately 3.4 years. Diluted book value per share
decreased by $0.34 in the quarter to $54.75, this is primarily driven by the net loss and
common dividends declared, partially offset by net unrealized gains.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Albert.

Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Pete. Let's do a brief overview on market conditions and outlook, and then
we'll open the call for questions. We continue to see acceleration across virtually every
line of business that we write. With insurance, we saw average rate increases of more
than more than 16% across the book in the third quarter. This compares to about 15% of
the second quarter, 10% in the first quarter of this year, and 8% in the third quarter of
2019.

FINAL

Through the first nine months, the average rate increase was a little more than 13%.
That's more than double the average increase in the first nine months of last year. In our
U.S. division, we saw average rate increases of more than 16%. Within that, excess
casualty reported average rate increases in excess of 25%, while primary casualty
averaged over 15%. E&S property rates were up almost 20%. And our U.S. programs
business, which focuses on homogeneous books of smaller accounts saw increases of
about 6%.
Moving on to our North American professional lines division, pricing they're also continued
to accelerate, and weights were up by close to 17% in the quarter. Our commercial
management solutions unit, average rate increases of over 35%. We saw particularly
strong great action across public D&O, where we're essentially an excess writer at more
than 55%. In addition, private equity was up more than 40%, and privately held companies
up more than 30%. In addition, we're seeing great increase of about 25% in our Canadian
specialty business, and 20% for Bermuda AXIS. Within cyber and tech we saw 6%
improvement, as rates are now rising to reflect increased claims related to ransom-ware
among others.

Bloomberg Transcript

Accident and health was essentially flat on low volume this quarter. In our London-based
international insurance division, rates were up close to 17% on average in the quarter.
Renewable energy where we're a global market leader was up more than 35%.
Professional and casualty lines were up over 20%. And aviation is finally correcting with
pricing well over 55% in the quarter.
Our London marine, political risks and property books, averaged a bit shy of 10%, held
back a bit by terrorism and offshore energy. Within that group though, marine cargo
continues to outperform and was up almost 25%, at the global property, which was up
close to 20%. Overall, in the quarter, 97% of our total insurance business renewed flat to
up. More than half of the premiums experienced rate increases in excess of 10%. And
within that, over 30% of the book had rate increases in excess of 20%.
Let's move on to reinsurance. There we're seeing encouraging signs of firming. Although,
not quite as high as insurance, with the understanding, of course, that are meaningful
variances by market. Our year-to-date average rate increase and reinsurance is about 8%.
And here too, we saw encouraging acceleration from lower levels at January 1, to about
double-digits on average as the years developed. Catastrophe and some specialty lines
including liability are in double-digits. Other than those lines, the U.S. and global specialty
markets are seeing the strongest rate increases with EMEA and Asia lagging behind.
Nevertheless, while we see pricing and conditions starting to respond to large trends and
reinsurance, we believe they are not yet making up for much lower interest rates. Leading
to less attractive total returns in some lines, we responded appropriately by reducing our
participation in certainties and markets. Although, we're optimistic that conditions going
into 2021, will provide opportunities to grow across a number of lines and markets.
Overall, across both insurance and reinsurance markets, we are seeing some impressive
numbers in terms of rate change. That said, I cautioned that with the significant increase in

FINAL

the frequency and severity of weather-related events, social inflation, the uncertainties
stemming from the COVID pandemic and significantly lower interest rates, current pricing
is approaching adequacy, but does not yet translate into stellar ROEs for the industry.
We remain optimistic that we will continue to see progress with the understanding that
more rate action is needed and very likely it'll take increases beyond 2021 in some lines to
get to rate adequacy. At Axis, we're leveraging our hybrid model to access risk across the
globe and a different points of the risk transfer chain. We seek to draw the parts of our
business where we're seeing the best opportunities and create a more balanced and
diversified portfolio of risks, delivering an appropriate risk-adjusted return. We're wellpositions in the lines and markets that are seeing some of the strongest pricing
momentum and are confident that this will accelerate our progress.
We feel well prepared and optimistic for the future. We've delivered meaningful progress
in our portfolio results in recent quarters, and we're confident that we can continue this
price -- this positive momentum through the rigorous execution of our strategy. And with
the favorable pricing environment anticipated to extend into 2021 and beyond, market
conditions are working in our favor. As we look to the year ahead, it feels like all the
pieces are coming into place.
And with that, let's please open the lines for questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)
We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) First question
comes from Yaron Kinar, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, my first question goes to the underlying loss
ratios in both reinsurance and insurance. Clearly, we're seeing significant improvement
year-over-year. I seem to recall that last year you had called out some mid-sized losses.
Are there any such losses in this quarter's results?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes. Hey, Yaron, this is Pete. First, I would like to do one thing before I answer that
question, Matt, hit me on the shoulder. The derecho event in my comments. I just want to
clarify for everybody, we had $45 million of losses on the derecho, and that was all
attributable to reinsurance. Matt, hit me on the shoulder and he told me, I think I said
insurance. So just to clarify for everyone that derecho was just purely a cat on the
reinsurance side. So I just want to clarify that first.

Page 8 of 21

FINAL

And then with regard to your question, yes -- last year in the third quarter was a bit spiky.
Right now we're just looking at all losses as performance. We did have some in this
quarter, but I would say year-over-year, there was about a 2 point delta there. And so
overall, the loss ratios down over 3 points. I'd say about 2 of that's due to that, the rest of
it is good performance.
I would also say that as I mentioned in my comments, especially with regard to insurance,
while we're getting right over trend on the long tail lines. Right now, we're kind of holding
our ELRs, [ph] our book and our loss ratios essentially flat to last year just due to the
uncertainties associated with the current economic climate, as well as COVID and social
inflation. So all in all, we feel really good about the improvement we're seeing in the book,
but about two of the three are associated to large loss. But again, I would look even yearto-date, if we look at our loss ratio year-to-date, it's at like 50 -- it's below 58 for the
company, and that's got a fair amount of those normal puts and takes we get on the large
loss side. And as we've re-underwritten the insurance portfolio, we have brought the
limits down. So we are seeing less of those on an ongoing basis.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Got it. That's very helpful.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

The way that I look at it fundamentally is that I think our year-to-date loss ratio is probably
just a good base. I mean there's so many puts and takes at this point given some of the
possessions that we're taking with regard to the current environment. We think we're in a
good place with the loss ratios we have.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Understood. And then with regards to holding BE [ph] for loss ratios, steady compared to
last year and for long tail lines, certainly prudent in this environment of uncertainty. If you
can maybe give us some color as to how you're thinking about when you cross that
threshold of feeling more comfortable with booking these loss trends -- sorry, the rates
that you're getting over trend. Is it like waiting for a vaccine to be readily available? Is it
getting past the credit cycle? At what point you become more comfortable to release
some of that pent-up margin?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

So there's two components to it, right? One is rate over trend. The second is the fact that
we're seeing just less claims activity right now. The position we're taking is that this lower
claims activity is probably temporary. We'd love it to be true, but I don't think that's a good
basis for reserving. I think that when you look at rate over trends, the rate over trend that
we're earning right now was last year's rate over trend, which you'll recall was more like in
the 8% range. And so we think that given what's happening in this industry, putting it all in
the loss ratio this year, makes perfect sense.
I think obviously as we go into 2021, we're experiencing much higher rate over trend. And
there I think we're going to start reflecting some of that, we're not going to put it all in the
Page 9 of 21



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2020-10-29

loss ratio. And then over time, as we see a little bit of maturity in these lines of business,
we'll take -- we'll start to reflect the positive. But the way I look at it, there's -- no company
has ever been punished for reserving prudently and then releasing afterwards.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

FINAL

Agreed.

Operator
Thank you. Next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Couple here for you. First, Albert, just talk a little bit about if we do get a double-dip here,
if we do get a kind of increase in kind of stay-at-home orders and stuff. What kind of the
COVID exposure is here going forward and sort of maybe some additional event
cancellation that kind of could hit? Where should we -- how should we kind of think about
that from that perspective?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think we're in a good place there. Let me just kind of walk you through some of the
numbers. And Pete, feel free to jump in and complement. So obviously, we didn't have a
lot of business that was exposed to the event cancellation. And frankly, we only had one
event, the Olympics. We took a partial reserve against the Olympics. If we get into wave
3, 4, 5, and the Olympics were ultimately to be canceled, obviously, we'd be closer to a
full limit loss on the Olympics, and that full limit is 50 million. And I think we took about a
1/3 of that give or take in the first quarter.
With regard to policies for businesses that are -- that business interruption, obviously, we
were very quick as were a lot of people to immediately change the wordings of our
policies, and in particular, a good bunch of our policies were already in businesses that
were canceled or in the process of being canceled. We believe that today, we have
reduced the number of policies exposed to the COVID lockdowns in the UK by about
70%, simply through the attrition of those policies expiring, not being renewed, and/or
new language being brought in.
In the U.S. frankly, we've always had both physical damage and virus exclusion, except for
a very small number of policies which already reserved for. So by and large, I think we're in
much better shape right now, if there were to be a COVID lockdown. Any more that you
want to add to that, Peter?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

No, I just want to clarify, I think you did at the end there. Brian, I think where we had most
of the exposure this year was in the UK. And that's the area where as that portfolio has
turned over as well as it's just turned over that we've been able to get exclusionary

Page 10 of 21



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2020-10-29

language on renewals as well as other clients that have been non-renewed, so that the
exposure is down about 70%. And we've always felt good about where we are in the U.S.

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That obviously speaks to our insurance book. The reinsurance book is a little bit more
difficult to evaluate, but I would expect that many of our customers would have taken
similar kinds of corrective action. So less able to give you specific numbers there, Brian,
but we think we're in a better place now than we were certainly at the beginning of this
year.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. Two more here quickly. So Pete, I'm just curious, given the difference we're
seeing in new money yields versus your current book yields, is there any way you can kind
of give us some kind of outlook or guidance with respect to investment income pressures
in fixed-income investment --

A - Peter W. Wilson

{BIO 4267902 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. So Brian, I mean we're looking at down to 2.3. You'll see sequentially the rate came
down about two tenths of a point. Again, that was some of the floaters which affect the
LIBOR resetting even lower. LIBOR is so low right now, I don't think that's really going to
go much lower.
So if you look at new money yields are about 1.4 with a three-year duration, I just think the
headwinds there are going to be on the yields, probably at about tenth of a point, a
quarter or so, Brian, unless we can get an uptick back up into the mid-2s on those yields.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. And then last question, Albert, for you. So maybe you could talk a little bit about
where you are with respect to lowering volatility. And the reason I ask is that, look at you
guys, you lost money this quarter and granted it was a big cat-loss quarter. But if you look
a lot of other companies, T&T companies that are reporting, they're also having large cat
losses, but they're actually still making money this quarter. Is there an issue with kind of
scale at AXIS that you maybe need some bigger scale or you still need to reduce
volatility? Maybe give us a perspective on that.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yes. I don't think everybody's reported, number one. Number two, as you know, there are
different kinds of accounting. Some people put all of their changes in the comprehensive
income through their income statement. We don't. So there's a bunch of things. Some
people have taken reserve releases. We've just told you that we think of it in this market,
it's probably not a good idea to take reserve releases. So I'm not sure that things are
comparable to the decimal point. But let me address your question more broadly.
Our goal has been and continues to be to do two things: one, is to increase the
profitability of our non-cat business; and B, to reduce the -- our exposure to the cat

business. And that's exactly what we're doing. I gave you some statistics in the early part
of the presentation about how we're much less exposed this year than we were last year
than the years before that, and we will continue to do that. We were explicit in telling
everybody, we are not going to be increasing PMLs into 2021, as -- even with the market
growing there. So that would be the first thing.
The second thing is making sure that our non-cat business contributes a bigger piece of
profitability. And there, I'm feeling really good about our trends. And obviously, this is not
a number that we're going to be reporting on a regular basis. But when I look at the ROE
of this company ex-cat, which is just for the --just for our own analysis of the drag of cat.
Our ex-cat ROE in the third quarter was up over 230 basis points. So the two parts of our
strategy, increase the profitability of your overall non-cat business. We're making great
progress, you see that in the improvement in the ex-cat. Combined ratio, where we're
seeing that the improvement in the ex-cat ROE. And then secondly, continuing to reduce
the volatility through more intelligent portfolio construction. And net-net, simply reducing
the amount of cat exposed business that we have, the net of which is going to be a
better result. I absolutely, I'm convinced that scale is not the issue, it's just continuing to
work on the two levers I've just discussed.

Thank you. The next question comes from Meyer Shields, KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great. Thanks. Good morning, all. I guess, the biggest -- big picture question is, when
should we expect the heightened level of portfolio reshaping to be done? And maybe a
simpler way of stating that is given the pricing environment, should we expect overall topline growth in 2021?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, the answer is absolutely we should expect overall top-line growth in 2021. I think that
fundamentally, we feel that all of the big blocks of our repositioning are done. I mean,
we're earning through it, if you would, this year as we're writing it. Cancelled a number of
producer relationships and so on in January 1, which are running through the year, and so
on and so forth.
I think from now on, it's really about optimizing the portfolio. And as I've discussed with
you earlier, we think that there are a number of areas that are not yet reflecting all of the
headwinds that we've talked about and in particular interest rates. If we have lines of
business in 2021, that are not appropriately responding and not giving us adequate
returns, obviously, we will not look to grow those. But if those lines of business are giving
us the returns that we want, then we're open to growth, and just about every line, subject
Page 12 of 21

of course to managing the overall volatility of our book of business. Anything you want to
add to that, Peter?

FINAL

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

The only I'd say is, Mayer, you're spot on there. I think as I look, especially at insurance
where we did a fair amount through the course of 2019 of shedding some business, they
had a headwind of about 2.5 points just due to discontinued businesses. That will really be
gone this year. So there'll be a little bit more of an impact, a headwind in the fourth
quarter. But as we get into '21, that should actually be a way -- go away from the insurance
side. And that segment has actually already started to show good growth as we go
forward. And then on reinsurance, we took a lot of the actions in the first half of this year.
So again, as we get next year, I expect to see growth again.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, perfect. (Multiple Speakers) insurance --

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Just to be -- I just want to be as complete as I can be. Obviously, we talked earlier about a
reduction in our credit exposed lines being a consequence. There, I think our growth is
going to be very much subject to our expectation of where the economy is going. If
there's going to be a lot of economic uncertainty, the odds are that we're not going to be
looking for huge growth on the credit exposed lines. But I think what matters at this point
in time is the book is where we want it to be. And from now on, it's really about, are we
getting the risk-adjusted returns? Are we getting the risk that we want? And we're open
for business in every line.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. No, that is very helpful. Pete, you talked in the past about how some business had -I guess, is essentially in runoff, it had something like a 2 point loss ratio headwind in the
first half of the year. Was that factor also relevant in third quarter?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes, again, it's really running off, Meyer. It probably hit -- it did hit the third quarter
negatively, but by less than 0.5 point. So it at this point has become an inconsequential,
but I mean the exact math would have it at about four tenths of a point impact due to the
runoff business in the quarter, but at this point, that business has pretty much gone.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, that's very good. And final question if I can. There -- the market I think is suggesting
a lot of skepticism in capacity modeling, or maybe just assuming that normalized losses
after what we've seen for the past four years are much higher than the historical record. I
was hoping if you could share your perspective on that specific issue. In other words, how
do you feel about the state of the industry's cat modeling relative to expectations in the
near-term?

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think it's a fair observation, right? I mean if you look at the last four years, I think three out
of the last four years have been a disappointment to the industry. And frankly, that's why
we've been pushing for pricing on the one hand, but that's why you're also seeing a
reduction in our cat premiums overall. Just look at our reported numbers, you see we're
writing less cat even on a gross basis, because we're just not feeling that the market is
properly reflecting what we believe is an ongoing trend. I think at some point, that's going
to have to change. But I will tell you that our cat writings of this year certainly would
indicate our agreement with you that we don't think it's there yet. Overall, we're taking
the position that we're going to see more frequency and severity of cat losses, which is
why it continues to be our strategy to make our exposure to cat events a smaller part of
our book.

Thank you. Next question comes from Michael Phillips, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mike Phillips

{BIO 17553225 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I guess kind of continuing on the reinsurance
thing, I think we hear you pretty clearly, your stance on property cat and pulling away
there. But I guess, can you say where in reinsurance, do you see any opportunities that
you're looking at for reinsurance? And then secondly, should we consider what we see the
drop in premium growth this quarter? Is that at trough or we continue to see more as we
go forward in next couple quarters?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

So I think just looking at projection, Peter, obviously some of our businesses that we've
already cancelled is going to affect fourth quarter. So just a lot of that is on the quarter
shares we report on a quarterly basis. So my expectation is you'll see that certainly for the
rest of the year. Peter, would you agree with that?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes. I would. But I'd say, Mike, that really when you're looking at reinsurance, the third and
fourth quarter such small volume quarters, it really looking at year-to-dates of better
indicator of where we've actually changed the book of business where it's down 12%. I
think this quarter in particular, there were timings, there were premium adjustments.
That's typically what happens in the third quarter, and just year-over-year, there were
positives last year and negatives this year. So I wouldn't read into the 23% down you saw
in the quarter, look more year-to-date. And I think that gets to how we've been
repositioning the portfolio, which I think is the second half of your question. And Albert, if
you'd like to address that?

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. So look, when you look at the big dollar numbers of reductions year-to-date, so we
talked about cat and that's already been addressed. Agriculture, same thing, with a lot of
climate change, there's been a couple of really difficult ag years. We ask for better terms,
we didn't get them. There was a big reduction in agro this year.
As we're continuing to optimize our portfolio, we felt that we were taking over lines
between insurance and reinsurance on engineering. And we determined to get out of
engineering on the reinsurance side, so we could offer our customers on the insurance
side, bigger lines and not have to worry about over lines.
We're continuing to optimize the portfolio. And so my perspective on this is that the
reductions that we've done in reinsurance are actually all moves that optimize the overall
consolidated portfolio. Going forward, as I said, it's really going to be a question of, will
certain markets adjust pricing enough to give us the returns we want? Let's -- but when
you think about our reinsurance business, over 70% of our business is quota share. And
we've just indicated to you that a lot of the lines of business in insurance are becoming
quite attractive. So I would expect that a lot of the quota share business, we as reinsures,
will be able to see that improvement and we will want to participate in that. So I do think
that kind of either year-over-year delta that you're saying in reinsurance certainly is a
trough due to the repositioning that we've made.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mike Phillips

{BIO 17553225 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thanks. Thanks, guys. And then one more on the reserve side. You
mentioned adverse and liability offset by some of the shorter lines. On the liability, can
you say how much of that was on the insurance versus reinsurance and then tell us about,
I guess, how we can get comfortable with the professional lines on the reinsurance? And I
guess (inaudible) some pressure there on reserves? And was there any adverse there
and just kind of comfort level with your current reserves in the professional lines in
reinsurance?

A - Peter W. Wilson

{BIO 4267902 <GO>}

Yes. Mike, this is Pete. I'll take that. The changes were really centered or the reserves that
we put up on the liability and pro line side. We're very much centered in the, call it the '16,
'17, '18 kind of accident years. And looking at the pieces, we did have -- we saw some
adverse development on the pro lines about 20 million in total, I'd say 60%, 70% of that
was reinsurance, 30% of that was pro lines. And that was really centered in those years,
'16, '17, '18. So we're feeling pretty good about where we are from that point forward.
Overall, we do believe the reserves are adequate where we put them at the end of the
third quarter. So we do believe that those increases were -- should get us to where we
need to be in those -- both those lines of business. And liability (Multiple Speakers) liability
about $5 million adverse.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

The other thing that I would say is also really important is, again looking at the books of
business, we really like what we've done in our U.S.-based professional lines and casualty.
Page 15 of 21

FINAL

And I think we've been changing the book, I think we're in the right place. Obviously, we
through our London-based business, have had some challenges in some of the European
professional lines. And as you know, we exited a lot of them. So we feel good that we've
either rehabilitated or exited the challenging professional lines in Europe, and we feel
very comfortable with our book of business in the states.

Q - Mike Phillips

{BIO 17553225 <GO>}

If I could follow-up on Pete's comment there on the professional liability or reinsurance in - now at the end of the third quarter, you feel comfortable with where you are. Can you
maybe qualitatively compare your level of comfort today versus maybe where you were in
that specific line for -- about a year ago?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I would say, are definitely more comfortable today, because again, our underlying
seedings have been have been getting rate, and then again, that's a big quota share
book for us. And so I do feel that the underlying business we have there is more
profitable today than where it was and we haven't moved ELRs [ph] We haven't
responded to that.
I'd say the same on our insurance side, where we've been getting a lot of rate, especially
this year, and we really haven't responded in our ELRs. [ph] But overall, I mean this is on
pro lines, sort of the -- on the reinsurance side, I would say, this was the first quarter
we've actually had an increase in the PYD and adverse on reinsurance pro lines. The first
half of the year was essentially flat. So it was just this quarter responding to what we saw
in a couple years.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 21718992 <GO>}

Sorry about that. Thank you for taking my question. You laid out a scenario where there
will be some lines of business that still at the end of 2021, still don't won't be rate
adequate. So I mean, there's two questions. And one is, if we think about 2021, how much
of your top line is going to be associated with exposures that COVID-19 has sort of shrunk
Page 16 of 21

FINAL

price, lines of business that you're just not interested and writing anymore and versus
willingness to grow the business? I know that it's going to be impossible for you to lay out
all four things. But can you go through each of the items, I guess, price and willingness to
write certain lines, exposures and willingness to expand? Can you talk about those four
categories?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yes. And if you don't mind, I'll wrap them up, because I think it would be difficult to actually
parse it in those ways. So again, probably the most important thing to say is that at this
point in time, we're open for business in every single line of business that we're in. We've
finished the macro exits and now it is purely a question of rate adequacy and optimization
of the portfolio.
With regard to the optimization of the portfolio, I think we've been very clear that we are
not looking to increase our PMLs. We think we're certainly going to get much better
returns on property and property cats, exposed lines of business, but our objective is to
deliver a more balanced and a less volatile book of business. So, we're happy to take all
the rates, we're happy to continue to reposition the portfolio to optimize the construction
through the -- there is the utilization of analytics and so on and so forth. But by and large,
you should not be looking to us to have any kind of meaningful increase in our PMLs.

Bloomberg Transcript

With regard to COVID, I would say we've never been a big contingency writer. So that's
really not -- it's frankly after the Olympics, we don't have any, right? So that's pretty
straight forward.
With regard to our property and BI related lines of business, as I've mentioned to an
earlier question, we've significantly strengthened our language and exclusion. So we feel
good about that. The real area is, what industries are going to continue to be some more
susceptible to the downsides of COVID and its economic consequences? And there,
through our normal underwriting, we'll certainly look to be more cautious in the
professional lines, in the DNO area, potential liability area, potential credit areas. And
that's simply making sure that we take risk, where we feel that the underwriting is right,
the risk is right.
There is one more factor, which we spoke about earlier today. And that is that there is
less economic activity, which has been a bit of a headwind. So there's less new
construction projects starting. Obviously a number of small businesses, a number of
restaurants have closed down. So that's reduced the renewals of those businesses. But
that's less, if you would, our choice and the fact that economic activity has declined. And
of course, as the economy recovers, we would certainly expect to participate in that
recovery with those opportunities.
But bottom line, I feel really good about where our teams have brought our book of
business. I feel really strong about our relationships. We're in all the right markets. The
question will be, how are we going to get the right pricing that meets our views of loss
trends, and in particular, the impact of lower interest rates and the uncertainties? Where
pricing is going to give us that? Where we can structure policies to protect us against that,
Page 17 of 21



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2020-10-29

we will be looking to grow. And where we won't, we won't, and I expect that you will be
happy that we won't want to grow there.

FINAL

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 21718992 <GO>}

Okay. That's fairly thorough. And then when we just one -- and then when we look at lines
of business that are absolutely not rate adequate today, some of them you were writing
last year. To what extent, we can't look at individual lines of -- we have some
segmentation in the triangles. But to what extent, do you think that you've put a layer of
conservatism on those particular lines that you're certain aren't adequate given the
current interest rate environment that investors should be confident about the portfolio?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think we've taken the corrective action to make sure that we're doing it right this year. I
mean, I think that we've made excellent progress in our reported numbers. And we've
just told you we've taken no credits for rate over trend in our long tail lines where interest
rates are the biggest impact and where COVID may have an impact. It's also areas where
we're seeing some of the strongest rate increases. So we told you, we're saying 15% plus
on primary casualty, we're seeing 30% plus in excess casualty, we're saying 35% in CMS.
Obviously, we are not going to take all of those increases into the loss ratio on year one.
So I think we're already very prudently booking that business, being cautious not to reflect
all the rates in 2020. We're certainly not going to reflect all the rate in 2021. But we think
that those lines of business, we're taking the appropriate action in reserving them
prudently and we feel good about where they are, and we think many of them are going
to get better.
In cyber, we've talked about the fact that ransomware claims are increasing, that this has
been a line of business that has not seen a lot of price action. We think in 2021, that line of
business will see more price action. And because we think we need to get paid for all of
the increased ransomware claims and so on, if we don't get the pricing, we won't grow as
much. But we like the business we're in.

FINAL

Hi, Elyse.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, Albert. Thanks for fitting me in. My first question on -- you guys kind of -- obviously you
mentioned, there's been a lot of business initiatives, right? So we have -- business saw a
little slowdown in reinsurance in the quarter. And you pointed to growth in 2021. We're
hearing that there's going to be a good amount of retro increases at January 1. So as you
think about growing your top line, in 2021, how are you thinking about the growth in that
and how that might play out 2021, I guess in reference to 2020?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right. So when you think about our insurance book of business -- I know you asked about
retro, but let me give you the comprehensive answer. I think when you look at our
reinsurance book of business, most of what we write or what we buy is quota share. And
so obviously, our reinsurance are getting the benefit of all of the improvements that we're
delivering. So I think that, that will continue whether we increase or decrease our
retentions, frankly is the decision that we'll make at the time, when we see most of what - most of our book reinsures sometime in the spring, so we'll be reactive to that.
With regard to the reinsurance book, we're actually not a big buyer of retro. As you know,
we use third party capital, but that's mostly quota share. So because we're not a large
writer of retro, we don't view changes in the retro market -- not a large buyer, I apologize,
of retro, changes in the retro market really don't affect us in a meaningful way.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. And then your PMLs, every return period, I think came down in the
quarter. Obviously, I think they came down like last quarter as well. Is that something as
you think about 2021 taking into account rate? I think you mentioned earlier in the call that
you have desire to take down the cat exposure a little bit. Should we expect the PMLs to
continue to come down from here?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, the PMLs in this quarter have a little bit of a benefit, because frankly with the activity
that we've had this year, we've eroded lot of the aggregate covers. So I think that has an
impact on the net PMLs. But I think if you look at where we were at July 1, I think that's
probably more of an independent view. And so to my point, I think around the levels of
July 1, maybe a little bit lower, is where I would expect where I would expect it to be.

FINAL

Okay. That's helpful. And my last question, the fourth quarter seems to also be pretty
active. We've had Delta Zeta, the ongoing California fires. Do you guys just have a little bit
of a sense of how we can think about the cat loss, the exposure to some of these events
in the fourth quarter? Maybe I know some of them are ongoing, so not looking for an
exact number, but more qualitative in terms of your exposure and how we should think
about the fourth quarter.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, you're right, I mean, they're literally just happened. I think Zeta, they just went
through Louisiana yesterday. But I think both of them tend to be reasonably low level cats.
The other thing that I would say is Zeta in particular, looks like it's going to be following
the same path as Laura, [ph] which means that there'll probably be some complications in
terms of attributing losses to Laura or Zeta. So my guess is that's going to be an issue for
the entire industry, certainly not just ourselves.
But that's kind of where we are on it. And we'll see how it develops as the fourth quarter
goes. It's interesting. I mean if you look at the last five years, give or take, I think kind of
median, cat losses were probably around $50 billion for the industry. We think we're at
probably mid-60s already through the end of the third quarter. So I think that gives you an
indication of what kind of year we're having.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Elyse, the only other thing I'd point out, and this is Pete, when you look historically,
especially the '17 and '18 with the wildfires, we had been on a number of large aggregate
treaties on the reinsurance side. And we're no longer on those treaties. So we don't have
those aggregates in our portfolio anymore. So just as you're looking historically, I thought
I'd point that out.

FINAL

Thank you, operator. And thank you to everybody for participating and for your interest
and your questions. Clearly, this was a quarter with a lot of noise up and down and
sideways. But at the end of the day, I think that AXIS responded very well to the
challenges of this year in terms of having a lower exposure than historically to cats. I think
that we've made significant progress in our ex-cat book of business. And I think that we're
advancing our strategy and building a global leader in specialty risk.
Again, I want to leave you with our commitment that we're focused on our plan. We're
disciplined in our underwriting approach. And we're managing our portfolio and
positioning our business to thrive in the eventual recovery. We did have a fair number of
books of business that we were repositioning in 2020, but we like where we are today
and we are open for business when the pricing and the returns are attractive.
To the -- to my colleagues who are listening today, I want to say thank you. I want to
express my appreciation to all of you. You're working hard. Your commitment, your
dedication, our clients see and our brokers see it, we see it everyday. I just want to thank
