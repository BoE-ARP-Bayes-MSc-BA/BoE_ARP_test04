FINAL

Good morning, and thank you, Denise. This is Tom Gayner. It's my pleasure to welcome
you to the Markel's Second Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this morning by my
colleagues: Anne Waleski our CFO; and Richie Whitt, our Co-CEO. The purpose of these
calls is to share our financial results with you to provide you with some commentary about
the numbers and what they mean in terms of the economic progress of your company
and to answer your questions.
The headlines for the first half of 2018 are that revenues grew 23% from $2.9 billion to
$3.5 billion. Operating income grew 13% from $357 million to $416 million. Net income
declined 2.7% from $219 million to $213 million and comprehensive income declined to
$565 million to a negative $10.5 million a year ago.
When you look at that series of numbers, a reasonable first question might be, well, how
is Markel doing? The answer is that we're doing well. It's complicated to take the steps
necessary to understand that answer but we'll do our best to provide commentary as to
why we have confidence in saying so.

Bloomberg Transcript

In short, Markel grew revenues over 20% compared to a year ago. We deployed capital
and made acquisitions to increase our revenue base and the size, scale and abilities of
your company. At the same time, we competed, adapted, worked hard and learned more
about how to grow throughout all our existing and new operations.
In our Insurance business, we increased our earned premiums 14% from $2 billion to $2.3
billion. We did so profitability for the combined ratio of 91 compared to 95 for the first six
months of 2017. We also continue to increase the range of our insurance related
capabilities. Richie will update you on our conditions and circumstances in our Insurance
operations in a few minutes, but suffice to say that we are pleased with these results in an
ongoing difficult and challenging insurance industry environment.
In our investment operations, the net investment income grew 6.9% from $199 million to
$213 million. This part of the investment equation is the most consistent and stable
component of our investment returns. It represents interest and dividend income from
our portfolio of equity and fixed income securities.
By contrast the gains and losses from our portfolio are and will likely continue to be quite
volatile in any given quarter or year. This is where year-over-year comparisons become
somewhat arbitrary and not necessarily in keeping with underlying economic reality.
For example, in 2018, we reported net investment losses of $17.7 million compared to
gains of $38.5 million in 2017. Additionally under the new industry accounting treatments in
place for 2018, our unrealized gains and losses now flow through the income statement
rather than just the balance sheet. While this new accounting makes no economic
difference, our net income account during the first six months of 2018 displace unrealized
losses of $220 million compared to unrealized gains of $340 million a year ago.
Over longer and more meaningful time periods, our investments earned positive and
appropriate returns. We're confident that will continue to be the case. We don't worry too

FINAL

much about short-term volatility where we'd usually chart it out when things are going
down. And we don't excessively celebrate short-term periods when the reported
numbers are positive.
In our Ventures operations revenues grew 61% from $600 million to $970 million. EBITDA
declined 15% from $97 million to $82 million. The primary driver of the increase in
revenues comes from our ownership of Costa Farms, but Markel Ventures grew on an
overall basis even without considering the impact of Costa.
Frankly, we faced unexpected challenges in one of our operations within Markel Ventures
during the quarter. We took actions to deal with them and we posted charges totaling $48
million to deal with the issues. This charge is non-recurrent and should not mar our results
going forward. Absent those charges, the EBITDA would've increased more proportionally
to the revenue growth that will also be my expectation going forward.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Anne to provide you with more details on the array of
numbers in our report. Richie, will then discuss our insurance operations. And I'll return with
comments about our investment in Ventures operations. Anne?

Bloomberg Transcript

That you, Tom, and good morning everyone. I'm happy to report the performance for the
first half of 2018 was strong. Our underwriting Markel Ventures operations have made
substantial contributions to our results during 2018, largely attributable to profitable
growth from acquisitions made in 2017.
Our investment returns reflects unfavorable market movements on our fixed maturity
portfolio due to rising interest rates. However, we continue to maintain a long-term focus
with our investment strategy.
Total operating revenues grew 23% to approximately $3.6 billion in 2018; the increase was
primarily attributable to a 14% increase in earned premium and a 62% increase in
revenues for Markel Ventures. The increase in earned premiums and other revenues was
partially offset by net investment losses for the first six months of 2018 compared to net
investment gains last year.
Starting with our underwriting results. Gross written premiums were $3 billion for the first
half of 2018 compared to $2.8 billion in 2017, an increase of 7%. The increase in gross
premium volumes was attributable to the contribution of premium from our new surety
business, which we acquired in May, 2017 and our collateral protection business, which we
acquired in November of last year.
We also saw organic growth across most lines within our insurance segment. Retention of
gross written premiums decreased from 85% in 2017 to 83% in 2018. This decrease was
driven by lower retention on our classic car business within the insurance segment and on
our Property product line within the Reinsurance segment. Earned premiums increased
14% to $2.3 billion for the first half of 2018 due to higher written premiums in our insurance

FINAL

segment and higher earnings in our Reinsurance segment related to increased premiums
volume in 2017.
Our consolidated combined ratio for the first six months of 2018 was 91% compared to
95% last year. As I mentioned previously the 2017 combined -- consolidated combined
ratio included $85 million or four points of adverse development on prior year loss
reserves in our Reinsurance segment resulting from the decrease in the Ogden Rate
which is used to calculate some awards on U.K. bottling injury cases.
Now let's talk about the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel
Ventures for the first six months of 2018 increased to $971 million compared to $601
million a year ago. The increased revenues are primarily attributable to the third quarter
2017 acquisition of Costa Farms as well as higher revenues in both our products and
services businesses. Operating income for Markel Ventures were $37 million for the first
half of 2018 compared to $64 million last year. EBITDA was $82 million for the first half of
2018 compared to $97 million last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

The decrease in both operating income and EBITDA was primarily due to expenses
related to an investigation and remediation associated with the manufacture of products
at one of our businesses and to an impairment charge related to intangible assets of this
reporting unit. These expenses were partially offset by the contribution of operating
income and EBITDA attributable to Costa Farms in 2018.
Now taking a look at our investment results. Investment income increased from $200
million for the first half of 2017 to $213 million this year. The increase was driven by short
term investment income primarily due to higher short term interest rates and higher
dividend income due to increased equity holding and dividend rate compared to the
same period of 2017. Net investment losses included in net income were $18 million for
the first half of 2018 compared to net investment gains of $38 million in 2017.
Net investment losses for 2018 include $9 million of pretax losses attributable to the
decline in the fair value of our equity portfolio. As we discussed last quarter effective
January 1 2018 all changes in fair value of the equity portfolio are included in net income
rather than other comprehensive income. Net unrealized investment gains decreased
$282 million during the first half of 2018 reflecting a decrease in the fair value of our fixed
maturity portfolio.
Given our long term focus variability in the timing of investment gains and losses is to be
expected. Taking a look at our total results for the year. Our effective tax rate was 47% in
2018 compared to 27% a year ago. As I mentioned last quarter the impact of
management's decision to elect the two U.K. subsidiaries as U.S. taxpayers beginning in
2018 added $102 million or 25% to the effective tax rate. Our estimated annual effective
tax rate which excludes this impact as well as certain other items that are infrequent or
unusual in nature were 20% in 2018 compared to 27% in 2017. The decrease in the
estimated annual effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the decrease in the U.S.
corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of Tax Reform Legislation enacted in the

Page 4 of 17

FINAL

fourth quarter of 2017. We reported net income to shareholders of $214 million for the first
half of 2018, compared to $220 million a year ago.
Comprehensive loss to shareholders for the period was $11 million compared to
comprehensive income to shareholders of $566 million a year ago. The comprehensive
loss for the period was driven by the decline in the fair value of fixed maturities since the
end of 2017, which was largely offset by net income for the period. Book value per share
was $683 at the end of June 2018 compared to $684 at the end of 2017. I think we can call
that flattish.
Finally, I'll make a couple of comments on cash flow and the balance sheet. Net cash
provided by operating activities was $308 million for the first half of 2018 compared to
$238 million for the same period of 2017. Operating cash flows for 2018 reflected higher
premium collections, higher cash flows from Markel Ventures and lower payments for
employee profit sharing compared to the same period of 2017.
2018 also included higher claim payment, largely driven by the 2017 capacity losses. As of
June 30, 2018 we have paid 61% of our total estimated losses on the 2017 catastrophe.
Invested assets at the holding company were $2.4 billion at June 30, 2018 and $2.7 billion
at the end of the year 2017. The decrease in invested assets is primarily due to an
increase in loans and capital contributions to our subsidiaries and interest payments
associated with our unsecured senior notes.

Bloomberg Transcript

With that, I'll turn it over to Richie to talk more about our underwriting results.

Richard Whitt III

{BIO 1836438 <GO>}

Thanks, Anne. Good morning, everyone. Today I'll focus my comments on our
underwriting operations and also provide a brief updates on State National and Markel
CATCo. So first I'll start with the insurance segment. As a reminder starting in the first
quarter of this year, we have consolidated the operating results of our previously
reported U.S. insurance and International Insurance segment into a new single insurance
segment. All results from prior periods for the two separate segments have been
combined, so you can compare those.
Gross written premiums for the quarter were up $125 million, or 11% compared to the
second quarter of 2017. On a year-to-date basis, writings were up $305 million or 15%.
The acquisitions of Markel surety and the State National collateral protection line added
$51 million in premiums in the quarter and $118 million in premiums on a year-to-date basis.
Premium growth for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis excluding the newly
acquired product lines was driven by organic growth in our general liability professional
liability and personal lines product lines. Earned premiums for this segment are up 14% for
the quarter and 17% on a year-to-date basis due to similar reasons as the gross written
premium increases.

FINAL

The combined ratio for the insurance segment was 92 for the second quarter of 2018
compared to 91% for the same period a year ago. The 1 point increase in the combined
ratio was driven by the impact of higher earned premiums which reduced the impact of
the prior year's loss reserves releases on the combined ratio.
The benefit of higher earned premiums on the expense ratio was offset by an increase in
G&A expenses from the newly acquired surety and lender services businesses. Those two
businesses have a lower loss ratio but higher expense ratio associated with them.
The year-to-date combined ratio for the insurance segment was 90 versus 91 for the
same period last year. The one point decrease in the combined ratio was driven by a
lower current accident year loss ratio, due to large attritional losses on Property lines in
2017 and the impact of a lower attritional loss ratios from acquired businesses.
Next, I'll talk about the Reinsurance segment. Gross written premiums for the quarter are
down $39 million or 16% compared to the second quarter of 2017. On a year-to-date
basis, writings were down $95 million or 12%. The decrease in gross written premiums in
the quarter was driven by lower premium volumes in the general liability and Property
product lines, due to timing of renewals of multi-year contracts and non-renewals in the
Property book.

Bloomberg Transcript

The decrease in gross written premium on year-to-date basis was primarily driven by a
large specialty quota share treaty entered into the first quarter of 2017 that was not
renewed along with the decrease in our Property lines, due primarily to two contracts that
were not renewed.
During the first half of the year, we have not renewed marginal Property business, where
rates and returns did not improve sufficiently to meet our profitability targets. As
mentioned in previous quarters, significant volatility in gross premium volume can be
expected in our Reinsurance segment, due to individually large deals and timing of
renewals on multi-year contracts.
Earned premiums for this segment are flat for the quarter, and up 5% on a year-to-date
basis, due to gross written premium growth from 2017 contracts earning into this year.
The combined ratio of the Reinsurance segment was 90% for the second quarter of 2018
compared to 85% for that same period a year ago. The five point increase in the
combined ratio was due to less favorable development on the prior year's loss reserves.
Contributing to the increase in the prior year's loss ratio was less favorable development
on prior year's loss reserves on the whole account product line and adverse development
from the 2017 cat events of $5 million, partially offset by more favorable developments in
Surety and Marine and Energy product lines.
The year-to-date combined ratio for the Reinsurance segment was 94 versus 108 for the
same period a year ago. The 14 point decrease in the combined ratio was driven by more
favorable development on prior year's loss reserve and the lower current accident year
loss ratio and expense ratio.

As Anne, previously discussed many times, the first quarter of 2017 results for the
Reinsurance segment included $85 million or 19 points on the segment combined ratio of
adverse development related to the decrease in the Ogden Rate.

FINAL

Excluding the impact of Ogden, the segment had less favorable development in 2018
compared to 2017 due to adverse development in our Property reinsurance lines
compared to favorable development in Property to previous year.
The adverse development experienced in 2017 -- 2018 is driven by $17 million related to
the 2017 cat events. On a year-to-date basis, in total, our insurance and reinsurance
segments increased reserves for the 2017 cat events by approximately $5 million. The
decrease in the current accident year loss ratios for the first six months in 2018 was due to
higher earned premium as a result of net favorable premium adjustments this year
compared to net unfavorable premium adjustments last year. The decrease in the
expense ratio was due to lower profit sharing expenses in 2018 compared to 2017.

Bloomberg Transcript

Next I'll make a few comments about our State National acquisition. As a reminder, State
National business is comprised of two primary products a collateral protection insurance
coverage results for which are included in our insurance segment and farming platform
which provides insurance licenses, waited paper and services for fee. We refer to this
business as our program services business. This business is non-risk bearing to Markel and
is reported separately from our underwriting operations.
The collateral protection insurance line contributed $42 million of gross written premium in
the quarter and $88 million on a year-to-date basis to the insurance segment operating
results. It also produced a solid underwriting profit. The program services business added
$555 million in gross written premium in the quarter and $1 billion for the first six months.
The business also contributed $23 million in the quarter and $45 million during the first half
of 2018 and speeding commission fee revenue from the gross written premium funded
during the period.
This was reported in other revenues within our operating results. We're very pleased with
the State National's year-to-date results. Moving to Markel CATCo. Assets under
management including funds held that would be used to settle claims for incurred losses
increased to $6.6 billion at June 30, 2018 up from $6.1 billion at the end of 2017. As of June
2018, Markel's investment in the Markel CATCo funds was approximately $132 million. We
recognized investment losses of $28 million in the quarter and $51 million on a year-todate basis due to decreases in the net asset value of the funds due to adverse
developments on the 2017 cat events.
The adverse development was primarily related to Hurricane Irma as a result of significant
increases in loss adjustment expense, late claim reporting and increased Caribbean loss
estimates. Finally, I'll end with some market commentary. Honestly, there's not much new
to report from last quarter. The market remains competitive but we are achieving modest
digit rate increases in many of our lines of business. The highest rate increases are in
Property. However despite continued increases in losses from the 2017 cat events
inexplicably property price momentum has slowed through the first half of the year.

FINAL

Interesting -- interestingly you can see underwriting pain getting to pick up in the market.
Whether it'd be the Lloyd's franchise drive to remediate under-performing lines of
business or companies having earnings misses due underwriting business -- underwriting
payment is increasing. I've also personally noted that many more of today's insurance
headlines are about insurance pulling out of lines of business. While a year ago all the
news seem to be about insurance entering new lines of business or adding underwriting
teams.
They're also clear signs of inflation pressure are building in the real economy. I define the
real economy is the one where you and I buy stuff versus the fantasy economy the
government reports on that seems to exclude the stuff that people buy. Full employment
leading to wage inflation, tariff leading to increases in commodity cost and replacement
cost and the gradual erosion of tort reform are all leading towards rising claim cost
inflation.
Every day at Markel, we're stretching to our underwriters the absolute necessity of price
increases and underwriting discipline. Unfortunately it's been proved over and over again
severe underwriting pain is required before the insurance industry will collectively get its
act together and price risk appropriately. At Markel, we see the pain coming and we're
working hard to ensure that we are not impacted when it gets here.
Thanks for your time today. And now I'll turn things over to Tom.

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Thank you, Richie. Investments result during the first half reflected a normal pattern shortterm volatility. In our equity portfolio, we were up a modest 1.5% during the first half. Over
the last 5.5 years we're up 222% cumulatively. Over that timeframe, we've been up as
much as 33% in a single year, and down as much as 2.5% in a year.
I would happily sign up for those results for the next 5.5 years and we continue to invest
each day with the same discipline that has produced such outstanding long-term results.
Publically traded equity stood at 64% of shareholders equity at June 30, compared to
62% at year-end. We continue to modestly and steadily add to our equity portfolio and we
think the recent volatility allows us the chance to purchase wonderful long-term
businesses at attractive prices. That is exactly what we are doing.
In our fixed income operation, we were down 0.3% during the first half. In the last 5.5
years we're up 14.2% cumulatively. The best year in those five was up 6.5% and the worst
was flat. I think this longer term comparison highlights why we allocate so much of our
investment portfolio to equities.
I would also sign up right now for these types of fixed income returns over the next 5.5
years, since they reflect the underlying actions of buying the highest credit quality
securities that we can find, roughly matching the duration of our bonds to that of our
insurance liabilities, and minimizing frictional cost along the way.

FINAL

Also point out that net investment income from an interest income and dividends totaled
$213 million during the first half, compared to $199 million a year ago, an increase of
roughly 7%. This higher return portion of our total return stems from rising interest rates
and increase in dividends from our high quality equity securities. This line is much less
volatile than the unrealized gains and losses. And I'm pleased with this progress and
expect more to come.
At Markel Ventures, we reported revenues of $971 million versus $600 million, an increase
of 61%, while EBITDA declined 15% to $82 million versus $97 million. I'm highly optimistic
that we will enjoy proportional increases in profitability going forward to go along with the
increased size and scale of Markel Ventures. All of our businesses faced challenges such
as competitive market conditions, labor market price and availability pressures, steel price
volatility, trucking and transportation bottlenecks and numerous other factors. Despite
these forces, the group continues to make economic progress and produce good returns
for Markel.

Bloomberg Transcript

Overtime EBITDA should highly correlate to total revenues. One of our unique
competitive advantages at Markel is our focus on long-term results and long-term
commonsense behavior in all aspects. If you're trying to figure out a normalized earnings
power sort of number for Markel Ventures, I would take a normalized revenue number
and a normalized EBITDA percentage number to get normal economic earnings. I look
forward to reporting on the group's results in coming period and demonstrating that very
outcome.
During the quarter, we also announced formation of Rosemont Investment Group as part
of Markel Ventures. Chas Burkhart joins us with 18 years of successful history in running
Rosemont. In this business, we'll be investing in the ownership of asset management
firms. We're excited to announce this addition to Markel Ventures and we're optimistic
about the multiple opportunities we are already seeing in light of this announcement. With
that, I hope you we've given you some sense for why we are confident that Markel is
indeed doing well.
And I'd like to open the floor for your questions. Denise, if you would open-up for

Mark Hughes

{BIO 1506147 <GO>}

The step-up sequentially in the Markel Ventures revenue I think you we're 439 in terms of
other revenue in the first quarter of the 628. How much of that was seasonality versus
underlying growth?

Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Yeah. It's a mix of both and cost of which we referred to you several times. Second
quarter would be one of the biggest seasons of the year third quarter will be not quite
that and fourth and first quarter are the lowest. So, yeah, there is seasonality factor
involved.

Mark Hughes

{BIO 1506147 <GO>}

And when we look at the -- I think your organic growth in the insurance segment you had
mentioned general liability and professional liability as a stand out there. Can you talk
about the maybe the price or rate that you're seeing there in any particular updates on
medical professional liability?

Bloomberg Transcript

Richard Whitt III

{BIO 1836438 <GO>}

You know, I would say both of those areas we're seeing sort of a low single digit increases
in pricing. I clearly would love to see more but that's what the market provides at the
moment. And with the growth in the economy I think most of the growth we're seeing is
not price I think that's a good economy out there. There's a lot of construction going on
and as a result we're seeing more business.
In terms of medical I would say that's still one of the lines that were struggling to gain
price direction to start going up. I think results have been for the most part poor for
people in medical in the recent years. But for whatever reason pricing hasn't responded
yet. So that would be one of the I'd say most lines we're seeing sort of the single digit
increases. Medical is probably one of those areas where we're still waiting to see some
increases.

Mark Hughes

{BIO 1506147 <GO>}

And then finally you mentioned Lloyd that they are doing I think a comprehensive review.
Have you seen any behavioral changes in your relevant markets?

FINAL

I think so. I mean the news as I sort of pointed out a year ago it seems like everybody was
reporting on adding lines of business or adding teams. In the last several months
particularly since Lloyds announced their drive to work on sort of the lines of business that
were hurting the market, you're seeing people move out of lines of business or teams
leaving. And so I think reality is starting to set in.

Questions And Answers
Operator
The next question will be from Jeff Schmitt of William Blair. Please go ahead.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Hi, good morning, everyone. Question on Costa Farms just about the -- how's the
business doing after the inventory loss last year? I mean did that have any effect on the
quarter or was that sort of properly grown and had no impact?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Richard Whitt III

{BIO 1836438 <GO>}

Yes, in addition to the seasonality question that Mark asked before that is magnified and
stood out a little bit more by the fact that we are still recovery from the hurricane to a
certain amount. So just with growing cycles what they are some plans taking couple of
weeks some things take a couple of months. It takes a while to refill the entire pipeline. So
the main take away I would say is a, the business doing well that's how we're as delighted
as we possibly could be with the affiliation and the cost of family and the nature that
business. It would be a mistake to annualize the current year results or last year results if it
both have a lot of distortion to it. But remember we have a long term focus at Markel and
when you start looking at the thing over years as a fellow Markel shareholder I feel very
happy that that's part of the family.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Okay. And then did I -- I may misheard a minute or two ago when you talked about the
seasonality of Costa Farms. Did you say the fourth and first quarters were lower? I would
think the fourth would be higher from with Christmas but is that not the case?

A - Richard Whitt III

{BIO 1836438 <GO>}

Well I invite you to see how much of it is in the cost up [ph] -- versus some of the other
stuff we buy in different parts for the year. (inaudible) but that tends to be something that
you leave it open there's price promotions by the retailers and what not. (inaudible) but
the second and third quarters are our highest parts of the business.

Okay. Is there anything more you can say on the investigation charge and the goodwill
impairment? I mean, is there a potential for that to for there to be more charges?

FINAL

A - Richard Whitt III

{BIO 1836438 <GO>}

Well, we've put up our best estimates, what we think the total expenses involved are. And
that's the same process and philosophy in the way we put up insurances reserve and deal
with uncertainty in life and we have a history of conservative accounting of doing our very
best to recognize things quickly. And at the instant, we know what, you know it soon after
is possible [ph].

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Okay. And then last one, you had mentioned some pressure on losses from tort activity. Is
that -- are you seeing that anecdotally? Or can you quantify that in anyway?

A - Richard Whitt III

{BIO 1836438 <GO>}

It's hard to quantify, but things in the world tend to work in cycles. And few years back
there was a lot of effort in tort reform and ever since then planet bar [ph] has been sort
of chipping away at that. And you continue to see that I mean in states like Florida, Texas
California there's been significant erosion in tort reform in those areas. And you're
starting to show up in lost cost. I couldn't quantify it for you, but it's just kind of what
happens as markets change.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Are there any lines in particular that you're seeing the most aggressiveness?

A - Richard Whitt III

{BIO 1836438 <GO>}

Probably every one of the areas in this business been talked about in a lot on calls over
probably the last years in auto. You're seeing some really eye watering verdicts in some
of the auto claims particularly like trucking things of that sort, commercial auto in particular.
Where it really looks like judgments are more to punish than to make people hold.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.

And next question will be from Bob Farnam of Boenning and Scattergood, please go
ahead.

Q - Bob Farnam

{BIO 15005467 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi, and good morning. I have a question on the expense ratio in the insurance
operations. So consolidated expense ratio is about 39% in the first -- in the second
quarter. And they may gradually trending down over the last five years or so from low 40s
to the high 30s. I understand, the surety in the collateral protection this is just going to put

some of upward pressure on that. But I'm just curious where do you see that the expense
ratio going overtime. Can we expect that to come down?

FINAL

A - Richard Whitt III

{BIO 1836438 <GO>}

I'll take this and you guys are welcome to jump-in. I mean, that is absolutely our goal for
that to continue to trend down, Bob. We -- by adding surety and the -- the vendor services
business -- collateral protections, sorry -- we kind of gone the other direction in terms of
mix that probably adds a point just in terms of mix of business. But in our underlying sort
of G&A cost everything we've done a nice job of reducing those. So, we'll -- as long as
businesses generate sufficient underwriting profits we'll be indifferent as to the loss ratio
component and the expense ratio component. But sort of a headline number gets
pushed up as a result of adding those businesses. The other thing that tends to happen
throughout the year is our bonus accruals and the balance around and add some volatility.
And I think you're seeing a little bit of that in the second quarter as well. So we still believe
the underlying trend is reduction to the expense ratio, it just doesn't show up as well with
the no ways [ph] right now.

Q - Bob Farnam

{BIO 15005467 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Great. And then as you say, it's probably more important the combined ratio basis than
looking expense ratio versus loss ratio. So actually another question for you. So there was
a substantial growth in the program services business gross written premium in the
second quarter relative to the first quarter, is there any seasonality to the State National
book?

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

No, there is no seasonality but much like we talked about there could be big transactions
in our reinsurance segment. In the State National fronting programs those can be big
programs and when they come on, they move the numbers rather quickly. So I think it's
more a factor of when new programs come online. And then how big those programs are.
So there's probably going to be a little more volatility in that than some of the other lines
of business.

Q - Bob Farnam

{BIO 15005467 <GO>}

So should we look at maybe the first six months and use that more of a trend going
forward -- is that.

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Yes, I mean we're certainly experiencing growth in the vendor services business. It can be
bumpy from quarter-to-quarter but the underlying trend is growth.

Q - Bob Farnam

{BIO 15005467 <GO>}

Okay. And the last question for me is it looks like you received your license to reinsure
business in India. I don't know much about the market in India. What kind -- what's the
opportunity there in your mind?

FINAL

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Well, I think the opportunity is one of the most populated countries in the world with a
rapidly growing middle class rapidly growing GDP it's been a very closed market to
insurance companies outside of the country. That is -- that's been changing gradually over
the last few years. And has changed to the point where we are willing to invest in the
company in a -- in the country in a small way. I wouldn't expect to be talking about huge
writings in India on the next several calls. We want to get there we want to learn about the
culture and how the business works and hopefully grow as that economy grows.

Q - Bob Farnam

{BIO 15005467 <GO>}

And likely reinsuring domestic writers, is that likely.

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Correct, correct. Which we have done historically. We've just done it from Singapore or we
have done it from London.

Q - Bob Farnam

{BIO 15005467 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

So it's something best to have feet on the ground people there that know have
relationships and know the culture and that's the steps we've taken now.

Okay, very good. Thanks for that.

And the next question will be from Mark Dwelle of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Yeah, good morning. A lot of my questions have already been covered but a couple for
Tom. Within Markel Ventures a lot of those businesses use steel for lack of better
description. Are you seeing any cost pressures yet, and any anticipation of cost pressures,
or your ability to pass that cost along should it occur to customers as a result of tariffs and
whatnot?

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

It'll work, yes. And it's not just cost it's availability. So just getting our hands on steel to run
the business is more of a challenge today than it was a year ago. Now everybody works
hard and figures that out but yes that's a topic (inaudible) these days.

FINAL

Okay. Secondly I mean you made some comments already about the charge in the
quarter and the goodwill impairment there. Was that item or that issue a subject to
litigation? It appeared in the contingency second section, I wasn't clear from that
placement, whether that was a litigation item or just something that you guys were
investigating?

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

That was internal and we have to put contingencies like what we did in a standard
business practice.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Excellent. Thanks. And I guess the last question that I had. Again, it relates to the tax rate.
I'm still been struggling to get my arms around this, this quarter seems to be little bit
higher than the first quarter. I didn't know. And if you had any kind of guidance, or way of
thinking about that tax rate to try to help us kind of pin that down a little bit more exactly?

A - Anne Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, I mean, I think it was slightly higher than the first quarter 20% versus 19%. So I mean, I
think something in the low 20s% high-teens is probably a fair guess. As we talked about
whether it's the U.K. tax election that we made earlier or it's the movement in the equity
portfolios that tax rate is going to move around some. But I would think that that effective
annual tax rate of 20%-ish is probably a fair enough estimate for your purposes.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

All right. Okay. That's kind of what I thought as well. I think those are all my questions. Most
of guys ahead of me already covered the other ones. Thanks.

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Terrific.

A - Anne Waleski

And the next question will be a follow-up from Mark Hughes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.

Q - Mark Hughes

{BIO 1506147 <GO>}

I just had a general question your view on the strength of the economy the sustainability
of the kind of this GDP we've seen lately? And, if there is inflation on the way? How are
you thinking about the equity portfolio?

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}
Page 15 of 17



Company N ame: M arkel Corp

FINAL

Yeah, I'll take that and there's two different parts to answer that, strength and
sustainability. In terms of strength, I mean, it's boom times out there. So anywhere you
want, look out to construction cranes try to hire somebody, look at labor markets, try to
get a hold, anyone of those measures that you wanted to look at. The conditions are
about running as hot as I could remember in a long, long time. Sustainability, your guess is
as good as mine, that's crystal ball stuff and we don't know.
So I don't really have anything to add on that. In terms of the equity portfolio itself and the
insurance pricing risk that Richie referred to. This is the kind of stuff that he and I talked
about on a regular basis to keep one another informed on both sides as to what we're
seeing and thinking about and trying to make show we're communicating throughout the
organization to do the best we can.
We've always been very cognizant of sort of real pricing power in the business as we
invest in now and we've also always had a pretty high proportion of equity securities
where those are dynamic businesses that we even live and move and change and adapt
to whatever circumstances they find themselves in. So part of the answer to your question
and protecting Markel is to increase the allocation to equities in a prudent and reasonable
way. Because those are inflation protected in a better way than a bond would be by
definition.
