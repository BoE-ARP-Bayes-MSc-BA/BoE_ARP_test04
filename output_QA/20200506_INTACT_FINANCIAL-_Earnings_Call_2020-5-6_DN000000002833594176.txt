{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thanks, Ken. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Since the last
weeks of March, the world has changed dramatically. The Coronavirus pandemic has
inﬂicted immense pain and suﬀering on communities across the globe, and economic
activity has slowed to levels not seen in our lifetime. And we're grateful for the dedication
and commitment of healthcare workers and essential services. They have rallied to
societies aids while people and communities have entered a lockdown never before
seen. Across North America, society's discipline is paying oﬀ, as we're thankfully
witnessing a slowing of the spread of COVID-19. At Intact, our business is resilient and our
number one priority is ensuring we support society and our customers through this. Over
the past six weeks, we've been helping impacted customers by providing payment
ﬂexibility and premium adjustments to recognize ﬁnancial hardship and changing risk
proﬁle.
Our measures are aimed at providing the highest amount of beneﬁt to those who needed
the most. So far into Q2, we've provided over CAD130 million of relief to approximately
390,000 customers and we expect the total amount of relief will exceed CAD200 million
by end of the lockdown. Our business was built to support people, businesses and
society in both good times and bad times. And that's exactly what we're doing.
Our ability to support our customers and brokers is the direct result of our people, of
which over 99% of them are working eﬀectively from home. Supporting them is our
robust IT infrastructure, which is performing really well. We're set up to operate our
business remotely for an extended period of time, if necessary. And at Intact, the trains
are running on time. I do believe it's not important though for businesses and
government to work together to develop a plan for a gradual risk-based return to work in
the coming weeks.
Now let me provide a bit of color on our quarterly results. So, yesterday evening, we
announced solid ﬁrst quarter net operating income of CAD1.61 per share. Top line growth
was 14% in the quarter. Including the GCNA acquisition. In Canada, premiums grew 15%,
and in the US, growth was 9%. The combined ratio was 94.3% Canada posted a solid

FINAL

93.3% mild winter weather more than oﬀsetting the COVID-19 related losses. The US
Commercial Lines combined ratio was 100.1% including 8.5 points of COVID-19 claims
provisions. In aggregate, we recorded a provision of CAD83 million directly related to
COVID-19 claims in Commercial Lines both in Canada and in the US.
We did a bottom-up analysis of where our exposure could be to determine the direct
impact of COVID-19 in Commercial Lines, and of course, we'll reﬁne it in the second
quarter as the situation develops. But we're conﬁdent with the position we've taken so far.
We're also of course remaining vigilant on the potential indirect eﬀect of the slowing
economy over the coming year. The prevailing hard market conditions in Canada we
experienced in 2019 and into early 2020 will be temporarily impacted by the crisis as we
provide relief to small and mid-sized businesses that are going through a hard time. Once
the impact of the crisis has passed, we do expect our active measures to resume fully as
the industry continues to report ROEs well below historical averages. In 2019, the industry
ROE was 5.6%, which put our outperformance at 580 basis points for the full year, again,
above our 500-basis points objective.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the US, while industry premium growth will be impacted by the economic slowdown,
we expect the prevailing hardening market conditions including rate increases to
continue.
Let's now look at our ﬁrst quarter results by line of business, starting with Canada. In
Personal Auto, premiums grew 11% driven by favorable market conditions and including
the GCNA acquisition. The combined ratio of 94.6% improved by 7.3 points, driven by
lower frequency of claims in large part driven by our action plan over the last few years, as
well as benign weather in the ﬁrst quarter this year. The crisis did not have a material
impact on Q1 results in automobile insurance. And overall, our emphasis remains on
portfolio quality as we focus on maintaining overall proﬁtability levels in 2020.
In Personal Property, premiums grew 12%, driven by favorable market condition, the
GCNA acquisition and unit growth. The combined ratio at 81.8% was the strongest in over
a decade, driven by our actions over time and the mild winter. The crisis did not have an
impact during the quarter and is not expected to have a meaningful impact in 2020.
Personal Property remains well positioned to operate sub-95% even with severe weather.
The Commercial Lines' premium growth of 22% reﬂects the GCNA acquisition as well as
strong market conditions. The combined ratio of 100.7% included 6.6 points, or CAD50
million of direct COVID-19 related losses. Overall, the underlying fundamentals in
Commercial are strong and we're maintaining our focus on underwriting quality. This
business is positioned for low 90s performance over time.
Moving to our US Commercial segment, premiums grew 9% including the GCNA
acquisition. The combined ratio was 100.1%, included 8.5 points of direct COVID-19
related loss provision. While the crisis may add some near-term volatility, the
fundamentals of this segment are trending well towards our goal of sustainable low 90s
performance.

Looking at our IFC underwriting operation for the rest of 2020, one could expect to see a
mid single-digit to low double-digit impact to top line growth from COVID-19 depending
on the severity and duration of the crisis. With the prudent provision we recorded in Q1,
we expect the overall direct impact of the crisis on underwriting income for the rest of the
year to be largely neutral. But given this unprecedented crisis is ongoing, it's of course
diﬃcult to be deﬁnitive on the indirect impact of the economic slowdown in future
periods. And as there is a fair amount of uncertainty as to how the crisis will evolve,
performance by quarter and line of business may be uneven.
Despite the market volatility in March, we ended the quarter with a strong capital position
with MCT above 200% and a capital margin at CAD1.5 billion. Our balance sheet is both
capable of absorbing further meaningful headwinds and is also ﬂexible to act on
opportunities. While it's always diﬃcult to determine the timing, it's clear to me that
market dislocation tends to surface opportunities and we remain watchful.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to strategy, while supporting customers through this crisis is our number one
priority, we continue to execute on our long-term strategy. First, our people are engaged
in responding to customer needs. When the crisis hit, we mobilized at lightning speed.
Over a thousand employees were redeployed across the organization to focus on speciﬁc
initiatives, including the processing of customer relief transaction and supporting our
digital tools and other activities. Across the organization, productivity and collaboration
remain high, and we continue to deliver top notch service to our customers and brokers.
Second, through our digital platform, we're ensuring our customers and brokers have
ease of access in a world where physical contact is disrupted. Since the crisis began,
we've seen for instance electronic payments for claims increase from low-teens to north of
35%, and the proportion of clients who are submitting claims electronically has more than
doubled as well. The usage of our digital tools is a win-win, it drives a better customer
experience and improved eﬃciency for both IFC and our brokers.
Lastly, the integration of GCNA and Frank Cowan is on track as we build a leading North
American specialty platform. Policy conversions are underway. We launched our high net
worth brand Intact Prestige in March. GCNA employees are already integrating with their
Intact colleagues and living our values, and we're on track to meet our ﬁnancial objective
of mid-single NOIPS accretion, including the On Side acquisition by 2021.
In conclusion, our discipline and our work over the past three years meant that we
entered 2020 in a very strong position and our ﬁrst quarter performance is a good proof
point. Our teams have mobilized fast to deal with the COVID-19 crisis and we've provided
signiﬁcant relief to our customers. Our focus is on continuing to provide real help to
customers while advancing our strategies and achieving our ﬁnancial objectives. Our
business is tremendously resilient and we're well positioned to demonstrate that again in
the months and years ahead.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Marcotte.

FINAL

Thanks, Charles, and good morning, everyone. Net operating income per share was
CAD1.61, up from CAD0.73 last year, driven by strong underwriting performance and
distribution results. As good as these results are, let me ﬁrst summarize the impact of the
COVID-19 crisis on our Q1 results. The impact on top line was very limited as the crisis
really began at the end of the quarter. The relief measures have also started after quarter
end.
We took a provision of CAD83 million related to COVID-19 losses, which we have
reported as CATs. This represents a 3-point impact on our IFC combined ratio. Of the
CAD83 million, CAD50 million resides in Canada and CAD33 million in the US, both in
our Commercial Lines. These provisions relate to direct losses from event cancellations,
tuition reimbursements, liability, and speciﬁcally endorsed business interruption in some
of our specialized programs. They represent our best estimate of ultimate losses, based
on the bottom-up assessment of where COVID-19 could trigger a liability, as few claims
have been reported to date.
Although the crisis is still unfolding, we recognize these direct losses early and prudently.
Consequently, for the rest of the year and based on our knowledge today, we believe our
underwriting performance will be largely on track. As we progress through the year, we
will continue to monitor the economic impacts of the crisis and the potential for indirect
losses.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Canada, excluding 2.1 points of COVID-19 losses, the combined ratio of 91.2% was solid,
improving 11.7 points year-over-year, thanks to benign weather, favorable market
conditions and our ongoing proﬁtability actions.
In the US, excluding 8.5 points of COVID-19 losses, we achieved a 91.6% combined ratio,
which reﬂects solid or improving performances across all lines of business.
Net investment income of CAD150 million was up 7% compared to last year, mainly driven
by the impact of higher invested assets following the acquisition of GCNA. We now
expect investment income in 2020 to grow between 1% and 3% compared to 2019, as we
reﬂect the impact of lower interest rates and dividend yields.
Distribution EBITDA and other income grew 20% -- 22% to CAD44 million in the quarter,
driven by the acquisitions of Frank Cowan and On Side. Our growth expectations for
distribution earnings for the year are tempered by the uncertainty resulting from the crisis.
Depending on the length and severity of the crisis, we believe the growth of these
earnings for the full year will be in the upper single-digit to low double-digit range.
I am pleased to see how our business performed in the ﬁrst quarter, delivering strong
operating results despite absorbing the impacts of COVID-19. In particular, I should
underlying the operating ROE of 14% on the last 12 months basis.
Now let me provide some additional color on the underwriting results, beginning with
Canada. In Personal Auto, we saw premium growth of 11% with minimal impact from
COVID-19, as relief measures have been rolled out after quarter end. As I mentioned
Page 5 of 23

earlier, we expect that the premium reductions oﬀered to customers will largely impact
top line in Q2 and Q3. Personal Auto proﬁtability was strong in the ﬁrst quarter at 94.6%
with a 6-point improvement in the underlying current year loss ratio, driven mainly by our
proﬁtability actions as well as better weather conditions. The impact of COVID-19 was
minimal in the quarter as the frequency decline observed throughout the quarter
accelerated at the very end, making it diﬃcult to distinguish between the impact of action
plans, weather and COVID-19. Prior-year development was slightly favorable in the
quarter, a sharp reversal from last year, but in line with our expectations.
In Commercial Lines, excluding 6.6 points of COVID-19 losses, the combined ratio of
94.1% improved 12.6 points on a combination of better weather and proﬁtability actions.
The Canadian expense ratio of 29.3% for the quarter increased 1.2 points from last year,
mainly driven by the business mix and the impact of GCNA.
Turning to US Commercial, the GCNA acquisition added 9 points to our top line in Q1. On
a pure organic basis, excluding the impact of exiting healthcare last year and the
acquisition of GCNA, growth was 10%, thanks to favorable market conditions and new
business.

Bloomberg Transcript

The underlying loss ratio of 51.6% in the quarter improved 3.9 points which was largely
driven by the impact of our proﬁtability actions. Favorable prior-year reserve development
of 2.2% was better than expected with strengths across all ongoing businesses. We
continue to expect little impact from PYD in the near term.
The US expense ratio of 39% was 1.5 points higher than Q1 last year, mainly due to the
addition of GCNA's surety business. The combined ratio in the US of 91.6% ex-COVID-19
related losses was driven by a strong performance in most lines of business. Although the
crisis adds a bit of volatility to our results, we continue to make steady progress on our
proﬁtability improvement plans and target a sustainable combined ratio in the low 90s.
Moving to our non-operating results, we recorded an impairment charge of CAD96
million on our common share portfolio despite the short time period over which we could
observe the price movements. The impairment does not impact book value per share as
the investments are mark to market, but it does aﬀect the ROE.
The eﬀective income tax rate of 27.9% was above expectations and reﬂects a one-time
retroactive change in US tax legislation. Moving forward, we continue to expect our tax
rate to be between 21% and 22%.
Now, a few words on our balance sheet. Our unrealized gains position, which stood at
CAD360 million at the end of 2019, moved to an unrealized loss position of CAD554
million at the end of Q1, mainly from common and preferred shares equities -- preferred
equities. This was partially oﬀset by an improvement in the funding ratio of our pension
plans driven by wider spreads, as well as the strengthening of the US dollar. Overall, this
led to our book value per share declining by 4% sequentially to CAD51.71, a good
outcome in the circumstances.

FINAL

In the face of highly volatile markets, we acted quickly and prudently to strengthen our
capital position, including the issuance of a CAD300 million medium-term note and
unwinding some capital intensive strategies, such as our market neutral strategies. As a
result of our actions, we ended the quarter in a strong ﬁnancial position with CAD1.5
billion of total capital margin. In Canada, our MCT was 202%, and in the US, the RBC
regulatory capital stood at an estimated 393%, both well above minimum required levels.
We have CAD343 million of cash at the holding company and over CAD600 million of
our credit facility is undrawn. Our debt to total capital ratio was 24.1% at March 31st.
However, we are conﬁdent we will return to our target of 20% over the next 18 months to
24 months.
With our resilient operations and strong capital position, we are in a good position to
support our customers throughout this crisis. We are also in a strong position to pay our
dividends, absorb future shocks from capital markets and capture opportunities as they
arise.
Before concluding, let me update you on the unrealized loss position in Q2. I'm happy to
report that the unrealized loss in AOCI has decreased by approximately CAD400 million
on the back of strong equity markets. But keep in mind that spreads have tightened and
this will impact our pension plan funding and could oﬀset some of these gains.

In closing, with a talented team, robust operating platforms, and solid fundamentals,
we're well positioned to deliver shareholder value during these unprecedented times.
With that, I'll give the call back to Ken.

Thank you. Louis. In order to give everyone a chance to participate in the Q&A, we would
ask that you kindly limit yourselves to two questions per person. Of course, if there is time
at the end, you can certainly re-queue for follow-ups. So, Cheryl, we are now ready to take
questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Certainly. (Operator Instructions) The ﬁrst question is from Geoﬀ Kwan of RBC Capital
Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. When I think about I guess how you run each of your business lines
and maybe you try to target certain proﬁt levels, but arguably these aren't normal times
and you've got Personal Auto that could beneﬁt from lower frequency, and Commercial,
where maybe there is potentially higher claims exposures. So when you talk about the
Page 7 of 23



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2020-05-06

premium relief eﬀorts that you guys are doing, are you still talking about kind of a silo
approach to proﬁtability? Or given the circumstances we are in, is it may be taking a little
bit more from a consolidated approach albeit on a temporary basis when making those
decisions on how to allocate the premium reliefs for your customers?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Geoﬀ, that's a really good question and I would say that we entered 2020 in a position of
strength, and that's why we were able to put those measures in place very quickly, and
just to recap, there is ﬁnancing relief here that is provided across the board, and then you
have premium relief that is provided based on change in risk proﬁle, change in behavior
and where real needs exist. We've tempered some of the increases again in the areas
where businesses are most impacted by shutdown, but you know, Geoﬀ, this program is
very much risk-based, it's ﬂexible, and it's based on individual people circumstances, and
our approach to running the business is to look at each line as they stand and do the right
thing for our customers within those lines of business taking into account the
performance of that line.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I would say, in aggregate, subsidization between line of business is not something that
is part of how we're thinking here about this relief eﬀort. It is really based on need, based
on risk proﬁle, and based on what we can do as an organization, and sitting here today,
I'm quite pleased that we've held 390,000 Canadian, and we're probably past 400,000
as we speak, because there is a fair bit of volume and we feel that this is the right thing to
do in this environment. But there is no subsidies between lines of business that are
explicit or even implicit.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay, thanks. And just my other question was, out of the US, we've seen on the Auto side
some data points from Progressive and Geico on whether or not it's claims ratio or
frequency since COVID-19 started. Can you quantify what the impact so far it's been in Q2
to whether or not it's a claims ratio or even if it's just frequency severity for the personal
and commercial auto book?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Geoﬀ, at high level, the impact of the lockdown was most acute towards the end of
March, I'd say last week of March and the ﬁrst few weeks in April, and we have seen from
Telematics data as well as from frequency data for a few weeks there, we've seen ballpark,
a drop in frequency close to 50%, it's been -- in the past couple of weeks though we've
seen driving started to pick up in the 10% to 20% range from the bottom of the lockdown
and with good weather, we expect that to gradually increase.
I think the other thing that one needs to take into account though when you think about
that as a couple of things I think that you can -- one should not assume that severity
doesn't change when frequency drops. There are some severity impacts related to the
crisis itself and we remain prudent in particular in lines of business like accident beneﬁt in
Ontario about the severity impact of not only the lockdown, but the economic
environment.So all in all, I'd say at the depth of the lockdown, we saw a drop in driving of

Page 8 of 23



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2020-05-06

FINAL

about 50%. We've seen the driving increase in the past two weeks in a, I would say,
meaningful way, it's really not back to normal, no doubt about that. And then we're
keeping an eye on severity in that process. So that's going on my take on it. I don't know if
Isabelle want to add anything to that, or Patrick, who is sitting in the claims operation also
on the front line of this, so maybe Isabelle, a bit of color, and then, Patrick.

A - Isabelle Girard

{BIO 21256467 <GO>}

Yeah, sure. Thanks, Charles. I would say that in addition of what Charles mentioned during
the COVID crisis, I think it's also important to note is that pre-COVID frequency was
already decreasing in our portfolio, given our strong action plan that was in place for a
few -- a lot of months already as well as favorable weather in the ﬁrst quarter of 2020, so
frequency was already in decrease by about 15% versus prior-year average.
So I think that's also something that is important to note, and as Charles mentioned
during the peak of the lockdown, frequency decline was higher, but we see in the last two
weeks that driving has picked up and we expect this to, as governments are starting to
remove restrictions and starting to share high level plans to reopen economies.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thank you very much Isabelle. How about you, Patrick?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Not much to have from a claims perspective. There is no real lag between the amount of
driving that we measure from UBI and the intake that we see in the claims operation. So I
would say that the increase in driving from the past two weeks or the 50% of -- or so that
we've seen for a few weeks at the peak mirrors very much the intake we've seen in claims.
So there is no real lag between the two.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks Patrick. And I think, Geoﬀ, we have been working hard to push our
Telematics program in the past three years, it is close to 40% of new business. This gives
us tremendous insight in driving. But it also means that embedded in the product and
embedded in a portion of the portfolio, the amount of driving that people do is actually in
part reﬂected with how we price in particular with Telematics and I would add that on top
of the relief measures that have taken place. Thanks, Geoﬀ.

Q - Michael Wayne Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Yeah, hey, thanks, good morning, everybody. I think Louis mentioned part of the A3 [ph]
for COVID. I think you said really speciﬁc endorsements for BI, and if I heard you correctly,
I hope it's what you said. And so I guess, does that mean that excluding those speciﬁc
endorsements that you probably wouldn't have had any exposure to business
interruption? And I guess, if so, does that mean then that I guess I'm trying to get you to
maybe quantify any kind of exclusions you might have in your policies as (inaudible) talk
about that down here in the US about speciﬁc endorsements and versus exclusions for
viruses, so I just don't know the percent of maybe your policies that have these exclusions
and how that might diﬀer for your Canadian business versus the OneBeacon business?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, so. Thanks, Mike. Key question indeed, I would say, 99.5% of our policies would not
provide coverage for pandemic and I'll let Darren maybe give a bit of perspective on the
CAD83 million per se, which is not really driven by business interruption, it is one of the
elements that make up the CAD83 million and may be Darren, you want to provide a
perspective on business interruption in particular in the US portfolio to Mike's question.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Darren Christopher Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Sure, absolutely. Thanks, Charles. So Mike, as we mentioned, I mean, consistent with our
past practices of reserving major events quickly and clearly this is a rather major event. I
mean we took a very prudent approach to recognizing at the end of Q1, the ultimate view
of our direct COVID losses. As you mentioned, obviously our best estimate at this point is
CAD83 million. I should point out though that this has really not been -- that estimate is
not being driven by claims activity to date. We've only seen less than CAD10 million of
incurred activity, but we undertook a very extensive bottom-up ﬁle-by-ﬁle exercise to get a
really good understanding of where exposure is understood to exist.
So when we look at the CAD83 million, CAD50 million relates to Canada, CAD33 million
relates to the US, and I'll get into the BI component here in a moment. If we look at some
of the key categories of our COVID-19 exposure, and there's really, I would say, four major
components. First of all, liability exposure. We understand, we know that certain
businesses in the commercial space have been impacted by COVID-19. Now, remember
that for liability for CGL, negligence has to be proven. So therefore, duty to defend is
clearly an exposure that exists for us. Both in the US and in Canada, entertainment line of
business has some exposure, mostly related to production shutdowns, but also event
cancellations, and then in the US, tuition reimbursement, we could see some exposure
there as well.
And then lastly, as you referenced, we do have some specialized programs where
pandemic-related business interruption coverage is extended. But as Charles indicated,
that's less than half a point in our portfolio. If I look at how our US portfolio, and obviously
business interruption comes with the property form, property coverage. And when we
look at our various diﬀerent lines of business in the US, roughly 15% of our US portfolio
actually has property forms of which a good two-thirds of that is actually excess property.
So when we back out the excess property, we're really looking at less than 5% of our
portfolio has property which ultimately then has an extension of business interruption. If I
Page 10 of 23

FINAL

compare that to Canada, which is obviously more main street, roughly 40% of the
portfolio has property coverage with a corresponding business interruption coverage as
well.
So when we look at our coverage forms, the coverage that we have in the US is very
consistent with industry practice and industry language which is surrounding the
requirement of physical damage by an insured peril to trigger business interruption,
together with a virus exclusion, which was introduced well over a decade ago, and as I
say, consistent with US practices.
On the Canadian side, our coverage -- we're very, very comfortable with our language, it's
very clear and the courts really have determined that loss of use absent physical damage
does not trigger business interruption coverage, I mean beyond this ﬁrst line of defense,
we have exclusions in our policy language that make it very clear that the inability to use
or access a property even in times such like this in a lockdown does not qualify for
coverage that is very unique or similar I should say to our US position as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we're very, very comfortable with where we sit from our coverage position today. It's
well understood by governments, by brokers, by customers that in the vast majority of
cases, which as we indicated, 99.5% of our policies, business interruption coverage would
not be triggered by the pandemic.
One last point that I would make, Mike, is that again, business interruption is a covered
peril under our property CAT reinsurance treaty. So assuming we do end up more than
our retention of multiple claims and we're not all that view at this time today, we believe
that there is a reasonable scenario that we would present this as a re-insured event.
So lot of information there, but that's sort of a breakdown in terms of where we sit from a
coverage position both in Canada and in the US.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

We think the position is quite solid. And I think Darren's point is that there are many layers
of protection here and where speciﬁc coverage works provided we've largely reserved it
for in Q1 already, which would be on less than 0.5% of our portfolio.

Q - Meny Grauman

{BIO 15238080 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Just wondering if there is any political pressure to increase premium
support or make it broader to all policyholders on the Personal Auto side of the business.
And then just more broadly if you could just talk about the regulatory landscape because
of COVID coming out of COVID and how you see that, is there any changes you see on
the horizon because of this pandemic?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So we are -- I'm talking with regulators and elected oﬃcial on a weekly or biweekly basis
across the board to share with them what we're seeing in the ﬁeld. I think that there is a lot
of relief that is provided by the industry across North America and certainly in personal
lines, which I'm more familiar with across Canada. And I think that regulators in general
recognized that this is going in the right direction. I think that it is early in the process and
people want to make sure that Canadians have access to this relief in personal automobile
in particular and in personal property.
Political pressure, I think is a strong word here, but I think we all share the view that relief
needs to be provided. There's a lot of traction and I think the regulators want to make
sure in my mind that indeed Canadians take advantage of these measures. That's the ﬁrst
point, but very cooperative relationships at this stage. And the second point on the
regulatory landscape, no major changes at this stage, I would say that where reforms were
in the pipeline, because the key issues in automobile insurance today, in my mind, if you
take Ontario, if you take Alberta, if you take the Maritimes to a certain extent is rooted in
the fact that the product that is designed by the governments have been a big source of
inﬂation in the last few years, as you know, I mean, we've talked about that a fair bit.
There are proposals on the table across most jurisdictions and it is likely that we will see
some change in the coming year or two. And in my mind, important to put in place to
further provide access to the product at a reasonable price, there is no change at this
stage. Some jurisdictions are saying, no, we are going ahead with the reforms. Other
jurisdictions are focused on other things at the moment and it's completely
understandable, but no major change from a regulatory point of view as far as, I can tell. I
don't know, Isabelle, if you have a diﬀerent perspective here or other members of the
team?

A - Isabelle Girard

{BIO 21256467 <GO>}

No, I would say, Charles, I agree with your comment. I would add that all the regulators
were open for discussion on relief measures as soon as the crisis started and that is true
for all the jurisdictions in Canada. So we are really in regular contact with them to ensure
that they understand our relief eﬀort, and we keep them advised of our actions on in that
regards.

Yeah, no, exactly. There's 10, in the US, a number of states have issued moratorium on
primarily underwriting measures and so on. And quite frankly, many of those measures
make sense. I don't know, Darren, if you have a diﬀerent perspective or any color you
want to add there. But that is COVID driven and nothing in there is not things that we're
doing already.

A - Darren Christopher Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

No, I would agree, Charles. I think we've seen a number of moratoriums in diﬀerent states
in the US, very much consistent with processes and practices that we had in place in the
US. I think the only other thing I would add from a US standpoint is this notion of
prospective pandemic coverage with several discussions around that at the federal level
to look to create federally funded programs to provide prospective pandemic coverage
similar to other programs that have been established in the past, obviously industry
bodies, very much in communication with the federal government working through that.
So that's probably just another nuance that I would add from a US standpoint.

Q - Meny Grauman

{BIO 15238080 <GO>}

Just in terms of the follow-up on that, the question is to what extent you see the risk of -you're clear that the market should continue to harden after maybe a brief pause, but
could you be in some situation where because of a deep recession because of political
will, it's just not -- the political side of it will not allow for that on the Personal Auto side in
particular?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, I think that you are saying on the Personal Auto side in particular, I think the answer
in my mind is the reforms I've just talked about, I think that the industry has suggested
over the past few years across the land very speciﬁc concrete measures that would bring
relief in the system. And I think the answer now and the answer coming out of this is to
put those reform measures in place as the best possible way to reﬂect the environment in
which we operate. So I think the better answer here in my mind is is reforms. And keep in
mind, automobile insurance is regulated today, and the pricing process in automobile
insurance is a back and forth. And I think that that will keep happening in the coming
period. I think if people push in ways that become uneconomical to right automobile
insurance, you'll see a severe capacity shortage in the marketplace and I think nobody
wins in that environment.
And keep in mind, automobile insurance coming in this crisis maybe not as much for
Intact but for the industry in aggregate, the industry was operating automobile insurance
with a combined ratio above 100%. In 2019, the industry's combined ratio was probably in
the 103%, 104% range in automobile insurance and so I think applying pressure in ways
that would create a deeper issue there for the industry in my mind is a recipe for a big
capacity shortage and I don't think you want that in this environment. That's why we

{BIO 6329080 <GO>}

Good morning, Charles. In terms of the current environment, I know that there is a little bit
of unwillingness to try to look out in terms of what the environment means, but does this
change your outlook for M&A in terms of whether or not there's going to be greater
dislocation from the rest of participants in the industry?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, I think that, John, you know us well. We've had this thesis of consolidation for many
years. We have said that we felt that in the mid term we see a good 15 points to 20 points
of consolidation and I think this environment is a meaningful source of dislocation in my
mind not only here but abroad and globally, and I think that this only exacerbates or
solidify our thesis when it comes to consolidation, and I think that Louis, Ken and team
have done a fantastic job with the investment guys and our capital management guys to
make sure that, A, we can absorb a real bad crisis, but also be able to be on the oﬀensive
at the same time, and that's really how I feel we're positioned now and I think the thesis
we've laid out a number of years ago is certainly stronger today than it was three months
ago.

Q - John Aiken

{BIO 6329080 <GO>}

Understood. And Charles, as we wait for that dislocation, are there any particular areas
where you're deploying capital, where you think you can gain market share organically in
the meantime?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. So I think that, and by the way. John, I just want to point out that as we wait for
consolidation, we closed our last transaction ﬁve months ago and so we're -- as we wait,
we are deeply in integration process at this stage. And I want to point out this integration
is going quite well, actually, we're quite pleased with where we are even though the
environment has changed.
You know, capital priorities, John, I mean, clearly we've laid out the roadmap in the fall
about the next decade of Intact and one of the things we said is priority number one is
capital deployment to strengthen our position here in Canada. And that's true in
manufacturing and it's true in distribution. Priority number two, and it's becoming
increasingly relevant, is to solidify our position as one of the leading and best specialty

performance of that business is low 90s and I feel really good that after all the heavy
lifting that Mike Miller and team have done in the past three years that we are very much
in that zone and in an outperformance zone. And I think that we are quite open and

line is open.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, thanks, good morning. First question is related to the bottom-up assessments of
direct losses where COVID could create some claims. I appreciate the color around that.
One thought is, how far did you look out in terms of developing that bottom-up
assessment? Was this related to events and production shutdown for the next three
months or is it something further out beyond 2020, for example?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, the lens we've taken is one of saying, if we look at this crisis, the shutdown,. the
implications of the shutdown, which parts of our portfolio will be subjected to a direct loss
as a result of COVID-19 per se, not so much as a result of an economic slowdown, which is
what we call indirect losses, and this is the lens that we have used to construe our
portfolio in Canada and in the US to come up with this bottom-up exposure as opposed
to extrapolating claims reported to date, which is a big diﬀerence, and so I'll ask Darren to
give a bit of color on that.

A - Darren Christopher Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yeah. So, Jaeme, when we look at the indirect eﬀects, I mean, clearly, we can see that
these are possible throughout the recovery, but clearly from where we sit today, much
harder to predict. Now while we've seen economic contraction before, our business has
proven to be quite resilient in past economic downturn. So when we look at potential
contraction of the recovery and we look at it by line of business. I would say in personal
lines, ﬁrst of all, we might see some limited severity pressure and that's mostly around
social distancing requirements virus prevention measures in the claims fulﬁllment process.
But we don't see this has been material, but it's one that we continue to watch.

The area that we'll obviously be very vigilant is the commercial lines, both in the US and in
Canada. So let me give you a few examples here. If we can think about property,
potentially, we will see an increase in vacant properties and with that comes the potential
for moral hazard. When you look at CGL and and liability, we potentially see an increase in
the litigious environment in areas such as employment practices liability and ﬁnancial
services surrounding market volatility just as a couple of examples. And then I would
bring another example around contract surety, which is clearly linked to the health of the
construction industry. While we do expect to see heavy government stimulus and
infrastructure spending in construction, contract surety can be impacted by an economic
slowdown. So I think at this point, we're simply highlighting the risk of potential indirect
losses at this time, and to be clear, we have not seen anything to date. But clearly, we
remain very, very vigilant in particular in commercial lines. And obviously as the recovery
progresses, we'll continue to keep you up-to-date on what we see. But as I said at this
point in time, we don't see anything, but the risk is there.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Louis, any color you want to provide?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Well, just a bit on the entertainment and the event cancellation, trying to ﬁgure out how
far ahead we're estimating here. In fact, the notion of a bottom-up is actually having
reviewed every single insured policy that we have in our book and some of them have
canceled their events, they are fully provided for if they have not rescheduled because if
they do reschedule, the liability goes away, but it was a ﬁle-by-ﬁle work that was done for
every single insured that we have in entertainment. Where events have not yet been
canceled because they are further out in the future, we took an estimate of how much
payouts we could have, applied the probability of cancellation there, but it was not based
on time, it was more based on what are the insured or the policies that we have in place
and then the likelihood of cancellation because they are extended in the future, but it was
really policy-by-policy from the event cancellation coverage.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So I think what you want to take out of this in my mind is, we looked at the portfolio and
we said the direct impact that we expect here let's try to account for that now as much as
we can. We're ﬂagging that in a slow, low economic environment, even though our
business is very resilient, we need to keep an eye on indirect losses. It would be really
hard to -- I mean you can't reserve for that, you just need to keep an eye on it as the
situation evolves and we wanted to be very transparent with you guys that these are the
sort of things we'll keep an eye on as this crisis evolves.
On the direct losses per se, we put our best foot forward, tried to be as rigorous as
possible. You expect ﬁne tuning on that point in Q2 and probably in Q3, but at this stage,
we put our best foot forward and tried to be as rigorous as we could in doing that. And
we all and you all recognize that this is a new environment in which most people are
operating and that will come with bumps here and there, but we tried to go as fast as we
can to develop a perspective on it and reserve accordingly.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Charles, I just want to clarify, In Canada, I guess your policies for business
interruption does not have a virus exclusion. I guess that's what I think I heard. And if so, I
guess my question is, is the protection purely based upon having a physical kind of
damage to the building? Actually, i know there's a lot of discussion down here in the US
that that's a potential risk area here that courts could potentially decide that the virus is in
fact a physical damage to a building.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Brian. The primary defense is indeed a direct physical loss. And as we've
mentioned, the common law is very strong in Canada on that front. Then the product as a
second layer of exclusions not speciﬁcally focused on the virus per se, but focused on the
fact that if you can't use your property, if you don't have access to your property, pretty
much whatever the reason, there is no coverage for BI interruption as a second layer of
defense. Then you have other elements of exclusion as well, which I won't get into in the
product and so while we don't think the -- we think that is extremely remote that we need
to invoke the second and third layer of defense if we had to in an extreme scenario, there
are other solid arguments to defend that position as well.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great, that's very, very helpful. And then I'm just curious, I know, Darren, you talked a little
bit about the surety potential indirect exposure here with an economic downturn. Do you
have any kind of numbers or anything you can give us with respect to the guarantee book
and how that performed during the ﬁnancial crisis, the surety business?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, Darren, do you want to take this one?

A - Darren Christopher Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yeah, sure. Hi Brian. When we look at our surety business in North America, roughly
CAD0.5 billion is the portfolio in Canada, US. Obviously, the contract surety piece is the
portion of the portfolio that is the most sensitive, as you all know, and that's just under
CAD300 million that particular portfolio. That portfolio today is in a very strong position
and it was very well positioned going into the crisis. So we could see some pressure both
Page 17 of 23

FINAL

in the near term and over the period of economic contraction, both in terms of costs but
also in terms of the economic slowdown.
Now the ﬂip side, obviously, we do expect to see strong government stimulus and
infrastructure to support the construction industry, but your reference back '08-'09, is a
really good one. And if we look back over that period of time, where we would say that
there was less government support at the time provided to the construction industry and
if we look at industry results during that time, combined ratios sort of pushed into the mid
90s.
So again, strong underlying performance. Yes, felt some pressure in '08-'09, but I would
say still within manageable levels. Obviously, in addition to that, we do have reinsurance
protection in place on the surety book to provide protection on large losses. That's
another layer of protection that we have. So I think when I'm looking at the longer-term
horizon. surety portfolio has shown to be very resilient in economic cycles. And if things
get worse, we have reinsurance protection in place. So from where we sit today, we don't
see this as a key issue for IFC during this crisis.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

But certainly something, Brian, something we are watching of course with great intensity
and we'll give you guys an update at upcoming quarters as the economy changes, but the
thing to keep in mind with construction is that before the crisis, this sector was red hot.
And so there was a lot of demand. And we think government response will compensate
to a certain extent the pressure that might come from the economic slowdown, but clearly
an area to keep an eye on.

Hi Tom.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks. First a question on tax probably for Louis and then a question on premium
volumes maybe for Charles. With respect to tax, the operating tax rate was 22.6% and I
think it included expense of CAD9 million or about 3 points related to some US tax
legislative changes. Is that considered to be a one-time -- one-timer, so if we take that out,
Page 18 of 23



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

Date: 2020-05-06

we would have had operating tax rate of 19.6%, is that correct? And is that, what should
we be thinking about operating taxes going forward given this? And then we'll get in the
premium volume question.

FINAL

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So on the tax front, you're right, it's a -- for us, it's a one-time event. So it's a retroactive
change to some legislation where the US government has made their views more precise
and we had to adjust for that, it's roughly CAD9 million overall, it was aﬀecting operating
and non-operating tax rates, roughly three points, as you said, in the operating tax. I
would say here, our expectation, generally speaking, is to be somewhere between 20%
and 22% on the tax rate. It ﬂuctuates on a quarterly basis as you know depending on the
nature of the results, how they're combined. But our view here that doesn't change that
this is a one-time item and where we would adjust for it and continue estimating between
20% and 22%.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, that's great. And then second, with respect to premium volumes, there is a CAD130
million I think of premium relief measures kind of in place and they're going to expire at
the end of June. So maybe the ﬁrst question on that, what's your thinking behind the
CAD200 million or more and how much longer -- how did you come to that and how
much longer do you have that extending to? And then in addition, as a follow-up on that,
in addition to the premium relief measures, what other headwinds do you see that would
impact premium volumes going forward?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, Tom, this is a question that is multifaceted. So, we have provided over CAD130
million so far to close to 400,000 people and businesses. We -- when we say June 30,
what we're saying is that given where we are, given our assessment of the situation, we
will grant relief until June 30, and then we'll reassess depending on where the world is
and that relief will impact not the performance until June 30. It will impact probably Q2
and Q3, quite frankly, because if you come to us and you need help in late May or early
June, we'll give you help and provide -- probably give you three months' worth of help as
we do that. So the CAD200 million that's been put out there is an assessment today of
how much premium relief will be provided, and on top of that, there is a bit of ﬁnancing
relief as well and we think that the bulk of that will impact the direct written premium in
Q2 and then in Q3 to a certain extent and will be earned shortly thereafter. Our program
is risk-based, it's ﬂexible, you know, it depends on how many customers come to us and
so far it's been very, very successful.
I think we've put our best foot forward and I think as the weeks advance down, we'll look
at the environment, we'll look at people's behavior and we'll decide if we take a diﬀerent
stance in the marketplace. But we're not there at this stage, we're clearly leading on this
relief process and we'll reassess in the coming weeks. But I would say, you got to think
about that in terms of impacting Q2 and Q3 direct written premium and I would say three
quarters of which you should think about in personal lines and a quarter of which in
commercial lines. That's the ﬁrst point I would make.

Page 19 of 23



FINAL

Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2020-05-06

Headwinds from a top line point of view, I would say you ought to think about a couple of
things beyond relief. One is the impact that the slowing economy will have on the units
and I would say that the impact that it will have on the units or the number of customers is
expected to be felt to a greater extent in commercial lines. So, on one hand, you've got
more relief in relative terms in personal lines. On the other hand, I think you have more
pressure from a unit growth point of view in commercial lines. Then the third thing that
you ought to anticipate in primarily in commercial lines, I would say, is the pressure that
comes from how much you insure yourself, meaning the amount of insurance, which is
driven by your business activity, which is driven by the size of your ﬂeet and things of that
nature. And I think that this will play out in the coming year. We're not sure exactly what
that will be, but we know it is a pressure point.
So when I came out in April, and I said, we expect that the impact on the top line will be
between low single-digit to low double-digit, this really anticipated those there
components. We're sitting here today and in a moderate scenario which we think is the
scenario we're in, we think that the hit to the top line will likely be mid single-digit, maybe
a bit above mid single-digit but at that point in the range and if I can help you think
through that, our perspective is that it's likely to be mid-single digit across personal lines
and commercial lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

In personal lines, it will be more driven by relief, the hit that is. In commercial lines, it's
likely to be more driven by units. This is an informed judgment. We've done a fair bit of
modeling, and there are a number of scenarios. But that would be the best way for me to
help you think through what that means in practice from a top line point of view.

Yeah. So it's about three quarters personal lines, one quarter commercial lines, and in
terms of collections, I guess is the point that you're making, we have provided in
commercial lines in terms of ﬁnancing relief in commercial lines, you know what, I don't
have that number in front of me right now and maybe it's something we can come back
to. I don't have a speciﬁc perspective on commercial -- on ﬁnancing relief in commercial
lines.

Q - Paul David Holden

Okay. But those are the kind of data you put together to come up with your mid singledigit impact on commercial units, that conclusion?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Darren Christopher Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yes, maybe Paul, it's Darren here. I can just add a little bit around sort of some of the
forms of relief that we are providing in commercial lines. So, and there's really three
diﬀerent elements there. When we look at mid term, so middle of term we're enabling
customers to come back to us and say, hey, my revenues are down, my payrolls down, can
I adjust my coverage accordingly, can I adjust my premium base accordingly? So we're
making those changes mid term. Similarly, on the auto side, with ﬂeets parking vehicles
that aren't in use, traditional things that we would tend to do more at the end of the term,
but we're making adjustments at the middle of the term. We are tempering rate increases
in commercial lines, and in fact, we've identiﬁed about a third of our portfolio that small to
medium businesses that are most impacted by the current crisis and on renewals for
those customers, we're going six months as is, in other words, no change in terms,
conditions, pricing. So that's another form of relief that we're providing on the
commercial line standpoint and that will all feed into some of that top line pressure that
Charles was referring to.

Q - Paul David Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

And any sense of how long that commercial lines' top line pressure might last for, that
seems like it could be something with a little bit more legs to it than obviously just a few
quarters, but maybe something that lasts in the 2021 as well.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, I think it's very much dependent on your perspective of how long will be in a
meaningful economic contraction and when the recovery will take hold. So it depends on
the scenario quite frankly. In the moderate scenario I think you know the pressure less
than 2021 and will still be pressure in a moderate scenario though we wouldn't qualify it
as a signiﬁcant from a top line point of view in commercial lines at this stage.

line is open.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

I'll be quick, Charles. Thinking longer term here, do you see any meaningful impact on
auto miles driven, and now that people have become really accustomed to not working in
the more formal settings, do you see any long-term implications and how is the company
positioned for that?

Bloomberg Transcript

So, Mario, that's a big one, right, because it talks about behaviors of people and we've
done a bit of work on what the permanent impact of COVID could be and we are in the
process of thinking through mid term talking three years here, how our strategic
positioning should or could change and I think that on one hand, the opportunity to work
from home is something that obviously will have greater importance in the future. The ﬂip
side of this, Mario, is the fact that you could argue that the usage of public transportation
might come down at the same time, and so there is a say a return to normalcy eﬀect which
might last within a year, and I think we don't want to opine on that at this stage though
we're surprised to see the driving pick up so quickly towards the end of the period, but if I
think about it mid to longer term, I think that it is a matter of looking at how people will
move in relationship with coming to work for those who come to work versus how many
more people will work from home.
I think in aggregate, it's probably fair to assume that there'll be a fair bit less driving in the
long run. However, again, I think if people don't feel the pressure to live close to the city
and if people don't use the public transportation as much I think, that's an oﬀset here, and
I think that with UBI, with some of the work that we've done on the data front with our
broad distribution platform with the fact that we're leading in commercial automobile as
well. And on the ﬂeet side of things, we feel, Mario, that from a transportation point of
view, we have fair bit of optionality and we have a fair bit of optionality because a few
years back we started to have this discussion about where the world was going in
relationship with transportation and clearly this is a new vector, but we have optionality.
Should miles driven compress on a permanent fashion, clearly the growth proﬁle of
transportation changes, but this is where the move we've made a few years back to really
bolster our presence in commercial and in specialty lines and the growth that might come
from there In my mind is a clear long-term macro oﬀset to anything that can happen on
the transportation side of things.
