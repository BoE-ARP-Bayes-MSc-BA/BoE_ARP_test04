Officer.
Before I turn the call over to Albert, I will remind everyone that the statements made
during this call, including the question-and-answer session, which are not historical facts,
may be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements
relating to the expected benefits of the offer for Novae, background to and reasons for
the offer, information on the prospects of AXIS or Novae, and future capital expenditures,
expenses, revenues, earnings, synergies, economic performance and future prospects.
Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties that could significantly
affect expected results and are based on certain key assumptions. Many factors could
cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forwardlooking statements, including risks relating to the successful integration of Novae with the
company, higher-than-anticipated costs relating to the integration of Novae, investment
required in Novae to realize expected benefits, and facts relating to Novae that may
impact the timing or amount of benefit realized from the offer that are unknown to the
company.
AXIS expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release any updates or revisions
to these forward-looking statements to reflect any change in Novae's expectations with
regards thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any
statement is based after the date of this presentation or to keep any other information
contained in this presentation up to date. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be
placed on the forward-looking statements, which speak only of the date of this
presentation. In addition, we urge you to review the other disclaimers set forth in the
presentation here, materials including the responsibility under the United Kingdom rules

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Albert.

Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Linda, and good morning, everyone. This is Albert Benchimol from AXIS
Capital. Thank you all for joining this call. We're very excited about the news issued last
night about AXIS' proposal to acquire Novae. This represents a new milestone in the
continued evolution of AXIS as a 21st century specialty insurer and reinsurer. As you'll hear
in more detail during the call today, this is both strategically and financially compelling.
Let me share some of the highlights and I'm doing so on slide 2. This acquisition is
strongly aligned with our strategic vision for AXIS Insurance with low execution risk. It
increases our scale and leadership in international specialty insurance. It brings to the
table a highly complementary portfolio of business, which enables enhanced growth for
the combined entity. It significantly strengthens our distribution platform, and not only
does this deliver all of the aforementioned strategic benefits, but it is also financially
compelling for AXIS shareholders. We'll spend more time on these points throughout the
call.

On slide 3, we show the key terms, structure, financing, and timing for the proposed
acquisition of Novae. The proposed transaction is a 100% acquisition of Novae Group Plc
at a price of 700 pence per share in cash for a total equity value of $604 million. This
represents 1.5 times Novae's tangible book value as of December 31, 2016, and a 29%
(sic) [20%] premium to the 30-day average closing price as of yesterday.
The transaction is, of course, subject to all customary regulatory approvals, as well as
approval by Novae's shareholders. We've expected the completion in the fourth quarter
of this year. Matthew Fosh, who's here on the call with us today, will be appointed
Executive Chair, Europe and Rob Forster, who is Novae's Chief Underwriting Officer, will
be appointed to a senior underwriting management role on the leadership team for AXIS
Insurance's International Division here in London. We're excited to welcome the Novae
team to AXIS and believe that their expertise in the London international specialty
markets will be valuable in ensuring a smooth integration and driving the success of the
AXIS-Novae combination.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to slide 4, many of you have followed our story. As you can see from this slide,
much has been accomplished since our inception in 2001 and indeed in recent years.
We've delivered compound annual growth in diluted book value per share adjusted for
dividends of over 12% since 2002. We've achieved an excellent value creation through the
execution of a clear strategy rooted in being a leader in specialty insurance and
reinsurance businesses. Critical to this execution is portfolio optimization.
For those of you who know us, we've been delivering very diligently on a plan to deliver
less volatile, more consistent performance across our portfolio with superior returns. As
we move through this presentation, you'll see a number of parallels to the Novae story,
and that's one of the key reasons that we believe that this combination will be successful.
Before I introduce Matthew Fosh, CEO of Novae, I do want to say that we've been
following Novae for many years and we've been very impressed with the work that you
and your team, Mathew, have done to focus Novae to make it more profitable and to
really position it as a very strong leader in the Lloyd's market. I think this is a perfect
combination of our businesses to create a London market leader, and I welcome you and
your team to AXIS. Matthew?

Matthew Kailey Fosh

{BIO 2270793 <GO>}

Well, thank you, Albert. And good day, ladies and gentlemen. Just to look at the two slides
that I have here in front of you to give you a sense of Novae that perhaps you don't know
that well. We are a Lloyd's business, a pure Lloyd's business, and we are one of the top
players in Lloyd's. You can see there on the top right $1.2 billion of gross premium written
in 2016. You'll note here the diversity across the three divisions there below, and I'll come
to second in the changes that we've undertaken there to make the business fit for the
world that it is now rather than it was, I'll come to that in a second.
Novae has an established reputation as a leader in the London marketplace. We are top
10 syndicate at Lloyd's and an operating history of over 30 years, we were founded in the

Page 3 of 16

FINAL

mid-1980s. And a return on equity averaging 13.2% over the last five years after adjusting
for the recent Ogden rate changes which impacted the 2016 results. But other than that,
13.2% over the last five. In terms of investment portfolio, we have a high quality liquid
investment portfolio and we have 350 employees primarily in London. So that's the
background of the whole business.
If you turn to that next slide, it gives you a sense of the detail behind that. Recently, we
announced plans to refocus our portfolio on a select group of core classes. Now, that is a
plan that â€“ we completed that plan in May and it's been underway for a while. Basically,
what it means is saying, you need in today's market to focus on those classes where you
have a demonstrable and sustainable competitive advantage.
As the markets got tougher, so you need to focus on where you could add value and
bring relevance to the brokers and so on. And that you see going on here in the bottom
right-hand corner, you see that dark area where we show the growth over time, over four,
five years, of those invest classes, where we have a proven track record. And that's what
we talk about for the invest and maintain classes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now we've demonstrated our commitment to a portfolio that delivers consistent,
sustainable and attractive returns by doing the difficult thing of exiting over Â£130 million of
gross written premium over that same period, while growing our invest and maintain
classes by over Â£550 million over those four, five years you see there. And that's what
you need to do. As the markets got tougher, you've had to be ever clearer about where
you have a competitive advantage.
And we believe the portfolio, as it stands today, fits perfectly with AXIS, the AXIS strategic
vision. And we think, by putting the two together, the combine (09:39) is uniquely
positioned now to maximize the potential of Novae and we can leverage the tremendous
assets that AXIS has, the reach, the bandwidth, the management bench strength and all
that, which allows us to exploit the advantages of having created the portfolio that we
have now. So, we're very excited.
Peter, you're next, I think.

Peter W. Wilson

{BIO 4267902 <GO>}

Thank you, Matthew. I think you'll be able to tell from the comments that Matthew has
made and then the comments that I will make from the AXIS perspective why we view this
as such a compelling combination.
I'd like to turn your attention to slide 7, if you will. I'll spend some time discussing just how
strongly this acquisition aligns with the AXIS Insurance strategy. We value expertise and
insight in specialty risks. Together, AXIS and Novae create a top 10 Lloyd's franchise with
an established reputation as a leader in the London market. Novae's underwriting teams
bring deep expertise and attractive classes, which AXIS has been looking to grow, such as
specialty property facilities, marine liability and cyber. The addition of these talented
underwriters gives us a chance to take more lead positions and also brings long-standing
Page 4 of 16

Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2017-07-06

FINAL

relationships with over 650 cover holders, providing increased access to attractive, more
consistent small account business.
Portfolio optimization is also critical to our strategy. Novae's business is largely
complementary to AXIS' existing portfolio, bringing the benefit of diversification without
significant attrition. And it's not just Novae's portfolio that is additive to our business,
Novae also brings an appreciation of innovation, having broader number of new products
to market, including the first computer prime products. The access to rich underwriting
data can also be leveraged to optimize both portfolios and improve underwriting, pricing
and claims insights.
Novae has an underwriting culture that is focused, disciplined and highly compatible with
the AXIS vision. Strategic relationships with our business partners are important to us. In
addition to increasing the AXIS profile at Lloyd's, this transaction will also increase scale
and relevance with our strategic broker partners and third-party capital providers. Its
market-leading binder business provides the potential to extend in other lines, as well as
unique franchise and attractive local UK specialty business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, we can't thrive as a business without an efficient operating platform. Through this
combination, opportunities arise to increase operating efficiency and drive meaningful
cost synergies and top line growth. We'll be able to leverage recent investments already
made in our London and Lloyd's operations. Novae's market-leading binder operations,
when combined with AXIS, has greater scale to support efficiency investments and
expansion into other lines or risks. And AXIS' company platform creates flexibility for
Novae's clients and distribution partners with the potential to reduce acquisition costs.
I'd ask you to now to turn to slide 8. Slide 8 with the acquisition of Novae, AXIS will
increase its scale and market relevance in the international specialty insurance space. The
pro forma company will be a $2 billion player in the London specialty market, a top 10
insurer at Lloyd's and a leading underwriter of attractive binder business at Lloyd's.
Furthermore, we meaningfully enhanced our position in the emerging cyber insurance
space, strengthening our leading Global Professional Lines franchise, all in addition to
AXIS' position as a top 10 U.S. excess and surplus lines player.
If I turn over to slide 9, we set out a summary of the pro forma business mix on slide 9.
You can see that Novae increases the contribution of specialty insurance. Lloyd's and
international specialty insurance business to AXIS, which is consistent with the strategic
vision we set out for AXIS. The pro forma business writes over $6 billion of gross
premium, of which 61% is insurance business, 24% is from Lloyd's and 51% is written
outside the U.S. in Bermuda.
Turning to slide 10. The table on slide 10 demonstrates the complementarity of our two
portfolios. Novae's premier marine and cyber franchises provide AXIS with deeper and
broader underwriting expertise in these invest classes. And the combination with Novae
brings us lead capabilities in these and many other specialty classes. Novae also brings a
number of new classes to our portfolio, including a UK and European property business,

Page 5 of 16

Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2017-07-06

FINAL

focused on SME and specialty homeowners, which is additive to our existing property
book.
As we dug deeper into the profile of our respective portfolios, it was remarkable just how
complimentary we found these portfolios today. Not all of these can be captured in this
table, where Novae is strong, has presence, leadership and/or scale, we tend not to be in
the business line, and are subscale or want to grow, where Novae writes a large portion
of a class of business under binders, we are no more oriented towards open market
business. Therefore, levels of pure overlap are surprisingly low. We're comfortable with
the benefits combining our two portfolios more than offset any impact or of any overlaps.
Turning to slide 11. It shows combination with AXIS will enhance Novae's top line growth in
multiple ways. These include access to more distribution channels for certain lines,
including UK and European property facilities and associated UK liability business; access
to broader â€“ let's say, the broader Lucas (15:21) platform â€“ I guess, we can say the AXIS
platform; the ability to write larger lines and retain more business; increased relevance
with strategic brokers and increased reinsurance purchasing power and optimization. We
also believe there are select opportunities to advance AXIS Reinsurance plans for Lloyd's.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, the combination may allow AXIS and Novae to expand our third-party capital
initiatives, which allow us to do more for our clients and deliver attractive fee income.
And finally on slide 12, shows the combined company will also benefit from the
significantly enhanced distribution platform, featuring increased relevance and scale with
Lloyd's brokers. Further, we'll have greater access to more stable, attractive binding
authority business through Novae's market-leading binder distribution network of over
650 coverholders. With more than 50% of Novae's business produced through
coverholders, pro forma AXIS specialty or specialist distribution will grow from 14% to 27%
of premium written. Additionally, Novae's binder relationships will allow us access
attractive SME and personal lines businesses, diversifying our distribution network while
strengthening relationships with key Lloyd's brokers.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Albert, who'll discuss the financial merits of the transaction
for AXIS and our shareholders.

Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Peter. Our conviction with respect to the strategic merits of this transaction is
matched by our belief in the significant value creation opportunity for AXIS shareholders,
many of whom are on this call. We believe emphatically that this is the financially
compelling transaction. As you heard from Peter, there is a long list of well-identified
revenue synergies, which we believe substantially offset any overlap between the
businesses. We've also identified $50 million of run rate pre-tax cost savings, which
include very little from front-office functions, such as underwriting and claims. And we are
confident that these cost savings will be fully realized by year two.

FINAL

Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity

It is our expectation that the transaction will be accretive to operating EPS and operating
ROE in year one, with high-single-digit EPS accretion expected by year two. It is also
expected to be roughly neutral to book value per share at close and very minimal impact
to tangible book value per share, with growth in book value per share and tangible book
value per share accelerating post-transaction, driven by the increased earnings powers of
the combined company. Further, we believe that given the size of this transaction, the
scope of integration limited to one office and the complementary nature of the Novae
business to our existing book, the enthusiasm and goodwill of our employees, execution
risk is very limited.
In summary, we believe that this combination represents the rare opportunity to
accelerate our strategic vision. Hitting on multiple objectives, while delivering a very
attractive value proposition to our shareholders with limited execution risk.
And with that, I'd like to open the line for questions. Operator?

Q&A
Operator
Yes. Thank you. And the first question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Good morning. So first question, can you give us probably more background about this
transaction, and how do you think is Lloyd's marketing now, because of the recent pricing
pressure as well as high expense over there? And why Lloyd's is attractive? And also, did
you talk with other independent Lloyd's syndicates and why Novae is best fit for you?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Kai. I think there's no question that we are all experiencing challenging market
conditions in all markets in all countries. And Lloyd's is no different. However, we remain
convinced that Lloyd's is the preeminent international market for specialty risks. And the
concentration of talent here in London and the number of companies and markets and
brokers is such that we really do not see that changing in a material way in the near term.
The other thing is that participating in the London market and participating at Lloyd's over
the last three years, we've also been impressed by the increasing conviction by Lloyd's
and by the various markets within Lloyd's to change the Lloyd's market; looking to
become more efficient, change of targeted operating model, lower costs. So we actually
believe that Lloyd's is doing the right things.
And so, if you, like AXIS, want to be in global specialty lines, Lloyd's is one of the markets
that we have to participate in. As you know, we feel very, very proud that we're
diversified; we are in a number of insurance and reinsurance markets; we do U.S. E&S; we
do professional lines; we do A&H. We're in a lot of different markets. What matters to us
is that we cannot be everything to everyone. But in a market where we choose to be, it's
Page 7 of 16



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2017-07-06

imperative that we have the relevance, scale, expertise to be a differentiated provider
and competes in a very positive way. And that's what we want to do with Lloyd's.

FINAL

As to Novae, I really do believe it's a perfect fit. As you've seen in terms of the books of
business, and as both Matthew and Peter have discussed, they're in many lines of
business that we are not in, that we would like to be in. They complement many of our
lines of business; they are a pure specialty lines player.
We don't have to work our way through different lines of business. Matthew and his team
have already done a lot of the hard work of focusing that book of business. And in one of
the slides that was referenced to, Maintain and Invest lines, the way we see it, given the
good action that Matthew and the team have done, is that the Maintain and Invest lines
that have delivered an average combined ratio of 80% over the last five years will
essentially comprise 100% of the book that we are going to be taking over in year one,
2018.
So we have a high level of confidence that this is a perfect fit with our book of business,
there's complementarity, the talents within Novae is outstanding. We're really thrilled to
be bringing them into our company. And combined, we will create a very successful $2billion-plus specialty company in the London market.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Matthew Kailey Fosh

{BIO 2270793 <GO>}

And, Kai, can I just add? It's Matthew Fosh here, the CEO of Novae. We are a something
of a rare beast. We are the only pure Lloyd's single-platform business there is of any
scale. We're the only quoted pure Lloyd's player. And so, whilst I'm sure Albert did all the
due diligence he needed to do to check whether we were the company he wanted to get
to speak to, we do offer something that others don't in terms of that scale, in terms of
that pure specialty play. And as Albert said, we have taken the surgery necessary in the
last two, three years to get very, very pure on that specialty approach. And that's one
thing â€“ one fashioning reason, I suspect, Albert lighted on us.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thanks, Matthew.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you very much for the comments. My second question on the financial accretion. If
you look at Novae's earnings for the past three years, you've taken Ogden rates for 2016,
you're running about $70 million to $80 million pre-tax earnings. That itself is more than
10% of expected earnings for AXIS going forward. So I was just wondering even before
the $50 million cost savings, so I was just wondering what's the basis for the high-singledigit accretion by year or two, and is something I'm missing, amortization or other things?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think we're taking a reasonably prudent view of the market as we're seeing it. I think that
the market today is not as attractive as it was three years ago â€“ two years ago until as the
Page 8 of 16



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2017-07-06

business, as you know, we earned the business on a lag basis. And our view is that we
don't want to create expectations that aren't reasonable. We've always been prudent in
our outlook. But, Kai, to your point, I think it speaks to the high level of confidence that we
have that, moving forward, this union is going to be very attractive to our shareholders.

FINAL

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you. Last one, if I may, very quick is that, the stock Novae is trading above your
Â£7.00 offer, so indicating some possibility of additional bps. So I just wonder what's the
breakout fee as additional safeguard for the transaction.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

In the UK, the rules for takeovers are very clear. There are no protections and no breakup
fees in transactions. So we believe that the offer that we have put on the table is a very
compelling valuation for Novae's shareholders. I think it represents a healthy premium to
Novae's market price. As I mentioned, 29% over the average price for 30 days. It reflects
the benefit that we see coming; and frankly, some of the benefits that could only happen
in a union with AXIS. So prices move up and down for any number of reasons, but we
believe that what we have here is a compelling offer to Novae's shareholders.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you very much and good luck.

Thank you. And the next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. A few questions. First, Albert, if you can just walk us through how you
became comfortable with Novae's reserve position in terms of your diligence for this
transaction? And I know there's been some press reports surrounding maybe some
legacy reserve transaction on Novae's part. If you guys can just update that kind of where
we stand on that and how that came into your thought process surrounding this
acquisition?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

So, Elyse, thank you for the question. I feel very comfortable with the extent of our due
diligence on Novae. And again, going back to the point, it's a very focused business. It's a
business that we participate in every day. So we have a lot of familiarity with the lines of
business. We reserve our own lines in similar lines (26:08). I will say that we were very
impressed with the processes, the professionalism of the approach.

Page 9 of 16

FINAL

We've done our work. We feel very comfortable as to the quality of the balance sheet. As
I've said in one of the interviews, we wouldn't have done this deal if we weren't satisfied
with the quality of the people, the quality of the book and the quality of the balance
sheet. And we are satisfied with all three. As to the press reports that you referred to, my
understanding is that these are unsubstantiated rumors. And, of course, we don't
comment on that.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And my second question. Can you just comment â€“ I know you guys said
you would finance this deal with cash on hand and maybe some debt. How do you think
about your buyback just given that we're now in the middle of hurricane season, just
entering into this transaction now change your thought process around buying back your
own shares?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you for asking that, Elyse. And, in fact, it does. As you know, we'll be taking on a $1
billion worth of new premium. And so it would make sense for us to have a little bit more
capital to support that premium. So as of now, it is our view that we will suspend our share
repurchases for the next two quarters, and then, resume repurchases in early 2018. And
we believe that that is the appropriate way to move forward.
I will say this because I expect there will be a question about share buybacks. We have
been, I believe, a very responsible steward of capital. And we have given back to our
shareholders a significant amount of capital in the form of dividends and share
repurchases. Where we are today is we have done significant analysis of the benefits to
our company and to our shareholders of continuing the buybacks and not do this
acquisition, or do this acquisition and hold back on the buybacks for the next couple of
quarters.
And I can tell you that we are absolutely convinced without a doubt that the economic
benefits to our company of making this acquisition far outweigh anything that we could do
in the near term in terms of continuing buybacks. This is the right strategic and financial
decision for this company.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then, in terms of Novae, what about its CAT exposure? I see about just under
half the business is property. If you can just let us know where their biggest CAT exposure
is? I assume there is some exposure to the U.S., if you can just walk us through that
especially now that we are in the middle of hurricane season?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That makes good sense. As you know, our net appetite for incremental CAT risk is
reasonably limited. So, what I would say to you is that a good part of their property book
is already shared with third-party capital, number one. And although we don't necessarily
have great appetite for incremental CAT exposure, we believe that this is business that is
going to be very attractive to our third-party capital partners.
Page 10 of 16

FINAL

And so, we're looking to see â€“ we view this as an opportunity to continue to be helpful to
the market, and also provide attractive premium to our third-party capital partners and
generate essentially risk-free fee income for AXIS. So, for us, this is a win-win-win. Of
course, as the wind season continues, we will be doing the normal risk management that
you would expect us to do.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

And so, where does their â€“ PML, I guess, where are they writing to today, do they disclose
it kind of like you guys do?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I don't think they do and given that the company continues to be a publicly listed
company, we don't think it's appropriate for us to create new disclosure for them.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

I don't know if this is for Albert or Matthew, but I'm looking at slide 6 in terms of the
breakdown of Novae's gross written premiums between invest to grow and other classes,
and between that and the various lines that were put into runoff, how much of the $1.2
billion of 2016 gross premiums is AXIS interested in renewing over the course of 2017,
2018?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

So, let me split this question in two, if I may. I think that the proper question for Matthew
is, given all the actions, what is the â€“ I don't know if they've already projected the premium
level for 2017 or not, but I think from our perspective, we can talk about how we feel
about the book. Fine?

A - Matthew Kailey Fosh

{BIO 2270793 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. So, our gross written premium will be around Â£940 million for 2017 or the net
earned will fall slightly. Your question about how much of the business have we
discontinued, is that what you're after, Meyer? Could you repeat, I'm talking pounds now,
okay?

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Matthew Kailey Fosh

{BIO 2270793 <GO>}

Pounds. Right?

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Yeah. That is my question.

A - Matthew Kailey Fosh

{BIO 2270793 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So, if you look at the 2016 number, we have probably â€“ since the end of 2016, we
probably discontinued about Â£80 million or Â£90 million of all business that we no longer
thought was sustainably profitable, okay? We have replaced that in 2017 with equivalent
amounts of growth. So, it's going to be relatively stable for 2017 over 2016. Does that
answer your question, Meyer?

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

It does. Yeah. Okay.

A - Matthew Kailey Fosh

{BIO 2270793 <GO>}

But it's the business mix that's changing, it's this absolute determination to know. Look,
this market is tough as we acknowledge, and when a market gets tough, you've got to be
crystal clear about where you think you have a competitive advantage, right. That's what
Albert says the whole time. He's especially asked (31:58) because he believes specialty is
the way you can differentiate, and we entirely agree and it's part of our â€“ and that's our
roots, okay?
So, when the market changes, you've constantly got to be adjusting your portfolio
because classes that were profitable three years ago are no longer profitable, right? And
so, you have to discontinue as a â€“ de-emphasizing it as a classic management just like a
fund manager, right, one's managing assets, we're managing liabilities, okay? And so,
that's what you have to do, but you've got to be really, really disciplined in markets as
they are now.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you. And from our perspective, as I mentioned earlier, we feel very good that, in
2018, which will be the first year of operation, we believe that 100% of that business will

be in those maintain and invest classes. So, we're starting with a book of business that we
think is very attractive. And then after that, of course, we just do the normal reactions to
opportunities in the market.

FINAL

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. No, that makes perfect sense. That's very helpful. Can you give us some guidance
in terms of what you're modeling for sort of typical acquisition-related premium spillage?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

One of the things that came across here was the complementarity of the books of
business. And as we looked at it, we felt that there were so many opportunities actually
for positive leverage in terms of taking Novae's products, placing some of them on
company paper versus Lloyd's, working through our distribution, really leveraging the
capabilities that we have, buying less reinsurance, all of those, anyway we cut this, we felt
that the positive synergies far offset any potential negatives.

A - Matthew Kailey Fosh

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

{BIO 2270793 <GO>}

And, Meyer, one â€“ if I could jump in, this is Matthew. One of the aspects the board was
dealing with was the fact that we have faith â€“ by being the specialist house, we are
enjoying more opportunities than we have capital. And so, now it's a question of how do
we cope with the opportunities we're being faced, because when you are very clear
about quite where you add value and what you can bring to the brokers and so on and so
forth, you get opportunities and they bring you more. And this is only, we believe, Albert
and I believe, that by putting these two businesses together, that's only going to enhance
those opportunities. And coping with the requests and opportunities we have is going to
be one of the challenges of putting these two businesses together.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Fantastic. That's very positive. And one last question if I can, Novae's tax rate has been
higher than AXIS's, should we assume that that 10%, 11% tax rate persists on that portion
of the business or can it be filtered through lower tax jurisdiction underwriters?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think, as you look forward, I don't think that that's going to have a significant impact on
the pro forma tax rates of the merged company. There is a fair amount of normal
volatility, if you would, to the location of the earnings and where they come back and
forth, so long term I don't see a big change in our tax rate.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Fantastic. Thanks so much.

Thank you. And the next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill
Lynch.

FINAL

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yes, thanks. Just a couple other questions. It looked like in the spring, Novae essentially
shed some of its catastrophe business. And I'm wondering how much and does that free
up any capital for the company.

A - Matthew Kailey Fosh

{BIO 2270793 <GO>}

Jay, explain shared some of its catastrophe business.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Shed.

A - Matthew Kailey Fosh

{BIO 2270793 <GO>}

Oh, shed.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

(35:27).

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Matthew Kailey Fosh

{BIO 2270793 <GO>}

Shed, okay. Yes. I mean, what we're talking about is that, it comes back to this point, Jay,
about do we â€“ where are the areas we have a demonstrable leadership/competitive
advantage. And in property cat, we are not a property cat player of any scale. We cannot
honestly claim to be a leader in London or anywhere else in property cat. So what do we
do? We shared it and shed, we worked with Fidelis, that is a leader in property cat in this
country, and we said, okay, you take our perfectly nice, but not especially good, book, but
they did want â€“ you can do more with it. We'll share that with you and we'll quota-share
back some of your book where you are clearly leaders.
And it comes back to this point is, unless we are leaders, unless we are really special or
something, we don't want to do it. And so with this journey we've been on to complete
that portfolio chain. So, when you say shed, we actually just exchanged a particular type of
business where we thought it was okay, but we weren't leaders with â€“ we've been
working with another partner, we then quota-shared back their book, which was
demonstrably top performer. So, that's...

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Got it.

A - Matthew Kailey Fosh

{BIO 2270793 <GO>}

...what, I think, you're referring to, okay, Jay?

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yeah, no, very helpful. Thank you. So, net-net, your cat premiums probably didn't change
much, it's just coming in a different form?

A - Matthew Kailey Fosh

{BIO 2270793 <GO>}

FINAL

That's exactly the point, Jay, yes.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Great. And then, the other question, the $50 million of expected savings, Albert, I'm
assuming that's sort of a net number. In other words, you may have to make some
investments in the business, but $50 million is what you expect to help the bottom line
eventually?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That's right. Look, as you know, we continue to be investing in the business, we've spoken
to you with some of our initiatives around the future insurance platform, the systems that
we have. We're clearly continuing to grow our investments in data and analytics. We will
continue to do that. But the $50 million that we've identified is a chunk of savings that we
can deliver within the first two years.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That's great. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. And as there are no more questions at the present time, I would like to return
the call to management for any closing comments.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, thank you very much, and thank you for your interest in this transaction. As you can
tell from everybody on this call, we're highly enthusiastic. I think this is really a unique
opportunity to put together two specialty underwriting shops that have a similar conviction
around underwriting discipline, around entrepreneurialism and around excelling in the
markets in which we choose to compete. It's a unique opportunity and we are very
pleased to be able to move forward with the acquisition of Novae. So, again, Matthew...

A - Matthew Kailey Fosh

{BIO 2270793 <GO>}

I would second that, Albert. Thank you very much. It's been a pleasure so far.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

And we look forward to reporting to you on our ongoing progress. Thank you very much.
