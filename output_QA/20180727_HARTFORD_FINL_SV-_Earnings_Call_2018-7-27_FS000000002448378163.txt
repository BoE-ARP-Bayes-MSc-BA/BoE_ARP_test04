Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Second quarter marked another strong
performance for The Hartford. Core earnings were up 36%, core earnings per share rose
40% and book value per share excluding AOCI was up 8% since year-end 2017.
Our annualized core earnings ROE for the first half of 2018 was 13%. Earnings growth
came from Commercial Lines, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds, including the lower
effective tax rate. Personal Lines underlying margins continued to improve but were
outweighed on the bottom line by higher catastrophe losses. Despite higher CAT losses
in the first half, we remain on track to achieve our underlying margin and profitability
outlook for the full year.
During the quarter we achieved progress on several other important goals. First we
closed the sale of Talcott on May 31, just eight weeks ago. Net cash consideration to the
holding company was about $1.5 billion. In addition, we retained a 9.7% equity stake in
Talcott, which is carried on our books at $164 million at June 30.
Second, the Aetna Group Benefits integration, about eight months underway, is
proceeding well. Given the complexity of the numerous activities involved, I am very
pleased and impressed with the pace and overall progress. We are optimistic that we can
reduce expenses by more than our original $100 million target.
Aside from the integration, Group Benefit sales are off to a strong start in 2018. First half
sales totaled $539 million, almost double from last year. This includes $7 million of life and
disability product sales to Aetna's group medical customers. These sales are the result of
our agreement with their major medical sales force to work with us and continue to

Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2018-07-27

market group life disability products to their customers. These results speak to the
success of our cross-sale partnership.

FINAL

We are also executing on projects across the company that are making The Hartford a
customer-centric and easier company to do business with. It's a long list, with an emphasis
on technology and digital tools working in an agile environment.
One example is in Small Commercial. On our ICON platform we have increased the
percent of accounts that can be quoted on the glass. We have streamlined the
underwriting process and reduced the time it takes to get a quote, which is an important
competitive advantage in this market. Another example is the expansion of our
underwriting capabilities in specialty product orientation to achieve our goal of being a
broader and deeper risk player.
In Middle Market, we have grown and added industry verticals, responding to increasing
demands from agents for deeper industry underwriting expertise with a broader product
suite. This aligns with our strategy to expand account rounding with our worker's
compensation policyholders who value our claims and customer service capabilities.

Bloomberg Transcript

Examples of our focus on industry verticals include technology, a traditional strength at
The Hartford, which grew premium 4.5% over the last two years. In addition, our
construction practice has grown premiums 35% over the past four years.
Lastly, we entered the energy market late 2016 and over the past four quarters wrote $24
million in gross written premium. These are just a few examples of our approach to
organic business development. Taken all together, we sustained very good momentum
this quarter in all our businesses. I am thrilled with our progress and our future potential.
Last week we announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. This decision was
based on the strong performance of our businesses, the sale of Talcott and lower tax
rates, consistent with our longstanding dividend philosophy. Last week's dividend
declaration was the sixth consecutive annual increase and it will increase our dividend yield
and payout ratio to be more in line with peers.
With regard to other uses of excess capital, our philosophy has not changed. Investing in
our company remains the cornerstone of our strategy. We want to achieve profitable
organic growth, particularly where we have attractive returns and strong competitive
advantages.
Along those lines, acquisitions that are aligned with our long-term strategic and financial
goals are a compelling use of capital. Acquisitions can help build greater competitive
advantages, add operational capabilities, and accelerate earnings growth compared with
building a business from the ground up.
For example, in 2016 we acquired Maxum which allowed Small Commercial to expand into
the E&S market. In 2017, we purchased the Aetna's U.S. group life and disability book,
Page 3 of 24



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2018-07-27

which was a unique opportunity to expand our market position while acquiring an industryleading claims and lead management platform.

FINAL

As I shared last quarter, when we assess areas of our business that could benefit from the
accelerants of an acquisition, we have a focus on specialty lines and industry verticals in
the commercial insurance segment that would expand our product sets in underwriting
expertise.
Since the recent sale of Talcott, there has been speculation and questions about future
share repurchase plans. This is understandable as our prior capital management actions
have included a large amount of debt reduction and share repurchases. While capital
management remains a valid alternative, it is not our primary focus at this time. Therefore,
we have not authorized a new share repurchase plan. We will continue to evaluate options
that will generate long-term earnings growth at good returns. And if we conclude that
there is not an alternative option to support growth, a share buyback plan could be put
into place relatively quickly. But, as I've stated previously, we will be thoughtful and patient
regarding capital deployment with our focus on creating long-term sustainable
shareholder value, which is why we are maintaining the option of investing capital to
expand the business.

Bloomberg Transcript

To wrap up my comments, The Hartford had very strong performance for the first half of
the year, both financially and operationally. We are intently focused on continuing to
execute on our goals and sustain our momentum through the second half of the year. I
look forward to updating you on our progress over the balance of the year.
Now I'll turn the call over to Doug.

Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. This was another strong quarter in
Property & Casualty and Group Benefits as we advance our key initiatives and address
evolving market conditions. Commercial Lines had a strong quarter as we continued to
balance growth with competitive market conditions. In Personal Lines, improved auto
trends continued, although overall results were hampered by catastrophe losses. And in
Group Benefits, we had another excellent quarter with strong favorable trends in group
disability.
Before I touch on second quarter results for each business segment, let me cover current
and prior-year catastrophe losses for Property & Casualty. In the quarter, we had $188
million of current year CAT losses, $33 million higher than a year ago driven by significant
wind and hail storms in various regions across the country. Included in prior-year
development is the reduction of our estimates for prior-year catastrophes, largely
attributable to hurricanes in the third quarter of 2017.
As a result of lowering these estimates, we no longer expect to receive a recovery
against our aggregate catastrophe reinsurance treaty for the 2017 accident year. The
benefit from the aggregate treaty was allocated to each business unit based on our
Page 4 of 24

Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2018-07-27

FINAL

estimate of ultimate losses for the full year. This quarter, as you can see on page 13 of the
slides, 2017 gross loss estimates decreased in both Personal Lines and Commercial Lines,
causing total P&C losses to fall below the attachment point for the c. However, the
decrease in gross losses was greater in Commercial Lines than Personal Lines and,
therefore, unwinding the aggregate cover resulted in net adverse development for
Personal Lines.
Let me now shift into the results for our business segments. In Commercial Lines, the
combined ratio improved 4.5 points from prior year to 90.1 driven by favorable prior year
development, partially offset by slightly higher current year catastrophe losses and
expenses. The prior year development was primarily due to continued favorable trends in
workers' compensation and lower estimates on catastrophe reserves as I just covered,
partially offset by an increase in reserves for higher hazard general liability exposures. This
portion of our general liability book remains profitable, but we are responding to an
increase in loss trends in accident years 2015 through 2017. Trends in the remainder of our
general liability book have been slightly better than our expectations.

Bloomberg Transcript

The underlying combined ratio for Commercial Lines, which excludes catastrophes and
prior-year development, was 90, improving 0.9 of a point from last year. The
improvement was largely driven by favorable loss trends, particularly non-CAT property as
well as general liability. This was offset by higher expenses and slight margin compression
in workers' compensation.
Let me provide a few additional thoughts on workers' compensation, touching on three
important factors; frequency, severity, and rates. First on frequency, in both Small
Commercial and Middle Market, our frequency has been trending slightly higher during
2018. We see this as a broad-based economic-driven trend across many states and
industry classes. Keep in mind that absolute frequency is still at historical low levels and
margins remain attractive, however expanding participation in the labor market often
means less experienced workers are on the job, a driver of frequency.
Second, on severity, we continue to closely watch inflation trends for upward pressure on
both wages and medical costs, drivers of severity. Although accident year 2018 data is
immature at this point in the year, severity remains within our expectations.
And third, on rates, loss costs in workers' compensation have been quite benign for
several years and, as a result, the NCCI and other bureaus have been filing negative loss
cost changes in many jurisdictions. Industry rate filings are based on these loss cost trends
and have put downward pressure on rates in 2018 and will likely do so in 2019.
Combining these three factors, we continue to expect some margin compression in our
Small Commercial and Middle Market books of business. Since each of these businesses
has unique market dynamics for pricing and growth, our approach to successfully
managing these rate changes is also dynamic. In Middle Market and national accounts,
greater weight is placed on individual risk characteristics when pricing the account. In Small
Commercial, pricing is more heavily weighted to class factors, making book management
a critical tool.

FINAL

Over the last five years, we have significantly advanced our actuarial analytics and data
science capabilities to improve our ability to identify these trends and respond confidently
with pricing, underwriting and claims management initiatives. Given our strong margins
and organizational capabilities, we will continue to execute a disciplined pricing and book
of business management strategy in the months ahead.
Moving to pricing in the quarter, I'm very pleased that our renewal written pricing in
standard Commercial lines was 3.1%, up from 2.4% in the first quarter of the year. As I
suggested in my comments last quarter, we saw positive movement in Middle Market
across property, general liability and workers' compensation with strong increases
continuing to come from commercial auto. Our pricing on standard Commercial Lines
excluding workers' compensation was 5.2% in the quarter.
Looking at our Commercial Lines business units, Small Commercial had another strong
quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 85.6. Written premium was off slightly, the
result of downward pressure on workers' compensation rates and competitive market
conditions for both new business and renewals. The margin improvement versus last year
was driven by non-CAT property, general liability and auto, partially offset by higher
expenses.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Middle Market, the underlying combined ratio of 94.1 improved 0.8 point from 2017
mainly due to non-CAT property and general liability. This was partially offset by modest
margin compression in workers' compensation and higher expenses. Written premium
was up 3% over last year with new business production of $138 million.
And in Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 98.5 deteriorated 2.6
points. This was driven mainly by higher expenses and margin compression in national
accounts and financial products. Written premium was up 9% for the quarter reflecting
strong growth in bond and financial products.
Moving to Personal Lines, the underlying combined ratio of 90.4 improved 2.2 points from
a year ago driven primarily by improvement in auto and to a lesser degree better
homeowners performance. The underlying combined ratio in personal auto improved 2.6
points to 96.5. We continue to experience relatively stable loss cost trends and we are
satisfied with our bottom line performance. Personal Lines premium was down 7%.
Consistent with my comments in recent quarters, our marketing spend continues to
accelerate and we're focused on driving new business growth.
In AARP Direct auto, our bellwether line, new business was up 19% in the quarter. This is
an encouraging result as we focus on growth through new business and improved
retention. We're implementing additional product and process changes throughout the
remainder of the year that I expect will continue to improve our top-line trends.
Turning to Group Benefits, we had another excellent quarter with core earnings of $104
million and a margin of 6.9%. Drivers were similar to last quarter, including favorable
disability results, lower tax rates, and the contribution from our 2017 acquisition partially
offset by slightly higher life mortality. Persistency on our employer group block of business

FINAL

remains strong at approximately 90% and fully insured ongoing sales of $85 million were
up from prior year. This was a solid sales quarter and we're pleased with our traction in
the market.
Our integration of the Aetna group life and disability business remains on track and is
picking up momentum. We began converting small case business to our current platform
this month and we will ramp up those efforts throughout the year. The new disability claim
platform, now branded The Hartford Ability Advantage, is expected to come online for
new cases effective in 2019. As Chris noted in his comments, our expense reduction
efforts are on track and as our business conversion process continues in 2019 and 2020,
we are confident that we will be able to exceed our original savings target.
In summary, this was another strong quarter for our Property & Casualty and Group
Benefits businesses. At the halfway point for 2018, I'm pleased with our execution and our
performance. We're responding to loss cost trends with appropriate pricing action and
disciplined underwriting. We continue to innovate in all areas of our business to deliver a
superior customer experience. And we're committed to becoming a more relevant
partner for our agents and brokers with an expanded product portfolio to better meet
customer needs and deliver profitable growth to The Hartford.
Let me now turn the call over to Beth.

Bloomberg Transcript

Beth Ann Bombara
Thank you, Doug. My comments today will cover second quarter results for the
investment portfolio, mutual funds and corporate, impacts on the quarter from the sale of
Talcott and June 30 book value and debt leverage before taking your questions.
Starting with investments, net investment income performance and yields remain steady.
Pre-tax limited partnership investment income was flat with the prior-year at $39 million
for an annualized return of 9.5% in second quarter 2018. Excluding LPs, the annualized
portfolio yield before tax was 3.7%, down slightly from 3.8% in second quarter 2017 due to
the impact of the Group Benefits acquisition.
The P&C yield was flat year-over-year at 3.8%. Consistent with the first quarter, the yield
on the consolidated Group Benefits investment portfolio is lower than last year because
acquisition accounting rules require that the acquired portfolio is marked to market. As a
result, the annualized yield before tax excluding LPs and Group Benefits was 4.3% in third
quarter 2017 before the acquisition but dropped to 3.7% in the fourth quarter. This quarter
the Group Benefits annualized portfolio yield was 3.9%, up slightly from first quarter 2018.
This is a result of our reinvestment of the acquired portfolio towards our target sector
allocation with less municipal bond exposure resulting in a higher pre-tax yield. Investment
credit performance remained excellent this quarter with no net impairments due to a
generally benign credit environment and the credit strength and diversification of our
portfolio.

FINAL

Turning to Mutual Funds, second quarter core earnings were $38 million up 58% from last
year due to the combination of lower tax rates and higher AUM from positive net flows
and higher market values. Income before taxes rose 21% as a result of the operating
leverage in our operations with a 6% increase in revenues but only a 3% increase in
expenses. AUM growth is due to net flows which totaled $1.9 billion over the last four
quarters and changes in market value which totaled $8.2 billion.
Our ETP business drove $500 million of net flows over the last four quarters. Hartford
Funds' strong performance is driving the positive net flows with 61% and 66% of funds
beating their peers on a three-year and five-year basis respectfully (sic) [respectively
(00:22:36). Corporate core losses totaled $76 million, higher than first quarter 2018 due
principally to a tax true-up for the reallocation from the business segments to Corporate
for the impact of non-deductible executive compensation.

Bloomberg Transcript

Income from discontinued operations was $148 million, up from $112 million in second
quarter 2017. In second quarter 2017, this represented Talcott's net income for the quarter.
In contrast, in this quarter, about 90% of the income reflected an increase in our estimate
of the retained tax benefits from Talcott due to a change in our estimate of Talcott's tax
basis. This change increases our estimate of the value of retained tax benefits to about
$830 million.
Going forward, other revenue will include the return on our investment in Talcott, which
will be included in core earnings and in the Corporate segment along with other Talcott
impacts. The other impacts include, beginning this quarter, income from investment
management and transition services, as well as the related operating expenses. The
amounts recorded this quarter reflect one month of activity and did not have a significant
impact on the Corporate bottom line. We expect transition services and stranded costs to
decrease over the next 12 to 18 months.
In total, The Hartford second quarter core earnings were $412 million, up from $303
million in second quarter 2017, due to higher Commercial Lines, Group Benefits, and
Mutual Funds earnings before tax, as well as a lower federal income tax rate. The
effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 19% in the quarter, compared
with 18% in first quarter of 2018, due to the slightly higher proportion of income from
underwriting results and taxable investment income as all income other than municipal
bond interest is taxed at 21%.
Book value per diluted share at June 30, 2018 was $34.44, a 7% decrease from
December 31, 2017. The after-tax unrealized gain on our fixed maturity portfolio at June
30, 2018, was $211 million, down from $1.8 billion at December 31. This decrease was due
to the Talcott sale and the reduction in the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio
due to higher rates and wider credit spreads.
Book value per share excluding AOCI was $38.15, an increase of 8% from December 31,
2017, reflecting the increase in retained earnings as a result of net income in excess of
dividends for the first six months of the year. The core earnings ROE was 8.4%, calculated
using rolling four quarter earnings and average stockholders' equity since June 30, 2017.

Page 8 of 24



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2018-07-27

On an annualized year-to-date basis, core earnings ROE was 13%, which was above our
outlook for the year.

FINAL

Turning to our debt leverage, in June we called at par $500 million in junior subordinated
debt, reducing our total debt outstanding by $323 million since year-end 2017. Despite the
repayment of debt and strong earnings, our rating agency debt to total capital ratio of
about 30% was flat with March 31, due to the inclusion of AOCI in this calculation.
Over the long-term, our focus is to reduce the rating agency adjusted debt to total capital
ratio to the low to mid 20s. However, since it includes the favorable or unfavorable impact
of AOCI, this ratio can be volatile during periods of changing interest rates. So we also
focus on the total leverage ratio, which is calculated by dividing total debt, including
hybrids and preferreds at par, by total debt and capital excluding AOCI. At June 30 our
total leverage ratio was 25%, which is still at the high end of our long-term goal. We
continue to focus on decreasing this ratio over time.
To conclude, we remain on a very good path in 2018, with strong underwriting and
investment results and success in both closing the sale of Talcott and the continued
integration of the Group Benefits acquisition. I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we
can begin the Q&A session.

Thank you, Beth. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Dan, could you please repeat
the Q&A instructions? Thank you.

Q&A
Operator
Certainly. Your first question today will come from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells
Fargo. Please go ahead.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. My first question, in terms of the Commercial Lines margin, pretty
strong improvement this quarter. I was hoping we can get a little bit more color – if you
can break down how much you saw coming from favorable non-CAT property, also from
liability, and then also from the auto, the three things you called out in the press release. If
you could just give us a sense of the contribution from each?
And then is the 90 basis points of improvement, just based off of how you see the rating
environment and what's going on in comp, is that the right level we should think about in
Commercial going forward?

Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2018-07-27

Elyse, good morning. This is Doug. Let me try to tackle both of them separately. When I
look across our markets, as I mentioned, both small and middle had excellent non-CAT
property quarters, and small about a point better quarter to quarter, and middle a couple
of points, 2.5 points better, so significant drivers of positive performance. Small on the
workers' comp side, about our expectations, and I mentioned that just slightly – we made
an adjustment to our workers' comp in middle, a small amount. So when I look across, I
feel good about all the non-comp lines. In middle we made an adjustment in comp. And
all-in, a very, very solid quarter for Commercial Lines relative to combined ratios.
Can you repeat the other question a little bit more?

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Yeah, I guess I was just trying to think about going forward, is kind of the 90 basis points
of underlying margin improvement you saw in Commercial Lines this quarter, is that the
right level we should be thinking about? Or maybe adjust a little bit just for the favorable
non-CAT weather in the quarter?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Well, first off, I think that the improvement of 90 basis points was a terrific quarter. And so
I'd love to think we could outperform like that going forward, but that is – that will take
experience and the next couple of months for us to be able to determine that. I am
suggesting that we're seeing a little bit of turn in our frequency in the workers' comp line,
so we expect to see some compression there because rates are moving in one direction
and frequency is moving the other. So we're watching carefully what that means to our
book of business, and we'll take appropriate actions going forward. But, as you know,
there are headwinds on the pricing side in workers' comp because those loss cost trends
over the last several years are so favorable that they're dropping in state by state to the
pricing algorithms. And so we're making adjustments as appropriate there. So, feel great
about our improvement in the quarter. Love to think we can continue it. But that's going to
take some time for us to show that through the P&L.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then on the capital side, so I appreciate the disclosure about how you
guys are now evaluating M&A, as well as capital return. I guess I also was wondering how
you guys also think about managing down your leverage. Pro forma for the debt maturity
that comes due early next year, your leverage is probably still running in the high 20s. So
how does managing down your leverage balanced against if you end up with excess
capital and how you're thinking about potential for buybacks?

A - Beth Ann Bombara
Yeah, great question. So, as we talked about before, we do have maturing debt, as you
pointed out, at the beginning of 2019, which our current intention would be to pay that
down. And when we look at that combined with just the earnings power of our
businesses, we believe that puts us on a very good track as we think about managing that
ratio down. So I think we've done a good job in the past of using maturing debt – the

Page 10 of 24

opportunity for that without having to pay a large premium to reduce our debt
outstanding. And I'd say just we'll continue on that path.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Gallagher

{BIO 3311667 <GO>}

Good morning. First question, Chris, just on the capital management commentary you
made, does the priority of M&A over buybacks suggest that you see current attractive
opportunities in M&A? Or is that more of a medium term comment, that you'll patiently
look for opportunities and like to build a bigger capital position while you wait for those
opportunities?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks, Tom. Again, we're just talking about things that we've talked about before.
So I would say, again, from the building the business, investing in our business, looking at
acquisition opportunities, I mean, that's been our consistent philosophy for a number of
years now, so I'm not signaling any change one way or other, it's just sort of our playbook
of priorities that we would go down and explore. And, as I said in my prepared remarks, if
we can't find a good use for our excess capital, we're more than comfortable in returning
it to shareholders.

Q - Thomas Gallagher

{BIO 3311667 <GO>}

Got you. So really no change, just consistent with getting maybe to a bigger level of
excess before you'd consider using it for alternatives, like buybacks?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah, I'm not going to try to sort of size the level of capital here. I mean we just closed
Talcott. We've gotten excess capital. You've heard Beth just comment about what we
want to do with debt. We're comfortable where we are right now and giving ourselves a
little time. I mean, it's not – we're not looking for years and years and years here. We just
want the option and the flexibility to explore using our capital to invest in businesses
and/or new revenue streams.

Q - Thomas Gallagher

{BIO 3311667 <GO>}

Got it. And then just a question on Group Benefits. From the disclosure in your Q it looks
like you had another good quarter of very favorable prior-year development. By our
estimate, it's more than half of the earnings for that segment. Now, you've been having
that favorable development for several years now, so it doesn't appear to be a one-timer,
seems pretty sustainable. So my question is, should we think about most of that

development being recent in accident year releases or is a lot of that coming from
recoveries of older accident years? Can you provide some perspective on how that –
where that's coming from and then maybe the sustainability of it?

FINAL

A - Beth Ann Bombara
Yeah, sure, it's Beth, I'll take that. So, again, on the Group side and specifically on the
disability side, as we look at our trends, we have been seeing favorable trends, more so
in the more recent years, as those exposures develop. I think in the disability block, it's
important to remember that there's a lag in the timing of when someone goes on
disability and then when they actually end up on long-term disability. So, we peg those
lines and then look at how the development comes in over time. And our incidence rates
and our recoveries on all those fronts have been very favorable. It's hard to predict,
obviously, going forward, but we're very happy with the trends that we've been seeing as
we kind of go into the second half of this year.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yeah, hi there. I don't know if I'm going to get a better answer than the prepared remarks,
but you talked about being more confident about the cost savings associated with the
Aetna transaction. You were formerly at $100 million. I look at about $400 million of run
rate expenses coming with Aetna. Can you sort of break out what's in that $400 million
and why we couldn't expect half of it to go down, or how we should think about that?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Hey, Josh, let me just provide an opening commentary and then we could add additional
color. I mean, we're – as I said, in essence, eight, nine months since the Aetna (00:36:18)
integration, we feel very good about the integration both from an operational side, a goto-market sales force side, customer retention side. And all we're signaling right now is
that our nine-month indication is that we, most likely, will outperform our $100 million
target over a longer period of time.
And if you remember, why we say a longer period of time is we're timing the conversion
of a lot of these policies and books of business from Aetna paper to our paper over a
two-year period of time so that we don't disrupt that customer base. We just completed
installing their claims system on our technology and our hardware here, so the real
conversion process just begins. So it is a little longer term than maybe a typical integration
activity, given we're dealing with three-year rate guarantees and moving the entire
administration platform into our network and our capabilities right now. But I look to –
Doug, if you want to provide any additional commentary, Doug.

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

I think, Chris, that's a really good baseline. Josh, the number I have in my head for the
Aetna baseline on cost is roughly $330 million. So when I think about $100 million or $100
million-plus, pretty significant change. In addition, what Chris said relative to us moving
accounts, we are being very careful trying not to disturb relationships of account
managers and account executives on key Aetna renewals. So this is a multi-year process
that I think we are very pleased about the initial nine months, but it is a several-year effort.
And as we move through that period of time, I know we're going to find opportunities to
be more effective and efficient in operations and we'll capitalize on those.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And look, there's always numbers. You gave a good detail on what's going on in workers'
comp. You took down reserves there, but you took up your accident year pick, and then
on GL you added to reserves and then took down your accident year pick. I'm just sort of
wondering how past information is different from what you're doing on the current
accident year?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Really good question. So let me attack both comp and GL separately. When we
think about our comp book of business and our reserves that we currently carry, we feel
very good about the adequacy of our reserves. And, in fact, this quarter we did release
some of those prior year reserves, primarily accident years 2014 and 2015. But our
position on the balance sheet is very solid, and we feel good about.
When we're talking about accident year 2018, we're starting to see some headwinds and
we're looking at frequency, which is a leading indicator. And so we've made an adjustment
in Middle Market, but we're connecting the dots through the accident years. And I just
want to point out, there's a difference between what we're carrying and what we're
seeing today, so that's really what's happening in the comp world.
In the general liability world, our normal GL book is performing according to our
expectations. What we did in the quarter, we have a specialized high-hazard, heavy
products group in Middle Market, and that is the book that we saw some increase in both
frequency and severity in older accident years. So we took action to strengthen those
years. That was our high hazard book. I want to differentiate that from what we're seeing
in our normal go-forward GL book, and there we continue to watch but feel pretty good
about current conditions.

Jay Cohen here. A couple of questions. First is the Commercial insurance expense ratio,
that did tick up. I understand on the Personal Lines side, you're spending more from a
marketing standpoint. What's driving the higher expense ratio on the Commercial side?

FINAL

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Jay, I'm looking at Doug, he'll add his commentary, but I would just say we continue to
invest in our infrastructure technology and digital experience for the customer. So, yeah, it
is elevated from trends over the years. But, again, it's a conscious part of our strategy. I
would say particularly from the Commercial Lines capability side, we're probably 60%,
70% through some of the core systems that we want to replace.
And I would say the other – there are always true-ups from quarter to quarter on
commissions, whether it, in essence, be profit-sharing or anything else commission-wise.
So, Doug, that's what I would say. But what would you add?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Yeah, that's a large piece and there's a little bit of compensation in there, Chris, as well.
So, as we look at plans and we look at performance through six months, just some trueups that we normally do, but IT is a driver, and are continued to invest inside our
businesses.

A - Christopher J. Swif t

probably disappoint you a little bit and refrain really from a lot of speculation here,
because it just doesn't do anyone any good, but I think the metrics that we've talked
about in the past really are in the premium range. Sort of a $2 billion premium company is
still accurate as a target as a bolt-on. So that's what we define. So that's what I would just
say right now, is that we're still in that bolt-on category, and that's what I would leave you
with.

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

It's part of the equation, on the metrics, on timeframes, payback periods, IRRs, returns on
tangible, intangible capital, so we look at it all. And I'm not going to tell you there's a hard
and fast rule, but we do want to earn acceptable returns, as we always define it, above
our cost of equity capital, in a relatively near term. And we define that term somewhere in
the three to four year period of time. So that's what I would say right now.

Q - Brian Meredith

Great, thanks for that. And then I'm just curious, looking at your small commercial
business. Policy count retention has continued to kind of slip for the last, call it, year and a
half to two years. What's going on there and what are you guys doing to maybe improve
that policy count retention?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Brian, we certainly focused on both the retention and the new. There's a little bit of
pressure in the micro space. I think we've seen more entrants in the micro and the small,
but there isn't anything material that I would point out that is worthy of spending a lot
more time on this morning.
Overall, we've been very steady growers of this business organically over the past five
years. I know in the quarter we were a little off. There's a workers' comp dynamic to it,
there's competition to it. But we're being thoughtful about this business. We continue to
innovate, some of the innovations that we're dropping into our platform I do expect will
show progress and growth in future quarters. So, I don't look at this as the full trend for
the next couple of quarters, but I do remind you that workers' comp is an important part
of our small commercial platform and therefore we're going to be in a different pricing
environment over the next couple of quarters than what we've seen in the prior probably
two, three years.

Q - Gary Kent Ransom

{BIO 3446828 <GO>}

Good morning. I was going to ask for a little more detail on underlying loss trends. You did
give us a little bit of a picture on workers' comp and high hazard liability lines, but I wonder
if you could just give us a sense of the entire array of what you're seeing. I mean, is
workers' comp the good end of the loss trends, still relatively benign? And then what's at
the worse end from your perspective? Is it commercial auto, or is it some other liability
line?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Good morning, Gary. I would say that the reason I made mention of workers' comp is we
do have full attention on this frequency dynamic. As I think across the rest of the lines in
commercial, yeah, we had a little spike in our high hazard GL in our prior book, but
generally, all of our other lines are still in a relatively benign low single-digit loss trend
environment. So I don't think a lot has changed as we looked at the quarter and our loss
performance relative to trends, and I spoke about the line that we saw some degree of
change in workers' comp.

Q - Gary Kent Ransom

{BIO 3446828 <GO>}

Yeah. So there's a lot of talk about inflation, not just you, but other companies as well, and
yet it doesn't really seem to be showing up in the numbers. Everyone's concerned about
it, but it's not quite there yet. Is that something you're able to respond to realistically? If
you have the concern of inflation, can you raise rates in small commercial? Or is that part
of what's – competitive activity is not allowing you to do that?

Well, I shared our ex-comp pricing in the quarter at 5% plus and feel very good about that,
and I feel good about the small commercial component of that, and the Middle Market. So
we've been working at not only comp but the other elements of our book of business
from a pricing perspective over time. And I think our performance demonstrates the
progress of that pricing. Yeah, it is a competitive marketplace, but the quarter we just
punched, I feel really good about. I think in terms of absolute performance, a very strong
quarter, Gary, and I would say we've been able to price for what we've seen in the
marketplace relative to the trend successfully over the last couple of years.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey, thanks. Just a couple, I guess, follow-ups on workers' comp for Doug. I guess I'm sort
of just thinking about the commentary on accident year margin pressure in workers' comp
being a function of a few things, is it safe to say, though, it's still mostly the fact that
pricing just isn't as good? That's probably the biggest reason why you're talking about the
margin headwinds there?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Well, I would say that in 2018, the biggest reason is really twofold. One is, yes, we're
watching these loss costs drop in and we're dealing with the state-by-state dynamics of
where our loss experience is and what to do about our multiplier in these various states,
So that's point A.
Page 17 of 24



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2018-07-27

FINAL

Point B is that we've got a bit of an inflection on frequency that we're watching very
carefully. So two quarters don't make a full trend, but we've had a couple of quarters now
of positive frequency, and that's the first time we've seen that in several years. So there's
full attention on what our own book of business is telling us relative to signals in frequency.
As I mentioned, the severity signals look well within our expectation, so we're watching
severity, both medical and indemnity, but feel pretty good about that. Just looking at the
combination of both pricing and frequency, we are very focused on choices and options in
front of us relative to workers' compensation.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Got it, and so you've seen a couple quarters of positive frequency. Should I take that to
mean that – I guess you're assuming in your new loss picks that there's positive frequency
in workers' comp?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

So I don't want to spend too much time talking about reserving process. But, in general,
we're looking at earn patterns, we use historical and we bring in current year, both
severity and frequency, as appropriate. So, the reason we adjusted Middle is that we're
trying to make sure we're recognizing what we're seeing in our patterns in the first two
accident quarters of 2018, and in the Middle we're seeing a pickup greater than we
expected, which is why we adjusted our reserves. We'll have to continue to assess what
third quarter and fourth quarter bring. But at the moment, we made adjustments based
on everything we could see in our book of business to make sure we closed up second
quarter where we should have been from a loss ratio perspective.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Got it. And then, I guess, the last one I had was just thinking about some of the favorable
results in the other casualty lines this quarter, like general liability, commercial auto. And I
remember you guys adding the reserves in those areas in, I think, call it, 2014, 2015, at
one point that was sort of a headwind. Is there a reason those results are getting better,
because you're finding out now that some of the things that you saw back then didn't end
up being quite as negative or is there something else driving that?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

There are probably lots of things driving that. I think our behavior and our discipline in the
marketplace starts that discussion. I think we've become a very solid, thoughtful
underwriter, using both skill sets at desk level and also data analytics. So, I start there.
Secondly, I think with Beth and Chris, over the last, seven, eight years, we've worked hard
to be disciplined on reserving to bring forward to be more current as we're looking at
data. So I think our entire reserving process is much stronger today than it was over the
last 10 years.

Page 18 of 24



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2018-07-27

Putting all that together, we're also trying to be very consistent in our approach quarter to
quarter. And the reflections of all those behaviors, I think lead us to feel much better
about our balance sheet today than we probably did seven years ago.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Hi, thank you. Beth, can we start out, just if I recall from the Q, we have $2.3 billion at the
holdco now. Can we just walk through what's left to come, as far as stack (00:52:31)
dividends in the second half versus the first? I know what you're talking about for the year,
but I don't know what's been taken already versus what's left to come.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Beth Ann Bombara
Sure. So, again, I'll remind you that with some of the actions that we did at the end of last
year with the Aetna acquisition, that really decreased our dividend capacity for 2018. So
we are not expecting dividends from P&C or Group Benefits in the second half of this
year. We would expect to see a modest amount from Mutual Funds. But for the most part,
there's not additional dividends coming in from the subsidiaries in the second half of this
year. And for P&C, because some of the Talcott proceeds actually went through various
legal entities to get to the holding company, our dividend capacity for ordinary dividends
in P&C really probably for the most part won't be there until the second half of 2019.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Got it. And then do we have any tax-sharing payments coming in second half, or did those
all coming in first half ?

A - Beth Ann Bombara
Yeah, so, a little bit. I mean, obviously that will dependent upon actual taxable income
forecasts for the second half of the year. But based on our current estimates, I'd
anticipate probably another $150 million maybe will come in, in the second half of 2018 to
the holding company. Again, that can bounce around just based on actual results. And
then we've also in the past highlighted the fact that we will – we do anticipate a refund
coming in in 2019 for our AMT credits. And that will come in when we file our tax return,
which could be as late as September of 2019.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay, I was going to ask about that one too. So, if I take the tax sharing minus the
corporate dividends, would suggest you end the year somewhere around the $2.3 billion
you're at right now at the holdco?

sorry, I hit my mic off by mistake – yeah, maybe a little bit less than that depending on

usually in the third quarter. But I'd expect to be roughly about $2 billion.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

Perfect, okay. So, Chris, I guess I was hoping you could talk a little bit more, I know you've
already commented, but on the capital side, I guess I don't understand the harm in
putting an authorization out there even – you don't have to necessarily commit to using it
tomorrow, but let's just say what happened with Facebook yesterday, or the President
does something or whatever and the market's down 20% in the next three months.
Wouldn't you want to have an authorization out there? I mean, why not have it out there
as an option? Just because you put one out there doesn't say you have to use the whole
thing?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks, Ian. I understand your point of view, I do. And you communicated clearly. I
guess the simplest way I can explain it is given our real intention – and I understand
different scenarios that you just pointed out, but I wanted to be as crystal clear as
possible that we weren't going to be buying shares, and we wanted time to continue to
deploy that capital into revenue streams, if possible. Didn't want to create any confusion.
So that's the simplest way as I could say it. And I didn't really want to signal that we were
going to be in in the market. And you did the math on the holdco. We're not sitting on a
lot of excess capital today. It does build over time. So as we sit here, here and now, and
project in the near-term, Ian, I just didn't want to confuse anyone.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

No, that's fair. I guess the one thing I'd push back on a little bit is that you don't have a lot
of excess capital today. I mean, it's a significant part of your market cap, right? And you
could do another Aetna and still be fine, and then have healthy dividends for 2019, plus
AMT, plus tax-sharing, right? I mean, certainly, when we project to the end of 2019, you
get to some pretty significant numbers. So, I mean, can you give us a sense of timetable?
Is this something every quarter we should expect another update on whether there will
be a change? Or we're going to – maybe you won't address it again until you give
guidance for 2019? Or sort of when should we expect another update, is maybe the best
way to ask it?

FINAL

Oh, thanks. Yeah, I just had a couple follow-ups real quick. Did you cover specifically on
commercial auto where you think price versus loss cost is now?
And then the second one on the frequency in workers' comp, I'm not sure I actually heard
what it is. Is it people getting in car accidents while they're at the job or is there some kind
of slip and fall thing happening out there? You alluded to less experienced workers, but if
there's a thing that's actually happening that causes the frequency at work, I'd be
interested in that.

Okay, Randy, let me take them each separately. On the commercial auto front, we're still
getting strong single-digit pricing in auto and I expect that to be on top of trend. So good
news there from commercial auto. Still more work to be done, but good news in terms of
where we are in the current quarter.
Relative to frequency, I suggested that we believe there's some macro factors across the
industry relative to employment. And inexperienced workers that is driving the trend, it's
going to take time for us to mature those observations. And we're spending a lot of time
looking at SIC class, geographies, size of risk, et cetera, et cetera. But know we're crosscutting the data very hard and, at the moment, it looks a little more broad-based than just
a couple of classes and we see this inexperienced worker dynamic where they tend to be
injured in a more frequent basis than more experienced workers. I don't think that's a
surprise to anybody on the call. That's just a fact of something as underwriters we have to
deal with every day on our risk business.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

Okay. But you can't point to it being – we've seen auto accidents creep into some other
workers' comp companies. So, I'm just trying to just isolate that. And I guess the answer is
you don't know. And then back on commercial auto, you said you're over trying to buy it
(01:02:55). Like, roughly how many basis points do you think you're over – pricing over loss
cost in commercial auto?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Let me just go back to your first point. At this point, I don't see the full connection. I don't
think auto is driving our workers' comp frequency increase. And we'll continue to study
that. And if it changes, I'll share that going forward. And secondly, we don't share
specifically exactly those points, but it's a couple of points over top of loss trend at this
point, relative to pricing versus trend.

That's great. Thanks a lot.

But Doug, I'd make the point, too, that it's still not anywhere near where we want to be
from a long-term return point of view. So the current year and maybe the last 18 months
we were out-earning loss trends, but there are still a ways to get to an overall acceptable
combined ratio.

I agree with that, Chris.
