Presentation
Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. In my name is Gianandrea Roberti. I'm the Head of Investor
Relations at Tryg. We published our Q1 results earlier this morning, and I have here with
me Morten Hubbe, Group CEO; Barbara Plucnar Jensen, Group CFO; and Johan Kirstein
Brammer, our Group CCO.
With these few words, over to you, Morten.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Gian, and we start on slide 3 where we see that Q1 is a little bit a tale of two
stories. On one hand, we have very strong progress and very strong insurance results
both in Trygg-Hansa and in the new -- in the classic swipe business and in the new TryggHansa business. But on the other hand, we also have investment losses driven by very
diﬃcult market. And indeed, a very diﬀerent risk approach in RSA that doesn't have the
same matching strategy that we have in Tryg.
If you look at the insurance result ﬁrst, we're very pleased to have the highest ever Q1
insurance second quarter result of DKK754 million in the Tryg classic business and we're
very pleased indeed to see Trygg-Hansa delivering extremely strong combined ratio of

FINAL

73.3 in Q1 and a technical result of DKK621 million. Actually taking the new family what if
scenario technical result to almost DKK1.4 billion but we also see that RSA London has
delivered a negative investment result for Sweden and Norway of DKK599 million, which
has really the big swing factor of the quarter. We see that RSA has not worked with a
matching strategy which results in more volatility, and Barbara will talk about the fact that
we are now restructuring investments. We now have full operational control after 1st of
April, and we will restructure the portfolio to match and mirror Tryg's matching strategy.
So classic has a combined ratio of 88 technical result of DKK754 million, very strong
growth particularly in small commercial but also in private lines while we have negative as
expected growth in corporate. Improved underlying claims and RSAs synergies of 50
million impacting Trygg-Hansa positively. We improve underlying claims by 100 basis
points for the group while being ﬂat in private which is in line with recent trends and we
are happy to see improvement driven by corporate and commercial in particular. As
mentioned, total negative investment of DKK284 million actually only DKK124 million
negative investment from Tryg Classic. I think that's actually satisfactory and well done in a
diﬃcult quarter and it shows that the matching strategy works. But as I mentioned, minus
DKK599 million administered out of RSA London in investment result for Sweden and
Norway. Happy that we are paying a dividend per share of DKK1.55 for the ﬁrst quarter,
which is an increase of 45% year-on-year, starting an attractive dividend journey. Solvency
of 184, maintaining our ﬁrst half solvency guidance of 195 to 205.
Now, if we turn to slide 4, we show the customer highlights. We continue to see
improvements in customer satisfaction with a score of 85 versus 84 in the ﬁrst quarter last
year. We are working to continuously improve customer experience and this quarter we
are pleased to see new digital solutions. For instance, track and trace for claims handling
in Norway and simpliﬁed digital solutions for customer in commercial, improving the
customer satisfaction score again this quarter from a very high level.
Q1 this year was also a quarter where we saw more than 12,000 customers that we helped
with claims related to storms in Denmark and Norway. And also in Denmark, we helped
more than 50 families with a big ﬁre in an apartment building in Copenhagen. We didn't
insure the building but we insure the consent and the re-housing of these 50 families. Of
course, in a dire situation, happy to help them out.
On slide 5, we elaborate on the highest technical result ever. As I mentioned, Tryg Classic
of DKK754 million highest ever compared to DKK751 year-on-year. We see strong growth
in private and commercial, improved underlying claims, and generally improved
performance that mitigates higher level of weather claims and large claims. You're seeing
private much lower result result at DKK273 million technical, impacted of course by the
storms in Denmark and Norway, but also this large ﬁre claim in Copenhagen. Commercial
improved technical results, improved underlying proﬁtability, and has higher level of large
claims but also higher level of positive run-oﬀ gains. COVID improved the technical
results signiﬁcantly, continuing to improve underlying claims that's very positive, but also
help much by higher level of run-oﬀ gains in this quarter. Sweden continued to improve
underlying claims, but lower run-oﬀ gains resulted in lower technical result.

As I mentioned, this is the last quarter where Trygg-Hansa, Sweden, and Codan Norway, is
not fully integrated in the P&L. Had they been fully integrated this quarter, the new and
large families total technical result would have been almost 1.4 billion showing indeed the
very strong earnings capacity of the new group passing.

FINAL

I'm passing it on to you, Johan.

Johan Kirstein Brammer

{BIO 18640275 <GO>}

Thank you, Morten, and I think we are going to slide 6 where we are opening up the Q1
ﬁnancial performance of Codan Norway and Trygg-Hansa. Trygg-Hansa reported a
premiums growth of around 3% in local currency in Q1 while Codan Norway reported a
reduction in premiums impacted by the transfer of (inaudible) business to Tryg from the
start of the year. Adjusting for this transfer, the growth was as expected slightly negative
for Codan Norway. The growth of Trygg-Hansa continued but was with 3% in local
currency slightly lower than what was reported in the previous quarter primarily impacted
by a drop in the sales of car insurance as a consequence of new car sales in Sweden,
dropping 26% in this quarter compared to Q1 last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Trygg-Hansa's technical result was DKK621 million, driven by an excellent combined ratio
of 73.3 while Codan Norway's technical result was DKK6 million driven by a combined
ratio of 97.5.
On page 7, we are opening up the Q1 for Trygg-Hansa even further. Trygg-Hansa's
ﬁnancial performance was impacted by a drop in run-oﬀ gains compared to Q1 last year,
which was the last quarter of reporting as part of the RSA Group. Furthermore, there was
no positive COVID impact in this particular quarter, but the increased interest rates in
Sweden of approximately 100 basis points had a signiﬁcant positive impact on the
technical result due to discounting of claims reserves. We are pleased to see that even in
a period with slightly higher growth for Trygg-Hansa than the previous years, we see a
slight improvement in the underlying claims ratio and also that the combined ratio in the
usually most challenging quarter was at 73.3. It is important, however, to note that both Q1
this year and Q1 last year are somewhat extraordinary. The ﬁve-year average combined
ratio for Q1 for Trygg-Hansa is approximately hovering around the 76% mark.
Moving to slide 8, looking at the RSA synergies for the ﬁrst quarter. For the ﬁrst quarter,
this year we report synergies of DKK50 million and these are unsurprisingly mainly cost
related in line with experience from the Alka transaction. In general, there is a positive
impact from natural attrition but we also utilize the new group's bigger procurement
power to improve procurement agreements. After the demerger 1st of April, we are in full
control of Trygg-Hansa and Codan Norway and can therefore realize a high level of
synergies moving forward.
Moving to slide 9 on shareholders remuneration. Let me just reiterate what you
mentioned, Morten, that we are paying a dividend of DKK1.55 per share in Q1 this quarter,
an increase of 45% compared to the ﬁrst quarter last year. A couple of months ago at our
Capital Market Day, we published a relative precise guidance in terms of shareholders'

FINAL

returns for the next three years. We aim to pay between DKK12 billion and DKK14 billion in
ordinary dividends between 2022 and 2024 and adding to that a buyback of
approximately 5 billion plan to start in H1 this year following the DCCA approval of the
sale of Codan Denmark to Alm. Brand.
We aim very clearly to remain a dividend stock and the full consolidation of RSA ﬁgures,
the synergies development and the booking of nearly all transaction and restructuring
cost in 2022 will drive our earnings substantially higher and boost our dividend capacity
in the coming years. 2021 and also in 2022 we have obviously seen some turbulence in
the P&L, driven by the equity accounting and the transaction and integration costs, but
things will stabilize towards the end of this year and our commitment to a strong dividend
development is as ﬁrm as always.

Bloomberg Transcript

And with that, we are slowly moving into premiums at portfolio the next section and we
are turning to page 11. Topline growth was reported 5.1% for the quarter and 5.9%
adjusted for bonus premium rebates, driven by growth in all private and commercial
segments, private being the most proﬁtable area and therefore we are very satisﬁed with
the growth in this segment of reported 5.7% and even 7.2% adjusted for bonus premium
rebates. Commercial had a growth of 8.6%, which was a combination of organic growth in
Denmark with a particularly strong growth in small commercial segment in line with our
communication at the Capital Market Day in November last year. And in Norway, the
growth of commercial was driven by price increases for especially larger commercial
customers.
Corporate on other hand showed a negative growth of minus 0.8% and was impacted by
proﬁtability initiatives in all countries. Also, the growth was positively impacted by the
transfer of Codan Norway brokered customers and adjusted for this, the negative growth
would have been approximately minus 3%. The development in the corporate area
follows the target for this area presented at the CMD in November last year. Sweden
showed a growth of just over 2% impacted by price adjustments, an improvement in the
retention rates.
Turning to page 12 on pricing. Adjusting prices in accordance with inﬂation is very
important and therefore we monitor the development very closely. In periods with higher
inﬂation in the prices of material, Tryg has been able to mitigate this through strong
procurement agreements. We have seen some inﬂation impact especially for housing
building and therefore we, especially in Norway, see an increase in average prices in this
quarter.
On Page 13, we are laying out the customer retention development and customer focus is
extremely important and customers view of Tryg is best monitored through exactly the
retention rate. In this quarter, we are very pleased to see an improvement in the retention
rates for all business areas. For Private Denmark, we are pleased to see a very strong
development in the retention rate to 90.8% against 89.9% and excluding Nordea churn at
level of 91.4%. We are satisﬁed that we continue to have a net positive impact when
looking at the Nordea and Danske Bank portfolios in total due to very strong sales
through Danske Bank. In Norway, we are very satisﬁed that we continue to see a
continued high retention even with very high growth in the last two years. And for
Page 4 of 24

commercial, we saw an improvement for Denmark with 0.2 percentage point and a similar
improvement for Norway also with 0.2 percentage point even in a period where we've
been working very much with price adjustments across the portfolios.

FINAL

And with that, I'll pass it over to you, Barbara, on claims and expenses.

Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Thank you, Johan. Well, on slide 15, we provide more details exactly on the underlying
claims ratio. Tryg reported an improvement in the underlying claims ratio of 100 basis
points for the Group while the private segment was ﬂat. This is in line with the past
quarters. The improvement in the Group underlying claims ratio was primarily driven by
proﬁtability initiatives in the commercial and the corporate segment.

Bloomberg Transcript

As mentioned previously, strong growth in the private segment is impacting the
underlying claims ratio as new business initially is not as proﬁtable as old business. The
claims ratio for new business is approximately 3% higher, primarily because new
customers tend to make more frequent claims under their insurance policies during the
ﬁrst couple of years. Inﬂation is unusually high at the moment and a very important area to
monitor for Tryg.
In general, Tryg is helped by strong procurement agreements as Johan just described
and in an environment like the one we experienced at the moment, increased interest
rates will have a positive impact on claims reserves through the discounting. If the
procurement agreement and high interest rates do not fully mitigate inﬂation, Tryg will
adjust prices in the diﬀerent markets as we have just shown. From Q2 2002, we will report
the claims ratio and the underlying claims ratio for the enlarged Group and for the private
segment. Furthermore, please note that we do a small adjustment in the segments that
we will report from Q2 and onwards, and those will be private, commercial, and corporate
across Denmark, Sweden and Norway.
Please turn to slide 16. In this slide, we show the large and weather claims experience in
the quarter, the discounted rate of Tryg's liabilities as well as the run-oﬀ result. As Morten
brieﬂy mentioned, both large claims and weather claims were signiﬁcantly higher in Q1
this year compared to the same period last year, respectively 39% and 66% up. However,
bear in mind that Q1 2021 was at an unusually low level. This year, the large claims level
was somewhat higher than the expected level while the weather claims were at slightly
lower level than expected for typical ﬁrst quarter of the year with winter in the Nordics.
The discounting rate of liabilities move upwards to 1% compared to 0.2% last year
following an increase in the market-based interest rates and this, as mentioned, has a
positive impact on the claims reserving.
Please turn to slide 17. The expense ratio for Q1 '22 was 14.1% in line with the same period
last year. It's important for us to have a good cost control and generally believe that an
expense ratio around the 14% mark is an important competitive advantage. In the ﬁrst
quarter, the number of employees was slightly higher driven among other things by the
Page 5 of 24

FINAL

higher business volumes requiring, for example, more claims handlers, as well as
investments in IT.
Now let's have a closer look at the investments in the quarter, so please turn to slide 19.
It's very important for us to insure the understanding of our investments. In Trygs
standalone, we have approximately DKK43 billion of invested assets, which are split in the
match portfolio of around DKK29 billion, which is backing our insurance reserves and the
free portfolio of approximately DKK14 billion, which is the capital of the company. The
asset allocation of the free portfolio is diverse and has been broadly unchanged in the
quarter.
On slide 22, you can see the impact of the volatile markets that we have seen following
the highest geopolitical tensions in recent times. Tryg's standalone for Q1 reported a
negative investment result of DKK124 million and the free portfolio had a return of DKK27
million beneﬁting from strong return from properties while all other asset classes were
negatively impacted by the turmoil. The match portfolio generated an unusual negative
results primarily due to widening Nordic COVID bond rates.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have inserted a new slide on slide 21, and here we are showing the asset mix of RSA
Scandinavia, which is a total of DKK24 billion of invested assets. As it is visible from the
pie chart, the asset mix has limited risk, especially after the sale of the REIT's portfolio. The
main issue causing the investment loss of DKK599 million is the fact that RSA Scandinavia
has a very diﬀerent investment policy and have not speciﬁcally targeted an ALM matching
in the same way that we do in Tryg.
In this quarter, interest rates in Sweden went up by approximately 100 basis points across
the entire interest rate curve resulting in large negative value adjustments only partly
oﬀset by being in the liabilities. Furthermore, the discounting curve in Sweden does not
have proper durations passed the 10-year point and is artiﬁcially constructed using the
last liquid point observable only at the -- at the year 10 of duration, which makes the
matching somewhat more complicated. Furthermore, the RSA Group has also been using
diﬀerent reporting and accounting principles and, hence, the Scandinavian business was
run diﬀerently than would be the case in Tryg.
Please turn to slide 22. As we've talked about, we strongly believe that the investment
policy that we have in Tryg today is right for a company like us and therefore look to
adjust the investments in the acquired business. Following demerger, we now have full
control of the assets and it is therefore possible to fully aligns investments in a previously
RSA to the Tryg set up as shown in this slide.
In general, we will continue to have a strong focus on the matching of the assets and the
liabilities. This reduce volatility at times with interest rate changes and thereby reduce the
capital requirement. The overall asset mix will remain broadly the same as you know from
Tryg today and by now, a majority of the new assets have already been adjusted to
resemble the Tryg proﬁle. The remaining part will be done in the following quarters and
we expect to be fully in place by autumn.

FINAL

On slide 23, we look at our solvency ratio with Tryg's reporting solvency ratio at the end of
the quarter of 184, down from 188 at the end of Q4. The downward move is primarily
caused by the spread between the reported net proﬁt, which is unusually low and the
dividend cost. Looking at the SCR, you will see that Codan's SCR is down due to some
technicalities in Codan's model. We have guided a range for the solvency ratio between
195 and 205 at the end of the ﬁrst half year this year and the change in Codan's
standalone SCR only has limited impact on this.
We conﬁrm the guidance we have given for the ﬁrst half year and would like to remind
that it includes the impact of the closing of the sale of Codan Denmark and, hence, the
expected launch of the DKK5 billion buybacks that we have announced previously. We
see this as a strong starting point for the enlarged group to drive further shareholder
returns.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide 24, we have the usual overview of the current Tier 1 and Tier 2 capacity. It's
important to remember that Q1 2022 SCR of DKK9.6 billion will be approximately DKK1
billion lower when Codan Denmark is spun-oﬀ, which means that the current Tier 2
capacity appears extraordinarily high. The Tier 1 capacity is linked to the overall level of
the core equity Tier 1 which is ultimately driven by proﬁts and dividends. Tryg has no plans
to issue further debt.
On slide 25, the updated buildup of our solvency capital requirement shown split into the
diﬀerent relevant categories. Please remember that we only use our internal model for the
insurance risk, all else is on the standard formula. Additionally, we are sharing the split of
the market risk charge between the diﬀerent asset classes and as expected equities
continue to attract the highest capital charge.
Slide 26 then shows the historical development of our solvency ratio. It's quite clear that
adjusting for the transaction at events like the acquisition of Alka and RSA Scandinavia,
then you can see that the development of the solvency ratio is very stable. In a normal
year, our own funds primarily move given by net proﬁts and dividends, while solvency
capital requirement moves very little driven by the growth of the business. We are ending
the quarter with a comfortable solvency ratio of 184. And as mentioned, conﬁrm the
guidance for the ﬁrst half-year of the solvency ratio between 195 and 205.
On slide 7, we provide an overview of the solvency ratio sensitivities and not a lot has
changed in this quarter. As always, the biggest sensitivity is the spread risk, which is a
direct consequence of the fact that covered bonds, by far, the largest asset class.
On that note, I will now hand over to Morten to remind me -- to remind us of the
important things to remember in an eventful year.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

The important thing to remember in '22 on slide 28, we look forward to starting full
consolidation in Q2. We have, of course, no changes to the guidance for solvency in H1
this year. Integration cost will follow the previous communication and we expect the

FINAL

majority of the DKK1.1 billion will be booked this year. During Q2 preparing for the
second-quarter results, we will publish additional info on the new group; the structure of
the group going forward, private, commercial, corporate; the new levels of expected
large claims and weather claims in order for you to build your models and calibrate; and
also we will give you information on the historical underlying claims for the enlarged
group.
And then on slide 29, we just reiterate our ﬁnancial targets for 2024 that we
communicated at the CMD in London. And, of course, most importantly repeat the
ambitious technical result target of DKK7 billion to DKK7.4 billion. Very pleased to see the
enlarged group having a technical result of almost DKK104 billion in this Q1. And, of
course, looking forward to harvest the synergies of DKK900 million. And then we also on
this slide reiterate that we will return DKK17 billion to DKK19 billion to our shareholders
between ordinary dividend and buybacks in the period 2022 to 2024. So, indeed, a very
attractive dividend journey ahead of us.
And of course on slide 3, we conclude the presentation with our favorite quote from John
D. Rockefeller.
And with that, I think we are ready to take your questions.

Questions And Answers

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Jakob Brink
from Nordea. Please go ahead, your line is open.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Thank you and thanks for taking my questions. I have three questions please.
The ﬁrst one is on the -- on the asset liability matching in Trygg-Hansa, just to understand.
So what is exactly that you need to do and I guess I'm also wondering why didn't you do it
already? Are you ﬁxing the matching between assets and liabilities? That was the ﬁrst one.
The second question is about the long-term guidance of DKK7 billion to DKK7.4 billion. I
understand it's early days, but you do have a comment, saying that due to discounting of
claims reserved increased interest rates will have a positive impact on claims going
forward which will help mitigate claims inﬂation. But I think also corporate, you just said
the claims inﬂation was dealt with through hedgings and price initiatives. But here, it
sounds like high interest rates will be part of the solution to inﬂation. So just some
clariﬁcation, that would be nice.
And then lastly on the Codan SCR reduction. Why is that and is it some model changes or
is it some technical on the Tryg books or is it the actual SCR in Codan that has been
reduced?

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

FINAL

Good. Thank you very much for your questions, Jakob, and I think I will start on your
questions on the investments.
There is a number of things as mentioned that we need to do, but I think it's important to
start with why haven't we done it earlier. If you go back to the structuring of the
transaction, we were able to close the deal 1st of June last year, but not only -- not until 1st
of April this year have we achieved full control of Sweden and Norway that we
fundamentally have acquired. That means that from 1st of June last year until demerger,
the asset allocation and the management of the investment has been out of our hands, so
to speak. That has been taken cared of by the old investment team in the RSA Group also
applying the investment principles and policies that they have been using. Like many
other international companies, they don't apply.

Bloomberg Transcript

You can say the matching approach that we have in Tryg and you can say we also, on the
free portfolio, have less of a risk appetite. So there are some features in terms of the asset
allocation that we will need to adjust for.
Some of that has already happened. We gained the operational control now 1st of April
and already during the month of April to where we are now. We currently have a risk
proﬁle, which is similar to Tryg's on approximately 80% on the match portfolio and 80%
on the -- on the free portfolio. So we are well progressed on, you can say, at the
adjustment of the investment assets, but we still have some things we need to deal with
and as we also explained, that is something that we expect will take some months from
here before we are fully done. It's important...

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Just one question if...

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

You mentioned also there were some problems about the discounting after year 10. Is that
a Swedish thing like during the old sort of accounting regime or will that still be an issue
going forward?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

You can say it's down to the methodology in terms of how you apply the matching
principles and without going into too many technical details. It's a question of whether
you apply using outright purchase of bonds or whether you actually use the swap curve.
So there are some technicalities that you can work within in that respect.

Page 9 of 24



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity

So you can say, again, being very mindful that that is what we want to achieve. It will also
have an impact on the instruments used on the investment portfolio.

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And on the question, Jakob, you're right. Increased interest rates help the discounting,
which helps the combined ratio, which helps the technical result. On the other hand, we
have more inﬂation on our hands. We will attack this from more angles. I think when we
see inﬂation, we work with both our procurement and procurement programs to reduce
the inﬂation. We're seeing that having quite a strong success. Then, of course, we work
with price increases in the areas where we see the most inﬂation like in property we will try
our best to make sure that procurement and price increases [ph]cater 41 oﬀset the
increased inﬂation. On the hand, fully predicting inﬂation at the moment is really, really
diﬃcult like predicting the outcome of the current war. But all other things equal,
increased interest rates will improve the technical result.
We will not adjust the target of DKK7.0 billion to DKK7.4 billion but we're very pleased that
we potentially have some tailwind from interest rates. You may recall that when we did the
targets for 17 to 20, subsequently, interest rates fell and we then had headwinds instead.
So we're not in the habit of changing our ﬁnancial targets, but of course, we prefer
tailwind to headwind.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Last question was around the SCR in Codan. Bear in mind that currently, they have an
internal model that they have been using as part of the old Group. Again, following the
full operational control, they will be included in our internal model. So you can say that is
where you will see things being aligned further and what we have experienced in Q1 is
down to some technicalities in the model that I don't think we should probably spend that
much time on the call here.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay, fair enough. Many thanks.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Asbjorn Mork from Danske Bank.
Please go ahead, your line is open.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Good morning and thank you. If I may just come back to the question on the discounting
and sort of the mid-term targets. If you look at it this coming is up 80 basis points yearover-year. It's actually 20 basis points higher than you communicated a month ago. So I
guess there is a clear beneﬁt here. I acknowledge the uncertainty on the claims inﬂation

FINAL

side that you also mentioned but if I just look at the 100 basis point better claims ratio in
Q1, I guess it's a bit better than you expected in November. And if I look at slide 12 on
your sort of your price development especially with Denmark, it doesn't look too
aggressive. I guess this would be sort of a tailwind -- repricing tailwind for the next couple
of years from that as well. So I guess, all things equal, you are seeing some rather
tailwinds than headwinds versus your expectations back in November leaving aside the
rate environment, but just the repricing eﬀect. Is that fair to say?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I think when it comes to the inﬂation part as plan, I think it's super important that you
really focus on the various areas. There is a lot of diﬀerences whether you look at some of
the areas that are most hard hit at the moment that would be housing and content and
then you have in motor which is also impacted, and then you have other areas that are
less impacted.
So there is actually a huge diﬀerence depending on which parts of our business we're
looking at. And therefore, we really need to pay attention to what needs to be done given
the development that we see. So it's not just a one size ﬁts all, but we really need to work
with this and that also applies to needed price adjustments for instance in housing as we
have seen it in the quarter for instance in Norway is something that that we ﬁnd is needed.

We are [ph] sorority of cautious people. So, of course, we try our best to be ahead of the
curve and not behind the curve, both working with the procurement agreements in
house, property, motor, working with the price adjustments in those areas. And be aware
when you see the average price adjustment, there is quite a lot of diﬀerence in the price
adjustments depending on customer segments and portfolio mix. And then, of course,
getting tailwind from the higher interest rates and the higher discount rates. But probably
also -- so all in all, I think on a good journey to beyond the right side of the curve here,
but also fair to say that probably discount rates have been stabilized at a higher level yet.
Let's hope for that because then it is more permanent tailwind, but the reality is probably
it's more volatile movements in the interest rate curves as we are seeing so far.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

I fully understand it's more that if I look at slide 12, the repricing on your house insurance
0.9%. I guess that's not enough to oﬀset inﬂation in the current environment. So I guess
we should expect that with the price initiatives you're carrying through now to trend
somewhat upwards the next couple of quarters and especially going into next year. So I
guess there will be a tailwind there. It's not reﬂected in the 100 basis points improvement
than we are (Multiple Speakers) Q1.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Whether we look at the earned price increases, all the written price increases, there is a
time gap between the two and I think all players will be looking at including us higher

prices in the house and property segments. So that will lead over the next couple of years
to higher levels of also reported and earned price increases. That's correct.

FINAL

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

All right, fair enough. And then if I may on Trygg-Hansa and Codan Norway. Starting with
Trygg-Hansa, it seems like you're more or less saying that the combined ratio should
deteriorate in a normal Q1 almost a 3 percentage points. I guess that's -- is that only really
related to weather.
And then my second question is that the discounting eﬀect of 100 basis points. I guess
that's roughly DKK25 million in the quarter. So is it fair that you in your investment case in
Trygg-Hansa would have expected roughly DKK100 million lower technical proﬁts for Q1
versus what you're delivering today?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yeah. I think the discounting is super important and gives the unusually low combined
ratio that we see this quarter. Like ﬁrst quarter last year was also unusually low due to the
positive impact from COVID. So those are you could say one-oﬀs.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And then I guess it's fair to say... Go on.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

I'll just go ahead with the Trygg-Hansa.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

No, I was just thinking that it's clear that in Denmark, we're used to sort of fairly equal
seasonality with claims around the four quarters. In Norway, we've been used to
signiﬁcantly worse Q4 and Q1, and very strong Q2 and Q3. Sweden, if you will, is
somewhere in between with more seasonality typically than what we see in Denmark but
less than what we would see in Norway and that's where I think when you model, it
doesn't really have any impact on the full-year numbers; but when you model your
quarterly expectations going forward, I would quote a model more negative split with Q4
and Q1 being the worst quarters in Sweden and typically also, Q2 and Q3 being stronger.
But I think we will share more details with the expected weather claims going forward. You
would get that during Q2 so that you're ready for the Q2 reporting in July.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

And just a follow-up on the Codan Norway business. The transfer of clients to [ph]track in
the beginning of the quarter, did that have any impact on the combined ratio for Q1, the
97.5?

Company Name: Tryg A/S

No, not really. I think it's fair to say that there were good market decisions being made on
transferring renewals directly to Tryg Norway a little bit ahead of time and a little bit ahead
of plan, if you will, but the claims have followed that and I guess if you look at the
historical combined ratio of Codan Norway, it has been around and above 100%
combined ratio historically but with an extremely high cost ratio of around 30%. So the
way we see it, we see the Norwegian Codan journey as one-oﬀ repricing and improving
claims ratio, a journey that they've already started quite well themselves. And then in
particularly taking the Codan Norway business down to our cost ratio, which is what will
[ph]prove the combined ratio of Codan Norway to sort of mid 80s level rather than 100%
level. So it is not a one quarter that is close to 100, it's more the history of that company
being soft scale and having two large cost level.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. Final question from my side on the Codan Denmark deal. How long
are you in the process with the FSA when it comes to buyback approval and if the deal
closes, how long will it take before you can initiate the buyback?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

When it comes to the FSA approval, we have a conditional approval in place. So we are
ready, but obviously, there is a process going on with the DCCA and (inaudible) that we
await the results of.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Very positive that we have the conditional approval with the FSA in place because it
means eﬀectively that we will not need to wait. So once the computation approval is
there, then we can start our buyback program.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Faizan Lakhani from HSBC. Please
go ahead, your line is open.

Q - Faizan Lakhani

{BIO 20034558 <GO>}

Good morning. I have three questions. Coming back to the asset mix change in the RSA
business, what is the level of P&L headwind we can expect once the derisk unchanged
that sort of asset mix towards the pre-classic business? And conversely, what does that
mean we have Solvency II ratio?
The second question is on the Swedish regulator looking into sort of price walking within
Swiss business. I understand you've just got hold of Trygg-Hansa business, but I wanted to
understand how much of the [ph]new hand to adjust the claims inﬂation versus sort of
improvement in margin and what the implication of that regulation or review be?

how is that performing relative year-on-year? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Good. I'll start with the asset mix as I heard it and, sorry, I didn't get the full details, but
you were asking about how the adjustment to the asset mix would aﬀect the Solvency II
ratio?

Q - Faizan Lakhani

{BIO 20034558 <GO>}

And P&L as well.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

And P&L. Yeah, basically, we don't give any guidance on that. I can say that if you look at
the proportions of the portfolio, they have DKK24 billion of assets under management as
is, of which approximately DKK6 billion will be what we would call free portfolio and the
remaining part, a match portfolio. So the ratio is somewhat like the one we have in Tryg
but there will obviously be some longer durations in the Swedish assets given the the
features of their liabilities. But in terms of guidance as such, we don't give that for the
year.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Second question, it's very early days for the regulators project. I think as I understand they
are looking into the diﬀerences in pricing in new customers versus portfolio pricing. I
think for us, the most important part of pricing is understanding the risk and the micro
tariﬃng of pricing to get the right risk selection and the right pricing for the right
segments to continue to allow us to improve our underlying claims ratio. And as far as I
can see, that focus is underserved by any such project.
But, of course, if there is new guidelines on the diﬀerence in pricing between new
customers and existing customers, then we will deal with that but it will not change the
most important part which is intelligence on risk selection, pricing, and selecting the right
customers, which is an area where actually Trygg-Hansa is a very, very skilled, and an area
where we are increasing focus and head count and emphasis and investments across the
Tryg Group.

Q - Faizan Lakhani

{BIO 20034558 <GO>}

Perfect. Thank you.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

And your question on the Tryg guarantee business, obviously, like the rest of our
insurance business, they are very mindful of the impact of inﬂation and what else is
impacting the performance of the businesses they have as customers but that is very
much business as usual. And when it comes to whether they have any exposures related
to Ukraine or Russia, the answer to that is, no.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youdish Chicooree from
Autonomous Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Hi, good morning, everyone. I have three questions please. The ﬁrst one is going back on
the topic of inﬂation. Can you give us a sense of where claims inﬂation is running up in
property in both Denmark and Norway.
And then secondly, I think in your report, you talk about procurement and reserved
discounting mitigating the impact of high inﬂation and that you would adjust prices if it's
not mitigated, does that -- does that mean that the competitive backdrop is actually quite
benign or basically you are ready to lose maybe some volumes or see some churn by
making sure you are priced for inﬂation?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then ﬁnally just on the sale of Codan Denmark. Can you remind us of the expected
timeline for securing the anti-trust approval and whether the recent press reports around
the potential investigation on how Alm. Brand approach this transaction might delay the
whole -- the whole process? Thank you.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think when we look at the inﬂation question, Youdish, and good morning to you as well, I
think the challenge is probably that historically we focused on an average, and then that
average was a meaningful number. I think the challenge at the moment is that the average
is becoming less meaningful because you have this strange situations where some
building materials almost impossible to get hold oﬀ and if you need them and repair, the
price increase could be 30%, 35%, 40%. Other materials have almost no inﬂation. There
are sort of public statistics showing that in property you see inﬂation getting up to 4%, 5%,
but there's an enormous variation underneath that and we see actually with our
procurement agreements, we can pull down the inﬂation.
On the other hand, we also know that we cannot have a 100% compliance with our
procurement agreements so we also see inﬂation. And then I guess in the various
countries, we see motor inﬂation also increasing but being lower than the property
inﬂation, but I would be a little bit careful over emphasizing on the average inﬂation
because at the moment the world is a little bit crazy. So the average is not as as
homogeneous as it usually is but that gives you some indication.
I think in terms of pricing and churn, as Johan showed actually our churn of customers is
very low. We see that our retention rates increase across private, commercial, Denmark
and Norway. We could have added Trygg-Hansa private and Trygg-Hansa commercial.
That is not in the numbers yet, but the reality is the retention rates is increasing in both of
Page 15 of 24



Company Name: Tryg A/S

Date: 2022-04-26

FINAL

those two areas as well. And as Johan mentioned that despite the fact that we are
carrying out price adjustments to capture inﬂation, I think market acceptance of that and
market understanding of the fact that there is inﬂation in society at the moment is high.
You cannot really open the paper without talking about inﬂation. So society and
customers are well aware of that.

A - Johan Kirstein Brammer

{BIO 18640275 <GO>}

And just to add to that, Morten, I guess it also goes to show that our competitors in our
markets are also going through price regulation. So that means that it actually doesn't
necessarily mean that retention rates are impacted negatively.

Bloomberg Transcript

And maybe I can just come back to your third question on the sale of Codan Denmark,
just reminding us all about the process. So I think as Barbara alluded to, everything has
been going according to plan on this process. Everything is approved regarding the sale
of Codan Denmark except for the DCCA who needs to approve and (inaudible) purchase.
We are not a part (inaudible) to details in this dialog with the DCCA but what we do know
is that (inaudible) has been very clearly stating that they expect this deal to close in Q2.
Since we are approaching May, it means that it could be very soon and we are optimistic
and remain optimistic that this will happen in Q2, allowing us to very swiftly after that
approval to initiate our share buyback.
So we don't see any real issues. We don't see any anti-trust topics that should hinder this
approval from the DCCA. It's a matter of the authorities going through the motions and
getting things done, and we are staying optimistic that this will happen in this particular
quarter. And you also mentioned the last point around the investigation, the police
investigations, we have read the same news as you have. We don't see any link to the
competitive -- anti-trust authorities approving the transaction. So we don't see any link
whatsoever.

Hi, good morning, everyone. Just on inﬂation more broadly, I was wondering if your view

My second one is, I was wondering if you have any comments on the situation with the

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Good. Well, on the ﬁrst question on inﬂation, just to be clear, are you alluding to the
wages related to the claims that we have to carry out or the wages related to our own
employees? I was little unsure.

FINAL

Q - Analyst
No, in terms of the claims. So the worker's comp line, if that could be aﬀected as the
result.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yeah. But when it comes to the wage increases, I mean, we clearly follow that and it is very
much a part of what Morten and Johan have already been talking to. So when we look at
the inﬂation, we are very mindful of not only which product areas are we looking at, but
what is -- when are we talking about raw materials or supplies that are needed in order to
carry out the claims handling and obviously the wages for craftsmen and others is a big
part of that as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, again, going down to the details and the nuances of what we track and stay very close
to at the moment, wages is obviously a big proportion of that as well. And there again,
Mike, you've seen across areas and products, you will also see just within the small region
of Scandinavia large geographical diﬀerences in terms of access to and the wages paid to
as mentioned for instance to craftsmen.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And on your question with the ombudsman the way we see it, we have zero doubt that we
have complied with the FSA guidelines on price adjustments. And in our view, there is no
doubt that the FSA is the governing authority on that question. Then we have noticed that
the ombudsman disagrees with the FSA guidelines. And, of course, that is the prerogative
of the ombudsman but in our view, we have no doubt that we've complied with the FSA
guidelines, which means that if two governance bodies disagree, then we'll have to take
that to court. And in our view, there should not be a ﬁnancial consequence of this
agreement and we will need to test that in court and let's see what the process is, but it
could take several years to get that question clariﬁed and we'll just have to take that
process.

Q - Analyst
Just a followup. Have you ever were in discussions with the FSA post the complaint? Have
you had any sort of [ph]reassurance made from them on this on this topic since that
(inaudible) surface or...

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

It's just ﬁne. And I'm sorry that it's in Danish, I believe, but in Danish newspapers, you can
ﬁnd quotes where the Danish FSA has conﬁrmed that that has indeed been the
guidelines. But that it is some time ago because the case is getting a little bit old but that
has actually been conﬁrmed with quotes in the price.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you for taking my questions as well. I have a couple of ones and the ﬁrst one is
around volume, the retention and aﬀordness of clients for price increases these days.
Have you seen in the past that your price increases have made clients bring down the
volumes. We saw some sign in the Baltics when people left their car in the garage rather
than run it during the pandemic. But have you seen anything there of the aﬀordness to
have an insurance or to change the tariﬀs so that you can get better oﬀ in such a way and
then have lower volumes in the past?

A - Johan Kirstein Brammer

{BIO 18640275 <GO>}

Yeah, maybe I should answer that question. I think in general, when we actually do see
that we have an ability to price when there is inﬂation in the market without actually
impacting volume signiﬁcantly, we do believe that with high customer satisfaction and
good levels of communication in a market situation where it's quite clear that there is
inﬂation in the market, we don't see our retention rates or volumes have been impacted
through -- by going through the price motions we are at the moment. I think we are even
displaying that in some of our charts here where we see retention rates going up for all
private and commercial areas at the moment. So at the moment, we are navigating
through that quite nicely with our volume impact.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I guess historical view on this people in the Nordic region tend to keep on insuring their
things regardless of price changes. So people insure their house, they insure their family,
they insure their cars, and they don't really change that because of price changes. I think
the only area where we've seen customers for a period potentially not insuring
themselves what we saw during COVID that there were more people not taking out a new
travel insurance, which I think was a pretty special example because everything was
closed down for a very long period. But for the more fundamental traditional insurance
product, there is no historical examples of Nordic customers signiﬁcantly changing the
insurance because of pricing.

So more so (inaudible) at all. Do you see that all in the future?

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

No, I don't think so. I think our new product development shows that there is an interest
with Nordic customers to defend and protect and secure the values they have so that
when we create new products, there is a very high interest for customers to buy those new
products. So if anything, I think the past two years, three years have showed a tendency
for customers to buy more products, not less. We see also in this Q1 that for instance
number of products in private lines is up a further 0.1 percentage point. It might not sound
like a lot, but when you're already at a high level with a big stock, then increasing 0.1% is
actually quite signiﬁcant.
So, generally, I got to say, no. The tendency is for people to buy more insurance and for
people to hold on to securing their valuables.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

(Technical Diﬃculty) on the wage of inﬂation part. On the Tryg homes, there has a lot of
children insurance. How would that be treated when interest rates are increased and of
course the base amount which the children insurance is calculated on in Sweden is
moving probably upwards with higher inﬂation. How would we -- how should we look at
that product when it comes to the proﬁtability going forward and the moving parts? If you
have -- could shed some light into that.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think it's -- if you look at this more broadly, the longer-tail lines in Sweden are sensitive to
salary changes and mortality changes. And I think you get pretty good public data from
authorities in Sweden on when to adjust this. Typically, the adjustments come quite
seldomly and they had tried to hit a long-term stable environment.
I guess what we're seeing at the moment is more volatile inﬂation and salary movements,
and deciding how that will impact salary longer term, I think is really a second question.
So I don't think we have information yet on changes to neither mortality or salary in the
longer-tail lines. And typically, the adjustments would be more stable and longer-term
focused and not sort of short-term volatility focus. But if there are changes, then of course
that would have to be reﬂected in pricing.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

I think we're not -- we're not disclosing all the details of that. But I think what you can see
is that you should expect that the majority of the decline in Codan Norway is due to move
of brokered business into Tryg's business in Norway. And you can also see that if you
adjust for that in our corporate book, the growth that was reported as minus 0.8% would
actually have been minus 3% if we hadn't moved the brokered business in from Codan
Norway. So it's in that ballpark.

Hi. I have three questions, please. So, the ﬁrst is on run-oﬀ. So you mentioned that there
has been popular positive run-oﬀ gains in corporate and commercial. It was this perhaps
other segments. I'm just wondering, could you give a bit more color in that, please,
whether if is driven by sort of comp lines or ﬁgures and if there is any change in
assumptions were made.
And my second question around the SCR. So you gave this kind of timeframe on how the
investment assets in the RSA parts will be kind of derisk. I guess my -- in this ﬂow already
well factored in terms of the SCR impacting your 105 to 205 guidance and half-year or we
should be some maybe like -- there should be more a few had on the SCR from what you
are showing in terms of the derisking?
So -- and third question is I driven -- I mean, the solvency life span (inaudible) guided
range and this shows it's much more line or you need to run the business given the risk
proﬁle. Should we now think about special dividend for this year? Thank you.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yes. If I start with the latter part on the solvency ratio where we, of course, have guided the
195 to 205. I think what we have been saying also at the Capital Markets Day is that
basically, this is a new level. You can say the 195 to 205 to embark on our journey. It is
something we're -- obviously, there is a lot of changes taking place throughout 2022. Our
P&L and so forth is impacted by a lot of one-oﬀs and so forth. So you shouldn't see this as
a permanent new level.
So at some point, we will be looking at, you can say, the overall capital repatriation. But I
think it's also fair to say that we just want to stabilize and make sure that we have the right
stat on the combined business going forward.

And on your run-oﬀ question, as we show the total run-oﬀ is somewhat higher than in Q1
last year. Q1 last year was DKK255 million, Q1 this year is DKK314 million. And then on the
other hand, we saw large weather claims and large claims. You can see that run-oﬀ gains
is actually down year-on-year in private lines and in Sweden, and the upwards trend
comes from commercial and it comes from corporate. And, typically, it is lines like
property and workers' comp where we see the majority of the run-oﬀ gains.
And then I guess also working with our claims and claims procurement program, we've
seen over time not only helps the current year but also helps the run-oﬀ gains as it helps
claims that have not been settled yet, but that is roughly the mix.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

And then I think the last question related to the SCR and whether or not you should
expect any further impact from the derisking of the asset mix in the RSA investment
portfolio, that is not the case. It's already included in the guidance we have provided
because you can say what we expect obviously is to adjust it to our proﬁle. So it is already
taken into account in the guidance that we have provided.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you and good morning and really sorry if these questions have been asked. I
just joined the call a bit late.
So my ﬁrst question is basically with respect to the the asset changes that you're doing in
RSA's portfolio, would you say that all those changes have happened and there is no risk
of any further losses because of such assets changes or would you say that some
uncertainty might still be there as you might -- might still be in the process of reducing the
duration gap, et cetera, between the asset and liabilities of assets portfolio.
So that's the ﬁrst question I have and second question is the growth in the quarter was
pretty strong. Would you say that there is any one-oﬀ in driving that growth or would you
say that the market remains very good at the moment and you expect similar sort of
topline growth in the coming quarters as well? Thank you.

So what we have obtained by now is that the risk proﬁle on both what we call the free and
the risk -- the free and the match portfolio stands at around 80% by now.
So we still have some allocation to be done over the coming quarters. It is -- some of it is
in more illiquid assets. So it's not something that you just do overnight. So I would say it's
too early to say that that we are fully done. We expect that to be the case during the
autumn and also obviously in times where you have such high turbulence as you have
seen in Q1, we cannot rule out obviously that we will have further losses in the future. But
what we are focused on is obviously to limit the volatility in the assets that we hold, and in
particular also that it matches the underlying liabilities of the business signiﬁcantly better
going forward.

I'm quite pleased to be honest that the Tryg Classic matching strategy works so well. In
normal quarters, you may forget that and I think the majority of insurance companies
around the world do not have a matching strategy. We do and that is why the loss on the
Tryg Classic investment was rather small in the quarter. So we're quite anxious to make
sure that is the portfolio strategy that we use also for the acquired portfolios.

I think on your second question for growth. Yes, it is quite high. We are very pleased to
see that what pulls up the growth is the most proﬁtable areas.
It's private lines at 5.7% and even before bonus premium rebates 7.2%. And increasing
this quarter, we see the smaller commercial segment at 8.6% growth. That is really high,
reﬂecting a strong development both number of customers, number of products and
pricing as well.
I think the dark horse -- I think private and commercial will continue to deliver strong
growth. I think maybe the commercial SME growth was a little bit to the high side, but
generally will continue to be high. And then the dark horse is, of course, what happens in
corporate. As Johan explained, corporate is reported at minus 0.8% growth, but if you
adjust it for the transfer from Codan Norway, the real numbers are more like minus 3% top
line growth and there, we will be willing to let portfolio go if we need that. But quite
interesting to see this quarter that we are reducing the static non-proﬁtable exposure in
property and liability in the larger global programs.
But actually, we're growing slightly in the smaller, less exotic, more domestic exposures in
the corporate segment. So, generally, we believe that high growth will continue, but also
that there is a dark horse called corporate.

And, Morten, if I could just add. You're talking very much around Tryg Classic. If we just
skewed towards our acquired businesses, the Trygg-Hansa, we are seeing this particular
quarter growth just around the 3% market in Trygg-Hansa going forward and I'm not
necessarily talking one or two quarters but one or two years going forward as the
integration progresses.

FINAL

We do expect to see more growth coming out of Trygg-Hansa. There have been
somewhat punching underweight in the growth levels in the last three years to ﬁve years
hovering up between 1% to 2%. We would expect them to grow up even further from the
3% mark we're seeing this quarter. So there should be some growth to come from TryggHansa going forward.

It was a little bit tricky to see what new car sales does. I mean, it's new car sales is down
26% in Q1 in Sweden. New car sales is down 28.5% in the Danish market. So really the
sales force is working quite hard to make cross sales and sales to existing customers
compensate for the lower sale of new cars. So that was just a few caveats at the end.

Thank you. Just one follow-up of the short-term. How would you then correct the
premium growth is sort of 50/50 price volume or is it sort of a diﬀerent split. If you could
shed some light into how this premium growth has come along?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Ever published that split, I don't think we will either, but what you may say, if you go back
four years or ﬁve years, the reality was that almost all growth was 100% price and even the
development in product and customers was a little bit on the negative side. What we see
now is that a very meaningful size of the total growth is now product growth with existing
customers. And we also see the fact that when retention rates is increasing so existing
customers stay for longer.
And then particularly in our SME segment, there is new sales growth but also in private. It
means that the number of customers is also growing slightly, which again has a
meaningful size of the total growth. And then, of course, pricing. So it is a very good mix
between pricing, customer growth, and very importantly product growth for existing
customers. Probably the healthiest combination we've had historically.

A - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Thank you, Jan Erik, but this is -- this is Gianandrea again. I just want to thank you all for all
the very good question. As always, [ph]Trevor and I in Investor Relations remain at your
disposal during the day, but we look forward to speak to you in the next hours in base.
Thank you.
