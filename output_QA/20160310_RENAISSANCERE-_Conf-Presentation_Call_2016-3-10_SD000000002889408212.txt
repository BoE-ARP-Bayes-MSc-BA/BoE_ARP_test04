I want to thank -- we have Kevin O'Donnell and Rohan Pai from RenRe here today with us.
And obviously, it's a great Company who has really kind of invented the property cat
reinsurance business a long time ago. Kevin is a really long-time RenRe executive who
has, I think, started his -- doing modeling and underwriting work and stuff like that,
potentially in the weeds. But become the CEO, obviously.
The Company has gone through a big transition over the past year or two. Became CEO,
did an acquisition in the time of -- given a lot of volatility in the insurance sector and
challenges and sort of fears of continued pricing declines. I think it would be fantastic -granted, it's a very informal group. But it would be great if you guys were willing to just -given that not everybody probably knows you that well, tell a little bit about sort of who
RenRe is; how you've evolved; and how you think about sort of the market here. And your
acquisition. And how it all sort of fits together.

Kevin O'Donnell
Great. Thanks. It's a pleasure to be here with you all today. So good morning.
I've been with RenRe -- I guess starting in April it will be 20 years. So I have seen the
Company evolve over a long time. And as Josh pointed out, I started as an AVP on the
international underwriting side and kind of worked up through the ranks. With that, I've got
a very strong sense as to who we are and what our culture is. As I go into the office, the
things that we had on the walls and the things that we valued are the same today as they
were back in 1996 when I started.
We think about being the best underwriter; we think about the three superiors, things that
we have talked about many times in the past. We think that if we're good at risk selection,
if we are good at capital management. And if we're good at taking care of our customers,
that will serve us well and make sure that we are successful over the long term.

FINAL

That said, we haven't done the same thing for 20 years. And even just thinking about the
three superiors, we've weighted which ones are most important depending on the
opportunity that's available on the market. So going back 20 years ago, we were most
focused on risk selection, because that's where we could capture the biggest spread
between our competitors and build the best portfolios.
Around the turn of the -- in 1999, 2000, 2001, our emphasis shifted to bringing new types
of capital. So thinking about capital management, we started DaVinci, we started Top
Layer Re. We were really working on ways in which we could bring the most efficient
capital to our customers. So our emphasis went a little bit from risk selection to capital
management.
Today we maintain the focus on risk selection. We maintain the focus on capital
management but we feel that the way our customers are approaching the market is
different and we've added a greater weighting to thinking about customer relationships.

Bloomberg Transcript

That's one of the primary reasons in which or drivers as to why we've changed the profile
of the Company from being exclusively a cat company, effectively, in the late 1990s to
being a company that's much more diversified today -- and really led to one of the
primary drivers, which was the acquisition of Platinum, which we closed just over a year
ago. So it closed March 2 of last year.
Customers are thinking about their risk increasingly in a more sophisticated way and a
more holistic way. And we wanted to make sure that we could match RenaissanceRe with
the way in which they wanted to see risk. So that's the reason we have diversified -- one
of the reasons we've diversified into more of those specialty lines.
We think it better positions us not only to be the preferred cat provider. But to allow us to
have access to their preferred risks in other lines. In order to do that, we had to build out
our teams pretty substantially. We started that build really in 2009 when we went into
Lloyd's and leading right up to the acquisition of Platinum last year. Interestingly, we were
already a bigger casualty and specialty writer this time last year when we bought Platinum
than Platinum was as a stand-alone enterprise. So people thought of us as a property cat
company. But we were already a bigger specialty company than Platinum.
Bringing that platform on has helped us enormously. We've opened a New York office -or we kept the New York office of Platinum. We added a Chicago office. And we've added
some additional skills, some additional lines. And overall improved the efficiency of the
organization, both from a capital perspective to get greater capital leverage on the
balance sheet and from an operating leverage perspective, in that we've -- although it
cost a little bit more, just one-time costs, for us to buy Platinum, the run rate savings have
been greater than anticipated. So that's kind of a little bit of a backdrop.

Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Cool, cool. Just for everybody's context, could you talk a little bit about the broader
dynamic of pricing pressures on the industry and alternatives coming in?

FINAL

Yes. So I think if you look back over the last several years, the property cat market has
probably changed most. It's had the greatest pricing pressure. And a primary driver of
that pricing pressure has really been new capital coming in. And that new capital has both
retained earnings, because it's been better-than-expected results on the property cat.
And third-party pension funds, et cetera, looking to enter this space.
That's added just a supply/demand imbalance and has added to the pricing pressure.
Additionally, we haven't seen property cat -- that market grow. So all of those dynamics
would lead to price compression. We think that we've withstood that pricing pressure
quite well. We've changed our portfolio. But we also recognize that it's not the time to be
growing.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we have guidance out that we'll be down 10% in property cat, which we think is
prudent. That is not -- that is a reflection of our desire to build preferred and leading
portfolios. We are a preferred market for third-party capital. So we believe that capital has
a place in the market; but we also believe the way to manage it is to align with that capital.
So we want to be paid as -- for being the best underwriter. And with that, in each of the
capital vehicles that we manage on behalf of third-party investors, we are a substantial
investor alongside of them.
Outside of property cat we are starting to see increasing pricing pressure broadly in the
casualty and specialty markets. We are not a broad player in those markets. We look to
find markets where we think it's profitable and then look to execute better than others in
those profitable markets.
We generally don't look for the one profitable deal in an unprofitable area of the market.
It's been a winning strategy for us. And it's one that we think we still have scope to
continue to grow, both within Lloyd's and within the specialty segment written across all of
our balance sheets.

Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

I wonder if, just going back to your comment about the market has changed in property
cat, my perception was -- and maybe this was always true, that you guys had better
opportunities to get into the business in, like, private layers. And relationships. And all this
stuff. My perception was most of the property cat business was syndicated by brokers
who go around. And they get everybody to bid on this stuff. And then there's like -there's a price clearing exercise; and you guys get a differentiated -- you know, people
want to give you business because you've got a bigger lead market. And so on and so
forth.
But at the end of the day, it was very much sort of an option format [ph]. How is the actual
placement in this business changing? And now, because you're becoming a multi-line guy,
basically, to get out of that kind of environment and get into some sort of customer-tocustomer relationship? You know, hey, we'll take your property cat if you also do this stuff.

Kevin O'Donnell
Right.

FINAL

Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

How does that really -- when the rubber meets the road. And you talk to customers, how
does this lay up?

Kevin O'Donnell
So I think in general your market characterization is accurate. I think from an access point
of view, we have a couple of advantages. One, we've been doing this for a long time. We
have track records with many of our customers; and we don't only know the brokers. But
we know the buyers.
I think there's two areas which allow us based on the market structure that you've
outlined. We do have private layer. So customers will come to us to ask and have us solve
problems specifically for them. And that's what we have called the private layer business.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the more traditional -- what we have called the syndicated market, we have great
access to build the portfolio within the layers we most want. So we don't traditionally
participate -- we'll take 10% of each of the layers that are in the market. We'll pick and
choose as to where we think we can build a better portfolio with bringing specific tranches
of risk in from each customer.
I think the diversification gives us the benefit not necessarily to leverage where, if you
write this, then you can have property cat; it's the fact that we have such a strong
relationship, the foundation of which was the property cat business we've built over many
years and supported many customers with. That is the -- that opens the door for us to
have the dialogue to target risks that they are ceding to others. And the response from
our customers has been quite good, where not only do our ratings help. But the track
record we have a being a good partner to them gives us preferred access to the most
desirable non-cat business that they're ceding.

Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Okay. So it's less of a -- I guess I want to -- sort of less of a defensive move to protect the
cat book. And more of a, hey, this is an opportunity to leverage the cat book to get into
that sort of looks at casualty businesses or specialty businesses that other people don't
have the -- or, I mean, you can be a more competitive offering at the same time; not
because of the price, because of relationship with your historic core business.

Kevin O'Donnell
Yes. Absolutely. We are not trying to defend the property cat business by running other
lines of business. We think we have such a preferred access and such a preferred model
Page 4 of 17



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity

there that we have a really leading position there.

FINAL

I think outside of the property cats business, there's two things. One is we have built up a
lot of internal capabilities to be able to write that business with the same underwriting
mindset and the same -- not the same tools. But being able to leverage the cat tools into
the non-cat lines.
And secondly, the way the customer is thinking about their risk has shifted. And so it
allows that conversation to be much more natural than it would have been five or 10 years
ago, where the segmentation between the property buyer, the casualty buyer, the quota
share buyer, the -- it would have been quite different.

Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Could you walk us through some of your biggest specialty and casualty lines. And how you
-- you know, both sort of what's going on. But also very interested in understanding how
you bring the sort of RenRe analytics and discipline in underwriting to these typically much
squishier lines of business.

Kevin O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. So let me start with the underwriting philosophy. And then we can talk a little bit
about some of the lines that we are in. What we do is we do -- before entering any line of
business, we assess the market.
So in the property cat, what we would call that is XYZ: we build the index of what the
market looks like. Once we've done that, we determine how much -- what are the
economics available within the market. And then we begin to execute into the market.
With that, we take the tools that we have that are transferable and bring them with us. So
if you take the property cat, we have modeling; we have portfolio construction; and we
have -- kind of grossed in that we have the ability to bring in other types of capital.
The modeling is something that is a combination in the cat business of vendor modeling
and our own proprietary modeling. There's not as much quality vendor modeling for many
of the specialty lines. So most of it is proprietary. But we have a lot of tools to how to think
about building the tail and how to build correlations among lines and among deals.
The other thing we bring is portfolio construction. So we have very good capital allocation
tools. So we are able to bring that into any line of business that we come -- that we are
targeting.
Then, finally, we bring our ability to think about gross to net. And once the portfolio
becomes of size, which now about $1 billion of casualty specialty, it's of size that we can
actually begin to think about bringing other types of capital in. And we've increased our
sessions materially in 2014 and then again in 2015.

FINAL

Within that, we have different disciplines -- one of which, though, we've been more public
about is we've written a reasonably-sized mortgage portfolio. And just taking that as a
lens into the type of risks that we'd look at, we like the mortgage business because it's
gone through a crisis. We are coming through with very strong credit scores. We have the
Freddies and Fannies under mandate to buy reinsurance. So we have a growing market
and we have a reason for which they are coming to the reinsurance market as opposed to
other markets.
With that we've built expertise internally. Then increasingly we're building a ceded
strategy around supporting the risks that we're taking. We also look at that risk across all
platforms in which we accept similar types of risks.
So we have mortgage risk within our investment portfolio; we have mortgage risk within
our ventures portfolio, one example of which is we own Essent -- we own a piece of
Essent, which is a primary mortgage insurer. Then we underwrite mortgage risk specifically
on our balance sheet. We look at each of those to determine where we are best
allocating. And then we also control aggregates in capital allocation individually within each
of those disciplines. But then, more importantly, aggregate at the enterprise level.

Bloomberg Transcript

Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

So I'm not at all surprised to hear you guys say that you're really good at portfolio
construction and figuring out tail risks. And the gross to net stuff, because that seems like
fundamentally -- well, first of all, probably poorly done by most casualty guys. But also very
similar to, conceptually, how you do enterprise risk management, all that stuff you guys
kind of invented.
How about, though, the pricing in these businesses? Because I feel like the actual risk in
casualty is basically that everybody thinks it's just -- like, the underwriter and the actuary
think it's a 65 loss ratio. And actually it's at 85. And it's all just about, well, the terms way
up the food chain really weakened. And pricing wasn't really as good. And you find out
about it three or four years later. It's sort of more, like, a less complicated question. And
more of that -- like, less statistical and just more what's the underlying loss ratio?

Kevin O'Donnell
Yes. That is always the risk with casualty. You've written the book for three years and
realize you mispriced it starting at year one. What we've done is tried to, again, build the
market; tried to look at it from a macro sense before we enter it from a micro
perspective.
The other thing is looking at Platinum, one of the benefits with Platinum is on several lines,
their data went back to 1984, going back to when it was St. Paul. So we were able to have
access to very robust historic information. It's been really useful for us in thinking about
the construction of the portfolio.

There isn't the same precision or the same independent -- let me change that from
precision. But independent analysis that can be done with vendor models in the casualty
book. So it is a lot of looking at rate sensitivity and how it's changing over time and just
being very careful to react very firmly when you see subtle signals.

FINAL

Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

So are you guys tracking -- I mean, do you now have to be much more focused on things
like, I don't know, like the industry price studies about what's happening in commercial
auto. And what CIAB says. And MarketScout. And things like that.

Kevin O'Donnell
Yes.

Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Because you're sort of in a lot of uncertain -- because, I don't know, you probably hear it
from the portfolio companies. I mean do you hear -- not your portfolio companies; your
cededs. Do you get lots and lots of pricing data on a semi-real-time basis that allows you
to feed the analytics engine?

Bloomberg Transcript

Kevin O'Donnell
Yes. So I think what we'd -- when we first start writing a line of business, we generally rely
on industry data from an actuarial perspective to build out what we think those good
reserving loss ratios are. Over time we will translate the industry to our own internal data,
with the hope that we can -- you know, if you take that -- our desire is to be a better than
average industry player. So we are hoping that over time, the industry loss ratios will be
somewhat protective of our underwriting as we enter a line of business, because we
anticipate them outperforming the industry. But yes, we are absolutely much more reliant
on macro industry data and thinking about building the reserving curves when we enter a
line of business than we would be for something like property cat.

Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

So then, if you think about just sort of big picture you sort of ended with it, too -- pricing
has been challenged in the property cat business; but maybe it's sort of spilling over into
other sort of specialty and casualty lines. How do you think that plays out? And how does
that inform -- like, how do you guys think about navigating for the next few years if it's
going to be a softening market?

Kevin O'Donnell
Yes. So I think the -- one is we are not to be an index player in specialty and casualty. Try
to find markets, again, starting at 40,000-foot level, that we think are profitable and then
execute into them.

Page 7 of 17



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2016-03-10

Secondly, think about structures that make sense. Understand why the customer is buying.
Then try to partner with people who you think are better-than-average underwriters.
Then, thirdly, it really is about having a robust gross-to-net or ceded structures and
changing that based on the way in which the market is behaving.

Questions And Answers
Q - Unidentified Participant
One of the things you mentioned in last part of your evolution is the customer
relationship. Having covered for a long time the (inaudible) that kind of rings a wrong bell
in my brain.
You know, obviously that's the recent -- you know, the big guys coming up out of markets
and of business. It was -- obviously, they are having that customer relationship that they
have (inaudible)

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Yes. That's a great question. I think, firstly, it's not -- what we're talking about is weighting
the superiors. So we still rely heavily on risk selection; we rely on capital management; and
then customer relationships. Structurally we are organized so that the underwriter owns
every aspect of the deal. Then where in different companies, they may have marketing
group, or they may have a customer relationship group. And then an underwriting group -and there's a degree of separation between the two; underwriter owns 100% of the
responsibility for any deal that's written. And finally, I think the -- and most importantly, it's
not being able to do any one of those things well. It's being able to integrate being good
at all three of them.
So we recognize that being just good at customer relationships can lead to very bad
behavior. Being just good at risk selection may ignore the fact that you need to have
relationships to be able to access the markets in which you're targeting.
So I think it is the integration of that, those three skills, as well as the integration of the
entity across all the platforms in which we're writing business. So it if it is best for
someone to be serviced out of our New York franchise, we will make sure that that
business is there. If it's best to be serviced out of Bermuda, the business will be written
there. And our underwriters are always engaged in that dialogue.
And more importantly, or as importantly, they are all paid from a single pool. If our casualty
business outperforms our cat, or cat outperforms casualty, it doesn't matter. The

Page 8 of 17



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td

underwriters are all paid based on the performance of the overall organization.

Q - Unidentified Participant

FINAL

What will happen if a betting [ph] customer of yours in one particular line said look, a
problem in here. I need to take this business. You look at it. And you don't want to take it
(inaudible) So what do you do in that situation? I lose a whole business with that line.

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Yes. I think we've done a good job being disciplined at what we're trying to do. And we
are not trying to re-grade a quota share of your entire risk into RenaissanceRe. We are
looking for places in which we can bring value beyond just the capital that we are bringing.
We'll share our expertise in the way we're thinking about risk. It's been very successful for
us to do that on the property cat. And increasingly we're having success doing that in
other lines. So rather than just saying that we're going to be anti-leveraged -- write this -write B at negative 10 to get A at plus 10 -- that's not the game that we're playing.
And I think we've been good about being very clear with our customers that if things
move to a point where we are no longer interested in supporting it, we will walk away.
You're seeing that, actually, now in the property cat, where we are being [ph] down 10.
But we are still seeing the opportunities to go into the specialty.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Unidentified Participant
You talked before about the need to be aligned when you are doing the alternative
capital. And I wondered what you would look -- what type of structure would make you
worried if you see more of them in the market? And maybe how much of that is there
occurring right now that worries you?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
So I think -- I wouldn't say worried is the way that we think about it, because we can
replicate anything that worried us. So if we thought there was a real threat coming in with
a different way in which capital was coming to the market, we could replicate it.
We think over the long-term, we will be paid best by being a good underwriter. So I think if
you take it at the simplest sense, one is: someone gives us a mandate. We will go write
5% of every deal, or we will try to build you a preferred portfolio in property cat.
I think our view is we would rather be paid for the underwriting expertise that we can
bring. That's what we are and that's what we have built over the last 20-plus years. Being
just an index player in this space we don't think it's the way capital should be serviced
here, because we don't think it will be the best way for that capital to participate in the
market over the long term.

So I think from -- our investors are most comforted by the fact that we have a long track
record of being successful in this business. And then that we align with them. So they've
kind of -- you know, the belt and suspenders. I think if I was an allocator into this space, I
would look very carefully as to what is the advantage that that manager has in this
business? And in some I see strong advantages; in others I see fewer advantages.

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. There is a tension between -- you talked about the -- I think you mentioned the
agency conflict. There's a tension between creating your own vehicle to buy reinsurance
from and being able to buy it more opportunistically from other people.
And I guess your guys -- the way you manage, more or less, because you sort of had a
ceded desk that is looking to take advantage of the market, wherever that best price is. Is
that sort of the right way to think about it? Is that the reason you prefer not just to have,
like, a -- basically a sidecar for casualty business that's going to give you a lower cost of
capital. And maybe a little bit of lower-case adverse -- you know, like a little bit of agency
or whatever, a little bit of leverage off of their lack of expertise?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
So I think I'll answer your question in two ways. If you take DaVinci -- if you were to take a
step back, DaVinci in some ways looks like the quota share of RenaissanceRe's business.
So in one way we are forming a quota share of our business. But it is customer-facing.
I think the other model is where you build a full capital that sits behind a rated balance
sheet. And then you are ceding opportunistically into that. We are less interested in doing
that, because we think that that is not building a partnership with the capital that we are
bringing to the market. When we talk about our third -- or ceded, it really is cessions to
true, independent third parties. And what we're looking, when we do that, is trying to
optimize the returns within our net portfolio.
So if a cession increases returns, we'll buy it. If a cessions reduces returns, we won't buy it.
That doesn't necessarily mean that the seller is getting a bad deal. They may have a very
different construct of their portfolio.

FINAL

One of the large cession classes that we have within Renaissance is something we call the
CPT. And what that's designed to do is to give risk to mostly primary insurance companies
that's purely uncorrelated with the risks that they have, to the point that if they have
losses above the threshold, we will take the losses back. So to them, it's highly efficient
capital risk to bring in, because it's perfectly uncorrelated with their tail. And for us it's very
efficient, because we have been able model that. And it's basically sell them reinsurance
on the portfolio that we ceded, which is the point at which we take it back.

A - Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

If we talk just a bit more about your actual -- like, on the front end of the business, what is
the status in Florida these days? Can you still get peak margin? I know they've come
down. But is it still an attractive place that you can be overweight. And that will drive
franchise returns? Or is that -- or has there been so much capital in now that everybody is
going after Florida. And Florida kind of looks like a lot of other places? And it's not as -you know, being over-indexed there doesn't make any sense?

A - Kevin O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

So I think your characterization that Florida has -- excess returns have diminished. And it is
looking more like the rest of the US market. It's still substantially better than the
international markets, which is true for Florida. And which is true for the US.
I think our desire to overweight in Florida has diminished only based on returns. So our
focus on being overweight in Florida -- and we used to talk about it as being hot down
low, or being overweight even within the low layers or the high layers within Florida -- has
diminished. But we do still see significant opportunities to deploy within Florida. If you take
the Atlantic hurricane in general, that still is a risk that drives the tail of our distribution. The
Florida-specific component of that tail is smaller than it used to be.

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

I wonder if we can just talk more sort of about M&A -- obviously, you guys did a big deal.
We have talked about the portfolio impacts. But how has the execution of actually bringing
everybody on board, aligning systems -- how has that worked? And how do you think
about your interest in doing more deals as the market continues -- you know, to
consolidate within Bermuda? Or perhaps maybe we should be expecting you guys to do,
like, specialty acquisitions or something here in the US?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
So let me talk a little bit about Platinum: what we learned and then what the future looks
like. Platinum has been a successful acquisition for us. We closed -- as I mentioned, we
closed the transaction March 2 of last year. And at this point every system that Platinum
had is fully integrated with RenaissanceRe.
We closed the financial integration in February of this year, which was the last component.
The first thing we focused on is the customer -- making sure that they understood the
reasons we did the acquisition -- and worked to make sure that we could bring all of that
risk on board. We believe we were successful doing that. And looking at the specialty

FINAL

book, the Platinum book plus the Renaissance book today is greater. So that in 2016 not
only do we bring the book on. But we have about $100 million of organic growth within
those lines as well.
I think it's something -- by doing an acquisition, you do learn a lot. So as I mentioned, our
one-time costs were a little higher. But our run rate costs are lower. Part of that is because
we kept fewer people than we anticipated. We focused -- from an underwriting
perspective we added a New York office. And we added a Chicago office. And we kept all
but one of those underwriters. So what we targeted to keep, we were very successful;
but looking at what we needed to keep was a little less than we thought.
As far as thinking about future acquisitions, it's one in which we feel like we have
everything we need to continue to execute our strategy. We are seeing good growth
already on our own balance sheets with our own initiatives within casualty and specialty.
And within the property cat, our guidance of down 10 is a reflection of the market, not a
reflection of access. And we don't believe that an acquisition in those lines will really bring
us much.
We would consider something. But it would need to strategically advance us. And it would
need to be done at a financially viable price.

Does it make sense to be a bigger reinsurer here -- I mean, or, is this like the right size to
be still nimble?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
I don't think there's a right answer to that. I think we are nimble. I think we're bigger than
we were, obviously, a year ago. But that hasn't cost us anything in flexibility. I think our
ability to scale with capital, third-party capital with our own capital and with ceded,
provides us with great opportunity to continue to grow without acquisition.
As far as being bigger, I don't think we are disadvantaged at the size that we are. I think
others are -- you know, it used to be -- you know, when RenRe started, it was $200 million.
The last round it was $1 billion. I think that number continues to inflate. I think where we
are, we are under no pressure to change the size of the organization. But I don't feel that
being larger would diminish our ability to be flexible.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Could you speak about capital returns versus M&A opportunity? Capital returns versus the
M&A opportunity?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
So we have always looked to return capital -- our first focus is to deploy capital within the
business; and then, if we can't deploy it, is to return it to investors. So I think where -that's historically been a good strategy for us and for our investors. I think the -- what we

are returning and what would be required for a major acquisition is not -- one will not -share buybacks won't impede our ability to do an acquisition.

FINAL

If you look -- after closing the Platinum transaction, we have now about -- have about the
same financial flexibility as we did prior to the transaction. So with all the capital that
moved around over the course of 2015, we're back at about the same point we were this
year -- at March of last year.

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

I wonder if -- I'm sorry, did you --?

Q - Unidentified Participant
No. Not anymore.

A - Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Okay, I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about what you guys are actually chasing
after in your specialty and casualty things. And then some of the things you're doing at
Lloyd's, just because I think everybody sort of understands the property/cat business. But
then it's never clear what you actually do in the other business.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin O'Donnell
So I think, again, we are not an index player in casualty specialty. We aren't targeting, I
mentioned, the mortgage business. We are large in financial lines. We've increasingly
added a growing professional lines portfolio. That's kind of a macro across specialty and
Lloyd's.
Within Lloyd's we are writing some delegated authority business, which brings some
primary exposure to the overall organization. We are doing it in a way that's consistent
with the way we think about underwriting. We are not really looking to be the sole primary
writer for many programs. We're looking to be part of a consortium of people protecting
these delegated authorities.
Within the specialty book overall, I'd say it's reasonably well diversified. It's more
professional lines than casualty. And it's areas in which we have targeted to build specific
expertise. One of the areas in which the Platinum acquisition brought us was an A&H
book.
So again, we not only increased the depth of the lines that we are in with the Platinum
acquisition; we've also expanded some of the scope in which we're writing. I think for
2016, I think we're more likely to go deeper in the lines that we're currently in than to
expand into new lines.

So what kind of -- what's interesting about financial lines or professional lines, given,
though, it sounds like you started at that market high level and then tried to find
subsectors or something.

FINAL

A - Kevin O'Donnell
I think it's -- part of it was when we started writing this was post-crisis. So there was a lot
of dislocation in many of those lines. So we saw an opportunity. And we were able to get
a toehold into some of the better programs being ceded into the market at preferred
economics.
I think within the professional lines, it's partially finding opportunities that we wouldn't have
necessarily seen had we not been in Lloyd's or had not hired the teams that we had. So
many of these are relationships that our underwriters had for many years. And they were
able to bring them over to Renaissance as we continue to build out the platforms.

A - Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

What kind of classes are you guys doing in these two businesses?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
It's pretty diverse within the professional lines. It could be writing kind of noncritical
medical in Australia to writing an architect E&O program in the States.

And remind me: these are both reinsurance on some of these -- on primary?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Some of those are direct delegated authorities out of Lloyd's. And some of them are
protections of reinsurance -- or reinsurance of primary insurance folks.

A - Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

I see. So like, your Lloyd's business -- is this the kind of stuff your delegated authority is?
Or -- because I was imagining -- when you said that, I was thinking you got an E&S broker
or something, who's a cover hold who is placing into Lloyd's? Is it like small bars and
taverns? Or is it like unique, one-off Lloyd's-y things?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
It's both, actually. Yes. What I was referring to is more of a one-off type thing. So there is
no specific example. So kind of one-off type things.

A - Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Q - Unidentified Participant
Could you talk just a little bit more about how Lloyd's has been in sort of a strategic vision
for -- and the, like, flight path for putting it on a more profitable path?

A - Kevin O'Donnell

FINAL

Sure.

Q - Unidentified Participant
(inaudible)

A - Kevin O'Donnell
So Lloyd's, we think, is important to us. First, it gives us access to write different business
than we would otherwise see. You know, it's a big market. So you can set up a syndicate.
And you're already part of have a very big existing market. So you have access to
business that you would not have otherwise had.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, it gives us a pool of talent in London that we can access that would have been
difficult had we not had the syndicate. Overall we are pleased with where we are with
building out the syndicate. And one of the things that has been -- two things that have
been hurdles to us in continuing to build the syndicate out: first was the headwinds in the
markets. So in many of the markets that we are targeting, pricing continues to be under
pressure. And secondly, it was frankly more expensive for us to build out the platform,
largely as a result of Solvency II.
We think that it's also a higher bar to jump over to enter Lloyd's, because it is more
expensive now that the regulatory requirements are so much more profound. I think the
other thing that we've done, which affected us in 2015, is we increased significantly our
ceded coming out of the Lloyd's platform. And we did that, really, in response to market
conditions and constructing an overall preferred net portfolio. But it hurt us from an
economic perspective, specifically in pushing up the expense ratio.
I think with the delegated authority, we've done a good job building out that platform. We
have entered that market in a disciplined and measured pace. And we have built the
claims and audit roles around that to make sure that we are carefully monitoring the risk
and matching it against our expected portfolios that we've constructed.

Q - Unidentified Participant
What's the sort of tail on the type of business you're writing in the delegated authority?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Firstly, it's within Lloyd's; so it's contained within not only our own risk metrics. But within
the Lloyd's risk metrics. I don't have the numbers to hand as to how to think about the tail
from that as opposed to the overall portfolio.

Page 15 of 17

FINAL

We do monitor it on a deal basis. We monitor it on a line of business basis at a syndicate
level. And then at a holding company level. So there are several pieces to the way that we
are looking at it. So that if we do see something at the holding company level from a risk
perspective that we want to dive more deeply into, we can run it right down the chain to
the individual account.

A - Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

What's your big-picture interest in Lloyd's? Is it sort of long-term you want a beachhead
there, just to have optionality? Or is it -- do you get really excited about the individual
businesses you're in?
Because it -- I mean, I'm just -- it's been a big investment for a number of years. And it
doesn't really drive the tail. But you've been growing it a lot. But I think -- not a failure. But
not a ramped success either. Just kind of curious how you think about it.

A - Kevin O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

We like the flexibility to be able to enter and exit businesses. We like the fact that that it's
a big market. So their access to risks around the world is pretty accessible. We also think
that even on the writing in insurance, our primary exposed portfolio there, it's a
reinsurance mindset to think about the risk that you're taking there. So it's very
transferable from the way in which we think about risk.
I think over the long term we have great aspirations for Lloyd's. We think over the last
several years, starting from scratch has been more difficult than we thought. But we built a
platform that can continue to scale pretty dramatically, should there be a great
opportunity.

A - Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Cool. I guess my last question, if no one else has any other -- what do you think -- this is
an easy one. What do you think we need to turn the market? I mean, is it three or four
years of pain, of, like, casualty -- you know, dumb casualty decisions? Or is there a big one
out there that people are assuming they can't [ph] get hit by?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
I think it can be any number of things. If you go back historically 9/11 wasn't something that
people would have talked about prior to it happening as being something that turned the
market. The financial crisis, a nuclear plant in a Japanese earthquake -- there's many
things that will come up in an unexpected way. I always think it takes some catalyst. And
the more surprising, the more profound the response.

A - Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

That's great. Okay. Well thank you, Kevin, I appreciate your time.
