Helge Leiro Baastad will start by commenting brieﬂy on the highlights for the quarter
before our CFO, Catharina Hellerud will comment the results in more detail. And then, we
will spend most of the time for the Q&A.
Before we start, I would remind you that the presentation can be downloaded from our
website gjensidige.no/ir. And Helge and Catharina will refer to the diﬀerent slides as they
go along.
Go ahead, Helge. Please.

Thanks, Janne. Then I would start with slide number three, and that's my only slide before
Catharina takes over. As you have seen, we experienced a solid premium growth and a
good start to 2014, and the proﬁt before tax was almost NOK 1.2 billion. It has been a few
big important events during the ﬁrst quarter. In January, we had the big ﬁres in Flatanger
and in Lærdal. And that reminds us how important our work is, and the importance of
scale in the business in the total value chain. We had a compensating (01:31) experience,
infrastructure and capacity to be there when customer really needs us.
Secondly, the sale of the Storebrand stake in February eliminated risks relating to deﬁned
beneﬁt pension from the balance sheet. The underwriting results came in almost at NOK
350 million, and that represented a solid 92.9% combined ratio, and a discounted 88.9%.
Despite the higher proportion of large losses than normally expected, we had a good
combined ratio and underwriting result in the quarter. And this is driven by good growth
combined with a favorable weather situation and a good underlying frequency claims
development in the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we are very pleased that we delivered good proﬁtability combined with good growth,
and we had a stable customer development in the private segment, and good customer
satisfaction. So it's a good mix actually, continuously strong and good mix. We
commented in the report that we had seen somewhat increased competition, especially
from established ﬁnancial players that are focusing on general insurance in the market.
And, of course, we also experienced our main competitors, the pure non-life players; they
are also active in the market during the ﬁrst quarter.
However, we experienced good competitiveness, and we have had a strong growth in
premiums, 10.1% reported. If we adjust, and we have to adjust for Gouda, Solid and
currency, we have a satisfactory development underlying with 4% growth, premium
growth. To start with comment, the private segment, main (03:38) we have 5.4% growth in
the private segment, and main focus is to improve our multi-channel distribution system,
and continuously increase and improve our targeted activities to retain customers. We
have a stable customer development during the quarter. The customer we lose, they have
fewer products compared to the customers that are – continues to remain customers at
the end of the quarter. And that's the trend we have seen for some quarters now. So that's
satisfactory.
In the Commercial segment, we have a 5.1% growth, if we adjust for currency-related
Swedish business, it's 4.6%. So that's a segment with good renewals and we continue with
high-level activity and increased activity level as we have seen for some quarters. Good
growth in both Norway and Sweden, and with deliberate reduction of municipal portfolio
due to low rates and weak proﬁtability in the segment. That's representing – that's the
situation both in Sweden and Norway.
In the Nordic segment, we report 36% growth. If you adjust for Gouda, Solid and
currency, it's 3.7% growth in the Nordic segment. And we had the same situation there as
in Norway in the Norwegian commercial business with good renewal rates and good
access to commercial customers. And we have also seen during the ﬁrst quarter, as we
saw second half last year, improved distribution powered through (05:27).

FINAL

Shortly comment, bank and pension and savings business. In the bank, the activity level
within mortgage loans is still high with focus on our loyalty and aﬃnity customers. The
interest rates for mortgages were reduced in April, and we are still among the most
attractive in the marketplace. The two segments, pension and savings and bank are
important for a broader customer oﬀering in Norway and help building a more loyal
customer base. And proﬁt before tax increased with 40% (06:04), so the combined results
from these two businesses are now signiﬁcantly at a better level compared to previously.
Finally, the ﬁnancial results, NOK 762 million represents 1.3%. Two comments here; it
includes gains from Storebrand sales of NOK 150 million, and compared to ﬁrst quarter
last year you'd remember that it was a write-down of NOK 611 million in the Storebrand
sales. And all this add up to a return on equity before tax, 17.4%. Next year, we are talking
about return on equity after tax and the target as you know, 15%. So Catharina.

Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Thank you. Looking at slide ﬁve, we have had a good start to the year. The underwriting
results is inﬂuenced by continued solid premium growth and a favorable frequency claims
development. In addition, as Helge mentioned, the investment portfolio, that has made
an acceptable contribution to proﬁts.

Bloomberg Transcript

The underwriting results was on par with corresponding quarter last year. But as you can
see from the ﬁgures, all segments except for the Baltics delivered better results this
quarter than in the corresponding quarter last year.
The underlying frequency claims development was benign, inﬂuenced by a relatively mild
and dry winter. The proportional large losses whatsoever considerably higher than in the
corresponding quarter in 2013. This is one of the reasons why the Corporate Center
recorded a considerably weaker proﬁt this quarter than in the corresponding quarter last
year. The main reason, though, is that we have had a negative development on some
large losses leading to run-oﬀ loss and some reinstatement premium that has been
charged to Corporate Centre.
Furthermore, the (08:08) growth continues both in the bank and the Pension and Savings
segment as commented by Helge. Together, they contribute a proﬁt before tax of NOK 83
million in the quarter, up more than 40% from the corresponding quarter last year. The
investment portfolio yielded an acceptable return in the quarter, and considerably better
than in the corresponding quarter last year. The proﬁt performance in the quarter was
aﬀected, of course, by the accounting gain of NOK 150 million after the sale of the
remaining shareholding in SpareBank (08:46) while the ﬁrst quarter last year, as I'm sure
you'll remember, was aﬀected by an impairment loss of NOK 611 million on the
Storebrand investments.
But taking it together, this means a proﬁt before tax of NOK 1.2 billion, corresponding to
proﬁt per share of NOK 1.85.

FINAL

Turning to slide six, the combined ratio for the general insurance operations was 92.9% in
the quarter. The takes on this slide is that the loss ratio in the quarter was strong, taking
into account the relatively high large losses impact. The underlying frequency claims
development was good aﬀected by the mild and dry winter. So we saw lower motor
claims frequency that can normally be expected in the ﬁrst quarter. The same applies to
property insurance with the mild winter resulted in lower proportion of water damage
claims.
On the other hand, the loss ratio for property insurance was also aﬀected negatively by
the fact that there were more ﬁres than normal in the quarter, among other things, as a
result of the two big ﬁres we had in Norway in January this year in addition to some
medium-sized ﬁres. Also, the cost ratio was down compared with the corresponding
quarter in 2013. You see now that the investments that we made in solutions, in that
simplifying and automating processes and a higher degree of self-service are paying oﬀ.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide 17 (sic) [slide seven] (10:21), Helge has already commented the premium
development. As you can see the nominal expenses increased by a total of NOK 49
million in the quarter, around 7%. A substantial proportion of the nominal cost increase is
related to exchange rate eﬀects in the Nordic segment as well as [indiscernible] (10:41)
from the Baltic segment, and also the acquisition, of course, of Gouda Rejseforsikring and
Solid. It is also worth noting that the distribution model in Gouda results in a somewhat
higher level of commissions going forward, which will then aﬀect the cost ratio for the
Nordic segment in the time ahead.
Looking at slide eight, the proportional large losses was high in the quarter, NOK 291
million, 5.9 percentage points eﬀect on the combined ratio, and also above the expected
value of NOK 266 million. And especially within the Commercial segment that we have
seen large losses this quarter. In the ﬁrst quarter last year, large losses amounted to NOK
146 million, 3.3 percentage points.
Turning to slide nine, run-oﬀ gain in the quarter was NOK 64 million (sic) [NOK 63 million]
(11:47) corresponding to a positive eﬀect on the combined ratio of 1.3 percentage points,
compared with then 0.8% in the same quarter last year. Part of the run-oﬀ gain is been
related to the same positive eﬀects for accident and health products which we have seen
for a period and also commented in the previous quarters. As I mentioned, we also had a
run-oﬀ loss in the Corporate Center this quarter, mostly related to previous natural
disaster claims that we have seen negative development during the ﬁrst quarter.
On slide 10, we illustrate the allocation of economic capital based on the internal model.
For the operational segment, the capital requirements increased by approximately NOK
300 million during the quarter. The main reason for this is due to volume increase in the
business. The main or the largest change this quarter was – if you look at asset risk, which
was reduced by NOK 2.3 billion in the quarter, and this is primarily due to the sale of the
stake in Storebrand. So in total, the risk-based capital requirement amounted to NOK 9.5
billion at the end of the ﬁrst quarter from NOK 11.4 billion at the end of last quarter, fourth
quarter 2013.

Looking at slide 11, the key message is that the capital in excess of the S&P capital
requirements and the technical buﬀer has increased by NOK 0.5 billion to NOK 2.6 billion
from the end of fourth quarter. The increase is primarily due to an increase in available
capital following the sale of the stake in Storebrand. As you recall, the strategic oﬀer alone
was NOK 2.1 billion at year-end. Assuming everything else equal, the strategic buﬀer can
be somewhat lower than this level due to the sale of the stake in Storebrand. And the
board will normally consider the size of the strategic buﬀer once a year, but I will remind
you that we have no intention to build unnecessary buﬀers, that's important.
The 15% after tax return on equity target requires capital discipline going forward. And the
work on optimizing the balance sheet will continue through 2014.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you might have also seen, our holding in SR-Bank is for sale at the right price.
However, this is an investment that contributes well to the return on the investment
portfolio. And we are in no hurry to settle the stake. We have chose not to ask to be
reelected to the board of directors however, which means that the shareholding will be
reclassiﬁed from an associated (14:40) company to an ordinary current equity from the
end of the second quarter. This will have consequences for both the – how this is treated
in our accounts and also the capital requirements as it is calculated by the S&P model.
Turning to slide 12. The investment portfolio amounted to NOK 60 billion at the end of the
ﬁrst quarter and yielded 1.3% in the quarter. There are few key messages related to this
slide. First, the match portfolio continues to make a stable contribution to the result
through the return of 0.9%. That continued fall in Norwegian interest rates combined with
tightening spreads make future returns challenging. The reinvestment rate for the bonds
classiﬁed at amortized cost was 4% in this quarter, down from 4.2% last quarter.
Secondly, the composition of the free portfolio yielding 1.8% in the quarter has changed
somewhat the associated companies and are not part of the current equities in the free
portfolio. And the proportion of ﬁxed income instruments is increased because the
proceeds from the sale of Storebrand has been reinvested into bonds and money market
instruments.
So the more large proportion of the assets were invested in money market instruments
ahead of the distribution of dividend of NOK 6.4 billion that took place last week. In
addition, the exposure to convertible bonds has been reduced somewhat as a result of
what we consider attractive pricing. Thirdly, the yield from the current equities and the
free portfolio included NOK 115 million in accounting gain from the sale of Storebrand in
addition to NOK 59 million estimated share of proﬁt from the SR-Bank stake.
Now, I will leave the word to Helge for a short sum-up.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah. Then we are at slide 13. And I think I only will comment that you have seen these
priorities before. We don't change much from quarter-to-quarter. Remember the Capital
Markets Day in London, 25 of November. And I suggest we jump directly, actually to Q&A.

Q&A
Operator
Okay. Thank you. We will take our ﬁrst question today from Will Hardcastle from Bank of
America. Please go ahead.

Q - William Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

I'm sorry if I missed this in your discussion. But can you just tell us again what asset class
and duration the Storebrand money has been put into within your investment portfolio?
And the second one is, you mentioned (18:08). I wasn't quite clear whether this had been
put in large losses or run-oﬀ where I'd expect it to be. Can you just discuss this in a bit
more detail on what they're speciﬁcally related to? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

I think, I'm not quite sure if I heard both of your questions. There was something – the line
was a bit blurry, but I think the ﬁrst question you asked was about the proceeds from the
sale of the stake in Storebrand. And it has been reinvested into mainly bond instruments
without much lower capital charge than the stake as such. Second question, you asked
about large losses, the large losses this quarter aﬀecting the segments and also to some
degree the Corporate Center was NOK 291 million. But in addition, there was a run-oﬀ
loss in the Corporate Center which relates to some natural peril claims from 2013. The
negative or the run-oﬀ loss in the Corporate Center amounted to NOK 60 million in the
quarter.

Q - William Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Okay. And that was just related to 2013 natural peril claims did you say.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Mainly claims from our Nordic operations, Swedish and Danish claims.

Q - William Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Okay. That's great. And just are you able to say of the Storebrand funding, what the rough
capital charge was that you invested in, you said it was mainly in bonds. Should I assume
it's somewhere between 5% to 10%, that sort of charge?

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yeah. It depends, as you know, on both the rating and the duration of the investments or
the bonds. So yes, your presumptions are correct.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Vinit Malhotra from Goldman Sachs. Please go
ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hello there. Good morning. Vinit from Goldman. Two, three things here. One is earlier you
mentioned competition, and now several Nordic players last two quarters or so have
mentioned competition, and particularly in Norway we heard even Sampo mention this.
How will this show up? Is it just that you expect to lose bad customers? You have said
Gjensidige is in a good competitive position and I presume the shareholder policy or the
dividend policy also has, but how will this materialize? Is it – do you see it already? Do you
expect it? If you could just comment a bit more it will help us understand the situation
there, please.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then second question is just a really simple one on the equities in the free portfolio. I
was quite surprised seeing that number around NOK 150 million, given that NOK 115
million of the gain is there, plus SpareBank is still there, and equities in the ﬁrst quarter
were quite up. The indices in the Nordic markets were not very diﬀerent from fourth
quarter. So could you just explain a little bit about if there's anything there that we should
note? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Do you want me to take the others? Okay. I can give some comments related to the
competition. As I said in the Norwegian presentation one hour ago, of course, we have
seen for many quarters, for a long period of time, high level of competition. We
commented increased competition in the quarterly report this time, and it's from the
present, or I would say the Nordic non-life players, we have seen that they have had a
diﬀerent kind of top line growth compared to what we have managed to present. And of
course, that aﬀects the type of competition. We have also seen competition from new
players like Vardia and, of course, also increased competition from the ﬁnancial players,
both saving banks and DnB.
So on a general basis, we can say the following, related to what we do to keep up with
that kind of increased competition because this will continue, I think. First of all, we have a
long-standing good history of accurate tariﬀ setting. Based on the size of the customer
base compared with many of our competitors, we believe that this will continue to be a
competitive advantage for Gjensidige going forward. Customer dividend, of course, that's
very important. The AGM in the ﬁnancial foundation Gjensidige will be on the 20 of May
and after that, we will see a customer dividend, I would say, in line with what we had seen
last year, and that's a very strong part of our competitive, I would say, measurements
continuously going forward.

It's a unique model, strengthen our distribution power. Car ﬁnancing, that's important,
both to secure our position within motor insurance, but also to meet increased
competition from more broader ﬁnancial players. We have launched the market's best
solution for the sale of car ﬁnancing and insurance through car dealers that we have great
conﬁdence in. It's important area in the time ahead. We have active market price
optimization in light of the competition environment. We continuously improve our
deliveries within the CRM area. And once again, with such a large customer base as we
have, all of our customer-oriented activities see that we continuously improve our
accuracy and relevance. We see great potential in this area going forward.
I commented also in the Norwegian call here that the organization market – our position
within this area, we have an extensive history and experience in this area, and we work
very closely with our partners. We have done that for many, many years, 56 years. Price
adjustments used within insurance and bank to address the competition, considering new
partnerships, and we have also seen growth through new partners as (25:38), which is two
new partners in the Norwegian private division last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

And ﬁnally, I commented also in my introduction that we have scale in the whole value
chain. We are one of the – related to claims settlement, we are one of the biggest
purchasers in Norway, and we have an excellent, broad network of contacts. We receive
good feedback from customers on our claims settlements. We have seen that in Lærdal
and Flatanger in January, and we have seen that after similar events. So we are conﬁdent,
actually, but the competition, yes, it's increasingly competition from the pan-Nordic
players, from also the ﬁnancial institutions. This is a continuously-improvement type of
business, so we are conﬁdent.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

All right. Thanks. Just a follow-up. Is there any pricing pressure visible as well, or is that –
the competition is still too small for you or too small to worry about?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Of course, it's pricing pressure in some areas and within some contracts. What I can say
that our customer, we have a stable customer development. A customer that leases us in
average, they have few products. It's more single customer compared to the customers
staying with us. And knowing that the customer dividend – it was 15% last year. I believe it
will be more or less in line with that also going for this year. That's a very strong value
proposition for the broader customer. So what we have seen? We have lost customer with
few products, single customer we have taken care of and still have the broader customers.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

All right. Thanks. That's very clear. Thank you.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

And then the other question regarding the yield from the current equities. I think it's
important to remember that if you look at allocation of the assets in the three portfolios,
this is also part of the ongoing risk management of the group. If you look at the yield from
Page 8 of 15



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2014-05-14

the current equities, you have to also take into consideration that there will be eﬀects due
to returns on derivatives for hedging purposes, so that has to be taken into consideration
if that's so.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

FINAL

So the hedges backﬁre. Okay. All right. That's very clear. So thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Do-Thoi from JPMorgan. Please go
ahead.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Good morning. Just three questions from my side. The ﬁrst one was on the pensions
and banking business. We've delivered extremely well in cost here in the quarter. If you
could just comment on the operational gearing in these businesses and, in particular, on
the cost-to-income ratio within the retail banks, which at 52% this quarter is sort of starting
to approach the levels that your larger banking peers are reporting.
Secondly then, on the Nordic business and the portfolio acquisitions, I understand there's
been some positive developments in this portfolio since you agreed the purchase. Could
you just perhaps comment at this point, what kind of retention rates you would expect in
these portfolios going forward? And then lastly, Catharina, you commented earlier on the
size of the strategic buﬀer. I just wanted to clarify what you meant with regards to the
reduced size of it following the sale of Storebrand. Is that in relation to the NOK 2.6 billion
at the end of the ﬁrst quarter or the NOK 2.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter?
Thanks.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

I can start with the strategic buﬀer, and what I related it to was the NOK 2.1 billion, the size
of the strategic buﬀer at the end of the fourth quarter. So the comment was that it could
be – everything else equal, it could be a bit lower than this level due to (30:10).

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

The other one as well.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

If you look at the acquisition in the Nordics, I think there has been a good start, if you look
at the premium level for Gouda and Solid. But when we take over this portfolio, of course
we will work on integration and we will work with optimizing all the portfolios, and that
might mean that we can see some negative eﬀects on premium levels going forward. So
Page 9 of 15



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2014-05-14

it's a bit too early to comment on the retention level as such. But we expect at least that it
could have some negative eﬀects on premiums.

A - Janne Merethe Flessum

{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

FINAL

And also the operational leverage in the bank.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yeah. The operation in the bank is of course due to the business model of the bank. This
is a retail bank. It's an online bank. So it's a very cost eﬃcient bank. So I think if you
compare it to larger banks, you have to take into consideration that it is the retail portfolio
and online bank. And so (31:17) to be very cost eﬃcient products for our customers within
the private and commercial business, also in the private general insurance business in
Norway.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. So, just all else equal, assuming continued increase in the lending portfolio, you
would expect the cost-to-income ratio to gradually notch down over time.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

At least I will say that we will have a continued focus on costs going forward. Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. And just on your ﬁrst line on the strategic buﬀer, can you perhaps give us some
indication of the – well, can you just help us try to quantify what you mean by a slightly
reduced size of the strategic buﬀer, because from my understanding, the strategic buﬀer
was initially put in place just with the dividend to ﬁnance small acquisitions and for
regulatory uncertainties. So could you just help us think about what portion of it was
allocated to volatility and Storebrand, or the balance sheet risk from Storebrand? Thank
you.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

First, if you look at the regulatory uncertainty, of course, we do not have any exposure
towards the fund beneﬁt schemes in Norway. That has been taking oﬀ our balance sheet.
And, of course, we'll take a look at available capital. The volatility of available capital is, of
course, reduced due to the stake of being sold oﬀ. But again, the size of the strategic
buﬀer is something that the board will consider normally once a year.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thank you.

FINAL

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two things in capital really. Christina (sic)
[Catharina] (33:20), you mentioned the reduction in the capital requirement for asset risk
in the internal model, but actually the capital requirement for asset risk in the S&P model
appears to have increased in the quarter. Could you just tell us a little bit about what the
diﬀerences are there? Then second, some of your non-life peers in Europe have
mentioned that S&P are a little bit moving away from using their own model to looking
more of company's internal models. Is that something you recognize as well, and would
you consider moving away from the S&P model at some point? Thank you.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yeah. I can comment on the diﬀerence between the internal model's perspective and the
S&P perspective. Of course, there are diﬀerent ways of how you calculate asset risk and
also how you treat the (34:10) of companies in these two models. But the main changes, if
you look at the asset risk reduction in the internal model, it's due to the Storebrand stake.
But if you look at the S&P model, the Storebrand stake was not part of the asset risk,
because the associate companies and the capital requirements for the associate
companies is actually 27% of the fair value of the stake that has been reduced from
available capital. So they're two very diﬀerent ways of how you calculate capital
requirements. So there's so much larger eﬀect in the internal model than in the S&P
model.

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

I asked also about the potential of moving away from the S&P model.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

I think it's not moving away from the S&P model, I think. That is the discussion. It's more
about if S&P can use part of it, or more or less part of – or implemented as part of their –
how they look at the capital requirement and more or less embedded some of these into
their models. I think that's how we feel that the discussion with S&P is, at the time being.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Okay. I guess it's just that the diﬀerence is now quite big in terms of capital requirement
between the internal and the S&P model. So sorry, that's what I was...

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Of course. Interesting (35:53).

Thank you. Our next question today comes from Jakob Brink from ABG. Please go ahead.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Yeah. It's Jakob from ABG. Just three questions please. And the ﬁrst one is regarding the
SR-Bank stake. It's correctly understood that's what's going to happen now to the capital
charges, basically that it will be increased from a 27% to around 49% capital charge.
The second question is regarding the bank. I just look in this quarter where I guess it's
becoming more and more normalized earnings in the bank, it's still just 5% of your proﬁt,
but around 20% of your capital allocation in your internal model. So I guess it's quite
capital-consuming to what you actually gained from it. Could you maybe add some
comments on that, please?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then ﬁnally, you just said before, Catharina, that the dividends are something the
board typically decides on once a year, but I did notice that they did ask for a permission
to do extraordinary dividends mid-year. Could you maybe also give some comments on
that, please? Thank you.

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yeah. If I start with your ﬁrst question, I can just verify that it is correct, that it will now be a
49% charge or part of the asset risk, (37:18) 49% charge. That's correct. If you look at the
bank, I think it's important to understand the strategic rationale behind the bank. It's not a
standalone bank. It's a bank for our private customers. And it's very important for us to be
able – and then also to meet the increasing provision (37:37) from all the ﬁnancial players
so that we have a broader product oﬀering to our customers. It's important to be able to
oﬀer both insurance and lending when the customers are paying new houses and also
buying new cars.
But it's an important strategic rationale behind the increasing loyalty and have a broader
and better products, oﬀering for our private customers in Norway. And you also asked
about the capital in the bank, and it's correct that it's (38:17) economic capital that we
allocate to the operational segments versus the return. I'll just also remind you of – also
you might have seen the press release from the bank that it is considering now to use up
to NOK 250 million in Q2 capital to actually fund the growth in 2014 and also the
increased capital requirements as from the 1st of July this year.
And then you have the ﬁnal question regarding the strategic buﬀer. And the board is
considering the size of it. What I said was the size of the strategic buﬀer, not the size of the
dividend. That number will be considered by the board once a year. And it's correct that
we also have, as you said, for an authorization to pay out interim dividend. But this is the
ﬂexibility that has long been introduced into the Norwegian legislation, and that we saw
Page 12 of 15

that it was interesting for us to use, and it can be used if the board ﬁnds that the company
– the buﬀers, the capital (39:40) requirement and the technical buﬀer exceeds the capital
requirement. So it's a ﬂexibility that has been introduced in the legislation that we found
interesting to use in Gjensidige as well.

FINAL

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay. Just a follow-up on the second one, the NOK 250 million you said to capital, that
would be issued by the bank, so I guess that will not aﬀect your S&P calculation. Is that
correct?

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

That is something that will be – it's considered to be issued in the bank, so it's a
consideration that is somewhere in the space.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Gianandrea Roberti from Carnegie.
Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning from me as well. I have a couple of questions just to bring you back
on the business really. I was reading in the outlook statement and also in your
introduction, Helge, about competition products heating up a bit especially from some of
the established player, but I cannot help but look at the premiums growth in your private
lines in Norway. I think it's 5.4%, which seems very, very healthy and show once again that
– I mean, you probably don't like it the way I put it down, but you seem to be getting away
pretty easily with quite decent price hikes year-after-year, while we are seeing in some
other Nordic markets that this is not the situation anymore. So I mean, when I look at that
number, isolated, it just seems somewhat diﬀerent from competition heating up, at least, I
guess that's how I see it.
And secondly also, I'd like to ask you again your attitude towards aggregators. I mean, I
can understand in your home market, you're shying (41:33) away from them, but some of
my sources are sort of hinting to the possibility that you work more and more closely with
them in the other Nordic markets, and that seems to me somewhat dangerous to me. So I
just would like to hear your view on these two topics. Thanks.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Gianandrea. First of all, it's not that easy. It's hard competition every day.
Strong competition is partly increasing from established players as we commented in the
report, they increased their eﬀorts into Germany and France. But as you've said and as
you have seen, we perceive our competitiveness as good. The number of customers,

relatively stable, and I commented also the mix of the customers, for all the customers
staying with us. I think increasingly, it's a combination of tariﬀ development, strong brand
and I think also the customer dividend model is very, very important factor that explains
our position. But it's increasing competition. I do not – it's not dramatic, but it has been
increasing. And I think it's a combination of some of the players as you commented that
want to secure the top line growth going forward and new players increasing eﬀorts into
our area.
Aggregators, yes, it's as you know, in Sweden, it's completely diﬀerent markets related to
aggregators. Still, it's a small proportion of the Swedish market. But we will have some
diﬀerent kind of – mainly due to the diﬀerence between Sweden, Denmark and Norway
related to aggregators. And, of course, due to the very, very diﬀerent position we have in
these three markets. We are looking more into – in what way aggregators could be part of
our distribution, call it, setup or system or eﬀort, into the Swedish market. I do not think
we have the same type of initiatives in Denmark and prefer we do not have that in Norway
and Norway, the aggregator market in Norway is almost not there.
So talking about aggregators in the long-term, I do not think that will be a very important
part of the Scandinavian market at all. As we have commented before, this is mainly due
to the fact that it's very well-known players, it's integrated value chains, strong brand
names. I think it's rather easy for the consumers to ﬁnd the best oﬀering without going
through the traditional aggregators.

Thank you. Our next question today comes from Niccolo Dalla Palma from Exane. Please
go ahead.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning from me as well. I have three questions. The ﬁrst one is on tax rate, if
you could help us give us a bit of guidance both for this year given the 20% tax rate in Q1,
but also for the next few years, how we should think about the development here.
The second question is to come back about the – once a year decision on strategic capital
buﬀer. Is there a speciﬁc time of the year when this is done, i.e. is it full-year results, is it
the October-November period, and maybe before the Capital Markets Day? So how
should we think of that also in the light of the interim dividend authorization, just to know
if a decision could come earlier than in full year? And the last question, and sorry to be a
bit early on this one, but I thought I'll give it a try anyway. For the Capital Markets Day,
what do you expect the key topics to be in terms of discussion there? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Catharina Elisabeth Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Okay. I can tackle the tax rate. As you know, the corporate tax rate in Norway is 27%, so
that's the starting point, if you try to estimate the tax rate. And then there are gains and
losses on equities that are not taxed, and it's not part of the tax calculation in Norway. So
the eﬀective tax rate to a large degree depends on the losses and gains on the equities in
the investment portfolio actually. So if you look at the eﬀective tax rate the ﬁrst quarter last
year, it was above 14% due to the impairment of the stake in Storebrand. This quarter, it's
around 20% due to gains on the equities. And as I said, we normally will consider
strategic buﬀer once a year and that's how speciﬁc we will comment on to that question.
Niccolo, you asked about the Capital Markets Day, we have, of course, not still concluded
on the agenda there. But in November, it will be four years since we were listed. We
haven't been in the market with any full update yet. And we'll deﬁnitely focus on an
operational update to the market.
