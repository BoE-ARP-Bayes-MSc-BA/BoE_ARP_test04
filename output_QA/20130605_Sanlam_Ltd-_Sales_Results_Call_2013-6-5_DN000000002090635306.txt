{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to this conference call. I'm joined
on the call by our Financial Director Kobus Moller and also Wilkus Oliver, the Head of
Group Finance.
By way of introduction, I'd like to say a few things. Firstly, consistent delivery has been a
key feature of Sanlam over a number of years. The Group's strategy has been in place
since 2003 and steady implementation thereof has transformed the Group into a
diversified and resilient business. This resilience enabled us to again deliver a set of
sound results for the four months ended 30 April, 2013.
The operating environment remained challenging in general, but in particular for our
short-term insurance operations in South Africa, and also some of our rest of Africa
businesses. Global economic growth remains constrained with low demand from
developed economies for resource based exports from Africa. The South African
economy continues to deliver low growth under these conditions, aggravated by the
industrial action in a number of industries over the last few months. Pressure is mounting
on certain over-indebted sections of the consumer base and this is evident in recent
company results, not our own, but those of peers.

FINAL

Claims experience in the South African short term insurance industry remains under
severe pressure emanating from mainly unfavorable weather conditions and weakening
rand. And the rest of Africa, the Songhai economy in particular continues to struggle. As
anticipated, the South African investment market did not repeat its 2012 performance for
the first four months in 2013, however, we've had a higher base to work from.
If we then move on to the results and an overview thereof, I'd like to mention that the key
aspects of the operational results for the four months period are as follows. Firstly, overall
new business volumes which excludes our white label products which are now diminishing,
increased by 50%. This new life business is up 20% and new investment business by
increasing by more than 30% as compared to the first four months of 2012.
The businesses performed as follows. Sanlam Personal Finance recorded a 28% increase
in new business volumes with strong contributions from all market segments. The South
African entry-level market recorded growth of 28% driven by more than doubling in new
group life business. The 2013 results include the ZCC premium renewal which only
contributes to new business every second year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Single premiums remained a main contributor to new business growth in the middle
income market. New risk business volumes growth remains disappointing but this was
offset to some extent by very good growth in new RA recurring premiums. Glacier's
superior offering attracted new business volumes that exceeded the prior year by more
than 30% despite lower demand for international products given the current weak rand
exchange rate.
In Sanlam Emerging Markets, new life recurring premiums increased by 26% on the first
four months of 2012, a particularly satisfactory result. Sanlam Emerging Markets received
large single premium inflows in 2012, in particular, the Namibian Unit Trust closed a [ph]
large life insurance mandates in the rest of Africa. This did not repeat to the same extent
in this year, but volatility is inherently part of single premium business and does not
detract from a sound underlying performance. Our rest of Africa growth trajectory
remained in line with expectations.
Sanlam Investments had a very good start to the year with most businesses delivering
growth in excess of 50%. This translated into satisfactory net flows, despite two large
withdrawals of some 4 billion in the four month period. Overall, net fund inflows of 9.4
billion represents an exceptional performance in the challenging conditions and this
excludes the white label stuff.
Net result from financials services or our net operating profit decreased by 30%. This
includes a first time contribution from the Group's increased stake in Shriram Capital that
we acquired last year. Organic growth in the operating earnings of 22% was achieved, that
is taking the Shriram Capital stake out of it, which we believe is still a very good result. All
operations contributed to the growth apart from Santam, which has been hit by
catastrophe and weather related agricultural trends.

FINAL

A few comments on capital. We remained very well capitalized with a healthy solvency
level. Sanlam Life Insurance Limited statutory capital covered its capital adequacy
requirements, it's CAR, by four times on the 31st of March 2013. Here we do the
calculation only every three months, so it's not for four months. The Group's discretionary
capital amounts to some 3 billion after allowing for the special dividends and investments
in Shriram Capital and Pacific & Orient. Our focus remains on computing value-adding
opportunities to utilize the discretionary capital.
In conclusion, a prolonged global recovery will continue to impact growth prospects in the
short-term. We, however, remain confident of the growth potential of the Group with the
entry level market in South Africa, our rest of African businesses, the Indian and Southeast
Asia remaining key focus areas.
Our investment markets are expected to remain volatile for the remainder of 2013, which
will impact our returns on the Group's capital portfolio. Our strategic focus on maximizing
shareholder value through optimizing return on group equity value is still key to our
strategy and this is what we're driving and how we are incentivized.
Thank you. I will now open the call for questions from the audience.

Questions And Answers

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
Thank you very much, sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Michael
Christelis of UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon, guys. Two questions if I can. Firstly, I am wondering if you can maybe
comment just on the lapse experience you are starting to see. Are you seeing any
deterioration particularly in the low income space in South Africa as we've seen at one or
two of your competitors?
And then secondly, just to clarify the impact of the sort of reduced bond yields on your
new business margin. Your commentary suggested you've got a marginal increase in
margins, yet if you look at where bond yields were at 30 April a year ago and 30 April this
year, this should be a good 10% move there in the new business margins. Maybe if you
can just give me some clarity there. Are you writing lower margin business and therefore
you have a slight improvement in margin or am I misunderstanding the comp here?

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

Okay. Kobus will come back to the bond yields and the margin issue. Let me just talk a
little bit about the lapse experience, particularly in the lower end of the market. We
haven't seen in the South African market, the lapse experience a weaker scene, but you
have to take into account that we've been managing this a lot over the last two years.
We've placed tremendous focus on that.

FINAL

And two years ago, you would recall, when most of our peers grew their books in the
lower end quite substantially with no growth, resetting the base, really focusing on quality
business and so forth and I think what we see now is the net effects of those things
coming through. We write and we take substantially less of the business that we -- or
much lower percentage of the business we would have taken in, we take in at present,
really focusing on quality and we don't write business from people who are fully indebted
or have too many policies already in the books.
So we don't see anything and we were within our assumption range in terms of
performance of the book both in the middle market and the lower income market. The
only area where we see some deterioration in our book is Botswana. We've spoken at
several times in the past, but again around the issues there, we have quite inflation rates
that are close to 10% in Botswana, yet we haven't seen any across the board increase,
particularly in salaries of civil servants. The idea here is to decrease the overall salary level
to become -- make the economy less reliant on diamond, and this is definitely impacting
on our lapse experience. But overall nothing to be serious, but we see a weaker demand,
nothing to be serious about.
And in terms of the bond deals, Kobus?

A - Kobus Moller

{BIO 7480143 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Michael, you're quite correct in terms of the impact of the rates. I think if you refer to the
marginal improvement, it's really on a consistent rate. if you use the actual rates which
end of April, I mean it is substantially better, but on a consistent basis it's just marginally
better than the year ago.

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

Okay. So, when you said your net value in your life business increased 27%, is that --?

A - Kobus Moller

{BIO 7480143 <GO>}

That was actual and it's -- part of that is -- is the rates.

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from (inaudible) of Standard Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Yes, hi. Hi, gents. Just two questions. Also on interest rates, you in the outlook statement
you sort of referred to possible impact of interest rates and profits. Now, you guys use an
asset mismatch reserve for your nonprofit books. I would have expected your interest
rate sensitivity in earnings to be quite low, so maybe just if you can maybe expand on

Page 4 of 7

exactly what you're referring to when you sort of warning about the possible impact of
interest rates.

FINAL

The second thing is, employee benefits. Now you mentioned that investments did very
well. I'm not sure if you include EB under that title, because EB itself hasn't been
mentioned anyway, so maybe some pointers on how EB did during the four months?

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

Yes. Just start through the EB question. EB, the sales are actually a bit down on the
previous, last year. But we didn't exclude it, so we included the number under the
investment. So, they've done fairly well on the single premium side, slightly up but down
on the recurring premiums. So overall I would say so (inaudible)

Q - Unidentified Participant
Okay. Thanks.

A - Kobus Moller

{BIO 7480143 <GO>}

Reference to the interest rate, the outlook was really exactly what Michael's point that at
the end of April the rates were very low but since then came back again, so it's more
impact on your value of new business and the GEV impact that clearly monitor. You are
quite right that on the -- the direct impact on the earnings is not that much.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Unidentified Participant
Okay. Perfect. Thanks.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Francois du Toit of JPMorgan.
Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Francois du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

Hi. The margin question can be clarified if you could just give us the PVNBP growth for the
period, first question. And then maybe is it possible for you to give us the earnings growth
excluding Santam? And then third question just on the impact of the ZCC premium
increases? Can you give us an indication of how much of that 27% growth just simply came
from the rate increase from the ZCC?

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

I can try to help you on those. So even without the ZCC, the Group has doubled year-onyear. So I mean, we had to see it as a sizable part of that, but it's not that material, so the
underlying business also is still much better than last year. On Santam, I don't think we'd
like to give you that. I think, really Santam doesn't provide detail on their numbers, so by
giving you that number it makes it easier to calculate the Santam numbers. We can't
disclose what they haven't.

Q - Francois du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

FINAL

PVNBP also I have disclosed. What was the increase there? Roughly 18%, 20% increase
PVNBP.

Q - Francois du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

18% to 20% increase, okay. And that would have benefitted from the lower interest rate
as well?

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

To some extent, yeah.

Q - Francois du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

Okay. And the (inaudible) volume increase, you would get to disclose that?

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

We haven't talked related to that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Francois du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

Okay. More or less in line or slightly below the PVNBP increase?

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

I mean, as you know, we don't disclose that anymore, so it's not something that we focus
on. I haven't done that calculation.

Q - Francois du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Gentlemen, it appears we have no further questions. Do you have
any closing comments?

A - Johan van Zyl

{BIO 4080290 <GO>}

Yes, thanks. The only comment that I have is to, I would like to thank people for
participating in the call. We appreciate the continued support and enjoy the rest of the
day.
