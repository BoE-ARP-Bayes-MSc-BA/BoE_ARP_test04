{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This
morning we reported record quarterly core income per diluted share of $3.32. Core
return on equity was 14.8%. As you've heard us say before, the primary measure we use
to manage our business is core return on equity over time, and any strategy to deliver
industry-leading returns requires a strategy to grow also over time.
For the full year 2019, we are very pleased that the continued successful execution of our
strategy to grow the top line at attractive returns resulted in record net written premiums
of more than $29 billion. Looking back over the last three years, our cumulative top-line
growth and its impact on our results are significant.
Earned premiums were more than $3.5 billion higher in 2019 compared to 2016,
representing a compound annual growth rate of nearly 5%. That volume has made a
meaningful contribution to underwriting income. We have a very high quality book of
business and we're pleased that retentions have remained high across the board in
recent years.
Premium growth in 2019, and over the past three years have been driven by higher pricing
with, both pure rate and exposure growth contributing. The new business we've added
Page 2 of 24

FINAL

has been in products, industries and geographies that we know well. So we're growing
with confidence.
Improvements in productivity and efficiency complement the benefit of volume. This
quarter, our expense ratio improved to 29.1%, bringing our full year expense ratio to
29.6%. That marks the steady and substantial improvement over the past three years
from an expense ratio, which prior to that, had averaged around 32%. This was driven by
our efforts to leverage technology investments and workflow enhancements. Importantly,
at the same time, we also continue to make strategic investments in our business, grow
our investment portfolio and return substantial excess capital to our shareholders.
Achieving further productivity and efficiency gains continues to be a strategic priority for
us. As you've heard us say, improved operating leverage gives us the flexibility to invest
further in our strategic priorities, let the benefit fall to the bottom line and/or be more
competitive on pricing, without compromising our return objectives.
Over the course of this past year, our results were also impacted by headwinds from a
challenging tort environment. Greg will comment on the impact in the current quarter, but
I'll note that we continue to believe that social inflation is an environmental issue, driven
primarily by a more aggressive plaintiffs' bar.

Bloomberg Transcript

For the full year, core income exceeded $2.5 billion, generating core return on equity of
10.9%. Considering the challenging tort environment and persistent low interest rates, that
level of profit and returns speaks to the strength and resilience of our diversified business
and our investment expertise.
Our results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book
value per share by 6% during the year to $92.76 after returning $2.4 billion of excess
capital to shareholders, consistent with our longstanding capital management strategy.
Turning to production, our marketplace execution was excellent and fourth quarter net
written premiums increased by 6% to $7.1 billion, marking the 12th consecutive quarter in
which we generated premium growth in all three business segments. Net written
premiums in Business Insurance increased 5%. Domestic renewal premium change was
7.8%, including renewal rate change of 5.1%, in both cases, the highest level since 2013,
while retention remained very strong.
In Bond & Specialty Insurance net written premiums increased by 9%, with strong growth
in both our Management Liability and Surety businesses. Renewal premium change in our
domestic Management Liability business was 6.6%, up about 2 points over the prior year
quarter, and the highest it has been since 2014, while retention remains historically high at
89%.
In Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 6%, reflecting growth in both
Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners. In our Agency Homeowners business, renewal
premium change increased to 7.4%, its highest level since 2014. You'll hear more shortly
from Greg, Tom and Michael about our segment results.

FINAL

To sum it up, our performance transform call to action served us well this past year. In a
challenging environment, we generated a nearly 11% core return on equity. We also made
important investments broadly across our value chain, advancing our ambitious innovation
agenda. We digitized sales and service capabilities, improved workflows to increase
speed and responsiveness, rolled out new products, implemented new analytic
capabilities and put claims related digital tools in the hands of our customers and claim
professionals, just to name a few.
All of these and other important initiatives are part of our coordinated efforts to deliver on
three priorities aimed at positioning Travelers for continued success well into the future,
namely: extending our lead in risk expertise; providing great experiences to our
customers, agents, brokers and employees; and optimizing productivity and efficiency.
With our relentless focus on execution, deep and talented team, sophisticated analytical
approach to underwriting and high degree of respect for our shareholders' capital, we are
well positioned to continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value over time.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Alan. Core income for the fourth quarter was $867 million, up from $571 million
in the prior year quarter, and core ROE was 14.8%, up from 10%. The improvement in both
measures from last year's fourth quarter resulted primarily from a lower level of
catastrophe losses.
Our fourth quarter results include $85 million of pre-tax cat losses, which consists of $186
million of cat events, partially offset by $101 million of cat recoveries under the new treaty.
Recall that under that treaty, we were re-insured for 86% of the losses above $1.3 billion
retention and that through the third quarter we had accumulated $1.2 billion towards that
retention.
PYD in the current quarter, for which I will provide more detail shortly, was net favorable
$60 million pre-tax. The underlying combined ratio of 92.1%, which excludes the impacts of
cats and PYD, increased by 1 point from the prior year quarter.
Our pre-tax underlying underwriting gain of $538 million was down modestly from $578
million in the prior year quarter, reflecting the higher loss level associated with ongoing
challenges related to the more aggressive tort environment, partially offset by the volume
benefit from higher levels of premium.
The fourth quarter expense ratio of 29.1% brings the full year expense ratio to 29.6%.
These results reflect the progress we've made in our strategic focus on productivity and
efficiency in recent years and this is our lowest full year expense ratio since 2005.

FINAL

After-tax net investment income decreased slightly from the prior year quarter to $525
million as increases in fixed income were more than offset by lower returns in our nonfixed income portfolio. In 2020, we expect that fixed income NII will decrease by
approximately $5 million to $10 million after-tax per quarter compared to the
corresponding periods of 2019 as we project that the benefit of higher average levels of
invested assets will be more than offset by a lower average yield on the portfolio, given
the lower interest rate environment.
All three segments reported modest net favorable prior year reserve development in the
fourth quarter. In Personal Insurance, both auto and property performed better than
expected from multiple accident years. In Bond & Specialty, we experienced better-thanexpected loss development in the fidelity and surety line. In Business Insurance, net
favorable PYD included about $140 million of better than expected loss experience in
workers' comp and unfavorable development in the general liability and commercial multiperil lines.
When our combined 2019 Schedule P is filed earlier in the second quarter, we expect the
results to be consistent with our commentary throughout the year, with strengthening in
the commercial liability lines and favorability in workers' comp, fidelity and surety and the
personal lines coverages.

Bloomberg Transcript

Page 22 of the earnings presentation provides information about our January 1 cat treaty
renewals. Our long-standing Corporate Cat XOL treaty renewed on terms in line with the
expiring treaty and continues to provide coverage for both single cat events and the
aggregation of losses from multiple cat events.
As you know, for 2019, we added a new Property Aggregate Catastrophe XOL treaty.
First, let me take a moment to summarize the impact of that treaty on our 2019 results.
For the full year, as expected, the treaty increased our underlying combined ratio by
about 0.5 point. The treaty had essentially no impact on the full year's total combined
ratio, as the impact on the underlying combined ratio was virtually offset by the benefit of
cat recoveries under the treaty, also very much in line with our assumptions.
Because we did not surpass our retention level until the fourth quarter, that's when we
began to recognize recoveries under the treaty. So the impact on the fourth quarter
specifically was a benefit to the total combined ratio of more than 1 point and there was
virtually no impact on the underlying combined ratio.
As renewed for 2020 this treaty will continue to address from $1 qualifying PCS
designated events in North America for which we incur losses of $5 million or more,
providing aggregate coverage of $280 million part of $500 million of losses above an
aggregate retention of $1.55 billion. The aggregate retention for 2020 increased from last
year's $1.3 billion, largely reflecting recent years and anticipated growth in our property
book. Hurricane and earthquake events once again have a $250 million occurrence cap.
Since we placed a lower percentage of the treaty than last year, the cost of the treaty will
be proportionately lower in 2020. So incorporating our assumptions about cat and non-cat
Page 5 of 24

Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2020-01-23

FINAL

weather for 2020, we would expect the full year impact on our underlying combined ratio
to be slightly less than the roughly 0.5 point we experienced in 2019, and we would once
again anticipate only a minimal impact on the total combined ratio.
Turning to capital management, operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.4 billion were
again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels and we ended
the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.4 billion. For the full year,
operating cash flow exceeded $5 billion, our highest level since 2007, which was an
unusually light cat year loss.
Interest rates increased modestly during the fourth quarter and accordingly, our net
unrealized investment gains decreased from $2.4 billion after-tax as of September 30,
$2.2 billion after-tax at year-end. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes
unrealized investment gains and losses, was $92.76 at year-end, 6% higher than at the
beginning of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

We returned $588 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share
repurchases of $376 million and dividends of $212 million. For the year, we returned $2.4
billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Finally, on a financial modeling note, let me turn your attention to Slide 23 of the earnings
presentation. As we enter 2020, we thought it would be helpful to point out the
seasonality of our cat losses over the prior decade. As you can see, the second quarter
has regularly and noticeably been our largest cat quarter. Cat losses in the second quarter
have been about twice as much as any other quarter on average, and the second quarter
has been our largest cat quarter in six of the past 10 years.
And now, I'll turn the microphone over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.

Gregory C. Toczydlowskiq
Thanks, Dan. For the fourth quarter Business Insurance produced $448 million of segment
income, a 15% increase over the fourth quarter of 2018. That brings the full year total per
segment income to almost $1.4 billion.
Earnings for both the quarter and the year benefited from strong profitability in workers'
compensation, our largest product line, as well as higher overall business volumes and a
lower expense ratio, as we continue to execute on our strategy of growing the top-line at
attractive returns and improving our operating leverage.
The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 96.4%, 1 point higher than the fourth
quarter of 2018. We've included information on Slide 9 of the earnings presentation the
detailed components of the change. As you can see on this slide, there is about one-third
of a point of net unfavorable impact from items that rolled forward from prior quarters.
There is also about 1 point of net unfavorable impact from items that are new in the fourth
quarter, including about 0.5 point associated with additional changes in our general liability

Page 6 of 24



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2020-01-23

and commercial auto loss estimates. And along with that, the current quarter includes
about 0.5 point related to the re-estimation of the first three quarters of the year.

FINAL

For the full year, the underlying combined ratio of 96.2% was 0.5 point higher than the full
year 2018. Slide 10 of the earnings presentation provides a detailed view of the various
items impacting the year-over-year results.
Before turning to the top-line and production, I'll provide a little more context on the tort
environment in our international loss activity. Regarding the tort environment, to get our
best view of the escalating loss costs, we've leveraged our leading data and analytics and
importantly, the tight feedback loop among our business leaders, underwriters, claim
professionals and actuaries.
We have a carefully underwritten book of business with largely a main street orientation,
which we have targeted, grown and optimized for years. More than 90% of our domestic
policies have limits of $2 million or less, excluding workers' compensation were limits don't
apply.

Bloomberg Transcript

While we will continue to pursue claim strategies and underwriting actions to mitigate the
impacts from the worsening tort environment, our primary action will be to seek more
rate. During the quarter, we were once again successful in achieving meaningful
improvement in renewal rate change while maintaining very high levels of retention, which
is evidence that we're not alone in driving rate. All of that is consistent with our view that
what we're experiencing is environmental.
As for international, we've been experiencing elevated losses in the property lines. We're
pursuing and achieving significant renewal rate increases to address these trends as you
can see within the international production statistics on Page 20 of the earnings
presentation.
In addition to that, we're executing a variety of profit improvement initiatives, including
tightening in terms and conditions and paring back exposures in certain lines and
accounts. While more work needs to be done, we're making good progress with all of
these efforts.
Turning to the top-line, net written premiums were up 5% in the quarter and 4% for the
full year, driven by strong production results. While renewal premium change continues to
be the largest contributor, we also grew our customer base for the year through strong
retention and new business. We're pleased with the continued progress we're making on
our strategic initiatives and remain encouraged by the feedback from our agent and
broker partners.
In terms of domestic production, we achieved strong renewal premium change of 7.8%,
with renewal rate change of 5.1%, while retention remained high at 84%, a reflection of
the quality of our book. The renewal rate change of 5.1% was the highest result since the
fourth quarter of 2013 and was up seven-tenths of a point from the third quarter, and
more than 3.5 points from the fourth quarter of last year. This demonstrates our
Page 7 of 24



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2020-01-23

continued momentum notwithstanding the downward pressure in workers' compensation
pricing.

FINAL

We are achieving higher rate levels broadly across our book with about three quarter of
our middle market accounts getting positive rate increases this quarter, which is up from
about two-thirds in the fourth quarter of last year.
A further illustration of the broad nature of our progress is on Slide 14 of the earnings
presentation. For our core commercial accounts business, the slide reflects the
percentage of renewed accounts in three rate bands for the fourth quarters of 2017, 2018
and 2019. As you can see from the graph, the percentage of accounts renewing flat or
with the rate decrease has declined, while the percentage of accounts renewing with the
rate increase is up, with the level of rate increase skewed higher. In other words, a higher
proportion of our accounts are getting a rate increase and a higher proportion of our
accounts are getting a more significant rate increase, and this progress has been
achieved while retention has remained at historically high levels.

Bloomberg Transcript

From a line of business perspective, outside of workers' compensation, we achieved
higher rate increases in all lines as compared to both the third quarter of this year and the
fourth quarter of last year. For the segment, new business of $488 million was strong and
consistent with the prior year quarter.
As for the individual businesses, in Select renewal premium change of 7.2% and renewal
rate change of 1.9%, were both up from the third quarter and from the fourth quarter of
last year, while retention remained strong at 83%. New business of $105 million was
consistent with the strong prior-year quarter. We continue to advance our investments
related to product development and ease of doing business, and are encouraged with
the progress and results to-date.
In middle market, renewal premium change was 7.1%, with renewal rate change of 5%, up
more than 1 [ph] point from third quarter and more than 3.5 points from the fourth quarter
of last year, while retention remained high at 86%. New business of $284 million was up
slightly from the prior year quarter, bringing the full year total to just over $1.2 billion,
reflecting higher new business pricing, as well as benefits from our ongoing strategic
initiatives.
To sum up, the fourth quarter wrapped up a year in which a lot of things went well and we
faced some challenges, most notably the continued pressure from the tort environment.
We're confident that we have the insights and capabilities to changing [ph] environment
and that will position us well in the market in 2020 and beyond.
We couldn't be more pleased with our local execution and we will continue to seek rate
and use all other available levers to meet our return objectives.
Before I turn the call over to Tom to talk about Bond & Specialty results, I want to
comment on our outlook for renewal premium change and underlying underwriting results
since we will not be filing our 10-K for a few weeks.

FINAL

For Business Insurance, we expect RPC in 2020 will be higher than 2019. We expect the
underlying combined ratio for the full year 2020 will be lower than in 2019. This assumes
the anticipated impacts of earned pricing in excess of loss cost trends and improved
results in our international business.
Underneath that full-year outlook, we expect the improvements in the underlying
combined ratio to come in the second through fourth quarters of the year as the first
quarter of 2020 will include the roll-forward impacts of the actions we took in the second,
third and fourth quarters of 2019 for the general liability and commercial auto product
lines.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.

Thomas M. Kunkel

{BIO 16615934 <GO>}

Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty delivered another quarter of strong returns and growth.
Segment income was $167 million, a decrease of $53 million from the prior year quarter,
primarily due to a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development.

Bloomberg Transcript

The combined and underlying combined ratios remained strong at 78.6% and 81.3%,
respectively. The underlying combined ratio increased 3.2 points from the prior year
quarter, largely reflecting the impact of the roll forward of higher loss estimates for
Management Liability coverages that we discussed with you last quarter. The underlying
underwriting gain was slightly lower than the prior year quarter as the earned impact of
higher business volumes largely offset the higher underlying combined ratio.
Turning to top-line, net written premiums were up 9% for the quarter, reflecting growth
across all our businesses. In our domestic Management Liability business, we are pleased
that the retention remained at a very strong 89%, with renewal premium change higher at
6.6%. These production results are consistent with our strategy to maintain strong
retention of our high-quality portfolio while executing targeted pricing actions. We will
continue to pursue price increases were warranted.
Domestic Management Liability new business for the quarter increased 17% to $62 million
and domestic surety and our international business, both posted solid growth in the
quarter. We remain pleased with our strong field execution and our strategic long-term
investments in market-leading products and services, together with our commitment to
thoughtful and disciplined underwriting and risk selection.
So Bond & Specialty results remained strong and we feel terrific about our ability to
continue to deliver top-line growth with strong returns over time. In terms of our 2020
outlook, we expect RPC for our domestic management liability business will be higher,
and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly higher, in each case as compared to
2019.
Additionally, for 2020, we expect that the underlying underwriting margin will be broadly
consistent with 2019 as the impact of higher business volumes will offset the slightly

higher underlying combined ratio.
And now I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.

FINAL

Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, we're very pleased with
our fourth quarter and full year results. For the fourth quarter, segment income was $327
million and our combined ratio was 88.5%. For the full year, segment income was $824
million, an improvement of $527 million from the prior year and the combined ratio was
94.2%. The results for both periods reflect solid improvements from the prior year driven
by significantly lower-catastrophes. Underwriting income also benefited from higher levels
of earned premium.
Net written premium growth for the fourth quarter and full year were 6% and 5%,
respectively, with continued strong retention, renewal premium change and new business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Agency Automobile delivered solid results in the quarter, with a combined ratio of 99.2%
in what is typically our highest combined ratio quarter for the line. The 3.9 point increase
relative to the prior-year period is largely reflective of the unusually low level of losses in
the fourth quarter of 2018.
The full-year combined ratio was an outstanding 94%, which was comparable to the prior
year. The underlying combined ratio of 94.6% improved 0.7 points, benefiting from
earned premium pricing that exceeded loss trends in the first half of the year, as well as
favorable frequency throughout 2019.
In Agency Homeowners and Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 75.8% improved
by 34 points in comparison to the prior year quarter, which was significantly impacted by
catastrophes, specifically the California wildfires and Michael. On an underlying basis, the
combined ratio was 73.6%, or 1.1 points higher than the prior year quarter, driven by higher
non-weather loss activity.
The full year 2019 combined ratio was an excellent 92.5% as lower catastrophe losses
drove a 13.1 point improvement from the prior year. The underlying combined ratio was up
4 points to 85.6% for the year due primarily to higher non-catastrophe weather-related
losses and the impact of the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty. As we've discussed with
you previously, we continue to take pricing and underwriting actions to address higher
levels of underlying loss activity.
Shifting to quarterly production, Agency Automobile net written premiums grew 2%, with
modest growth in new business and policies in force, while retention remained strong at
84%, and renewal premium change with 2.9%. We continue to make progress in our
efforts to grow this profitable line.

Page 10 of 24

FINAL

Agency Homeowners & Other delivered another strong quarter, with net written premium
growth of 13%, driven by higher new business levels, retention at 86% and renewal
premium change rising to 7.4%, double the level from the prior year quarter.
We remain pleased with the roll-out of our Quantum Home 2.0 product, which is now
available on 34 states and the District of Columbia. Quantum Home 2.0's granular pricing
segmentation, customizable coverages and ease of quoting, combine to form a solution
that is both sophisticated and simple and our increased quote volume and higher average
premiums suggest it's hitting the mark with both agents and customers.
Turning to our outlook, we expect that for 2020, compared to 2019, Agency Homeowners
and Other renewal premium changes will be higher, while Agency Automobile renewal
premium changes will remain positive, but be lower. The underlying combined ratios for
both Agency Homeowners and Other and for the Personal Insurance segment as a whole
will be lower. This improvement is expected in the second through fourth quarters of the
year, assuming lower levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses. For Agency
Automobile, the outlook is for the underlying combined ratio to be broadly consistent.

Bloomberg Transcript

All in, it was a very good year for Personal Insurance with the second consecutive year of
strong profitability in Auto and strong and significantly improved Homeowners profitability.
In addition, we achieved record levels of domestic net written premium, new business
and policies in force.
We have strong momentum going into 2020, and are well positioned to deliver profitable
growth, while investing in capabilities that will continue to enhance the value of our
franchise.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. My first question, I'm thinking about Slide 9 and
just sort of the bottom of Slide 9. And I know you guys talk about longer-term trends of
4% to 4.5%, I think it was 4.5% last time. And I know you focus on long-term trends, but
you've moved that up a bit in the last couple of quarters more on the catch-up, which you
again refer to here in Slide 9. So I'm wondering if you still think that 4.5% is something
you're comfortable with, or how you think about that going forward now?

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Hey, Michael. It's Dan Frey. So I'll draw the distinction between the long-term trend
assumption and what's going to roll through any particular quarter or any year. So in that
slide we're reconciling for you the difference between last year's combined ratio and this
year's combined ratio. And clearly, for the year as a whole, when we look at the change in
the loss environment overall, it was more than 4.5%. We did, remember, raise our view of
the long-term trend. I think we talked about that back in the second quarter, but we
haven't changed it since then. So these are more reactions to data that we're seeing in
the current environment, raising the level of losses, but not the trajectory from this point
forward.

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Okay. I mean, I guess, obviously, what I'm getting to is a tug-of-war between pricing and
loss trends and to who wins, and where we're right now. And obviously, this quarter the
tug a war went to went to loss trends because margins were down, but lot of your
commentary talks about the outlook being better for the underlying. Certainly, I think you
said in second quarter. So you're still thinking that earned pricing will get better than loss
trends as we get into the back half of this year. It sounds like, is that what you're saying?

Yeah. That's full year. So remember the outlook is really a 12-month broad view of what
we think the environment is going to be as opposed to a quarter-by-quarter reconciliation.
The comment Greg made is that, when we compare Q1 in particular of '20 to Q1 of '19,
the strengthening that we've done for 2019 came in Q2, Q3 and Q4 primarily, so that
comparison in and of itself is going to be a little different than the year more broadly.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

Michael, I would also just encourage you to make sure you're looking at Slide 10 too
because there's a lot of moving pieces in Slide 9 that when you look at it on a full year
basis, it's a little bit of an easier view to take in.

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. No. Thank you. Second question, I guess, I appreciate the color you guys gave
on the Business Insurance PYD, $140 million you talked about for comp and that was
helpful. I guess on the CMP piece, I assume the adverse there was on the liability side of
CMP. I just want to confirm that. And then, if so, I guess, what's driving that? Are you
seeing -- is that more of the tort environment leaking down from GL into the smaller
accounts of CMP liability or what's driving that piece?

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Yeah. Michael, it's Dan again. So I'd say broadly, yes. And I'd remind you, if you go back
and look at the results we've disclosed throughout the year, even going back to Q1 of this
year, we did talk about CMP as being an unfavorable contributor to prior year reserve
development, and BI even going back to Q1. And clearly, as you're alluding to, CMP has
got both of property and a liability component. It is the liability component, but as we've

Q - Larry Greenberg

{BIO 16478161 <GO>}

Good morning and thank you. I guess I'm just asking a qualitative question. Where you sit
today or feel today versus where things stood coming out of the third quarter, obviously,
you're pushing -- this is all about Business Insurance. Obviously, you're pushing price. To
some extent, you're shooting at a moving target with loss trend and all the issues
surrounding that. You've now got another quarter just looking back to from the third. Is
there any way to say that you are more comfortable with where you sit today and what
you're seeing and how the relationship with pricing and loss trend is moving? Just looking
for some qualitative thoughts on that.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. Larry, it's Alan. Let me take a stab at that. So first, I would say, we are definitely
pleased with the trajectory of rate versus loss trend. That continues to be a good story.
And importantly, you got to look at retention in that regard. That's hanging in there which
suggests we think this is an environmental thing and we would say that the pricing actions
have room to go here.
In terms of our overall sense of the balance sheet, we are closer to the end of this than
we were a year ago, that's for sure. And what we're very confident in is, we're confident
in the talent we've got looking at this, we're confident in our processes, we're confident in
our data and analytics, and we're confident that we understand the environment out
there. So very confident in our best estimate.
Can we tell you this is the end of it? Of course, not. We couldn't and nobody could, but I
don't mean to imply any lack of confidence in again, the data analytics people process
here. This is an environmental issue and we think we're on top of it.

Q - Larry Greenberg

{BIO 16478161 <GO>}

have in addition to pricing, are you willing to share any of those other levers to go at this
environmental issue?

Well, certainly, because it is environmental, just the playbooks as you go to rate that's just
the way you solve those issues. Now, anytime you have a circumstance like this, and
frankly, anytime, in any book of business, we're always looking to optimize, we're always
pulling books of business apart and understanding where there are opportunities to
improve. And that's true in our best performing businesses and our worst performing
businesses. So you go through that process and there are always things that we can do
better and we will do those things.
When we look at this environment in particular, relative to our overall book of business,
there are around the edges accounts or segments of the business that we think in the
current environment don't make sense and we will either get the right rate or we will get
off them. And then, probably to the question you're really asking is, what we're doing
from a claim perspective? And clearly, the plaintiffs' bar is getting more sophisticated,
more clever, more aggressive, and I guess in response to that I would say, so are we. I'm
not anxious to detail our tactics or strategies. I think that would probably be unwise for us
to do that, but we've got a very large and very sophisticated claim operation lawyers'
litigation strategy. And so we will employ all those levers as well.

Your next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. I had a couple of questions. First, just on the tort environment overall,
you've been more vocal than most other companies. I'm just trying to understand is the
environment stabilizing or has it gotten worse as you went through 2019? And then, the
other question I just had is on your expense ratio, which was very good for the year and
for the quarter. To what extent is it sustainable versus being an aberration?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks for the question. I'll start with the tort environment and then I'll ask Dan to
talk about the expense ratio. Clearly, I think, if you look at our results throughout the year,
we would say, I don't know if the environment has gotten worse, but clearly the losses
have come in worse than our expectations. And one thing you got to remember is, we are
setting reserves for years in various long tail lines of business where there is a very high
percentage of IBNR. So the paid-in case are a relatively small percentage of this and so
we're squaring triangles. We're looking at the data as it comes in every quarter,
comparing it to our expectations and that's what has gotten worse.

Page 14 of 24

FINAL

And I will say, quarter-in, quarter-out, we have not responded gingerly. We have
responded assertively to this and yet, it's continued to come in a little bit worse than our
expectations. But as I said before, we are five quarters closer to the end of this than we
were a year ago. And again, we think, we understand the market dynamics, we think we
understand what's causing this and we feel very good about our analytics and our
process. Dan, you want to talk about the expense ratio.

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Sure. So I'll focus you on the full year because there's going to be a little bit of variability
from quarter-to-quarter. So at 29.6% for the full year, that's a range we're comfortable
with now. Certainly, noticeably better than it was several years ago and steady progress
over the last three years. I think everything comes back to the way we talk about the
business consistently, which is, we're trying to optimize returns over time. There's not
really a specific targeted expense ratio, although in the current environment, the level that
we're at now is a level that plus or minus we're pretty comfortable with in this
environment.
We've been able to get productivity and efficiency gains and at the same time, we've
been able to make the investments in the business that we think we needed to make for
our success going forward. And we will always balance those things. The fact that it's
come out of 29.6% for the year feels good, and this is a level that we're pretty
comfortable with in this environment.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Okay. And if I could ask one more, just on personal auto. I think, you mentioned, you
expect margins to be stable in 2020, but if we look over the past couple of years, the
pace of price hikes is actually steadily slowed and it seems like for the industry, that's
worse than just loss cost inflation. So what gives you the confidence that margins in
personal auto won't get worse in 2020?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Sure. Jimmy, this is Michael Klein. I would say a couple of things. One, most of the rhetoric
in the industry about loss trend deterioration focuses on severity, which is a piece of the
puzzle. And we certainly, are observing some of the same dynamics in terms of collision
and physical damage severity that you're seeing folks talk about, as well as bodily injury
severity. On the good news front has been frequency. And as I mentioned, we continued
to see favorable frequency, better than our expectations throughout 2019 and we put
those frequency and severity results together with a longer-term view of loss trend and
view of loss trend as actually an aggregate relatively consistent going into 2020.
And then the lower renewal premium change outlook is again on the margin and again
lower but continued positive. And so that's where we land on broadly consistent. And
again, I think much like Greg's commentary in Personal Insurance, rate versus loss trend is
one dynamic that drives you to your outlook for a combined ratio, but the other levers
that you used to manage the business, including underwriting terms, conditions claim

Page 15 of 24



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2020-01-23

process, claim efficiencies come into that view of the outlook as well. So it's not just a
linear roll forward of rate versus loss trend getting you to that answer.

Your next question is from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.

Q - Mike Zaremsk

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Hey. Good morning, guys. Sticking with the tort environment first, is it more pronounced,
any geographies or maybe by employer size? And probably the number one question I
get is, could we still be in the early innings of this upward trend? I don't know if there's a
way to frame historically how high year-over-year tort inflation has gotten in the past.
Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks for the question, Mike. So you could look at any one quarter and there may
be a pocket of heat in terms of geography of business or line, but I think the right way to
answer that question is, to take a step back and look at the last year. And when we take a
step back and look at the last year, we would say, it's been broadly across our casualty
coverages geographically line of business and so on and so forth. I would point out that
the vast majority of the business we write has 500 or fewer employees. And as Greg
mentioned, more than 90% of our policies have a limit of $2 million or less. So I would say,
this is relatively broad-based phenomenon is the way to think about it.
Now, you asked about relative to history, we've had other liability environments, I'll say,
over the last decade or two, and there are some people out there that try to compare
them. I don't know that you really can compare them. Just the facts and circumstances are
different, you've got companies that have different books of business we've got all of us
have different data and analytics available to us. But I think most importantly, if you look at
prior liability environments, I will call them, those have largely been driven by medical
inflation, this one is driven by social inflation and I'm not aware in recent history of another
environment where distributed social inflation has been the driver.

Q - Mike Zaremsk

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And my last question is regarding Slide 23 of the deck on the
historical catastrophe losses. Would you say that over the last decade or so, hurricane
losses in the US have been less than expected? I am basically trying to get at, should the
3Q and maybe 4Q cat load look a little differently if we're thinking about this on a forward
basis?

Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2020-01-23

Mike, it's Dan. I'm not quite sure how to answer that question. What you're seeing here is
our numbers. And for sure the point I think we're trying to make here is, our experience in
this includes, as a result of underwriting actions taken over the previous 10 to 15 years, to
really move the mix of our book so that it's less coastal than it was a decade or more than
that ago. So there has been a lot of industry commentary around hurricane. I don't know
that anybody feels that there is any less exposure to hurricanes broadly now than there
was two years ago, five years ago or 10 years ago. I think as a percentage of where our
risks are, we've probably, on a relative basis, mitigated our hurricane risk compared to the
other risks.
And I think that's really the point we're trying to make in this slide is that, second quarter
for us has been the issue, which is not aligned with the traditional hurricane. Not because I
think on a macro basis, the hurricane environment is more benign. I don't really have an
opinion on that. We're just telling you, in our book, based on where we write and the
exposures we have, this is what our result looks like over the past 10 years.

Q - Mike Zaremsk

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. Yeah. I guess I'll follow up because it's still feels like on a forward basis that since
we're not going to (inaudible) there has been less hurricane activity. And I think the Street
definitely has 3Q being a little more pronounced. And it sounds like you're saying maybe
we should weigh it a little differently, but I'll follow-up. Thank you for the insights.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Mike, I'll just add, that's definitely why we provided the slide. We look at models and we
scratch our heads a little bit. And obviously, we don't know what 2020 is going to look like
or 2021 or any other year. We have no idea where the volatility could come from, but
certainly, when we think about what our assumptions are and what our plans are, our
starting point is the last 10 years and we think it's relevant for thinking about this year and
future years.

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great. Thanks. Good morning. I think, this is a question for Greg. Within the BI segment
middle market, the delta between renewal premium and renewal rate change was the
smallest it's been in some time. Is there something going on with exposure units there
that is worth noting, or is it just the quarterly fluctuation/

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowskiq
Hey, Meyer. This is Greg. Yeah. That's just quarterly fluctuation. You can see the exposure
is down a little bit over the last two quarters and we do a lot of unpacking on that, try to
understand is that individual accounts or broad economic activity. And we think it's more of
the latter. If you compare the economic activity in the back half of this year to 2018, it's
linear with what we're seeing on the exposure change.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Fantastic. And then for Michael really quickly. You talked about the combined ratio. I
want to say for Personal Lines improving assuming or reflecting a return to normalized
non-cat weather. Is that just a regression to the mean, or is that reflection of claims
actions or underwriting changes?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Sure, Meyer. I appreciate the question. I would say, two things. One, we do say that it
reflects lower and more normalized expectation for a non-cat weather. That doesn't
mean reversion to the mean. It means a lower expectation than we saw in 2018. And as
we've been talking about 2018 was -- I'm sorry 2019, what we've been talking about is
non-cat weather has been elevated in 2019. We have an expectation in 2020 that's lower
than the 2019 level, but importantly continues to reflect updated estimates and an
updated view of non-cat weather loss activity, which has been rising.
So I wouldn't want you to assume that the assumption in that outlook is the same
assumption we had two or three or four years ago. It, in fact, includes more loss content
than it would have two or three or four years ago. And so we see margins in the segment
and margins in Agency Homeowners & Other improving despite the fact that we have a
higher view of the non-cat weather loss content in that outlook than we would have had a
year ago or two years ago.

reviver statutes given we've seen some other states expand or open the statute
limitations?

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Hey, Brian. It's Dan. Yeah. So in the quarter, again, a modest amount of reserve activity in
our PYD number related to revivers, not big enough to have been called out, but we saw,
California enact reviver this quarter, I think North Carolina as well. California is one that
gets a lot of attention. It's, obviously, a big state and a very active legal environment. But
remember or in case you don't remember, California had once before opened a reviver.
And so that goes into our consideration there.

Page 18 of 24

that and that did occur again in the fourth quarter.

FINAL

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. And then, second question just quickly on workers' comp. I mean you've noted and
others have noted the really favorable loss cost environment there that is obviously
offsetting some of the rate reductions that we're seeing. Would you expect that to
continue going into 2020? Is that kind of your expectations given the low unemployment
environment, although we've seen a pickup of medical cost inflation/

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Is your question whether we expect PYD to continue in workers' comp?

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

No. Just the loss trend environment with respect to workers' compensation, not so much
the PYD, but just the very favorable trends we're seeing, frequency trends and comp, as
well as severity, which is I guess average.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

The trends have been favorable. We generally assume a reversion to a longer-term mean
there. So we don't assume that all the favorability will continue. I mean there has been a
very long-term improvement in overall workers' comp frequency. So we certainly take that
into account, but results have been even better than that and we don't necessarily
assume that's going to continue. Medical inflation -- the severity side has been pretty
benign as well and. And similarly, we tend to think that these things revert.

Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I guess one just for Alan, and going back to the commentary
on thinking we're closer to the end than the beginning. So we've had some charges in the
past few quarters. This one is bigger than the we saw in 3Q. Just trying to get maybe
some sense of when you took this charge or these tweaks that you made, how does that
give you more comfort? Is there more IBNR in these than there have been in the past, like
where we are at now relative to the third quarter that gives you confidence in saying that?

Well, it's another quarter. It's another data point. Every time you get a little bit more data,
you get a little bit better view on where the environment is. And so from that perspective,
we feel better. I can't look at it and tell you where the first, second or third quarters of
next year are coming in. So from that perspective, there continues to be some
uncertainty, but we're another quarter into it, and frankly, we're five quarters into it. And
so the view we've developed over five quarters, our view of the environment, every
quarter we dig into our book a little bit more and test our hypothesis and all that gives us
a little bit more confidence. I can't comment about what's going to happen in the first
quarter, we just don't know yet, Ryan.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

So when you think about your, I guess, outlook for 2020 in terms of, hopefully, improving
Business Insurance margins, if you wanted to achieve that, do you still think that would be
a result of the tort environment or do you think it would have more to do with pricing or
execution or something on other fronts?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

I mean, obviously, any of those things could be a contributor. Certainly, social inflation
continues to be a risk factor and some uncertainty for us, but any of those things could be
a contributor. We feel -- as I said, we've got confidence in our processes. Our objective is
always to get this number right. We price and reserve based on one view of loss cost, and
so it's important to us to try to get it right. And so we think we've done that.

Yeah. I mean, let me just go back and highlight a comment Greg made in his prepared
remarks and I just referenced. 90% or so of our policies in liability lines, ex-workers' comp,
have policy limits of $2 million or less. So I don't think it's -- there's been a lot of industry
observers that have commented on this relationship between the loss environment and
the limits profile. We just don't think that's true. There's plenty of activity on the smaller
accounts. And we haven't and we haven't seen the industry necessarily move to changing
the limits profiles. We think our customers are out there and they need a certain level of
protection to manage their businesses and we intend to help them manage their risk in
their businesses. We just got to charge the right price for it. And so solving this through
broadly changing limits profiles is probably not the answer.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks, and good morning. Two follow-up questions, but the first question goes back to
Brian's question on the CVA does your Business Insurance outlook contemplate any
potential action from CVA down the road, because by the time we get to the back half of
2020, some of those reviver windows will start closing?

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

So Amit, it's Dan. We are aware of the revivers that have been enacted and are open in
the periods through which they'll close. What we've tried to do in 2019 is book our best
estimate of the ultimate loss costs related to that activity regardless of the period of time
for which the reviver is open. Obviously, when the windows close, we'll have a more
crystallized view of the volume and types of claims that have actually come in. To this
point, we haven't seen anything in the activity that's come in that makes us change our
view of the reserves related to CVA.
Regarding the 2020 outlook, in general, our view -- one, our commentary relates to
underlying combined ratio, but I'd make the comment that, generally speaking, and we've
said this consistently, we don't anticipate prior year reserve development either favorable
Page 21 of 24

claim environment, as it exists today, is reflected in our reserves today.

FINAL

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. But the only other question I have is, and I want to go back in terms of initial
question on CMP. The CMP product is towards the small to mid-size accounts, the GL
product is towards the larger customer account. I'm curious, just going back to the
broader discussion on tort environment, would it be fair to say that the adjustments have
started from the national accounts permuted to middle market and then moved on to
Select, or how should we think about that?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

No, definitely not. It started in Commercial Auto and I'm looking around the room here. I
think 99% of our commercial auto policies have policy limits of $2 million or less, I think.

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowskiq
$1 million actually.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So this isn't something that started large and moved down. This is something that started
on the small end and spread on the small end.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. I was just trying to understand the directionality of the tort climate because
we have consistently heard that the attorney involvement has continued to move down
and down and down into the smallest claims versus the larger claims. That's where I was
heading with that question.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. And again, that's why we gave you our limits profile and talked about the fact that
the vast majority of our commercial lines policies have customers -- employees of 500 or
few. I mean we are a main street writer. We've got a middle market and small commercial
business and we are feeling the heat in those policies that have limits of $2 million or less.
Now, we did observe a year ago that to a large degree it started in commercial auto and
that made perfect sense to us, because there was a lot of homogeneity to those claims.
Those are very easy claims for the plaintiff's bar to bring, but it did spread to GL, and
again, largely on -- not in the national accounts with larger limit size. Those larger accounts
with big limits, those have always had aggressive attorneys on them. What we're seeing
now is the attorney participation spreading into across these small accounts.

Q - Amit Kumar

FINAL

Your final question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Just a question for Alan on the tort environment and the lawsuits in BI. I
guess I'm just trying to get a sense for how far above expectations did loss experience
come in this quarter compared to last quarter? Was it a smaller amount of deviation
versus expectations compared to last quarter, has that narrowed over the past five
quarters? Just trying to get a sense for where we are in terms of seeing more charges
here going forward?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

I'm taking a step back and trying to think about the year, which I think is the right way to
think about it. Probably the right way to think about it is, is Slide 10 on a full year basis. I
don't really know that the quarter-by-quarter view really gives you any insight, but maybe
the answer to your question is, somewhat consistent. Dan, what would you say?

Yeah. I think that in broad magnitude, we saw bad news in the second quarter, we saw
bad news in the third quarter, we saw bad news in the fourth quarter. They weren't
noticeably different in terms of the way they felt in terms of magnitude. And if you step
back and looked at the full year overall related to the tort environment or social inflation,
things being worse than they had been. We'll say, in the underlying combined ratio on a
full year basis compared to a year ago, it's probably about a full 1 point higher than it was.
And when you think about the fact that there has also been an impact in PYD, and we
think about that same thing over the full-year basis, it's hard to attribute exactly what
drove loss changes, but to the best that we can characterize it and you should not take
this to be there is a very specific science, but based on the data and analytics we have,
we'd attribute it's probably to the place worth about 2 points of bad news within this
year's full year prior year reserve development.

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. And Alan, you had mentioned just higher attorney involvement just on the
smaller cases or smaller case sizes. I guess I'm just wondering, I guess, just how much has
that increased, like, are you seeing it now on like 30% versus 20%? Just trying to get a
sense for where that is. And are you assuming that that continues to increase in your loss
picks?

FINAL

Yes. So I not sure we're going to share the absolute number, but I will share with you that
the percentage of claims on which we're seeing lawyers has increased by about 10 points
over seven years -- over six years, with about half of that increase coming in 2019 in 2018.
So that gives you a sense of the quantum of the increase over recent years and how
much of that has come really in just '19 and '18, half of the increase. One of the reasons
why we think it's been such a recent and significant shift. And just to -- Abbe, is putting out
to me, that's a commercial auto statistic.
