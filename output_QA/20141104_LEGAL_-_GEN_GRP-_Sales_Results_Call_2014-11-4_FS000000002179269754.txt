MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Legal and General Q3 2014
Interim Management Statement Conference Call. My name is Andy and I'll be the
operator for your call today. There will be a question-and-answer session at the end of
today's presentation.
I would now like to hand over to Mark Gregory, Group Chief Financial Officer to begin
today's presentation. Mark, please go ahead.

Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call this morning.
With me in the room today are John Pollock, Mark Zinkula, Kerrigan Procter and Paul
Stanworth. We will follow the usual format of me giving an overview of the Q3 results
we've announced today, then we'll open it up to questions.

FINAL

The two main themes of our Q3 trading statement are cash and growth. Starting with
cash. Operational cash at £844 million is up 8% for the first three quarters of 2014, and
net cash is up by 12% to £827 million. The reconciling item between op cash and net cast
is new business strain and this is down 58% year-on-year at £17 million as our increasing
scale and efficiency benefited our LGAS Protection and Savings businesses in particular.
We've also taken the opportunity today to reiterate the 2014 operational cash guidance
that we gave back in March. Our business model continues to deliver significant and
predictable cash generation, and our structure means that the vast majority of that cash
flow can be dividended up to Group, thereby underpinning the Group's dividend.
Those who follow our results will be well aware that we focus on growing the stock of our
business. And it's that stock which drives our current and future cash generation. The
business highlights bullet points on the front page of today's IMS release are all stock
measures. Across the business, we're delivering growth in stock typically at double digit
rates.

Bloomberg Transcript

Annuity assets up 16%, now just under £40 billion; LGIM total assets up 14%, now £676
billion, or over $1 trillion; Savings assets up 13% to almost £120 billion; UK protection
premiums up 6%; U.S. protection premiums up 10%: and direct investments more than
doubled to £4.6 billion.
These rates of growth are being delivered both in our traditional markets like protection,
investment management and savings, as well as newer areas of focus, such as housing,
where we're building on our established capabilities. For instance, we facilitate one in six
mortgages in the UK.
Housing illustrates our ability to focus on a market where there is a clear supply-demand
imbalance, where many of the market players are relatively small (2:56) constrained and
we're able to deploy our skills and scale to deliver almost immediate results.
Looking at our businesses in turn, I'll start with L&G Retirement, annuity premiums year-todate are up 5% to £3.9 billion. Within this, bulk annuity sales are up 29%, at £3.4 billion.
These numbers exclude the transaction in Q3 which transferred just under £2 billion of
annuities from with-profits to our shareholder fund. Including this transfer, we've returned
£5.8 billion of annuity business year-to-date. Of this £5.8 billion of annuity business, only
£508 million was individual annuities, well under 10%.
Individual annuity sales in the quarter were down 61% year-on-year and we see little
prospect of upside against the forecast we gave at the time of the budget that individual
annuity volumes will be 75% lower in 2015 compared to 2013. Even before the budget
announcement, we were expanding our bulk annuity business because the global derisking opportunity was where we saw the real growth potential.
The strength and flexibility of our annuity franchise means that we've been able to secure
bulk volumes, which have more than offset lower individual annuity sales. Looking ahead,
our bulk pipeline is strong including our immediate prospects, hence our comment today
Page 2 of 17

FINAL

that we have a high degree of confidence that we'll finish 2014 having secured around £8
billion of annuity transactions, which will be more than double the record we achieved in
2013. The usual caveats apply around timing and market conditions for the portion of the
£8 billion not yet fully contracted.
The financial consequences of the Chancellor's changes for us are limited, but we'll not
be walking away from the provision of retirement solutions for individual customers. We
will have a range of products available for next April including tax efficient cash out plans,
new income-oriented multi-asset funds from LGIM and still annuities. We will continue to
provide good products, good value, and good service.
The message to people reaching retirement is simple, access your pot how you like, but
you can only spend it once, and make sure you get guidance. The message to
shareholders is also simple. The financial engine of LGR will be the bulk market. The
individual market will be a much smaller part of the overall contribution.
LGIM total assets are up 14% at £676 billion. A key part of our strategy for LGIM is focused
on the de-risking trend, which is occurring within defined benefit pension schemes. The
impact of this is pretty well illustrated in this trading update, where our year-to-date LDI
net inflows were £18.4 billion whereas our index business had net outflows of £11.8 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

Another key aspect of our LGIM strategy is to take advantage of international
opportunities. Total international assets have increased by 45% to £86.5 billion, with net
inflows of £7.2 billion year-to-date with particularly good progress being made in the U.S.
LGAS grew UK Retail Protection sales by 18% to £124 million APE in a market whose overall
size is broadly static. This represents further growth in market share. We're strengthening
distribution with new ties. We're continuing to increase efficiencies and improve digital
processes to reduce unit costs. Scale reinforces our competitive advantage.
Group Protection sales in the UK were down £3 million in the quarter, while we remained
much disciplined in our pricing. Savings increased AUA by a further 13% with net inflows of
£4 billion to Cofounds, AUA at Cofunds is up 18% to £69 billion. Workplace now has over
£10 billion AUA, up 28% and customer numbers up 48% on this time last year. Net inflows
year-to-date in Workplace are £1.5 billion and we're on track to halve the losses this year
as the business increases both scale and efficiency.
Longer term, Workplace has the potential to be more than just a pensions business. It
could become a wider distribution mechanism (7:27) for additional products including
protection. U.S. protection and LGA sales in the quarter were $39 million, down from $43
million in the corresponding period last year, reflecting the price changes we made in May.
So we will broadly expect this to be the new run rate level for new business going
forwards.
Finally on L&G Capital, our direct investments at the end of September were £4.6 billion,
reflecting a mixture of investments and disposals during the quarter. Our medium term

Page 3 of 17

Date: 2014-11-04

intention of having around £15 billion of direct investments remains, but each and every
asset will be assessed on its individual risk and reward characteristics.

FINAL

In summary, our strategy to deliver cash plus growth is set and we are in execution mode.
And this was another quarter of delivery.
I now open the call to questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you, Mark. We will now begin today's question and answer session, ladies and
gentlemen. The first question is from Alan Devlin of Barclays. Alan, please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Alan G. Devlin

{BIO 5936254 <GO>}

Hi, guys. Two questions, if I can. First of all, I wonder if you could talk about the economics
of the internal transfer, where French life did one last year of £2 billion. They set it at a £10
million annuity to the cash going forward. Is that a good guide to you guys? I mean just on
the corporate pension business, you said you're on track to halve down your loss, and
you've got that £10 billion of AUM, which in the past you said is one of the numbers to get
towards scale. What's the impact on the new business strain of getting to -- of reducing
that loss? Is that one of the drivers that will reduce new business strain this quarter? And
then finally, just on LGIM, what's the margins on the overlay business versus the rest of the
portfolio, or the economics of the overlay business versus the rest of the portfolio?
If your -- you've a net outflows of £7 billion on the bulk of the business, but if you include
the overlay you've actually had net inflows year-to-date. Is the £476 billion the driver of
earnings in that business or the £676 billion including the overlay assets in GIA? Thanks.

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay thanks, Alan. I'll pick up the first one on the internal transfer annuity business; John
can comment on the corporate pensions' scale point; and Mark pick up on the LGIM
margin point. Just on the internal transfer of the £2 billion of annuities out of our withprofit fund into our shareholder fund, clearly we haven't disclosed the exact breakdown of
that, Alan. What I will say, we used pretty much the same pricing measures we use for all
our external bulk purchase, bulk annuity transactions.
So there's no kind of special element to the with-profit transfer; it was pretty much an
open book exercise. Both partners had their own advisors so it was done on an arm's
length basis and therefore the economics will be similar to what you would expect from
other externally sourced bulk transactions. Like I said, we haven't actually disclosed
uniquely to-date.

FINAL

So Alan, yes, having losses, we are still on track. I think what we previously guided is low
double digit billions rather than £10 billion specifically. And I'm very confident that we can
continue with that guidance, low double digit (11:00) to have losses. And the strain impact
on -- from those losses is negligible. It doesn't quite work like that. It's the efficiency cost
of setting schemes up that drives the strain, rather than whether it's intrinsically profitable
or not.

A - Mark J. Zinkula

{BIO 16142450 <GO>}

In regards to LGIM and the economics of the overlay business versus the rest of the
business, the fees on the profit margins on our overlay assets would be very comparable
to the index business. That would be the closest comp. And with regards to whether to
focus on the total AUM or total assets, you should focus on the total assets. We earn fees
on £676 billion. And also focus on the composition of the assets as well. So, over the last
several years, we've diversified our business model by product, by distribution channel, by
geographic region, and that's continuing. And while doing so, investing heavily in the
business, we're still maintaining roughly 90% persistency and roughly 50% profit margins
but across a more diversified book of business.

Q - Alan G. Devlin

{BIO 5936254 <GO>}

Okay thank you.

The next question is from Oliver Steel of Deutsche Bank. Oliver, please go ahead.

Q - Oliver G. Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Good morning. Actually I wanted to follow up on that sort of LGIM question. I am assuming
that a lot of the outflows in index is linked to bulk annuities. So given your positive pipeline
on bulks, looking specifically into the fourth quarter, but also, I guess looking into next
year, how should we be thinking about index fund outflows looking through into 2015? The
second question again, linked to this is, is there any way in which we can use the inflows
into your solutions business as a sort of forward indicator of what future bulk annuities
might look like?

A - Mark J. Zinkula

{BIO 16142450 <GO>}

Okay, good questions. With regards to the first question the passive outflows are not
directly related to annuities, they would be related to de-risking strategies, although
some plans will ultimately not pursue annuities as an end game solution, they might
pursue self sufficiency or something in between frankly, a partial annuitization, what have
you. But certainly the vast majority of our passive outflows are related to de-risking
strategies which may or may not ultimately end up in some kind of annuitization.
And yeah, the growth in our LDI business would be somewhat of a leading indicator as to
the ultimate growth in the annuity market, but again not all of the LDI strategies will
ultimate result in a buyout contract. But certainly that would be the direction of travel for
much of that business.

Q - Oliver G. Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. I mean at some stage, not necessarily today, but I think it would be quite interesting
for us to sort of understand the dynamics of the shift from passive funds into de-risking
solutions, and then ultimately into bulk annuities, just so that we understand the timing
and the linkage between the flows.

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Yes, we'll pick that up, Oliver.

A - Mark J. Zinkula

It makes sense, you're thinking about it the right way though, it makes sense.

The next question is from Andrew Crean of Autonomous. Andrew, please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. Three questions, if I might. Firstly, given the very strong performance in
the annuity sales, including the internal transfer, I'm slightly surprised that you haven't
moved up your cash forecasts for LGR since the beginning of the year. I wonder whether
there's something which lies behind that or that's just innate conservatism.
Secondly, I wanted to ask, on LGIM, whether you felt that the business had any
opportunity from the debacle at PIMCO in terms of active or passive fixed interest. And
then thirdly, I wanted to ask, on the bulks, does the company believe that it's got all the
skill sets it needs in terms of longevity, IP in-house, or does it think it needs to have a
better understanding of impaired lives?

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Great. Thanks Andrew, I'll pick up the first one on the impact on op cash, Mark will pick up
any thoughts on PIMCO and Kerrigan can pick up on longevity skills, in particular. So on the
op cash guidance and the impact of current year volumes, Andrew, we very much set the
op cash based on the opening balance sheet for each year, so any impact of new
business in that year, with only impact on new business strain or surface number, Andrew.
That will come through net cash rather than operating cash in the guidance we've given,
the op cash level.
So you would never expect any new business in the current year to affect the op cash
guidance, so it's a pretty stable number for the year in question. It will then impact the
opening balance sheet before the new year, so you will get an operational cash benefit
down the track. But in the year, you're right, the only impact coming through is on the new
business strain/surplus line --

Which affects net cash rather than op cash.

A - Mark J. Zinkula

{BIO 16142450 <GO>}

In regards to the situation at PIMCO, it could be an opportunity for us certainly in the
Institutional space. So there's been a lot in the news about outflows from the retail funds.
Institutional investors, on average, will take a bit more time to assess the situation. But
certainly, especially related to our U.S. fixed income business, and to some extent LDI
business, could present an opportunity over the next few quarters, to potentially gather
some assets off the back of this news.

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On the bulks, on the IP, we think the longevity expertise that we have is significant IP for
us. Just to give you some brief idea of the scale, we have a research team of 27 people
based in Kingswood, looking across the data we've collected over 27 years of bulks and
individuals. We also have skill sets from data and skill sets in U.S., Netherlands, Canada
and also on the individual sides, in particular things like comorbidities is a hot topic of
research and data build up in that area, which will be an important thing for enhanced or
underwritten annuities going forward. So we see that as a significant skill set for, and not
especially looking, and we're never complacent, hopefully, but not especially looking to, or
think we need to complement that.

The next question is from Andy Hughes of Exane BNP Paribas. Andy, please go ahead.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Hi guys. A few questions, if I could. The first one, on Lucida, I think you said at the half year
you'd distributed all the acquisition proceeds out of Lucida, plus the incremental capital
requirements. And I read something that said that Lucida, on an internal capital model,
was actually falling short of the Solvency II -- sorry, on a standard model, was falling short
of the standard model. So are you basically running the business currently with a massive
difference for the annuities versus the kind of standard model? And how big is that gap
versus your feeling as to where the cash flow should be versus where it would be on a
standard model?

Page 7 of 17

FINAL

And the second question was about the Prudential Financial annuity reinsurance. Is there a
cost for that? And how big should we think of that? And a third question was on the -again, on the annuities, I'm afraid. I'm a bit confused because, obviously, spreads have
narrowed quite considerably in the credit markets, and that would normally mean -- as you
say, you have a very disciplined approach to writing protection -- shouldn't that mean you
also have a very disciplined approach to writing annuities, and as you're making a lower
margin, pull back from the bulk annuity market as well? Thank you.

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay, thanks, Andy. I'll pick up the first question on Lucida and the read across to Solvency
II. I guess, Kerrigan, if you can pick up the reinsurance point and the impact of spreads on
bulk pricing and margins.

Bloomberg Transcript

Just on the impact of, I guess, Solvency II, in the round, standard model versus internal
model, Andy, clearly, at this stage, we're still -- as I keep saying, we're still working through
with the regulator exactly the outcome in terms of internal model. Now our application
doesn't go in 'til next April. I think it's fair to say, as you probably would expect, that we
would hope that our internal model gives a better treatment, a more favorable treatment,
capital-wise than the standard formula. But in terms of the quantum of that difference, I'm
not going to comment on that on the basis that we don't yet know exactly what -- the
quantum in our internal model.
So I think it's fair to say, we'd not be bothered trying to get internal models approved
unless it was beneficial to do so. And clearly, from our perspective, annuities is a big risk
area, both for credit and for longevity and therefore it's a key component of that. But
much more color than that I think would just be unhelpful at this stage.

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

On the Prudential Financial annuity reinsurance, I mean, they join a roster now of six
reinsurers that we use lives to, at the right time, select which risks we keep and which risks
to pass on to reinsurers. So I just view that as a continuing part of the sensible
management of longevity risk on the balance sheet, probably nothing more than that.
On your point about spreads narrowing, I mean, in terms of our pricing basis and how we
select deals, we really work on a return on economical capital basis. And when things
meet our internal hurdle rate on that, we look to proceed with deals; and when they
don't, we stand aside. So, that's really how we think about the economics of the deals.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

And then, has the return on economic capital come down?

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

I am sorry, Andy, I didn't catch that.

The next question is from Jon Hocking of Morgan Stanley. Jon, Please go ahead.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning everybody. I've got two questions, please. On the asset management
side, if you look back at one of the tables you've got some nine-month flows tracking over
the last three years, is it fair to say the international business is slowing in terms of
inflows? Or is that just phasing of mandates? And how is the pipeline looking now? That's
the first question. And second question, just on Legal & General Capital, the principal
balance sheet, the £4.6 billion, is all of that in shareholders' funds? Or is some of that in
assets backing annuity technical liabilities (21:49)? Thank you.

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Mark, can you pick up the first one, and Paul pick up the second one?

A - Mark J. Zinkula

{BIO 16142450 <GO>}

In regards to the LGIM international flows, it is still relatively early days in building out our
international business, as you know, so the flows will be fairly volatile. The U.S. continues to
see increasing flows in its fixed income and LDI strategies, and I'd expect that trend to
continue. Where we've struggled a bit the last few quarters has been in – with, in our
international passive business, which is related to additions or new mandates from
sovereign wealth fund clients, which again they're much lower margin, lower fee, and our
active strategies are LDI strategies. But we expect that business to perform better over
the coming years than it has over the past several quarters.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.

A - Paul Stanworth

{BIO 15495409 <GO>}

Yeah, in terms of the £4.6 billion of assets that we've got, they effectively represent the
shareholder components of various legal entities that we have in the group, but they do
Page 9 of 17

not back any liabilities.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay, thank you. And then the £15 billion aspiration for -- as mentioned somewhere else,
presumably, that is partly backing annuities?

A - Paul Stanworth

{BIO 15495409 <GO>}

It would be covering all of the parts of the balance sheet. So it would be annuities, it
would represent the £4.7 billion that we just talked about. We had some going in our U.S.
business in LGA, and we held some of that with-profits fund as well.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

The next question is from Gordon Aitken of RBC. Gordon, please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Good morning. I have three questions on bulks, please. First, on solvency of the pension
schemes, can you just talk about what the typical solvency of a pension scheme you'd
take on is? And I'm presuming it's all buy-ins these days. And has the big reduction in
solvency in October had an impact on demand? First thing. Secondly, back to the
reinsurance transaction, the £1.35 billion with Pru Financial. You're obviously bullish on bulks
and the pipeline in Q4. Would you look to – do you need to or would you look to offer
more longevity risk when you do those deals? And just can you talk a bit about margins on
bulks, please, that you've seen in the third quarter, and also (24:08) now? Thanks.

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Cheers, Gordon. I think it's all for you, Kerrigan, those three.

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

Great, yes. Solvency of pension schemes, at the point people buy in or buy out of these
pensions, if it's buy in, typically you're right there. It will be -- typically involve the trust
assets plus some typically reasonably small contribution from the company to complete
the buy-in premium. And clearly those pension schemes are pretty close to fully-funded
typically to go through that transaction. Your point about reduction in funding levels or
fund expenses in October, I mean the way I think about market volatility is more that it
increases the dispersion of funding levels.
So, those people furthest away from de-risking probably have more in equities and they
might exhibit a larger fall in funding level, but those are the ones who are closest to buyout anyway. Those ones that have gone down a derisking route, LDI strategy, kind of
clearly demonstrated they're on that path of de-risking, their funded status or funding
Page 10 of 17

FINAL

level tends to be pretty stable. And stable funding levels, that's the purpose of LDI, and
the likelihood of eventually over this year, next year, in the next decade, heading towards
buy-out. So it increases disparity. So it doesn't necessarily increase the demand from
those people that are likely to look at buy-out.
Back to the point about the Prudential reinsurance strategy, as I said, the Prudential
Financial, they announced, we have arrangements with a wide range of reinsurers. Back to
the point, just sensible risk management, I wouldn't necessarily read anything into that,
other than we choose which risk we keep and which to pass on when the price is right.
And that's what we have to -- that's what we choose to do really.
Margins in Q3, you saw our margins figures at half year. (26:18) that's, I think, the sensible
starting point for future bulks.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Could I just follow up on that reinsurance? I mean The Pru Financial, the margin they are
making versus the margin that you originally made on the bulk business, are you making -what sort of spread are you making on that sort of deal?

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean, we will -- will give you the actual margins figures when we get the whole year
figures, you'll get the full detail then in those figures. But as I said, the margin figures we
showed at the half year, then take that as a half year guidance, essentially a starting point
for future reference.

The next question is from Ashik Musaddi of JPMorgan. Ashik please go ahead.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah, hi. Good morning everyone. So just a couple of questions. First of all, your annuities
volumes are kind of, I mean the total assets is kind of up 20%, give or take, year-on-year,
by the end of the year it will be around that. So is it a fair thing to assume that your gross
capital generation from LGR will also be more or less similar, 20% up? If not, what's the
missing link there? That's the first one.
Secondly, there is some news around that you have recently cut the pricing for the index
funds. So is that material? Or does that change anything in terms of earnings from LGIM,
et cetera.? And thirdly is, can you just explain a bit more on this efficiency concept on the
new business margin and exactly where is it coming? I agree you mentioned Protection
and Savings, but where is it weighted more towards, and what are the benefits from that?
Thank you.

FINAL

Okay. I'll pick up the first one, then Mark, pick up the one about the retail index pricing
changes. John, you want to pick up the one on new business strain?
Just on the growth in annuity assets, in simple terms, no, the dominant impact is higher
volumes, so clearly we do get some diversification in Capital. Having said that annuities is
our dominant risk type. So in sense, you do not get very much. So in simple terms as
assets volumes go up, you should expect – for annuities – you should expect the capital
requirement to go up broadly in line with that.

A - Mark J. Zinkula

{BIO 16142450 <GO>}

Okay. In regards to the recent announcement about our reduction in fees on a targeted
range of our retail index unit trusts, this is -- retail represents about 5% of our index assets
and it's in a subset of those funds that we ultimately decided to reduce our pricing to be
more in line with the some of the competition in those funds. We'd expect higher volumes
as a result of the more competitive pricing to more than offset revenue loss as a result of
reductions in our fees.

On the new business margins, Ashik, essentially you should just think about strain as the
cost of establishing a policy on the books. And the more efficient you are, so for example,
in Protection 82%-odd straight through processing, the higher the volume, the higher the
unit cost, therefore the lower the strain. And the same is true in Savings; the more that
you automate the capture of customers and the premiums and the money, the less cost
you have in establishing those policies. So, the more efficient you are, the lower, in effect,
the strain. There are capital effects as well, but principally that's how you should think
about it.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

I mean, just a follow up on that new business strain question, is it possible to start seeing
a positive new business strain item for both Protection and Savings as well? Or is it too
early for that to happen at the moment, given the scale?

A - John B. Pollock

{BIO 6037447 <GO>}

I don't think you should be thinking about savings ever generating positive strain. It's a
much more simple, straightforward, cash-in-expenses-out type business. And, therefore,
it's unlikely, except potentially at very, very high premium levels, you might see an effect
there. But it's more about the reserves that get established, as well as the cost to get
established on insurance businesses. So, it's possible and the higher efficiency you are in
the risk businesses, the higher the strain can be. The Savings, that's much, much less likely
to evolve in that direction.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, very clear.

The next question is from Greig Paterson of KBW. Greig, please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

Morning, gentlemen. I'll lead with the traditional three questions. The one is, I'm just
thinking about the budget you do have to the Capital, or free surplus budget that you do
have to write annuities. I wonder if you could give us an idea of how much the £8 billion
you're writing this year will cost on your -- assuming in order to keep your AA credit rating.
And how would that compare to the sort of stock of free surplus you have on a AA basis,
so we can get a sort of feel for what the budget is?
And the second thing is, the U.S., you made these comments about slowing sales and
then potentially returning capital through higher remittances. I wonder if you could talk
about the strain there, the back-book release, et cetera, so we can have an idea what the
potential is.
And then the third question, CALA, you made the comment it made £27 million, it was a
record amount, it was on circa £300 million of turnover, and you want that to get up to
£800 million. I was wondering, A, where does that fit in in the various lines of net capital
generation? And what would be the kicker if you did achieve that £800 million turnover in
2016, just for modeling? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay, thanks Greig. I guess I'll pick the first couple and Paul will have a go at the CALA
question at the end.
In terms of capital budgets and our stock and impact of free surplus of writing more
annuity volume and protecting the AA credit rating, clearly, it is a balancing act, in the
round, Greig. You'll clearly recognize that no balance sheet can write infinite amounts of
business. This is capital usage -- used in business. We will update on IGD and economic
capital use at the year end. We haven't done that at the Q3 point, as we don't do at Q1
and Q3. We'll clearly update on the capital balance sheet position at year-end. Although I
will say this, we're never entirely comfortable with the level of business that we're writing
this year. Again, we will update and give a bit more color on the prospects going forward,
and the capital implications of that, at the prelims in March.
In terms of LGA, it's going to be just like (33:22) at the half year that we had adjusted our
pricing in Q2 this year, and we did expect that to have some impact on volumes, and it's
getting -- some of that has come through. As I said in my overarching speech at the start
of the call today, volumes were down about $4 million AP in the quarter in isolation.
In the round, this is a term insurance business, we're just keen to make sure that we get
the right risk-adjusted return for the capital that we put at risk in writing business in
America. Again, it's a business we know very well. We've been in that marketplace for a
long time. So, I would describe the price changes as more of a tweak, rather than a
Page 13 of 17

wholesale change, hence the impact on volumes has been reasonably muted. But again,
we are very keen to make sure that business generates good value for the Group and for
shareholders in the longer term.

FINAL

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

Sorry to interrupt, just on a request, you don't ultimately have to hold IGA or the minimum
economic capital; you have to hold a higher number, because the regulator requires a
higher number, and you have a superior credit rating. I wonder, it would be a bit more
useful to actually see the free surplus movement on a AA level than – because it's more
realistic, just going forwards, just as a disclosure.

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Yes, we'll think about that for year end, Greig. Clearly, exactly what constitutes AA, frankly,
is in the eye of the rating agencies, ultimately. But we'll try and give a bit of color around -clearly, the ranging we gave is £175 billion to £225 billion (35:00). Clearly, it's a clue as to
where we think the right level of capital is for the organization. But that wouldn't
necessarily be exactly how Moody's and S&P, in particular, think about AA. But clearly, the
two things are not that far apart, because that's our preferred range and we are a AA
rated business. So you can read into that what you will. But just we're in broadly the same
place, but we'll give some thought to it, Greig.

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. And then just CALA?

A - Paul Stanworth

{BIO 15495409 <GO>}

Yes, thanks Greig. The way that we account for CALA on the accounts is that we accrue
their net sales in terms of an addition over cost, because they're not declaring dividends.
And so we own 47% of CALA, and they made £27 million as you say, just under £300
million of revenues.
And we would expect the margins to be the same as they build up to their target plan of
£800 million. And it would come through our accounts as a continued accrual of those net
sales, as opposed to a private equity type approach where they might re-mark the value
of the asset according to current multiples.

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

(36:02) your sort of artificial net capital generation stat, will it make that?

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Yes, we have an assumed return in the cash number, Greig, and any variance against that
goes through the investment variance line.

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

All right, so it'll contribute to the LTIR percentage?

Next question is from Ravi Tanna of Goldman Sachs. Ravi, please go ahead.

Q - Ravi Tanna

{BIO 16926941 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Just three questions, please. And the first one is on the with-profits
annuity transfer. I'm just trying to understand to what extent we can see this as a one-off,
or whether there's a great deal more of this type of business to come in future and
specifically whether the £8 billion annuity guidance for this year has any more of that type
of business earmarked within it?

Bloomberg Transcript

The second question is on the UK protection market. You talked about maintaining your
pricing discipline. I was just hoping you could speak a little bit more about the conditions in
the protection space and specifically any differences between the retail versus group
markets. And thirdly, and finally, on the UK platform sales appear, and flows appear, very
strong. I was just hoping for a quick update if it's possible on the direct-to-customer plans
for the platform and then how they're progressing. Thanks.

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Thanks Ravi. So Kerrigan, will you pick up the (37:25) please? We'll come around to
whether the with-profit thing is a one-off. John, pick up points two and three?

A - Paul Stanworth

{BIO 15495409 <GO>}

That's a simple question -- simple answer, that it is a one-off so was that was the general
transfer from with-profit to shareholders.

A - John B. Pollock

{BIO 6037447 <GO>}

Yeah, hi Ravi. The Protection market -- I think you asked about the differences between
retail and group. Retail at the minute is pretty much operating as it always has with
appetite being expressed by competitors in a kind of on/off sort of way. We've been very
consistent. Of course our broad reach of distribution puts pricing discipline slightly less up
our agenda than it would be for others because we are not in the same state of reliance
on a broker market, a fee (38:20) market as many others are.
But we observe what people are doing and by and large the retail market has been
relatively quiet of late. The group market, however, has seen a bit more competition
emerging. We are very happy with our pricing point and tend to select the schemes on

the basis of our risk appetite. We've been in that market for a very long time and have
built quite a lot of data on not just sectoral, but scheme specific characteristics that allow
us to select. And if large schemes come to market, you can see quite sharp swings. And
we have seen a growing appetite in that space from some of our competitors, but we've
been doing this for a long time and we're very, very comfortable with the position that we
occupy in both of those markets.
You also asked about a platform growing and our progress on D-to-C. We are in the last
stages of the initial technology development on core functionality in that space and it's
already in soft testing internally with some of our own staff, me included, as it happens.
And I quite like it.
There's quite a long way to go in D-to-C and I think, I worry a little bit about the translation
of that language into people always thinking about it as outbound marketing, whereas
what I think about is enabled engaged customer self-service capability and that's what we
will be delivering. It's what we expect to deploy into our partnerships earliest.
But you will see a capability merge during the course of Q1 as I think our technology, I'm
pretty sure, will be delivered robustly during the tail end of Q4.

The next question is from Andrew Sinclair of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew,
please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Thank you very much and good morning. Three questions, please. Firstly, on LGIM,
investment performance was extremely strong in the quarter, particularly in the Solutions
business. I just wondered if you could give us an update on that performance, and maybe
tell us a bit more about what the key sensitivities are for this business. And secondly, just
looking on the Workplace businesses, again, I just wondered if you could give us an
update on how the market's looking for tenders and re-tenders at the moment. Are you
seeing existing schemes coming back to the market?
And finally, just following up on Ravi's point on platforms, just wonder if you could give us
an update on Cofunds, and if you've seen any material change in flows, particularly since
Intrinsic was picked up by Old Mutual. Thanks.

A - Mark J. Zinkula

{BIO 16142450 <GO>}

In regards to your first question, so within the Solutions business, we include our multiasset business as well as our LDI business. Our multi-asset fund performance has been
very strong year-to-date. We're seeing increasing momentum in sales there.

Page 16 of 17



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C

In regards to the market performance, if you will, the -- a lot of our collateral assets within
our LDI portfolios are relatively long duration. And you saw a rally in that part of the curve
in particular during the third quarter, which is driving the higher market values in that part
of the business.

FINAL

A - Paul Stanworth

{BIO 15495409 <GO>}

On Workplace and the market, that's quite a difficult question to answer, to give any kind
of clear steer. There is activity in the second market, where schemes are -- particularly at
the larger end, where they are reviewing their providers and we are keen to get those
asset transfers. We have an incredibly powerful proposition that's doing the right thing for
pension savers with our 50:50 guarantee. And I would hope that as a consequence of
those re-tenders that we would be a winner.
But it's hard to say that it's actually happening yet. Remember, it's fairly early days in autoenrolment. And I think scheme trustees and scheme managers will be considering their
position fairly carefully. But I do expect it to be a market that emerges and I do expect us
to be a winner in it. As far as the flows impact from Intrinsic changes, nothing really to say
on that. No noticeable effect. Not a huge account for us anyway, so I don't anticipate that
being materially impactful.

Q - Andrew J. Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

That's great. Thank you very much.
