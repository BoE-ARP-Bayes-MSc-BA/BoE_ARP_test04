then I will come back at the end of the session to take some questions.
Let me first introduce some of our members of our executive team that are in Cape
Town, we've got Wikus, whom I have introduced already. Mr.Heinie Werth, the CEO of

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and a warm welcome to the 2020 interim results
presentation. I'm joined in the Cape Town studio by Wikus Olivier, our acting Chief
Financial Officer, and Heinie Werth, the Chief Executive Officer of Sanlam Emerging

Markets. On line, we have Anton Gildenhuys, our Chief Actuary and Chief Risk Officer as
well as other members of our Executive Committee.
I will begin by giving a very brief strategic overview and cover the context for the period in
which these half year results were produced, before handing over to Wikus, who will take
you through the detailed financial results. I will then talk about some of the priorities that
we have in the business and the outlook for the balance of the year before opening up to
questions.
The management team together with the board went through an extensive strategic
review recently and the board has approved a new group strategy during August. We aim
to become an African champion, strengthen our position outside South Africa, and our
vision is to be the most admired financial services player in Africa. Our strategy, which is
designed to achieve our vision is built on two legs. The first is becoming an African
champion, and the second is strengthening our position outside Africa selectively.
In order to become an African champion, we will build a fortress position in South Africa, in
partnership with Ubuntu-Botho and African Rainbow Capital. And we will secondly
accelerate growth outside South Africa on the African Continent on a strengthened base
of our business in the continent.

Bloomberg Transcript

Outside Africa, we have an excellent business in India, in which we've been invested for 16
years and we aim to do more to build the insurance operations as a key part of the
Shriram ecosystem. Execution of our strategy will be enabled by data and digital
transformation, culture development within the organization, innovation and partnerships.
We continue to organize ourselves within business clusters, but we've split the South
African Retail business formerly known as SPF, or Sanlam Personal Finance, into two
clusters focused on two different client segments. And we've given the overall control of
our South African Retail and corporate clusters to a new life and savings head in order to
drive integrated customer propositions for our customers, to get cross-sell going
between the different product houses, and to create some operating efficiency.
In South Africa, in order to build a fortress position, we are going to continue to grow our
client base, but more particularly we aim to deepen the customer relationships that we
have with a view to reducing acquisition costs over time and to improving customer
loyalty, which obviously in the life business comes through as persistency, and then
focusing on transforming our operating efficiency.
In Africa, excluding South Africa, we will continue to drive improvement within our existing
operations, and we will also, from time to time bolt-on acquisitions to further strengthen
existing operations in market. Outside Africa, in India, in particular, we aim to grow our
insurance business.
In order to support our new strategic direction, we've announced some changes to our
group executive committee, this will enable us to focus efficiently on the different line

FINAL

segments within South Africa to drive better client propositions and to drive digital and
cultural transformation across the group.
I joined Sanlam on the 1st of July and I have to say I'm extremely proud to stand and
merely represent the efforts of all of my colleagues. Against one of the most difficult
backdrops in the group's history Sanlam has delivered a solid set of financial results for
shareholders, while providing over ZAR2 billion of relief to customers participating in a
joint effort with the Motsepe family to provide ZAR1 billion of direct COVID relief to
communities and establishing the investor legacy funds which we seeded with ZAR2.25
billion to assist small and medium businesses in South Africa to recover from the COVID
crisis.
We've also delivered a considerable amount of support into different African economies
and communities. In 2018, Sanlam completed a transaction with Ubuntu-Botho, under
which a ZAR2 billion facility was established to fund the investment by Ubuntu-Botho and
African Rainbow Capital into selected financial services enterprises.
I'm pleased that we have completed recently an agreement in terms of which African
Rainbow Capital will acquire 25% of Sanlam investments' third-party business, thereby
creating the largest black-owned asset manager in South Africa.

Bloomberg Transcript

Completion of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals. But completion of this
transaction will mean that only ZAR175 million of the original ZAR2 billion facility which
expires in December 2020, remains unutilized at this stage.
New business growth during this half year was strong despite various lockdown
conditions, but it was indeed adversely affected by the various lockdowns, especially in
our Retail Mass segment in South Africa. After a dramatic initial fall off in March, we've
seen a gradual recovery in new business as we've accelerated the digital enablement of
our intermediaries, our partnership in Capitec and our direct distribution channels have
helped to offset some of the impacts on our intermediated channels from all the
lockdown conditions.
The hard work done by the Sanlam Emerging Markets management team has borne fruit.
And the Saham underwriting performance recovered to 7.6% for the half year to fall slapbang in the middle of our target range for the half year. The Saham business is an
excellent asset. And with the various initiatives being driven by Heinie Werth and his
management team, I fully expect this asset to deliver excellent growth and returns over
time.
Despite the very difficult operating conditions that we experienced in this first half, we
saw continued positive experience variances. We've used data analytics to manage
persistency experience in our business and we've seen only a minor deterioration in
persistency and extremely strong premium collection experience. Premium relief was
provided to customers, but we have subsequently seen most of those clients to whom
this relief was extended, resuming premium payments.

FINAL

We have strengthened our lapse assumption to allow for a 5% future mass lapse
experience in the light of the weaker economic conditions that we are now experiencing
and the time period for which the tough economic conditions could continue to prevail.
However, this impact our group equity value, but has absolutely no impact on our
operating profits for the half year since our policy at Sanlam is to eliminate negative rand
reserves in the valuation of our liabilities.
Our solvency ratios have remained very strong throughout the half year, demonstrating
the strength and the resilience of the Sanlam Group. Cash earnings remains strong albeit
at a lower level than last year and our dividend policy remains intact. We have estimated
that without the direct COVID impacts during this half year, our net result from financial
services would have been 18% up on previous year against the reported decrease of 22%.
I'm extremely pleased with this result.
The difficult environment that the group has operated under since March has resulted in
several negative operating result impacts, which totaled more than a ZAR3 billion impact
when compared to the first half of 2019. These include and I'm going to list four different
areas in which we had severe impact making up that ZAR3 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

The first was credit provisions in Shriram, Lebanon and our South African Retail credit
book, totaling some ZAR690 million. Secondly, credit spreads in our corporate credit book
in South Africa as well as some defaults on domestic corporate credit amounted to
ZAR554 million, but please note that this is after allowing for some of the credit spread
mark-to-market losses going through a gate.
In the business continuity insurance provision within Santam, our after share tax -- our after
tax share of that those provisions amounted to ZAR581 million. And then finally, we had
large unrealized mark-to-market losses arising from poor investment returns on the
Saham float and this amounted to ZAR145 million.
Given the decline in the share price of Shriram, the situation in Lebanon and the
deterioration in the economic outlook for the African continent, we have impaired the
value of both the Shriram and the Saham assets by over ZAR7billion. Wikus will provide
more detail on this when he covers the financial results.
Sanlam have been invested in Shriram for 16 years, and this is an excellent company with a
good ecosystem. However, the COVID crisis severely impacted the consumer credit side
of that business, which is indeed the entry point for most customers and the source of
most insurance business written within Shriram.
As repayment holidays lift in the credit business there, we in due course expect the
business to recover and in time we will continue to invest in growing the business. I'm
pleased to say that the group responded very well operationally to the various lockdown
conditions and the turbulent market conditions experienced globally. Sanlam moved
rapidly and effectively to remote working. Our liquidity and capital strength was evident
throughout the period of turbulence and the business responded very quickly in order to
support clients and broader society.

FINAL

New business, particularly life new business through intermediated channels was severely
impacted by lockdowns. The business had to accelerate digital enablement of
intermediaries and the new business has gradually picked up post April. I'll give you some
more detail on that when I come back after Wikus.
Investment markets were initially depressed by the COVID pandemic, subsequently
recovering. Furthermore, the Indian credit businesses have seen significant share price
declines given the repayment holidays applicable to those businesses. The group results
were negatively impacted by lower fees on average asset levels, but were heavily
impacted by negative investment returns on the Saham float, which is relatively large
when compared to the gross written premium of that business, and whose portfolio has a
very heavy weighting to both the equity and property markets in Morocco.
Credit risk has played the largest part in determining this set of financial results. Credit
spreads have not recovered to nearly the same extent as the equity market and this has
impacted our operating results through the mark-to-market losses that we've had to post.
Furthermore, we've had to significantly increase retail credit provisions in both India and
South Africa as well as credit provisions in South Africa, and we have seen some
corporate defaults.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have not seen any material negative mortality or morbidity impacts at this stage and
the COVID impacts have been much more economic than health-related when it comes
to our results. Credit impacts, the business continuity provision at Santam and the
negative investment returns in Morocco are all driven by economic factors.
I will now hand over to Wikus to take you through the detailed financial results. Wikus, over
to you.

Wikus Olivier

{BIO 20074722 <GO>}

Thank you, Paul. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and a warm welcome from me as
well. As Paul already mentioned, COVID-19 has been the theme of our results in the first
half of this year, impacting on all of our key performance indicators. But through the
period, our operations and also our solvency remained resilient as I'll highlight in later
slides.
Just looking at operating and underwriting environment first from an exchange rate
perspective, we benefited from a weaker rand which had a 1% positive impact on our net
result from financial services and also increased our return on group equity value by 5%.
From an economic basis perspective, higher long-term interest rates in South Africa and
also in a number of our other markets combined with lower future investment return
assumptions in our non-life businesses had a 3% negative impact on our RoGEV for the
period and also decreased the growth in our VNB by 4%.
From an underwriting perspective, Santam did very well to achieve an underwriting margin
of 4.3% for the period, despite the more than ZAR1 billion COVID-19 provisions that I had
to allow for in their results. From SAM's perspective in the GI businesses, the underwriting

FINAL

margin improved from 5.5% to 7% in the period, which isn't a highlight for us. Weaker
investment markets with negative investment returns being earned in South Africa and
across many of our other markets unfortunately had a ZAR1.5 billion negative impact on
our EV investment variances and also reduced the return on the same GI insurance funds
from plus 14% in 2019 to just 1.7% in the first half of 2020.
Looking at the impact of COVID-19 on our results. First, on new business volumes. If I
compare the second quarter of 2020 to the first quarter, excluding Sanlam Investment
Group that was awarded a few large new mandates in the second quarter, new business
volumes was about 16% lower with the life business in particular negatively affected by
lockdowns in a number of our countries. General Insurance business and also investment
business was more resilient. The Santam lower volumes in the second quarter included in
the 7% is also the premium relief that they provided to their client base.

Bloomberg Transcript

From an operational earnings perspective, Paul already mentioned, compared to the first
half of 2019, those specific earnings components impacted by COVID-19 had an overall
ZAR3 billion negative impact on our results, of close to ZAR2 billion coming through on
the net result from financial services line and also a turnaround in the net investment
return and in our capital portfolio from more than ZAR400 million in 2019 to a negative
ZAR800 million in the first half of 2020. Included in ZAR800 million is ZAR716 million
increased expected credit loss provision that we had to make in respect of our Lebanon
exposure.
Just looking at more detail on the impact on net result from financial services, Paul
covered most of these impacts already in his introduction and I'm not going to repeat
that. Maybe just also to add within Sanlam Personal Finance, also a negative impact of
ZAR270 million with the majority of that relating to increased credit provisions in the
Sanlam personal loans book, given some deterioration in arrears in that book and also
intermediary support of some ZAR100 million that SPF provided to the intermediaries
whose income was negatively affected by the lower sales volumes in the second quarter.
I'll get into more detail on the return on group equity value in later slides, but just to
highlight that as you can see all of our businesses were negatively impacted by COVID-19
with a significant reduction in RoGEV with the overall group return declining from 5% in
2019 to minus 4 % in the first half of 2020.
Looking at some of the key performance indicators. Paul already highlighted 22% decline
in net result from financial services. But if I strip out the impact of COVID-19 that was
reflected in the previous slides, it actually increased by 18%, which is a solid result in the
first half of this year.
Similarly, net operational earnings down 39%, but excluding the impact of COVID-19 it was
actually up 17% on the first half of 2019. New business volumes, definitely the highlight for
the period up 40%, supported by strong investment business flows at Sanlam Investment
Group, SIM and also Sanlam Corporate. And also a highlight from my perspective is the
fact that the foremost Sanlam businesses in Africa in total exceeded their targets for the
period.

FINAL

From a group equity value perspective, unfortunately both actual RoGEV per share at
minus 4.6%, and also adjusted RoGEV per share that excludes market volatility at minus
0.9%, underperforming against the hurdle for the period, which was 6.4%. And I'll also get
into more detail in further slides.
Just looking at cluster contributions to the results from a net result from financial services
perspective, minus 22%, but as I mentioned up 18%, excluding COVID-19 and all of the
clusters contributing to the 18% growth, with good support from all of the major business
lines. New business volumes up 40%. And as you can see on the slide, all of the
businesses also contributing strong growth. The exception is Santam at only 1% growth in
net earned premiums, but on a gross written premium basis for the conventional
business, they increased that by 6% excluding the premium relief that they provided to
clients, which is a very good result given the current economic climate in South Africa.
From a VNB perspective, VNB down 29% and which is directly related to the lower life
business volumes in the first half of the year and also a change in mix due to lower margin
products.

Bloomberg Transcript

Return on group equity value. As I mentioned, both actual RoGEV and adjusted RoGEV
underperforming the hurdle rate by 11% and 7.3%, respectively, impacted by negative
investment variances, a strengthening in our economic and operating assumptions and
also a write-down of the Lebanon valuations to 0 given the current economic climate in
Lebanon. Lower listed share prices of Santam and also our listed credit business in India
also had a negative impact on returns for the period. That was partly offset by a positive
from foreign currency translation gains due to the weaker rand.
Just looking at the components of group equity value earnings, just highlighting a few
numbers in this slide. First, I want to highlight, the positive is the experience variances at
425%. Included in there is a negative ZAR317 million credit spread variance relating to the
Sanlam specialized finance business. If I add that back, experienced variances amounted
to close to ZAR800 million, which is an improvement on the prior year. And I think, in
current conditions, really a solid result.
Assumption changes unfortunately detracted more than ZAR2 billion from adjusted
RoGEV with a majority of that relating to the strengthening in persistency assumptions in
the life insurance book and also related strengthening in the maintenance unit cost prices.
That contributed to adjusted life earnings of ZAR2.3 billion.
On the non-life side, the adjusted RoGEV amounted to a negative ZAR2.9 billion with the
majority of that relating to negative returns coming through from lower valuations in teh
Sanlam businesses and also the Shriram Capital business in India due to the lower listed
share prices. Adjusted RoGEV amounting to a negative ZAR860 million for the six months.
Moving from adjusted RoGEV to actual RoGEV, investment variances and changes in
economic basis adding more than ZAR10 billion negative earnings for the period with
ZAR1.8 billion coming through on the life side and close to ZAR9 billion coming through on
non-line life businesses.

FINAL

ForEx and other which is a positive of ZAR5.5 billion, includes ZAR6.5 billion of exchange
rate differences which was partly offset by the write-off of goodwill relating to the FBN
acquisition in Nigeria of some ZAR700 million, contributing to a negative actual RoGEV of
ZAR6.1 billion for the period or 4.3% in nominal terms.
Looking at the solvency position, the strength of the Sanlam balance sheet was evident
throughout the COVID-19 turbulence, staying well within the target range during the sixmonth period and ending at the end of June towards the upper end of the target range.
The decline in the group solvency ratio from 211% to 187% is largely attributable to the
payment of the Sanlam dividend in the first half of the year of more than ZAR7 billion, and
then also the decline in the Sanlam life coveraged ratio from 206% to 201%.
Discretionary capital. The only major transaction that we concluded in the six months was
the acquisition of the remaining 65% stake in the Nigerian businesses for some ZAR1.3
billion, but that was fully funded through a debt issuance with no net significant impact on
discretionary capital, which ended at ZAR264 million at the end of June. This is lower than
our target ZAR2 billion to ZAR3 billion war chest that we would like to keep. But just to
note that we do have substantial funding sources available through the disposal of noncore investments. Our debt exposure is also well below that of our peer group. So we do
have the option to raise further debt.

Bloomberg Transcript

I mentioned in previous results announcement, that we will see a release of -- a significant
release of reserves under IFRS 17, all of which we would not have to maintain in the IFRS 17
environment. And of course also adding to discretion capital is any excess investment
return that we own on the Sanlam life capital portfolio.
Just moving to the cluster performance, a few highlights. Sanlam Personal Finance new
business volumes up 8% for the period, largely due to Glacier increasing its contribution
by 10% with fairly good demand for its annuities international products and also money
market funds. Sanlam Sky, down 14%. It's a combination of more than 30% decline in the
more traditional channels, which was severely impacted by the lockdown environment in
the second quarter of the first half, but with Capitec actually continuing to do well,
increasing its sales by 9%, despite Capitec also being affected through closure of
branches.
Recurring premium business down 11%. That's a net effect of very strong growth in the
direct channels, Sanlam Indie and MiWayLife in particular increasing new business by 80%
but with the traditional sales being down on last year. Savings volumes in particular
declined by 17%.
Net flows up 85%, is essentially reflective of the strong new business volumes within
Glacier. Net value of new life business down 28%, reflective of the geared impact of lower
new life business volumes and also lower volumes within Sanlam Sky, which is the more
profitable line of business within SPF.
From a net result from financial services perspective, down 12% on last year, but actually
up 6%, excluding the COVID-19 impact and also the prior year tax adjustment of ZAR70
Page 8 of 24

FINAL

million at Sanlam personal loans. We saw within the SPF business very strong growth in risk
business and also within the entry-level market which grew its contribution by more than
20%, excluding the COVID-19 support provided through to intermediaries, but this was
partly offset by a 4% decline in profit from savings products, given lower assets under
management in the period.
Sanlam Emerging Markets, stellar new business growth of 35% despite lockdowns in a
number of each countries as well, supported by large new investment mandates in
Namibia and Botswana and also a welcome improvement in Kenya, which achieved new
investment business sales of ZAR1.7 billion in the first half of the year. Very positive also
from a general insurance perspective, as I mentioned, exceeding the targets for the
period. And Sanlam increasing its general insurance premiums by 10% despite the
lockdowns and also deliberate slowdown in new business to focus on the quality of
business written.

Bloomberg Transcript

On this slide, similar impact on VNB than SPF, down 24% due to 11% decline in life new
business volumes across the businesses. But from a net result from financial services
perspective down 28%, but up 27%, excluding COVID-19, to a large extent driven by
improvement in the general insurance underwriting margin, which improved to 7%, with
Saham Finances coming in at 7.6%, as Paul already mentioned.
This slide just provides a summary of the general insurance and reinsurance result across
the main regions. And as I mentioned, increasing from 5.5% to 7%, with both Southern
Africa and North and West Africa and recording substantial increases with the Morocco
motor book benefiting from lockdown and also an absence of large catastrophe claims in
the first half of this year, apart from a few fire claims in Cte d'Ivoire. This was,
unfortunately, to a large extent offset by lower return on insurance funds declining from
14% to 1.7%. And you can see at the bottom of this slide, most of that coming through
from the Saham business which declined from 12% return in 2019 to a negative 2.8%
return in the first half of this year.
Other international, you'll also note the underwriting margin declining from 19% to some
11%, and that's largely due to a high base in India, which included a release of third-party
reserves in the first half of 2019.
Just comparing Santam and Saham margins in particular, as noted before, the Saham and
Shriram General Insurance book are exposed to longer tail lines of business compared to
Santam, so the level of float and hence also the return on float is a much more
pronounced portion of their earnings in the general insurance side. And that's reflected in
the target return on insurance funds margin which is only 2.5% for Santam, but 6% to 9%
for Saham.
Looking at the impairment of the same operations. Unfortunately due to the lower
valuations of the Saham businesses and also Shriram Capital in India, we had to raise
impairments of ZAR7.6 billion in the first half of this year, with ZAR5.8 billion of that coming
through Saham, and we provide the split for you on this slide. And you can note that the
majority of that is coming through from the Lebanon write off and also -- we've written

FINAL

also off most of the premium paid at the acquisition of Saham at ZAR2.7 billion with the
ZAR2.7 billion and also the ZAR1.9 billion impairment last year related to the COVID-19
environment.
And the Shriram Capital impairment, as I mentioned, is largely due to the lower listed
share prices. Of the ZAR7.6 billion, if you look at our detailed results, ZAR7.1 billion of that
is recognized within the same earnings base and Santam accounting for more than
ZAR400 million of that for its participation in these businesses.
Looking at Sanlam Investment Group, from a net investment business flows up 9% on last
year, which I think is a stellar performance in the current conditions supported by very
strong institutional inflows, which was partly offset by lower retail net flows. But we've also
seen a welcome turnaround in the wealth management performance.
Net result from financial services down 77%, but up 4%, excluding COVID-19, supported by
the SA Investment business that increased its profit contribution by 14% on the first half of
2019 attributable to strong performance fees, good net inflows at Sanlam Multi-Manager
and Satrix over the last year, and also a significant focus on cost control within all of the
businesses.

Bloomberg Transcript

From a Santam perspective, gross written premium increasing by 7%. If I look only at the
conventional business included in that, up 4% due to premium relief to clients. And as I
mentioned if I exclude the premium relief, gross written premium was actually up 6%
within the conventional business. Santam as mentioned despite the large CBI claims
provision that they put through coming in within the 4% to 8% target range for the period.
Sanlam Corporate had a very good first half of the year, with new business volumes up
42%, but this was largely driven by lower margin investment in life single premium
volumes with recurring premiums down 29% and life recurring premiums in particular
down 37% on the first half of last year, which is the main driver of the 65% decline in new
life business written. Net result from financial services up 39%, with a good risk claims
experience that started coming through in the second half of 2019, also persisting in the
first half of 2020.
Over to you, Paul.

Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Wikus, thank you very much indeed. I'm going to talk a little bit about the current priorities
that we have within our businesses and then about the outlook for the rest of the year
from our point of view.
Within our life and savings and asset management businesses in South Africa, our focus
will be on profitable growth. We will work in collaboration with the Ubuntu-Botho and
African Rainbow Capital to maximize the benefits of our empowerment credentials as we
work to develop improved and integrated customer propositions. We're very much
focused on deepening the relationships that we have with our customers by providing
Page 10 of 24



Company N ame: Sanlam L td
Company Ticker: SL M SJ Equity
Date: 2020-09-10

more product opportunities to our clients and to provide them in a way that makes more
sense for our customers.

FINAL

Furthermore, the digitalization of our business will be an important focus area for us and
it's going to be one of the ways in which we're going to be able to deliver a more
integrated customer proposition to the market.
Within Sanlam Emerging Markets, we have detailed plans to drive value creation. When
we get to question time, Heinie Werth is with us and it would be very useful to get his
detailed answers to any questions that you may have in this regard.
But the plans that we have include the following actions. Firstly, we are focusing very
heavily on the quality of the business that we've written, as Wikus alluded to and then on
to our claims and cost management within the business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Both Wikus and myself have spoken about the impact of negative investment returns on
the Saham float which is relatively large in proportion to gross written premium in this
business and it's invested in equity and property markets to a very significant extent. So
one of the actions we will take is to gradually rebalance this portfolio as equity and
property markets recover over time. We are maintaining a very strong focus on
operational processes, improving them and improving and tightening our controls and risk
management.
We're also focused on rationalizing the portfolio and optimizing capital usage without -within it. And then finally, we are going to continue to drive the partnerships that we have
for acquiring new business in these markets.
At the group level, we're going to have a slight shift of emphasis at Sanlam. We're going
to be focusing very heavily on the strategic delivery across the portfolio, and there's an
enhanced focus on digitalization across the group and the ongoing development of
human capital.
When we consider the outlook for balance of the year and for the medium-term, we are
the first to acknowledge that the economic and operating environment and outlook
remains extremely uncertain and challenging. It may take several years for African
economies to fully recover to pre-COVID levels, meaning that our new business volumes,
persistency, credit defaults and investment return outlooks all remain quite uncertain.
We do expect that we'll see lower rates of new business and higher lapses than during a
pre COVID period for quite a period of time. We don't know how long that is, but we are
expecting it to be for a significant period. However, the Sanlam Group intends to continue
with the strategic development of our business and the group, despite this uncertain
environment, are maintaining a very disciplined operational focus. We wouldn't normally
do this, but given the time period that we're in, we are going to try and provide some
indication of the trends that we have seen post June 30.

FINAL

So in the top left-hand corner, there's a graph of credit spreads, which you can see having
spiked up at the outset of COVID and lockdown have actually narrowed and they've
continued to narrow post the half year, June 30, but they're still well above pre-COVID
levels.
In the top right-hand corner, I've shown retail sales in South Africa. These have been
gradually improving as you can see, for our different businesses month by month, but
there's still over 20% below where we would ideally have liked to see them when we set
our original budgets.
In the bottom left-hand corner, we've got a chart that shows you life new business across
Sanlam Emerging Markets. And you can see there that it's gradually recovered after the
initial periods of lockdown which have taken different forms in different countries, to get
back to almost the same levels that they were at, at the beginning of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then in the bottom right-hand corner, we've graphed the mortality -- the death claims
and the mortality experience that we have seen. When COVID lockdown was put into
place, we did see a fall in mortality experience, and our mortality patterns have been
quite consistent with those seen in population statistics. In July and the first half of August,
we saw a big spike in mortality experience, which was quite worrying. But again, this
absolutely mirrors what we are seeing in population statistics and we've subsequently in
the back half of August and the beginning of September, we've seen a reduction as the
excess debts have effectively moved out of the pipeline.
So we see an ongoing short-term recovery, but I would caution that the medium and
longer term outlook depends very heavily on the extent of the economic recovery, how
long it takes to happen, and how it takes shape.
So we will now open the floor to questions. And Sydney is going to direct the questions in
this regard. So thanks a lot.

Thank you very much, sir. This question comes from Francois Du Toit of Ren Cap.

Q - Francois Du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

Hi, Paul, Wikus, can you hear me?

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Francois, we can hear you fine. Good morning.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Francois Du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

Excellent. Thanks very much. Good morning. First question just relates to the way you've
normalized for the COVID-19 impact. If you can maybe just take us through that very
briefly. It looks like you've also adjusted the positives. In other words, there are better
than expected claims ratios on the motor book and better-than-expected mortality
claims, certainly up to 15th of June. And is that the case? And also, how have you adjusted
for new business strain, which was also slightly lower than expected? Bottom line for me is
I'd like to find out whether the normalized level, the level adjusted for COVID-19 is a fair
level to project from for, say, 2021, if things return to normal by then.
Secondly, if you can maybe just give a sense of your -- the likely impact on cash profits
and therefore distributions because I think you said you continue to set your dividends
relative to cash, net operating profit, the impact of cash profits on things like credit
spread movements, so unrealized losses really. Would that impact your dividend decision
at the end of the year?
And then the third question relates to the Nigerian business that you bought like for
ZAR1.3 billion. Looking at the EV statement, there looks to be about a ZAR940 million
addition to life EV. Does it mean that you bought it at a premium to EV? Or is there nonlife components in that Nigerian acquisition to consider as well? Those are my three
questions, please.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

All right. Great. Sydney, I'm going to suggest you send those questions to Wikus. I'd just
say one thing before we hand to Wikus. On your first question Francois, which is the
adjustment, what you call normalizing for COVID. Of course, it's not an exact science. So
we've tried to take line items that are very directly and specifically attributable to COVID.
So things like the impact of different market levels on fees on assets, we've ignored
things like that. But I'll let Wikus answer your three questions.

A - Wikus Olivier

{BIO 20074722 <GO>}

Sorry Paul, we didn't get the questions down in Cape Town. So if you can perhaps repeat
them for us?

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Sydney, do you want to -- you want to try or you want me to do it?

A - Sydney Mbhele

{BIO 20089938 <GO>}

Okay. So the first -- so Wikus, the first question from Francois is we've normalized our -we've estimated the impact of earnings as if COVID didn't happen. So effectively the
ZAR3 billion. So Francois was trying to work out precisely what we didn't put in ER
specifically he noted that we had put in some positive impacts, for example, on the motor
book, which is in fact true. We did -- we didn't just show the negatives. We showed the
positive impacts of COVID as well. He did also ask about new business strain in that
context. And as far as I recall, we didn't adjust. So in fact, the lower new business strain
would have helped us.
Your second question Francois was on...

Q - Francois Du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Impact on -- of cash profit.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Yes, of cash. So what's happened to cash earnings? And in particular, if you take mark-tomarket losses on things like credit spreads, what impact does that have on cash earnings
with the implication of course being the impact on distributions and dividends?
And then the third question was a question relating to the acquisition in Nigeria and the
impact on embedded value which Francois, I didn't fully hear your question. So you may
need to repeat it but we'll get Wikus to explain anyway. And if he doesn't answer it
properly, just come back. So Wikus, if you wouldn't mind having a bash at those three
issues. Heinie as well, of course, can help with the Nigerian one.

A - Wikus Olivier

{BIO 20074722 <GO>}

Francois on your first question, Paul is 100% correct. The approach that we followed is to
identify those specific earnings components that were severely impacted by COVID-19
and then showing the earnings number for both 2020, but also for the 2019. Because it
wasn't in all cases, you couldn't identify whether it's 90% or 95% attributable to COVID.
So we rather than not to overstate the impact, decided to show the line items with the
comparative numbers.
And also to identify those areas like the motor book that was positively impacted by
COVID. From a NB strain perspective, yes, a lower new business volumes did result in
lower NB strain but that wasn't material from a group perspective.

FINAL

On your second question, the cash earnings, the mark-to-market losses in particular within
the Sanlam specialized finance business, what we usually do with those profits actually to
treat them also as cash earnings, sort of net cash flow from the SEM business would be
after allowing for the San Fin impact.
And then within FBN, we paid in total ZAR1.3 billion for the acquisition, of which ZAR925
million related to embedded values, and that included a number of close to ZAR700
million for goodwill that we've written off in terms of our EV methodology.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Francois, can you just confirm that we answered your question? I'm sorry that we are
becoming a post box here.

Q - Francois Du Toit

{BIO 16128719 <GO>}

No, that's perfect. That's what I thought happened in terms of Nigerian acquisition. Thank
you.

Q - Michael Christelis

{BIO 15233664 <GO>}

Thanks for the time this morning. Three questions as well, if I can. Firstly, can you talk a
little bit about your persistency change that you've made to your COVID embedded
value? I see you're aligned for a 5% mass lapse. Does that include all investment products
as well? It certainly looks like you've been a little bit more cautious on the some of your
peers. And I'm just trying to get a sense of is it across the board? So it's all investment
and life products? And to what extent -- maybe if you can just give us an idea of what your
base case for GDP growth and macro deterioration for this year?

FINAL

The second question relates to SAHAM and the underwriting results there. Now you've
mentioned a pleasing underwriting result there in the midpoint of the target range. But
given that, that book is mostly motor, particularly third-party motor in Morocco and Ivory
coast. I mean, I wonder if you can give us a Sense of what you think the attritional loss
ratio is excluding the impact of lockdown. Because clearly COVID had a very positive
impact on motor across the globe. I just want to understand how much of this recovery do
you think is a result of your management action versus COVID related?
And then lastly you mentioned right at the beginning that part of your strategic review
that outside of Africa you've got that fantastic Indian operations and I don't disagree, but
you made on mention of the Malaysian operations where we've seen very disappointing
earnings over the last few years both in the life and non-life space. Can you maybe talk a
little bit about what your thoughts are around the future of those businesses within the
group? Thank you.

A - Sydney Mbhele

{BIO 20089938 <GO>}

Good. Should we maybe start with the last question. Heinie there's a question around the
Malaysian business. Can you give us a sense in terms of what the future holds for that
business. We've touched on other regions or areas of our footprint. What sort of sense
do you give behind that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Heinie Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

Thank you, Sydney. I'll start on Malaysia, Michael, our focus as Paul have said, is India going
forward. In the meantime, we are running Malaysia as best as possible. And I have to say
since we appointed Prasheem Seebran as CEO of our Malaysian business, things have
really gone better over the last year. Even if we look through the cycle now of COVID,
actually they still succeeded to achieve growth in various areas.
So we are quite comfortable with the progress. But as part of our holistic group strategy,
it remains to be decided on the future of some assets outside Africa. I don't I know, Paul, I
can also take the question on Saham, the underwriting margin and...

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Yes, I think it's -- yes, you take that as well Heinie. I think it's worth pointing out the
lockdown was very different in different places. So would not have been an identical
impact in Morocco and Ivory Coast to South Africa for example. But you answer that
(pretty good).

A - Heinie Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

Yes. Michael, if you look for the results, there were -- Wikus have shown, you will also
know that lots of our profits go through what we call Southern Africa, given the
reinsurance that we do through Saham via our Mauritius entity. It's very difficult to exactly
split the two. And I have to say Morocco was one of the most severe lockdowns. I mean
even this week, Casablanca is in lockdown again post-holiday season. And yes, we had
different impacts in different markets. When you look at SAHAM, you should also

FINAL

understand that motor is big but in the whole portfolio, if you split between the different - the five core lines, all of them are between 20% and 30%. So motor is just one.
What we have tried to do is to sufficiently allow in our June results -- also we didn't take all
the benefit of lower claims. So we've tried to be prudent as well in keeping reserving for
the second half of the year. So it was not the case lower claims show a good underwriting
margin. But you see there is really the effort of all lines of business, including motor, and
allowing, I want to say, for some conservatism in our reserves also for the second half of
the year and not taking the full benefit of the underwriting cycle on motor.

A - Sydney Mbhele

{BIO 20089938 <GO>}

And then, thank you very much, Heinie. We've -- we are going to come back to the first
question, Paul, on persistency.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So Michael, if we -- I'm probably going to hand over to Anton in a minute to check that I'm
A correct; and B, to give you a more technically correct answer. But when we considered
the impact of persistency, and you'll recall, we had to do this not yesterday, but some
weeks ago, if not months ago, we had to make these decisions. We're looking forward
into extremely tricky funnel of dart. And we at best, are making educated guesses as to
future persistency and future economic recovery.
And even as we sit here today, our base case on economic recovery is no different to the
consensus of economists and ther's probably quite a widespread in there of how people
see things recovering.
I mean I think I've said in -- when I was talking earlier that we see quite a long period of
time in order to get back to where we were beforehand. So when we looked at the
situation, we felt it would be prudent to make the assumption that all of our business
which is in the life wrapper, that we could allow for a 5% mass lapse. Now we could have
tried to finesse this with all kinds of clever assumptions that would mimic an assumed
pattern of recovery in the economy.
But honestly, that would just be applying, science far beyond what we were able to really
forecast. So we've made a, if you like quite a simplistic and perhaps prudent assumption
but it's a simple assumption for us to make. And I think given how long and deep this
recovery is probably going to be to unfold I don't think it's an unreasonable assumption.
But Anton, you might want to add a little bit more color. Maybe I'm being unfair to the
science that you applied.

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

Thanks, Paul. Good morning, Michael. No, I actually fully agree with your view on being
spurious in terms of modeling this kind of thing. So a narrow model adjustment is the
approach that we've taken. Basically we've simply gone through the entire COVID
business book. And everything that can lapse, we've allowed for a lapse, whether it's a
savings product, a risk product, an umbrella scheme, a group risk and so on. The only

product I didn't allow the labs with of course retirement annuities. There we've allowed
for paid-ups and then guaranteed annuities. So those products can't lapse. So those
we've kept in force.
I think it's also important just to mention that the reduction in units also had a secondorder impact on our maintenance expense assumption in some businesses, not all of
them. Because of good cost control, some businesses didn't have to adjust for that as
well. So you can see another ZAR250 million assumption change on the expense line as
well, but that is purely driven by this managed laspe scenario.

Q - Michael Christelis

Awesome. Thanks very much, guys.

Great. Thank you. Thank you, Anton. Thank you, Paul. Let's see, if we still have any other
question on the line.

Operator
Yes, sir. We have the next question which comes from Warwick Bam of Avior Capital
Markets.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Warwick Bam

{BIO 19921967 <GO>}

Hi, everyone. Thank you very much for the time, four short questions from my side. Just
the first on your Sanlam personal finance. New business growth relative to pre-COVID
levels and thank you for the post year-end information. But when do you expect sales
volumes to return to pre-COVID levels? On average your graph is showing that you're
around 75% or so of your budgeted, new business sales volumes. So give us a sense of
your outlook and timing with regards to recovery in sales? Sorry, I'll carry on with my
questions. And then the corporate credit portfolio, just give us some thoughts on why
you're comfortable with your provision for defaults and what that portfolio looks like that
would be useful.
And then the Lebanon business you've written it to zero. Is it considered a going concern?
And are you able to completely ring-fence the potential losses in that business? Thank
you.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Okay. So I'm getting old. Just remind me what the first question is on?

A - Sydney Mbhele

{BIO 20089938 <GO>}

The first one is no personal finance and...

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}
Page 18 of 24



Company N ame: Sanlam L td
Company Ticker: SL M SJ Equity

And our new business...

A - Sydney Mbhele

{BIO 20089938 <GO>}

FINAL

When do we come back to pre-COVID...

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Yes, when do we get back. So Warwick, my view is that premium sales generally, if we had
to have a mental model would be in line with GDP growth. So the question then becomes
when do we think GDP will get back to pre-COVID levels in order for new business
volumes to get back to pre-COVID levels. And that's extremely difficult to call. If one
assumes that the economy today is may be running 10% below its capacity before we
came in and here I'm talking purely about South Africa because you confined your
question to South Africa. And if you think of normal economic growth rates, I think you can
assume that it would take quite a few years to get back.
Now obviously, what I wish for would be something much faster than that. But if we are
realistic it could take several years to see those volumes get back. Obviously, if they get
back sooner that's going to be great. But we will certainly be working on the assumption
that it's going to take -- it's going to be a long period of recovery as I've alluded to. So it
could take two or three maybe even four years to get back I really pray I'm wrong, but
that may not be the case.

Bloomberg Transcript

And the second question was about...

A - Sydney Mbhele

{BIO 20089938 <GO>}

The second one is corporate credit provision for default?

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Well, so the way we deal with this is that we go through every single asset that we have.
We look at the situation pertaining to that asset. And we make suitable provisions in
exactly the same way that we would do in a banking operation. So we think that the credit
provisions that we've put in place in each and every asset are adequate. But again, it's -- if
we saw a real setback in the economy, there could be some downside on that. But we
fully provided on each and every asset at an individual level. I'm sorry, Sydney, just remind
me of the...

A - Sydney Mbhele

The business to zero. Is it still a going concern?

FINAL

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

So the business is still a going concern. And you asked whether we were ring-fenced in
terms of our liabilities. So Heinie will be able to perhaps add a little bit more detail or
Wikus. But we do expect to pick up some claims. We do have reinsurance, so -- but we do
expect to pay some claims as a result of the explosion in Lebanon. And obviously we
could in theory, walk completely away from the business. There may be some reputational
issues to that. But we've written it down because, practically, I think that, that is a sensible
thing to do.
However, I think, hopefully in time, the economy will recover, and the business is definitely
a going concern. So in a sense, there is only upside there, not down side. I don't know,
Heinie, if you want to add anything to that.

A - Heinie Werth

{BIO 7529974 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, Paul, I think you've answered it very well. We've got a great management team in
Lebanon. And the industry is obviously working very closely with the regulator. And until all
the debt restructuring in terms of the soveregin crisis are resolved, the business is a
going concern. It's operating day-to-day. The Beirut explosion which was devastating
cause some further issues. But again as Paul says, we're -- there is very solid reinsurance
in place.
There's obviously claims in Lebanon in Saham Re and the rest of the group, but it's ringfenced within our risk appetite. And yes in the end, we will back -- there's no obligation to
back the company. But as Paul says that is a decision the group takes, but we are more
comfortable that things will really pick up or improve.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Thank you. Can I just ask Anton, do you need to add anything to my answer on the
corporate credit, because you were very close to it?

A - Anton Gildenhuys

{BIO 4058523 <GO>}

Thanks, Paul. There's basically two additional things I'd like to mention. The one is over
and above the specific one-time provisions that Paul alluded to, we also have a portfolio
provision on top of that to strengthen the total quality of valuation even further. So I'm
also comfortable that the provision in total should be adequate.
The second important point, I think, is that we've got a very well diversified portfolio. As
we've told you before, we've pulled up this portfolio using economic capital as a main
direction or as a main parameter to determine the size of the different exposures to the
different assets.
So we are diversified in terms of counter-parties, industries and so on. So that would also
provide us with some resilience in terms of the downturn, because it impacts different

No more questions on the line. I do have a few that have come through from the webcast.
Let me take the first one. What are the reasons for the reduction in the shareholders'
funds net asset value in H1 2020? And is it Wikus or you, Paul?

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

We'll get it to Wikus.

A - Sydney Mbhele

{BIO 20089938 <GO>}

Wikus, will you take that one? What are the reasons for the reduction in the shareholders'
funds net asset value in H1 2020?

A - Wikus Olivier

{BIO 20074722 <GO>}

The biggest contributor to that would of course be the payment of the Sanlam dividend
which was more than ZAR7 billion that we paid out in April. And then there will also be
some impact coming through from negative investment returns on the capital portfolios,
which was partly offset by foreign currency translation gains. But the biggest portion would
be related to the dividend.

A - Sydney Mbhele

{BIO 20089938 <GO>}

Anything to add to that, Paul? Great. Let me take the next question then on from the
webcast. I note a reduction in interest-bearing assets in H1. What are the reasons for this?

Okay. What I'm going to suggest we do is move on to the next question so that Anton

our portfolio. But let's -- we'll come back to that one.

A - Sydney Mbhele

Yes, we can. I mean Anton will share that in a minute. But again, let's give him some time
to look it up. We haven't made significant changes in the half year. Are there any other
questions?

A - Sydney Mbhele

{BIO 20089938 <GO>}

Those are the only questions I have so far. And all the questions are referenced in Page
88. So once you are on Page 88, we should be able to deal with both questions.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

So Wikus and Anton, are you able to answer because otherwise we'll just take it offline?
Do we know the identity of the person who has asked?

A - Sydney Mbhele

We can certainly get it from the administrator of the webcast and we should be able to
get back if we can give immediate answer to that.

A - Paul Hanratty

{BIO 7445748 <GO>}

Wikus and Anton, do you want to answer now? Would you prefer to take this offline?

A - Wikus Olivier

{BIO 20074722 <GO>}

All right. I can maybe respond to the first question on interest-bearing investment on Page
88 is actually an increase in interest-bearing investments from ZAR235 billion to ZAR252

billion. Now that particular line item also includes interest-bearing investments that's held
within policyholder funds. And of course, it's due to the weakening rand, translating the
offshore holdings outside of South Africa to rand terms, those would have increased. And
that's a majority of the increase in interest-bearing investments.
And that will be spread across all of our non-South African geographies. Because we did
see, as I did in one of my slides, that they are underpreciated against all of the major
currencies in the first half of the year.

Yes. I'll take that. I think the second question in terms of offshore equity simply the value
of offshore equities in the rand increased significantly simply because of rand
depreciation and offshore equity movements. So that would have increased the weighting
of offshore equities on the balance sheet. There is an analysis of the required capital and
the exposure to equities versus bonds and cash and so on in the disclosure. So you can
see the exact breakdown of the required capital itself and the exposure to offshore
equity there.

Okay. So I think we've answered it basically. It wasn't a fundamental shifts in portfolio, but
clearly, as the rand depreciated, the relative weight did increase. Sydney, so I think that -does that bring us to a close of questions?

Yes, it brings us to a close of questions. No other question on the telephone line. We
don't have any other question on the webcast as it stands.
I'm going to take the opportunity then to thank you, Paul, to thank you Wikus, for the
presentation and that you've done with Paul. Thank you Anton. Thank you, Heinie. And we
will now bring this to a close.
Thank you for joining us, to everyone, whoever you are, and I hope you and your families
will remain safe during this very testing and difficult time. Take care.
