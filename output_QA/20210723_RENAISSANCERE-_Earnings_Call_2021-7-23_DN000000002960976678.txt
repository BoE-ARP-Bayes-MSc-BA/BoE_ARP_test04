Thanks, Keith. Good morning everybody and thanks for joining today's call. Last night, in
our earnings release, we reported a solid quarter with strong top line growth and
increasing bottom line profitability. This resulted in annualized return on average common
equity of 27.6% and annualized operating return on average common equity of 16.8%.
Now that many of our locations are tentatively reopening, we are excited to begin reestablishing our normal cadence of business. In many ways, last year was a trying one, but
it was also a year of great opportunity.
I am incredibly thankful for the loyalty of our customers and the resilience of the RenRe
community. I'm especially proud of our team's ability to continue to drive and execute in a
time of great uncertainty. While for many, 2020 was a year of challenges, for us, there
was also a time of opportunity and growth. I am pleased with all that we accomplished
and we'd like to take a few minutes to talk about the journey we've been on and how that
affects, who we are and what we do.
Back in 2013, the market was evolving rapidly. We anticipated that investors would
increasingly seek yield which would result in capital becoming more interested in
reinsurance risk. At that time we made the strategic decision to focus on our vision, which
is to be the best underwriter. For us, this meant leveraging our skills into remaining a
leading reinsurer while diversifying both geographically and into traditional Casualty lines.
It meant remaining focused on reinsurance business and not pursuing an insurance
strategy. It also meant committing to grow our hybrid business model by expanding our
capital partners franchise.
We knew that achieving this strategic imperative would require us to become more
efficient. We set specific goals to increase our capital leverage, investment leverage, and
operating leverage, with a particular focus on managing expenses. This was because we
expected the market to become more efficient and we wanted to insulate our investors,
as best we could from the effects of the soft market. Lowering our expense ratio will help
to mitigate the effect of the falling rates and offset its impact on our ROE.
In short, we transfer -- excuse me, we transformed the profile of the Company to ensure
we continue to benefit our shareholders over the long term. We knowingly began building
our Casualty business during a challenging phase of the market, with the intent that by
doing so we can construct a portfolio with embedded options for growth when pricing

improved. This is not a strategy for the faint of heart. You must believe that you
understand the risk you were taking because there is little room for error. You need
conviction in your beliefs on how, when and why the market will change and you must be
positioned as a respected market participant, so you can grow quickly when opportunity
arises.
I am pleased to report that we have succeeded in executing this strategy in our casualty
book. Of course, we continue to monitor the impact of social inflation and other trends.
What I am confident of however is that the successful execution of our strategy to grow
Casualty in a clearly improving market will serve us well and the favorable balance of
profitable business will ultimately benefit our shareholders. As we have said many times,
we evaluate our Casualty business over rolling 10-year period. For the last few years, we
have been writing well-rated risk that we believe will serve as the foundation for a strong
portfolio with superior returns. While we believe that we are already beginning to see this
profitability, we are in no rush to make changes today. Our long-term shareholders
support us and they will be rewarded.
Shifting gears briefly to capital management, which Bob will address in greater detail. We
have always been thoughtful and careful stewards of our capital. And have methodically
grown our capital base at a -- at a pace consistent with scaling our business, while
maintaining strong ratings. Since the second quarter, we have -- 2020, we have raised $1.1
billion in equity capital, raised over $1 billion of partner capital, grown gross written
premiums in our in force portfolio by $1.8 billion, earned $1 billion in net income and
returned over $700 million to our shareholders, through share repurchases and dividends.
As a result, we now find ourselves in the enviable position of having what we believe to
be the most -- to be more than ample financial flexibility to support our existing risk, take
advantage of potential opportunities and continue repurchasing our shares or what we
believe are attractive valuations.
I cannot emphasize too strongly, however, that last year's common equity raise was the
cornerstone of all these capital management and underwriting successes. Having the right
capital at the right time provided us the fortress balance sheet necessary to accomplish
all that we have. That concludes my opening comments. I'll provide more detailed update
on our segments' performance at the end of the call, but first, let me turn it over to Bob
to discuss the financial performance for the quarter.

Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Thanks Kevin and good morning everyone. My comments today will focus on our
accomplishments during the quarter and items that drove our results including our three
drivers of profit. Starting with our consolidated results, where we reported net income of
$457 million and operating income of $278 million for the quarter. These results were
driven by strong performances in each of our three drivers of profit, excellent
underwriting results, increased fee income and high quality net investment income, as
well as robust mark-to-market gains in our strategic investments and fixed income
portfolios. This produced annualized return on average common equity of 27.6% and
annualized operating return on average common equity of 16.8%.

FINAL

I'll now shift to our three drivers of profit, starting with underwriting income. Our top line
grew significantly in the quarter. Gross premiums written were up $392 million or 23% with
the Property segment growing $141 million and the Casualty segment growing $251 million.
Year-to-date, we have grown net premiums written by $886 million or 36% and remain on
track to grow well over $1 billion. We reported underwriting profit of $329 million million in
the quarter and a combined ratio of 72%.
For our Property segment specifically, gross premiums written grew $141 million over the
comparable quarter or 14% and we reported a combined ratio of 44%, driven by a lack of
Cat losses and strong performance in our Other Property business and $51 million in prior
year favorable loss development. Growth in gross premiums written was $50 million or 7%
in Property Cat and $91 million or 28% in Other Property. Most of the growth in our
property catastrophe business took place in our joint ventures. As a result, we currently
only retain about 28% of the gross premiums written in our property catastrophe
business. Attritional losses in Other Property book ran at about 46%. This is somewhat
favorable to our expectations for this business. As a reminder, in addition to attritional risk,
we also take catastrophe risk in our Other Property business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving on to our Casualty results. Our Casualty segment reported gross premiums
written of $911 million, growing $251 million or 38% versus the comparable quarter. Kevin
will elaborate on the drivers of this growth in his discussion of underwriting performance.
We experienced a small amount of favorable development in the combined ratio and the
combined ratio was 97.8%. Underlying this was a 67% current accident year loss ratio,
which is a 1.4 percentage point improvement from the same quarter last year and
consistent with our expectations.
This quarter, there were no significant changes to our COVID-19 loss estimates. That said,
this is a developing situation and we will continue to receive information over time. We
continue to monitor COVID-19 development across both segments and our current
reserves represent our best estimate of potential losses.
Now moving on to our second driver of profit, fee income. Total fee income was $46
million, which is up from the second quarter of last year. Management fees increased and
we expect that they will continue to serve as a strong, stable source of recurring revenues
going forward. Overall, we shared $114 million of income with the partners and our joint
ventures, as reflected in our redeemable non-controlling interest, driven by profitable
performance and a low Cat quarter and prior year favorable loss development. Our
Medici and Epsilon funds raised in aggregate over $200 million in New Quarter capital this
year, which we deployed it during the June 1 renewal. We made a small addition to our
financial supplement this quarter. You will see that on the bottom of Page 11, we have
broken out our fee income to show its contribution to underwriting results. The goal was
to provide additional disclosure on the geography of our fee income in the income
statement.
Turning now to our third driver of profit, investment income. We reported strong
investment returns this quarter due to falling interest rates as well as gains in our equity
portfolio. Net investment income was $81 million and we had $191 million in mark-to-market
gains. This resulted in total investment returns of $272 million. The decrease in interest

FINAL

rates has lowered the yield on our retained fixed maturity and short term investment
portfolio to 1.3%. The duration on our retained portfolio remain roughly flat at 3.8 years.
You'll note that we reduced our exposure to corporate credit this quarter, shifting the
portfolio to US Treasuries. We did this as credit spreads approach multi year lows.
Turning now to our expenses and starting with the acquisition expense ratio, which was up
slightly to 24%. This was driven by Casualty acquisition ratio, which increased by 1
percentage point to 28%. The current expected run rate of our Casualty acquisition
expense ratio is in the upper 20's. So this quarter is consistent with expectations.
Meanwhile, the Property acquisition expense ratio -- acquisition expense ratio was flat.
Our direct expense ratio, which is the sum of our operational and corporate expenses,
divided by net premiums earned, was flat from the prior quarter at 6%. On an absolute
basis, operational expenses were up in the quarter but remain below 5% as the ratio to
net premium earned. Going forward, as we grow our top line, we will also continue to
invest in the business to support our growth. We expect our direct expense ratio to
remain generally consistent with this quarter, absent one-time items.
I'd like to now shift to our discussion on our capital management during the quarter. Earlier
this month, we issued $500 million of our Series D perpetual preference shares with a
fixed-for-life dividend of 4.20%. We plan to use $275 million of the proceeds to refinance
our 5 and 3/8 Series E preference shares, which we have already been called and the
remainder of the proceeds for general corporate purposes. As a reminder, last year we
redeemed the outstanding $125 million of our 6.08% Series C preference shares and
retired $250 million of our 5 and 3/4 senior debt. So in total, we have replaced $650
million of capital at an average cost of 5 and 2/3 percent with $500 million of capital at a
cost of $420 million. This is part of our long-term strategy to minimize the cost of capital.
Even with the incremental $225 million raised this month, we are comfortable with our
various capital ratios, which are stronger than 2 years ago. Also in the quarter, we
participated in the issuance of additional $250 million tranche of our Mona Lisa cap on.
Consistent with our strategy, this adds additional efficient underwriting capital to our
fortress balance sheet. As Kevin noted, since June -- since last June, we have earned a $1
billion. In the second quarter of 2021, we continued returning these earnings to
shareholders, repurchasing 1.9 million common shares for $309 million. This works out to
an average price per share of about $159 and an average price to book value of 1.1 times
our current book value.
Subsequent to the quarter end, we continue to repurchase shares and as of July 19th, had
repurchased an additional 920,000 shares for $138 million at an average price of just over
$149 a share. In total this year, we have purchased 3.9 million shares for $618 million at an
average price of $157 per share. This has reduced our share count by about 7.8% from the
year-end 2020 total. Despite substantial quarterly share repurchases, we ended the
quarter with more capital than we began, which reflects our excess earnings, net of share
buybacks and dividends. Our common equity now stands at $6.7 billion. To be clear about
the use of the $1.1 billion of common equity we raised last year, that money hasn't fully
down streamed into our operating entities to support the attractive opportunities we took
advantage of to substantially grow our book this year and position us well for the future.

FINAL

Now, before turning the call back over to Kevin. I'd like to finish with a brief discussion on
tax. We have been closely following recent G7 and G20 announcements on setting a
Global Minimum Corporate Tax, the OECD's work on Pillar 1 and 2 and President Biden's
proposals for US tax changes. When it comes to tax reform, the details matter and they
are not yet clear. Over the years, however, the flexibility of our global operating platform
has proven resilient. And we anticipate this resilience will persist. That said, we will
continue to monitor this issue closely.
So in closing, we are pleased with our solid financial performance this quarter across our
three drivers of profit and believe we have demonstrated proactive capital management,
which should continue to contribute to shareholder value.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Kevin.

Kevin J. O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Bob. As usual, I'll divide my comments between our Property and Casualty
segments. Starting with Property. While we always maintain our leadership in Property Cat
underwriting, to be clear, we are increasingly doing it differently. We currently take more
of our Cat exposed risk through our Other Property portfolio, because that is where we
are seeing better returns for taking Cat risk. Our existing Other Property book has access
to some of the most dislocated property lines in the US E&S market. We have the
platforms, capital and expertise to focus across classes to target and obtain the best risk,
due to the long term relationships that we've cultivated with customers for over 25 years.
This is evident in the 28% year-on-year growth, which our Other Property book has
delivered and we now have an in force portfolio of over $1 billion. We also grew our
Property Cat portfolio this quarter, but by a smaller percentage. The June 1 renewals
proceeded as anticipated and overall we believe that we have constructed one of our
best Cat books in years. The Florida renewals saw rate increases averaging 5% to 20%,
with abundant capacity for upper layers, while many lower layers struggled to get placed,
especially if they were loss impacted. As we anticipated on last quarter's call, we reduced
the number of Florida programs that we wrote from 18 to 13, which is a continuation of
last year's trend when we reduced from 25 programs.
Since 2019, we have reduced our bottom line exposure to Florida domestic companies by
almost half. The Florida market remains highly challenged due to social inflation and as
anticipated, proposed reforms do not appear likely to materially change the landscape. I
reiterate that the Florida domestic market now represents less than 3% of our gross
written premiums. That said, decreased exposure to Florida domestics is not the same
thing, as decreased exposure to Florida Hurricanes. Southeast wind remains the peak risk
in our portfolio. What has changed is that we have moved away from Florida domestic
companies to more regional and nationwide programs and over the last year have
increasingly taken Southeast wind risk, through our other property portfolio.
I should note, that as we have grown, so has our tail risk on an absolute basis. On a
percentage of equity basis, however, it is similar to where we were prior to last year's

Page 6 of 19

FINAL

capital raise. It is easy to grow in this business by simply going risk on, but we created a
larger and more efficient portfolio than we had prior to the capital raise, and we did this
while holding our relative risk levels consistent with prior years. Inflation has been in the
news recently with headline CPA in May exceeding 5%. Most relevant to our Property book
however is inflation in the commodity and labor markets. As that is more likely to impact
rebuilding cost after an event.
Lumber and other commodity prices have been elevated this year, although recently they
appear to be moderating. We price for inflation in our models, given the elevated risk in
the current environment, we have stress-tested our portfolio and remain comfortable with
this exposure to inflation. From our perspective as a reinsurer, it was a quiet quarter for
Cat. Claudette made landfall in Louisiana as a disorganized weak tropical storm. In the
beginning of July, Elsa made landfall in Florida as a strong tropical storm and was the
earliest e-storm on record. While these storms may result in some losses, we currently do
not anticipate these to be material.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are closely monitoring meteorological conditions as we head into the third and fourth
quarters. You've probably read news reports about wildfires and record droughts already
in the US, particularly in California. We are expecting an active hurricane season, having
already having three US land falling storms. Europe recently experienced a significant
flooding event which we are closely evaluating, although it's too early to estimate
potential losses. As always, RenaissanceRe Risk Sciences is proving invaluable, in helping
us understand the climate dynamics likely to influence the remainder of the year.
I am often asked if we vary the amount of business that we write based on weather
forecasts. I strongly believe that due to our superior tools and better understanding of
climate change, we play a critical role in managing our customer's natural catastrophe risk.
Behaving like a partner by providing long-term stable capacity as part of our value
proposition, for which I expect we will be rewarded.
Moving now to our Casualty and Specialty segment. Our Casualty portfolio is performing
well. Original insurance rates continuing to increase, although the magnitude appears to
be moderating in those classes which have experienced the greatest uplift, such as D&O.
We have grown our Casualty business by more than 300% since 2015 on an in-force
basis. This includes adding over $1 billion of new business in the last 12 months, also on an
in-force basis, which should position us well as the market has clearly improved. Reflecting
over my career, I believe that many underwriters do not go large enough when
opportunity knocks or small enough when it recedes. I am proud of how our team has
performed and believe that we have executed into this market opportunity with great skill
and dexterity. Our competitive advantages, including our long term relationships and first
mover status, have served us well this year.
We anticipated this market well in advance and adopted a strategy of confident provision
of consistent capacity. While other reinsurers haggled over terms and conditions, we were
discussing new structures and coverages. We believe that this was the appropriate
approach and it explains our ability to grow proactively into an improving market, which
should benefit from building our largest and what we believe to be our best Casualty
Specialty portfolio as the market hits a multi year high.

FINAL

Cyber insurance has been getting a lot of attention lately. Rate changes have been
greater than 40% year-on-year and the market has been growing by about 25% each
year for the previous 5 years. Recently, this is being driven by multiple large cyber attacks
and increasing instances of ransomware. As a result, the cyber market is currently
experiencing increasing demand and limited supply. We have been reinsuring cyber
liability for almost a decade and believe there are good opportunities to grow this book.
Casualty and Specialty losses, including those related to COVID-19 continue to develop
within our expectations. In our credit book, mortgage forbearance rates also continue to
improve and the US housing market continues to be very healthy. As I mentioned on our
previous calls, in the Casualty business our actuaries are being patient in recognizing
positive rate movement. We are optimistic that over time we will benefit from the
improved underwriting terms and pricing that we believe we are enjoying.

Bloomberg Transcript

Closing now with our Capital Partners business. The big news for this quarter, was that our
Medici cap on Fund surpassed $1 billion in capital under management. This quarter
experienced near record Cat bond issuances and we continue to see strong demand for
our Medici Fund. Our strategic approach to asset management is not as an asset
accumulator, but rather as an underwriter looking to match the most efficient capital with
desirable risk. To achieve this, and provide the best solutions to our customers, we need
multiple capital structures and capital sources. It is for this reason that we manage several
vehicles, both rated and un-rated to provide additional capacity to our customers from
third party capital.
Since 2015, we have grown our capital partner business from 4 vehicles and $6 billion in
capital to 6 vehicles with more than $11 billion in capital. This is a critical component of our
strategy, provides our customers efficient capital that are owned, rated balance sheets or
less efficient. It allows our third party investors to partner with the best underwriter and
benefit from on -- from our unparalleled understanding and modeling of the catastrophe
risk that they desire. And it is good for our shareholders that it results in a stable growing
source of fee income.
In conclusion, we delivered a solid quarter with strong premium growth, improving
profitability and proactive capital management. We maintained our fortress balance sheet
while heading into the wind season, continuing to build the foundations for long-term
shareholder value.
And with that, I'll open it up for questions. Thanks.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, thanks, good morning. My first question, Kevin, is picking up, I guess right on your last
comment, where you said you guys have a fortress balance sheet heading into wind
season. If I remember correctly, RenRe typically does not like to be as active with
buybacks during wind season. But if we look at the disclosure of July to date, which I know
isn't the active part of wind season, but is wind season you guys kind of continue to buy
back your stock at a pretty robust clip. So, given the strong capital that you guys sit with
today, can you just give us a sense of thoughts around buyback throughout wind season
this year?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yes, I think we have in other years paused our buybacks during wind season. The way we
look at our capital and our capital positioning going into wind season is, first to make sure
you're right, the portfolio that we target and desire, which we have done. We hold capital
available for opportunities that are likely to emerge during the quarter. And then we look
at what excess capital is available and look to manage it typically through buybacks. I
would say looking at this wind season, we are in a very strong capital position to continue
to execute our strategy. We have ample financial flexibility for a new opportunities. And I
would say that with that, we are in a stronger position to continue to think about buybacks
during this wind season than we were last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. And then my second question, when you guys raised the capital, we
had discussions last year after that, you spoke about wanting to put the capital to work
right in 2021 and then in subsequent years. So you still sound pretty bullish on the
opportunities within Casualty and Specialty and also within the Other Property market.
Obviously you know we're still away a little bit away from thinking about next year's
renewals, but as you kind of think about just the opportunity at hand, does it still seems
like you'll be able to continue to put that capital to work, relative to what you guys had
thought kind of following the capital raise last year?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Sure. So firstly, we've deployed everything we've raised. And the way I think about that is,
we have very high renewal retention. So our deployment I think of as an annuity for future
value. So we brought it on to our platform, as Bob discussed briefly, we are still yet to
earn much of the benefit of the premium that we've already written. And when we look
into 2022, we are building our pro-forma's with the assumption that that business remains
with us and we have further opportunity to grow. So when I think about the future, we are
in a capital position where if that money is deployed, we have additional capital that we
are targeting for future growth going into 2022 and we still have the financial flexibility to
repurchase shares at what we think are attractive prices. So I couldn't be in a -- looking
back over the history of my role at RenRe, I think this is one of the strongest financial
positions we've been in, with the greatest flexibility we've ever had.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous
Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey, thanks, good morning guys. Kevin, I guess just looking at your 1.3% retained
investment portfolio yield, isn't that -- it's extremely inefficient, given how much you've
mixed more toward longer liabilities in recent years?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll take that one Ryan. One, we're very comfortable with our investment portfolio. First,
you have to remember, we're an underwriting Company. And we underwrite for the
reserves and I'll answer the reserves question in a second here, but we're very
comfortable with the liquidity, good stewards of that liquidity and we look at our balance
sheet in totality and how the liabilities develop over time. We have extended duration. If
you look back over the last few years, we've taken it out from a very conservative duration
that you would expect with the Property Cat Company short tail, we've extended that to
3.8 years right now. So, we're consciously looking at that. But what we're not doing Ryan,
is trying to swing for the fences and generate yield. Right now, we're trying to be good
stewards of the liquidity to ensure that our reserves are taken care of.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
One thing I'd add to that is, in thinking about the portfolios that we construct and my
comments about Southeast wind still being a peak risk for us, we also placed very high
goals for our liquidity. So that, given any sort of Cat event, our liquidity is available. And
that obviously affects returns and it has been a consistent part of our capital management
over, frankly since I've been here.

Q - Ryan Tunis

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yes, thank you very much. So, I'm trying to do some work to figure out the paths. And
when you interpolated Platinum into your business, there was a favorable development
that was coming off the Platinum acquisition. And maybe things have seasoned enough in
your legacy Casualty and Specialty portfolios that you got comfortable with a seasoning
and improving underlying loss ratio coming through on that business. How is the -- are the
lessons of I guess that '14 to '16 period and the favorable development that we saw in the
Casualty and Specialty segment. What lessons can we apply to where your reserving the
book right now and following the TMR acquisition?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

So the -- let me talk a bit about our portfolio. So, within the Casualty Specialty, we have a
diverse portfolio, we do our reserving at a line of business basis. And we, generally as I've
talked about on previous calls, have a long period before we begin to recognize positive
news. We don't really think about periods, pre buy them and post buy them, as we
integrated that portfolio, we integrated the Tokyo portfolio. What I would say is, our
methodology is exactly the same as what it was 3, 4 or 5 years ago. The difference is -and is that we are substantially growing our Casualty portfolio and we're growing into a
much better market. We haven't fully earned the -- the growth that we have already
achieved. And the growth that we're achieving is at substantially higher rates, than the inforce portfolio.
All of that will take time, but when I think about our Casualty portfolio, I sometimes think
about is a battery and how much energy have we put into the battery. We've not only
made the battery bigger, the pipe charging the battery is much stronger. So when I look at
our -- the quality of our portfolio, I think it's better than it's ever been and it's bigger than
it's ever been. And if, when you think about managing the Casualty portfolio being able to
grow and leverage the portfolio into what is now the high mark for the portfolio so far,
from a pricing perspective, is exactly what you want to be, where you want to be. So the
portfolio is in exceptional condition, it's going to take a little bit of time to earn it, which is
natural with writing quota share business. And we're enjoying the full benefit of the
underlying rate change that has been available in the market for the last several years.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

All right. I appreciate and I realize you guys are trying. But I mean I look at the US reserving
right now in your Casualty and Specialty book at about a breakeven combined ratio. Is that
based on that you think that a recent accident -- not current, but just bring us that recent
accident year, and we're looking at the industry producing much much better margins,
than rent reinsurance on the Casualty business. Are you of the view that is there a lot of I
guess ACR that you or cedents haven't put up enough for those recent accident years
and the way you're reserves are contemplated is your IBNR and ACR is an access of what
you're getting from the cedents?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Let me just talk a bit about property types. I think the ACR is a little bit more relevant
there. Within our property portfolio is an event-driven property portfolios. We generally

Page 11 of 19

FINAL

carry significantly higher reserves than the primary companies. Looking at our Casualty
portfolio, a lot of what is booked is -- is IBNR. And we are then given border of reporting
and then we reconcile the actual against the curve that we've built from the up for the
IBNR.
In general, we start with a higher expected ultimate than many of our customers. That's
just who we are and what we do. Over time, that can be reconciled back to the
performance that the underlying carrier is having, because ultimately that's the portfolio
we're protecting. So I feel it's a prudent way to think about it when you're one step further
away from the original risk. And it takes some period of time for the earnings to come
through, because of that strategy, but I think it's the right strategy as a reinsurer. The fact
that our portfolio is so much bigger than where it has been historically, also amplifies the
change that the pricing should have on the overall return of the portfolio.
So I think we're in good shape. I like the way we reserve our portfolio. I think it's
appropriate, and in general, it is higher than what we're seeing on the underlying
portfolios that we're protecting, as a starting point, ultimately to reconcile.

Q - Josh Shanker

Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Your
line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great. Thanks. Kevin, in your comments, I guess, when you talk about moving towards, I'll
say, bigger national carriers that have Florida exposure. So I would assume that that
means that you're writing at higher layers. Is that just because they're biggest, they can
retain more risk. Is that a fair interpretation and are there other changes in the profile of
the book beside that?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I think there's two ways, nation -- national carriers by one is including Florida and one is a
Florida specific. The Florida Pacific -- specifics replicate a little bit more to how the
regionals buy. Your comment in general on our Property Cat portfolio is that we are higher
skewed in our attachment point for Florida. That is not true for our overall Property
portfolio, because on the Other Property portfolio, we are writing more proportional
exposure through the full risk distribution which will add exposure at the lower point of the
curve or the more frequent return periods. So when I look at our portfolio at the overall
Property level, your comments are accurate for Property Cat, but our overall Property

Page 12 of 19

portfolio is about equally exposed as it has been historically to small events and large
events. And that is mostly because of the Other Property writings.

FINAL

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. That makes sense. And then a quick question for Bob, if we have
some of the management fees offsetting expenses and the asset pools are growing,
with so that translates into expense ratio improvement over time assuming that you
continue to grow investor capital?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Yes, I'd say, as we continue to grow the fees, which we have been over the past several
years, you will see the geography in the income statement come through, part of it will be
in the Property and is an offset to the expenses. Using a disclosure we put in the
supplemental this quarter, you'll be able to see that going forward on a trailing basis. The
other is really, it's down in the non controlling redeemable interest and does not affect
expenses, it just affects the amount that's released back into our Capital Partners.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Right, no, I understand that. That's helpful. And just earlier you or in your prepared
comments you talked about expecting basically a flat expense ratio and I'm trying to
reconcile those two ideas.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

The expense. Okay. Sorry. I misunderstood the question. I was thinking was definitely the
expense ratio, as the ratio is going to continue to grow. We're going to have -- that is
what our measure is, and we continue to invest, it's around just under 5% right now, on
the underwriting side of it. The fees as they grow, will continue to be an offset to the
operational expense, but we're going to continue to invest in our teams and our platform.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. That -- thank you so much.

Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan
Stanley, your line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. Two, well, I guess one quick numbers question for Bob. Bob, you
mentioned the change in the ports asset mix from corporate to treasuries. But there was
a couple of just minor things that I noticed, if you can comment on cash will be up quite a
bit, anything there that was kind of noteworthy for what that was? And then investment
expense kind of jumped as well. On those two things, anything that was worth?

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

So I think, the question, Mike was on cash changes in the portfolio?

FINAL

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Yes. Cash was up quite a bit in the quarter. I know it was quite lumpy, but it definitely
jumped up this quarter and then investment expense I think for the quarter over $7 million
in Q4 [ph]. So sort of.

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Got it. On a cumulative, starting with the expenses, it was $7 million this quarter, it was the
timing of the accruals on a year-to-date basis, Mike, it should be normalized, consider,
comparable to what last year was. On the cash side, you see we did raise a couple of
hundred million dollars in our funds, that will be on our balance sheet until we get that put
into some of the short-term investments which are out there. Just more minor on the
geography and inflection of what we've had in our -- in our third party capital.

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, cool vessel. Thanks. Kevin, you mentioned, I appreciate that, it's a little too early to
talk about European flooding and exposure there, but we've seen some stories I guess
late reported large claims activity from last quarter's winter storm (inaudible). I'm
wondering if you've seen -- you didn't talk anything, I guess not, but any concerns there of
that moving up at the industry level on what we've seen so far?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yes, I mean, we're -- I am aware of the changes that you're discussing, that's from our
estimate and looking at our portfolio, we still -- we don't see that affecting us the same
way it's affecting the market. So we feel good about the estimate that we have up.

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, guys.

Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Again we have a question from the line of Brian
Meredith with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks. Kevin, I was hoping we could dig back a little bit into the whole inflationary
question and kind of what the impact could be on losses here as we go through hurricane
season. I know you said you're comfortable with your exposure, but how do we kind of
think about it, frame it, when you renew contracts at 1-1, were you thinking about the same
type of inflationary environment we are in today? And then as we kind of look at potential
hurricanes hitting, could they be 5%, 10%, 15% higher given labor shortages and as well as
lumber prices?

FINAL

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So firstly, I believe losses will be more expensive this year because of inflation. And I
would have said the same thing last year, and the way I think about inflation is, most of the
-- the inflation in specifically for the Property Cat portfolio is going to be after an event.
That's captured in our models through what we call demand surge. And we hold demand
surge curves, significantly higher than the commercial models hold them. So we already
have a degree of conservative relative to the industry with our view of inflation, postevent.
Going in this year, we already know there's pressures there. I think labor, the pressures
post event could be significant. But we have it reflected in our model. We've done some
stress-testing on where they -- where inflation is, we feel comfortable with the way we
modeled the book. So if inflation is probably higher than what we thought at 1-1 but and
thinking about how we built the portfolio, it's in a post event demand surge basis, I think
we're well covered and going to be higher and we already have -- it held higher than the
industry.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great, thanks. Very helpful. And then the second question, I'm just curious, could you give
us a little bit of color on kind of what's your exposure right now as to aggregate covers
and obviously with the first quarter events being high and now wildfires, do you think
that's a book of business that's at risk for some kind of decent size losses again this year?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
It's early. I think all aggregate covers are going to be closely monitored, if there is large
events in the first quarter. We've reduced our writing of aggregate covers this year. We
have a vehicle Epsilon, which tends to be better suited capital for a whole host of reasons
for that type of risk. And that's reduced its exposure to aggregate covers as well. So it's
again, if we do have exposure to it, it's less than last year on a relative basis. And it's not
something that at this point we have a significant concerns about.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great, real helpful. Thank you.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Sure.

Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank.

Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td

FINAL

Yes, thanks, good morning. In response to an earlier question, you talked about the
difference in ultimate expectations between yourself in the season. And I was hoping you
could layer into that, I guess some commentary around pricing. When we see the
favorable pricing environment in the primary side that we have right now, does it feel like
that spread between the ultimates grows, as maybe your ultimate expectations stay
flattish. But the expectations of cedents come down to reflect the pricing may be more in
real time?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yes. And the spread between us and our cedents from a pricing perspective is true, it's
also the spread between our reserving actuaries in our pricing attitude. Our pricing
actuaries spread has enhanced as well. So what that means is the -- our pricing actuaries
in the moment are reflecting the price change that is occurring on our portfolio. Our
reserving actuaries are monitoring trend and will more slowly reflect the price change that
their -- the pricing actuaries are affecting immediately.
So it's a normal part of a rising market. The good news is, as we're moving into a by any
measure a better priced market, we are substantially larger. So the beneficial impact of
the quality of the portfolio that we've currently written, will emerge over time as we earn
it out. So, when I think about the portfolio, when I made my comments about it being the
best Casualty Specialty portfolio, we've written, I couldn't be more excited about the
profile of the risk that I'm seeing and it'll just take time to earn out.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Philip Stef ano

{BIO 20346322 <GO>}

Okay, understood. And I also -- I'm understood and appreciate the comments earlier that
the full $1 billion or so that was raised a year ago is deployed. And as you work through
the excess capital, you feel like you have enough levers in place to continue to grow and
continue to repurchase shares. How should we be contemplating the excess capital
position now versus a year ago and maybe 2 years ago? And but how -- without putting
numbers on it, how should we think about the drivers moving this excess capital position
versus the capital return that you're doing?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So I think not all of these are things that are easily seen from outside the four walls of
RenRe. But our portfolio is more efficient. We actually have more ability to share risk, both
with third party capital, we mentioned we raised $1 billion third party capital last year and
over the last 12 months. The -- we've seen more opportunities for portfolio enhancement
through some traditional cedant and we were able to grow our top line more than we
originally forecast. So all of that plays into the consumption of capital within our portfolio.
And that's where the deployment of the $1 billion came from. We've earned out -- we've
earned $1 billion and kind of the simplest math and we've only bought $700 million of
stock back. So, right there, we've already created more room for growth just by not even
keeping up with the earnings that we've had.
So when I look at it, it's a combination of greater efficiency with our portfolio, partially
because we've had more opportunity to share it with third party investors and others and

Page 16 of 19

FINAL

convert it to fee income. We've earned more than expected, partially because of the
investment returns in the second half of last year. And as we look forward, that gives us a
lot of financial flexibility to think about continue to invest in the portfolio and then also
have the scale and the flexibility to buy more shares back. So, it's a combination of things,
not always easy to point to one number on our Reports to reflect it.

Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan.
Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. Good morning. So, most of my questions were answered. I just had a couple of
items. The first, can you talk about the drivers of the favorable reserve development that
you saw this quarter and any sort of color on either accident years or region or cases or
what really drove that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Thanks for the question, it's Bob. It really came across most of our years in perils. It's just
part of a review that we go through. I would point out that of the $52 million, $28 million if
it was in DaVinci. And so that was a lion's share of it and that's aligned with our Property
Cat business, and we have 30% of that. So really $20 million of that favorable
development was actually released back to our Capital Partners in the non redeemable
controllable interest. So, favorable development that was on us was only about $32
million.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Okay and then on pricing overall, obviously the pace of increases has slowed, but how do
you feel about the adequacy of pricing, given that rates have gone up over the past
several years and, but then there are some pressures as well such as inflation. So -- and
just across your various businesses?

A - Keith McCue

{BIO 20595590 <GO>}

Yes. So I think, we've been getting rate on rate. So the -- the level of rate increase is
reducing but still positive. So that's good news. Just to start with. So, we look at our
portfolios -- our observations are broadly, we are seeing rate above trend, we do watch
social inflation carefully to make sure that we're assessing that element of trend. And we
feel as if the portfolios that we're writing are rate adequate. So, we believe that there is
further rate increase coming in the pipeline. But we're already dealing with portfolios that
are seeing rate above trend and our rate -- and have rate adequacy in them. So I think the
book is in good shape.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. Hopefully, this is a good continuation of Jimmy's question. You've talked about
the improving rate environment, I think that's undeniable, but it seems like eventually
we're going to see softening in Casualty and Specialty. I was hoping you could talk about
how your expectations for maybe the shape of this price cycle mess what we're seeing?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yes, I think rates won't go up forever. So I think we certainly expect that. I think one
sometimes reflecting back on the last comment, we do monitor rate change, but we're
disciplined in understanding rate adequacy. So, we believe that there is more rate coming
through the system. That will take us again, so we're optimistic about where the portfolios
are. Once we observe and whether that's from an increase in trend or a reduction in rate,
that the balance is no longer in our favor, we will reduce the size of our books. We're
nowhere near that point at this time in our observation of where the markets are though.
