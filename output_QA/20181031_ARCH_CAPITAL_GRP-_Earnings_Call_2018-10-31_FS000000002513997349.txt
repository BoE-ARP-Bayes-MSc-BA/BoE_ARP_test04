{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Thank you, operator, and good morning to you all. Happy Halloween to all and best
wishes to your little ghosts, goblins and princesses. While the stock market has been
providing some scares this past week, here at Arch, we had another good quarter
despite higher cat activity around the world as our operating strategy of diversification,
cycle management and focus on risk adjusted returns produced an annualized operating
return equity of 11.4% and a 2.3% increase in book value per share at September 30, 2018.
François will provide more commentary on our financial results in a moment.

Bloomberg Transcript

But it's worth noting that our modest exposure to property losses this quarter is not just
the result of our good risk selection. It also reflects our ability to remain disciplined in a
market where risk adjusted returns do not meet our return hurdles. The 2017 and 2018
catastrophes are a reminder that margins in cat exposed property lines remains thin and
in many cases, are inadequate relative to the severity and frequency of catastrophe
events. With respect to market conditions in our property, casualty operations, outside of
property, there are just a few specialty areas such as travel accidents and European motor
where current market conditions provide opportunities to deploy additional capital.
In most of our insurance lines, rate changes are positive and appear to be outpacing claim
trends. But as we have discussed in prior quarters, the spread between rate changes and
loss trend, claims inflation, if you will, is small and we remain cautious in establishing our
loss picks. In addition, specialty lines such as those that we write are volatile by their
nature and it is necessary to use a longer assessment period in order to evaluate the
ultimate margins.
In summary, overall market conditions in our P&C businesses to evaluate the ultimate
margins. In summary, overall market conditions in our P&C businesses seem relatively
unchanged from last quarter and we continue to believe that additional rate increases are
needed to provide a more adequate margin of safety and broader growth opportunities.
Turning now to MI where the operating environment remains attractive. I will focus my
comments on our U.S. primary business, which represents over 80% of that segment. MI
pricing appears to have stabilized in the third quarter as to the rate changes announced in
the first half of this year. The credit quality of loans insured remains strong and our key risk
barometers are still at benign levels relative to historical norms. If you have a chance, visit
our Arch MI website for our full housing and mortgage market report, and called it
Hammer Report. It will give you a good idea of why we remain confident of the health of
the U.S. housing market. In short, due to the factors I just discussed, we like the visibility in
the future performance of our U.S. mortgage insurance business.
Our U.S. MI new insurance written or NIW was strong again at $21.4 billion, a 21% increase
over the same quarter last year. In the third quarter, higher loan to value or LTV
mortgages with greater than 95 LTVs grew slightly as a percentage of our NIW to about

FINAL

15%. Credit quality as indicated by FICO remains high across our risk-in-force with an
average score of 743.
We remain underweight relative to the market in the greater than 95 LTV and the higher
DTI products. Our single premium policies remain low at 7% of NIW this quarter versus the
industry average of roughly 15%. In the current rising interest rate environment, monthly
premium products should continue to produce better risk adjusted returns over time. The
persistency of our monthly policy has increased to 82% in the third quarter and support
the allocation of more capital to the monthly products.

Bloomberg Transcript

In addition to maintain the credit quality of our in-force book, we increased our protection
for mortgage tail risk by completing our second and third Bellemeade risk transfers to the
capital market this year where we have become a regular issuer. Insurance linked notes
enhance the level and the predictability of our expected returns. As far as the new MRT
programs with the GSEs, the IMAGIN and EPMI facilities, they have begun to generate
business. Momentum is building slowly as banks develop new systems to handle the
programs. More on that later.
Now, briefly, with respect to our investment operations, higher yields available in the
financial markets and growth in invested assets led to a 21% increase in net investment
income in the third quarter. We remain underweight both credit and interest rate risk given
the rising rate environment. Finally, a few words on capital and risk management. Share
repurchases by Arch are typically light in the third quarter, and this quarter was no
different. While we repurchased some shares this past quarter, we have been working on
a few opportunities to deploy our capital into our businesses and we will let you know if
and when these opportunities come to fruition.
As to risk management, for the reasons I mentioned earlier, our property cat exposures
remained at historically low levels with our 1-in-250 year peak zone at 5% of tangible
common equity at the end of the third quarter.
For our mortgage segment, as of September 30th, our realistic disaster scenario declined
as growth in the insurance in-force was more than offset by the capital relief from the
Bellemeade transaction and the continuing run-off of pre-2009 business.
With regards to PMIERs, which applies to our primary U.S. mortgage insurance business as
of September 30, 2018, Arch MI was at 151% of the current GSE capital requirements. Arch
required assets exceeds both the current efficiency ratio known as PMIER 1.0 and the
revised GSE required assets as proposed under PMIERs 2.0 which is to be effective on
March 31, 2019.
With that, I will turn it over to François.

François Morin
Thank you, Marc, and good morning to all. Let me jump right in and give you all some
comments and observations on our results for the third quarter. Consistent with prior

FINAL

practice, these comments are on a core basis which corresponds to Arch's financial
results excluding the other segment, i.e., the operations of Watford Re. In our filings, the
term consolidated includes Watford Re.
After-tax operating earnings for the quarter were $242.3 million, which translates to an
annualized 11.4% operating return on average common equity and $0.59 per share. On a
year-to-date basis, our annualized operating ROE also stands at 11.4%, a solid result in
light of challenging conditions in the P&C sector.
Book value per share was $21.15 at September 30, a 2.3% increase from last quarter and a
6.4% increase from one year ago, despite the impact of higher interest rates on total
returns for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis.

Moving on to operations. Losses from 2018 catastrophic events, net of reinsurance
recoverables and reinstatement premiums, were $58.2 million or 5 combined ratio points.
While these losses were predominantly the result of Hurricane Florence hitting the
Carolinas, we were also impacted by other events across the globe including Typhoon
Jebi in Japan. As for Hurricane Michael, while we are still early in the process of assessing
our exposure to this event, we believe the impact to our insurance and reinsurance
operations will be in the range of $40 million to $60 million on a pre-tax basis given the
information available at this time.
As for prior period net loss reserves development, we recognized approximately $77.6
million of favorable development in the third quarter or 6.7 combined ratio points
compared to 5.1 combined ratio points in the third quarter of 2017. All segments were
favorable, led by the mortgage segment with approximately $38 million favorable, the
reinsurance segment at $33 million favorable, and the insurance segment contributing $7
million. This level is higher than in recent periods, primarily as a result of the significant
favorable development observed in our first-lien portfolio in the mortgage segment,
where cure rates this year continue to be materially higher than long-term averages and
expectations. The calendar quarter combined ratio on a core basis was 80.1%, while the
core accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats, improved to 81.8%, down 260 basis
points from last year's third quarter.
The insurance segment's accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats, was 100.2%,
slightly higher than the comparable 2017 level, as a result of elevated attritional claim
activity across a small number of lines, slightly offset by lower operating expenses,
resulting primarily from lower compensation costs. In comparing the quarterly accident
year results, it should be noted that the reported results can be subject to noise due to
random occurrences that can take place in the lines of business we operate in. Just as we
reported that our results last quarter were enhanced by the lower frequency of large noncat claims, the opposite result materialized this quarter. In order to detect trends in the
performance of our units, we tend to focus on trailing 12-month analyses to remove some
of the noise that we see from quarter-to-quarter.
The reinsurance segment accident quarter combined ratio excluding cats stood at 92.5%
compared to 96.9% on the same basis one year ago. As we discussed in the prior call, the

Page 4 of 17

FINAL

combined ratio in the quarter one year ago was impacted by a large retroactive
reinsurance contract. Given the nature of our book and the impact certain large
transactions may have, fluctuations of quarterly results are not unusual and should be
expected.
The expense ratio benefited from the reduction in Federal excise taxes of $2.3 million or
0.8 points as a result of the cancellation of certain intercompany property casualty quota
share agreements effective January 1st as discussed in prior calls. This item will continue
to impact comparisons of 2018 to 2017 results.
The mortgage segment's accident quarter combined ratio improved by 410 basis points
from the third quarter of last year as a result of the continued strong underlying
performance of the book, particularly within our U.S. primary MI operations.

Bloomberg Transcript

The calendar quarter loss ratio of 3.2% in the third quarter of 2018 compares favorably
against the 12.8% in the same quarter of 2017, due to substantially lower delinquency
rates. 570 basis points of the difference or $17.1 million is attributable to increased
favorable prior development, while an additional 280 basis points of the difference or
$8.3 million is attributable to favorable development on 2018 delinquencies due to very
strong cure activity in the period. The expense ratio was at 21.4%, slightly higher than in
the same period one year ago as a result of the higher level of acquisition expenses due
to increased amortization of deferred acquisition costs.
These figures highlight the contribution to our pre-tax underwriting income from the
mortgage segment which remains strong this quarter. After allocating corporate items,
such as investment income, interest expense and income taxes to each segment, the
mortgage segment's contribution to our 2018 year-to-date net income decreases to
approximately 70% of the total, after normalizing our results for catastrophic activity.
Total investment returns for the quarter was a positive 31 basis points on a U.S. dollar
basis and a positive 37 basis points on a local currency basis. These returns were
impacted by the effects of higher interest rates on investment-grade fixed income
securities with marginally higher returns on alternative investments and non-investmentgrade fixed income.
During the quarter, we continue to shift our allocations away from municipal bonds and
into corporates due to relative valuations. The investment duration was substantially
unchanged on a sequential basis at 2.94 years. Operating cash flow on a core basis was a
strong $543 million in the quarter, reflecting the solid performance of our units. Lower
levels of claim payments and higher levels of investment income received explain most of
the increase over the same quarter one year ago.
The corporate effective tax rate in the quarter on pre-tax operating income was 11.8% and
reflects the benefit of the lower U.S. tax rate, the geographic mix of our pre-tax income
and 190 basis point expense from discrete tax items in the quarter. As a result, the
effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income excluding discrete items was 9.9% this
quarter, slightly lower than the 10.4% rate last quarter.

FINAL

As we look ahead to year-end 2018, we currently believe it's reasonable to expect that
the effective tax rate on operating income will be in the range of 9% to 12%. As always,
the effective tax rate could vary depending on the level and location of income or loss
and varying tax rates in each jurisdiction.
With respect to capital management, our debt to total capital ratio was 16.6% at
September 30th and debt plus preferred to total capital ratio was 23.5%, down 290 basis
points from year-end 2017 and 520 basis points from year-end 2016 when we closed the
UGC acquisition.
As for share repurchases, we repurchased 414,000 shares during the third quarter at an
average price of $26.48 per share and an aggregate cost of $11 million under Rule 10b5
plan that we implemented during our closed window period. Since the start of the fourth
quarter, we have purchased an incremental 575,000 shares at a cost of $15.3 million. Our
remaining authorization which expires in December 2019 now stands at $247 million after
consideration of the share repurchases made through October 30th.
With these introductory comments, we are now prepared to take your questions.

Q&A

Thank you. Our first question comes from Geoffrey Dunn from Dowling & Partners. Your
line is open.

Q - Geoffrey Murray Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Hey, Jeff.

Q - Geoffrey Murray Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

I guess, first, could you update the RDS number for the MI business and specifically can
you give us what the gross RDS is and then the net RDS after all the ILN benefits?

A - François Morin
Well, I mean, we do the gross and – we focus on the net because there's a lot of
movements there and there's a lot of reinsurance protection as you know that comes into
play. The current number is just at about $1 billion net of all the protections we have.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. Shy of 13%, Jeff.

Q - Geoffrey Murray Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

And is there any way for us to try to back into that gross number?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

FINAL

Not really. From just talking to you, I guess at some point, we might want to talk to it
through it but it's not very easily manageable I guess in a call like this.

Q - Geoffrey Murray Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

Okay. And then with respect to managing capital in the MI platform, as you consider both
regulatory limitations on dividends and just overall surplus until contingencies start
releasing, is it possible to manage to an efficient cushion on a pro forma 2.0 basis as a
recurring ILN (00:20:03)?

A - François Morin
I just want to make sure – I mean the question in a sense, a cushion, yes. I mean just to be
clear, we certainly want to have a cushion above PMIERs 1.0 or PMIERs 2.0. We don't think
it's prudent to run the business right at PMIERs whatever that is. So no question, yes. As
you saw, the PMIERs ratio did go up this quarter driven by the new Bellemeade transaction
we closed on in the third quarter. We're in the middle of discussions and planning around
how we can extract some of that excess capital from the regulated entity, regulated
mortgage entities and see what we can do with that.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Two things to add to this. Two things to add to this, Geoff. I think that the Bellemeade
transaction, as you know, are by and large so far have been backward looking. So, you
really only know after you've accomplished or you've realize them. So, your question
assumes that you're going to have the same level of execution in the market going
forward on a guaranteed or semi-guaranteed basis which we don't know if that's the
case. But having said all of this, you also have opportunities that may develop over time in
a marketplace that might mean more need for capital and that also will cause sometimes
delay or it's not a very immediate release of capital, as you know, with the regulatory
entities in the U.S. We have to be careful and it takes a little while to go through the capital
management because of all these constituencies out there.

Q - Geoffrey Murray Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

It sounds like maybe it's little too early to ask the question.

A - François Morin
Well, I mean we're working on it. The answer is it's a fact. We closed on the transactions
and, as you know, it takes time to get approvals that we had done and...

Q - Geoffrey Murray Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

Yeah.

Page 7 of 17



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td

Date: 2018-10-31

A - François Morin
...that's really were the first thing we need to do for and then we'll once – if and when we
get those, then we'll have more flexibility in what we can do with it.

Q - Geoffrey Murray Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thanks.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Sure.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. My first question just follow-up with Geoff on MI business. It looks like last two
quarters, your underlying combined ratio running at high-30s given the strong credit
environment, and that's compared with last year probably in the mid-40s. I just wonder if
the credit environment remains stable, will that be a sort of reasonable run rate for that
business or other sort of like minus pluses like could impact that core combined ratio
going forward.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

So, Kai, all moving parts that are very – there's lot of things going on. If anything else
change, you're quite right that we should expect to have a very similar combined ratio.
That's just based on the credit quality of the borrowers. It's still extremely good out there.
So yes, that we would expect everything else being equal, which is never is, right, we still
need house price to go up, we still – unemployment remaining low and mortgage rates
not increasing dramatically or in a significant way. So there are lot things that need to
happen for this to be – because for the shorter term, yes, we would expect this to be a
sustainable combined ratio.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. That's great. And then switch to the reinsurance side. We have heard a lot of sort of
new demand in the marketplace since the cash leery, as well as this year's cat activity is
not quite, it's not like as large last year but we have some adverse development from last
year's events as well. So what's your outlook for January renewals. If you can talk both on
the property cat side and as well as ongoing sort of like pricing on the casualty side as
well?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

So let me take the property cat. I mean it's still early, right? We're a couple of months
before the renewal of the January 1s. The market is still flush with capital. So there's a
couple of things going on there that brings a lot of dynamic as we get towards January 1.
Page 8 of 17



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2018-10-31

FINAL

Based on the results of the losses that we've seen over the last two, three years, we
would expect it to be at least – should be at least some price increase to recognize the
fact that the long term average – the short term average is probably not going to favor of
the insurance companies and the reinsurance companies. So we would expect that to
have an influence on the renewal. But, however, capacity is plentiful and there is a lot of
alternative capital that could come in and change it. So we'll have to wait and see what
happens. It's not a clear cut answer from that perspective.
On the casualty side, it's a very tough place to be. The result on the casualty, we're not a
big casualty reinsurance player. What you see in our casualty segment is not at all the GL,
general liability, or the traditional casualty reinsurance. We still feel this is too competitive
for our own taste. The fact that people want to buy more reinsurance might indicate to
me that there is a willingness and a desire to share or at least to deemphasize the risk
that is inherent in their portfolio. So we'll be very cautious in the way we are going about
running that business. We're not as optimistic about the casualty market as people would
be out there.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Last one you may on the primary insurance side. So you mentioned attrition loss is
higher, could you quantify that for the quarter? And also you mentioned that these results
have been close to breakeven and you have mentioned about 95% long-term outlook
and how quickly we can get there?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Not soon enough, right? I mean that will be the right answer. I think that we've seen that
trailing 12-month combined ratio hovering around 99%. This quarter, yes, did have larger
attritional losses. I think it's 2 to 2.5 points impact on the quarter, which would have put this
quarter in line with the other ones. But on the trailing 12-month, we are pretty much at the
99% number. And this is the one that we intend to focus on. Any one quarter does not
make a trend. And as you all remember, we had large losses on reinsurance last quarter.
We did not have them this quarter. We are having them in insurance. So there is a lot of
volatility going around those given the specialty lines that we write.
I think that we also look at this in sense of the overall market being soft, terms and
conditions not strengthening any better with some rate increase. It just makes us to be
that much more prudent. When there is a large loss that comes in, most of the time IBNR
would be there to make up for that loss. But we tend to take a more conservative
approach to this and may not take the full impact on the IBNR and leave the IBNR at the
same level and take the large loss as it comes because we are not sure that the
fundamentals are improving as much as we would hope they would be.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you so much.

FINAL

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your line is
open.

Q - Michael Zaremski

Hey. Thanks. Starting with mortgage insurance, in the prepared remarks, you mentioned
that momentum is building for, I think, you said some of the bigger banks to handle some
of the adjustable mortgage insurance pricing. Is that you think helping you maintain your
market share position? Because I think your market share jumped up a lot in 2Q and I think
– and still stayed higher than expectations, which is a good thing of this past quarter.

A - Marc Grandisson

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I'm not sure what part of my remarks you mention you referred to but the thing about our
ability to increase market share and being that relevant to our clients is most clients that
embraced risk based pricing are actually the ones who are gaining market share in the
industry and that's been – a phenomenon has been going on for several quarters. So yes,
by virtue of us being – there's much more nimbleness, if you will, at the – the more in the
non-bank loan originators than there are at the larger banks out there. And I think that for
the recent quarters, I think there's been a recognition that the larger banks might be
losing market share to those non-bank loan originators. And RateStar actually works much
better for those loan originator and actually helps them win business. So that's actually
helping us grow market share or maintain our market share to be released.

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. That's a good nuance to know. Sticking with mortgage insurance, I know this is
probably difficult, but is there any way that we could maybe try to size up how to measure
how much could be left in terms of the pace of reserve releases if the cure rates continue
to be significantly lower than historically? I mean, I guess – I don't know if you're using a
two-year average or three-year or a 10-year historical average. I'm assuming you're not
just assuming the rates that you've seen in 2017-2018 kind of overlay on the entire
portfolio. But just kind of curious if there's anything we can look at to better understand
and size up how that could trend if things do stay good for the foreseeable future as you
kind of mentioned in your prepared remarks in terms of your outlook for MI.

A - François Morin
Yeah. I'll say a couple of things on that. First, I mean, yeah, delinquency rates are at very
low levels, so we don't think they're going to go much lower than that. But the reality is
the performance has been very, very good. As you know, the reserving methodology in
the mortgage segment is very much a more of a mechanical prescribed exercise. There's
a lot less flexibility in the mortgage segment than there might be in the P&C side. So if the
delinquencies are there, yes, we can put up reserves for it; and if they are no longer
there, they cure, the reserves come down. So there's no in between. Is it delinquent? It's
Page 10 of 17

Date: 2018-10-31

FINAL

only delinquent, yes or no. And from there, the model we built produced the estimates
we carry or the reserves we have on the books.
So, to answer your question, I think maybe there is a bit more to go, but I think to be
honest, the levels that we saw this quarter have been extremely high and probably higher
than any of us here expected. So, if it happens again next quarter, say, well, I'd be
surprised. I'm not saying it can't happen, but it would be again a continuation of a very
favorable trend that the whole industry is seeing. We're not the only ones as you know
that are seeing these trends. But, again, I don't think they'll be there sustainable for an
extended period.

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then, lastly, just on capital. You mentioned that looking at some new
opportunities – I know you guys are always opportunistic and looking at things. Just curious
if you can give us a flavor whether it's primary insurance or reinsurance or MI or all of the
above that you're kind of looking at.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

It's pretty much all of the above. There are possibilities, and we'll be communicating with
the market as and when we find out. If they do find out, they'll come out to fruition. So,
yes, the answer is all of them.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is
open.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Yes. Good morning. My first question is going back to the discussion on your insurance
business. So, obviously, the higher non-cat losses drove the increase in the quarter. But
I'm just trying, as we think about going forward and you guys getting to kind of that 95%
target, can you just give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing with inflation,
anything that you guys are watching out for – you think about setting your picks as we think
about the margin outlook for the business for 2019?

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. So the trend is a very interesting and important discussion. The problem is nobody
will really know what it looks like until five or six years from now. Historically, trend in the
insurance industry has been outpacing the core CPI increase and we've seen the CPI at
about 1.7% to 1.8% over the last four or five years, which would mean to me that a trend –
and if you look at the spread over that historically, it was 100 bps above that. So the
inflation on claims for insurance claims is always higher than CPI. I just want to make sure
it's clear here. We've seen 250 bps above this over the last four, five years. So there is a
lot of uncertainty on this. We are trying to do two things, right? And one of them is
portfolio construction. We try to focus on more primary policies because we think that the
excess portfolios will have a lot more uncertainty in terms – if we turn out to be wrong on
a trend on a pricing, the trend is going to impact the excess insurance market a lot more
than the primary market. And then, second, we are pricing for those kinds of trend or give
us a range around those trend and putting a cushion that we're not on the wrong side of
the decimal when we actually produced the results.
There is also other things, Elyse, that help us. We could buy reinsurance to help us shape
around the expect margin. But by and large, it's a give and take and working through with
the marketplace, and really portfolio construction, and also focusing on a business where
– you heard us talk about travel and property, right? Those two lines of business would be
lines where inflation is a lot less relevant because you're going to tend to find out what
inflation truly is much quicker than let's say any E&S casualty or high excess workers comp.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then in terms of the tax rate, I know there's potential for some changes
as we get closer at the end of this year. Do you still think your rate will kind of stay in that
9% to 12% range as we think about 2019?

A - François Morin
Too early to tell. We think it's not a bad place to start. We're in the middle of planning for
2019, and all I can say is we will give you more color with the year-end call. I'd say once
we're into 2019, we'll have more visibility on how things are shaping up and the mix of
business in what jurisdictions and how we think that'll play out.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then one last question on mortgage. Your market share seems like it
might have grown a little bit this quarter, but you – maybe slightly around 25% or a little bit
higher. You had been taking that down after the deal, and then it started to come back up
earlier this year. As I thought you guys kind of got ahead with RateStar and some of the
other in adjusting your pricing, and so others probably kind of caught up this quarter. So I
just want to get a full sense of what's really – do you see kind of that 25% or so as a share
that you would expect to maintain, and how should we think about that going forward?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

So, first, we don't run the business, as you guys know, on a market share basis. We just
provide our best foot forward with our rate in our approach to risk based pricing and try to

give good service to our clients and provide them with good products. And at the end of
the quarter, we count them, we look at where the chips fell and we just – this is what it is.
We have no design for market share. When we did the UG acquisition, we had thought
about – we had indicated we might be lower 20s just by virtue Some of it was by virtue is
the singles being less of a relevant product and we had delivered on this. And we like the
monthlies. I guess there is no answer, Elyse. I don't know where we're going to be. I just
know that what we've done this quarter generated x market share and we're happy with
that. I don't know what the future holds for us.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is
open.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi there, everyone. There was earlier call from Genworth who said that they lost a
major U.S. customer. I'm wondering how that shapes up in the market and whether you'll
get the same share of a large customer that the rest of the group did, or is your market
share in such a way that it's harder for you to take a big chunk out of that new opportunity
per se.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I think we're in the same market as Genworth from that perspective, right? I mean there
are large customers and that happens all the time that might decide to reallocate
between providers of mortgage insurance for various reasons. There's no grand design
here. I think that it could happen to us, it's happened to them, and we might be gaining
what they lost and vice versa. There's nothing magical there, Josh. I can't read much into it
much more than this.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay. And I saw there is decent amount of growth in property, marine, aviation. That's a
pretty big catch-all for a lot of things...

Yeah. It's property.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

...in insurance. What's going on exactly?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

It's really property. A lot of it came out of the – mostly London cat exposed business that
went through substantial rate changes, rate increases as a result of the 2017 cat event in
the areas like Texas and the Caribbean. So this is most of where the increase came from
on the insurance side. On the reinsurance side, very similar story. You'll see that the
property also grew dramatically. We have some growth in marine, but it's largely driven by
property. And for the record, it's not aviation. Just want to make sure, very clear. It's not
aviation.

Q - Joshua Shanker

And does this business have a lower normalized combined ratio than the aggregate
book? And what I'm getting at is is this going to cause one year from today the combined
ratio all things equal to lower than it is now?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Everything else being equal, it should. I think that the property cat exposed insurance or
reinsurance business will have a combined ratio of probably 60 or 70, 75. Whereas a
more or less cat exposed – this is absent any cat, right? If there's a cat, of course, it could
be a lot worse. Right. So, yes, you're right. It will depend on the cat activity in the year. But
all things being equal, your assumption is right.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Good luck.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

FINAL

Great. Thanks. François, you talked a little bit about lower other expenses. I guess you saw
that in reinsurance, mortgage and corporate. I'm hoping you could provide a little bit more
color really in terms of the sustainability of the third quarter versus prior 12 months run
rate.

A - François Morin
Well, no question that we look at our expenses. I mean that's something that we watch
very closely and this quarter just turned out there's always going to be movements in
quarter-to-quarter. So on the corporate side, yes, a little bit lower but I wouldn't read too
much into it. Sometimes there's just timing of some cash payments or what have you,
some expenses that we have throughout the year. So I wouldn't read too much into that.

Bloomberg Transcript

The reality on the reinsurance side is their lower compensation which is a direct result of
the performance of the units. No question that as we accrue bonuses throughout the
year, they are based on an expected ROE, which this year turns out may not be as good
as it has been in prior years, and we're adjusting for that. So, certainly, you think that the
operating expenses should adjust over time based on the profitability of the units. And
there is a reality there's also a couple of miscellaneous payments here and there that will
move the needle. But, again, the message is yes, we keep looking at it. We're trying to be
as diligent and do as good a job making sure that we're spending the money in the right
places and making the right investments in our people, in our technology, in our systems.
But there's no question there's going to be some movements from quarter to quarter.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. In terms of mortgage, I guess would the underlying things be getting better?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Say it again, Meyer, please, I didn't catch up, I didn't catch this.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

I'm sorry. So the other expenses in mortgage insurance declined. I don't know if it's
significantly a lot, but $7 million, $7.5 million from the second quarter to the third, and I
would naively maybe expect the better cure rate to drive more incentive comp better
than last year.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Well, that was – second quarter, we had accrual for a lot of...

A - François Morin
Yeah. Yeah.

Page 15 of 17

...equity-based compensation.

FINAL

A - François Morin
Yeah. There's the timing of the second to third quarter. Second quarter is historically
where we've done our equity grants, and there's a spike there across the board for all
units. There is also depending on whether it is retirement-age people or not, there's a
different way of accounting for the grants. But that's really why comparing second quarter
to third quarter is something that you've got to be careful with. And just to give you a bit
of a heads up as you plan ahead and maybe on a year, overall 12-month period, it doesn't
make a huge difference, but we're contemplating moving the equity-based awards from
the second quarter to the first quarter next year. So, again, we'll give you more color
when and if we get there, but that's a possibility we're exploring right now to make those
all in the first quarter.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. That's very helpful. And then bigger picture question I guess for Marc. If you were to
isolate insurance segment casualty pricing, I guess, what do you see in terms of rate
increase accelerating, if at all?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Whether we do or not. Yeah. Most of the rate increases we've seen in casualty over the
last two, three years were led by commercial auto and it's still very hard to get significant
rate increases outside of that realm. And I think, as you know, Meyer, that is slowing down.
I'm not judging whether it should or not, but I think that we're seeing that the rate
increases are slowing down, because it went through two, three years of significant rate
increase. (00:44:05). We still are able to push rate increase in some of the E&S casualty
that have some auto exposure. But if you don't have auto exposure, it's still not clear that
you can get those rate change accelerate or getting higher.
And again, I think the rates on the E&S casualty will react, will start to accelerate when and
if we see losses emerging. We believe we will, but we've been wrong before. But since
the downside of being wrong is too painful, would take a pause and take a step back and
just wait for (00:44:44).

Q - Meyer Shields

Okay. Thank you very much.

A - Marc Grandisson
