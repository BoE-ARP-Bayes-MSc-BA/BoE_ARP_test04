MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day everyone. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call of Everest Re
Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks
and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice
President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Elizabeth B. Farrell

{BIO 1986541 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's Second Quarter 2017
Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's
President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, Chief Financial Officer; John
Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President of
North American Insurance Operations.
Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include
extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note
that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as
statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various
risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or
expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in
connection with such statements.

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Thanks, Beth, and good morning to all. We are pleased to be able to report $246 million
of net income for the quarter, which was $90 million above last year's second quarter. On
a year-to-date basis, net income rose $210 million to $537 million. These results were
primarily driven by excellent underwriting results of $130 million for the quarter and $313
million on a year-to-date basis, which include $54 million of cap losses in second quarter
and $74 million in the six month results.
These results are improving year-over-year due to continued growth in premium, along
with a lower combined ratio, due in part to lower catastrophe losses in the quarter. More
important is the improvement evident in the Insurance segment where we have an
underwriting gain this year versus last. The attritional combined ratio from Insurance has
now reached 93.6% for the quarter. The various growth and underwriting initiatives we
have implemented are beginning to take hold. Overall premium is up $238 million or 17%,
with growth coming from both Reinsurance and Insurance; however on a percentage
basis, insurance is up 25% while reinsurance is up 14%.

Bloomberg Transcript

The growth in Insurance, which Jonathan will discuss in greater detail in a moment is well
diversified coming from several new business units. We are extremely encouraged by the
growth in all of our segments.
In the Reinsurance businesses, while due to market conditions there are areas where we
are contracting; there remains an array of opportunities in the credit and structured
solution areas that are contributing to profitable growth. In addition, as John Doucette will
cover in his report, proportional transactions including crop reinsurance are presenting
profitable opportunities in today's market environment.
The non-U.S. segments have also been a reasonable growth area for us more recently, as
we have added resources there and established new locations. While Reinsurance is still a
challenged space, we have been successful in achieving better than market returns due
to our ability to reallocate our capacity in scale through the better return in opportunities.
Our size and relationships matter in this type of market. Scale also plays a meaningful role
in the success we've been having in the Insurance segment. The ability to operate in
sophisticated lines of business with meaningful capacity and a strong balance sheet with
A-plus ratings matter to customers and brokers. These factors have also enable us to
attract terrific talent and armed with our financial strength, have propelled us to over $1
billion of premium in the first half of the year.
At the same time, we have eliminated a number of underperforming businesses. For
example, crop insurance and we have strengthened our reserve position. All this is
leading to a profitable first half and as earned premium begins to catch up with the
written premium, we would expect this profit picture to accelerate.

Our insurance operation is in the best position it has ever been, and is now a recognized
market to brokers and their customers.

FINAL

On the investment front, there was also a positive movement over the prior year as
income was up 9% for the first six months. This is a result of some rotation into limited
partnerships on public equities and traditional fixed income. However, our allocations are
still quite conservative relative to the industry.
Our investment team has done an outstanding job of enhancing performance through this
cycle while maintaining quality. Overall, our results were excellent with an ROE of 13% for
the first half. Our shareholder's equity growing to $8.6 billion and our market cap reaching
$11 billion. These factors have led us to just recently being added to the S&P 500, a great
accomplishment and acknowledgement to our shareholders and employees.
Now, I'll turn it over to Craig for the financial report, and look forward to your questions in
a bit. Thank you. Craig?

Thank you, Dom, and good morning everyone. Everest had a solid quarter of earnings,
with net income of $246 million. This compares to net income of $156 million for the
second quarter of 2016. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $537 million compared
to $327 million for the first half of 2016. The primary differences were an improved
underwriting result, higher capital gains, higher investment income, lower catastrophe
losses and lower foreign exchange losses compared to the first half of 2016.
Net income included $50 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $30
million of capital losses in the first half of 2016. After-tax operating income for the second
quarter was $227 million, compared to $134 million in 2016. Operating income, year-todate, was $487 million, compared to $357 million for the first six months of 2016.
The overall underwriting gain for the group was $330 million for the first half, compared
to an underwriting gain of $234 million in the same period last year. All segments reported
underwriting gains for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis.
The year-to-date combined ratio for the group was 88.3%, down from 90.7% reported in
the first half of 2016, with lower catastrophe losses contributing to this favorable variance.
In the second quarter of 2017, the group saw $54 million of current year catastrophe
losses, net of Reinsurance.
Of the total, $25 million related to wildfires in South Africa, $15 million related to U.S.
storms in Colorado, and $14 million related to floods in Peru. This compares with $124
million of catastrophes during the second quarter of 2016.
On a year-to-date basis, catastrophe losses totaled $74 million, compared to $134 million
for the first half of 2016. Excluding the catastrophe losses, the current year attritional

FINAL

combined ratio through the first six months was 85.6%, essentially flat from the 85.7% for
the first half of 2016. Our expense ratio remains at 5.8% for the first two quarters of 2017.
From investments, pre-tax investment income was $135 million for the quarter and $257
million year-to-date on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was up 9%
from one year ago. This result was primarily driven by the increase in limited partnership
income, which was up $40 million for the first half of 2016 primarily due to the turnaround
in energy-related investments compared to last year. The pre-tax yield on the overall
portfolio was 2.9%, with a duration of just over three years.
Foreign exchange is reported in other income. For the first half of 2017, foreign exchange
losses were $5 million, compared to $31 million of foreign exchange losses in the first six
months of 2016. The 2016 foreign exchange losses reflected the weakening of the British
pound during 2016 related to the Brexit vote.
Other income also included $4 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re in the first
six months of 2017, compared to $3 million of income in the first half last year. The
increase reflects the lower level of catastrophe losses during the first half of 2017
compared to 2016, resulting in a higher profit share to Everest.

Bloomberg Transcript

On income taxes, similar to the first quarter of 2017, the 9% year-to-date effective tax rate
on operating income was lower than the expected range for the year. The 2017 rate is
lower than the 10% tax rate for the full year 2016 due to a FASB tax accounting change
related to share-based compensation and the utilization of foreign tax credits for years
2008 and prior. These two items reduced the effective tax rate by about 1 point.
The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses
for the remainder of the year. Should catastrophe losses come in lower than this estimate,
it would be expected that the tax rate would increase.
Stable cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $634 million for the first half of
2017, compared to $684 million in 2016. The decline reflects a higher level of paid
catastrophe losses in 2017 compared with 2016.
Shareholders equity for the group was $8.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, up
$500 million or 6% over year-end 2016. This is after taking into account capital return for
$103 million of dividends paid in the first half of 2017. Our capital position remains very
strong and continues to grow.
Thank you. And now, John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.

John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Thank you, Craig. Good morning. We are pleased to report another strong quarter with
$126 million of Reinsurance underwriting profit. The second quarter combined ratio
improved to 87.4% from 89.9% in the second quarter 2016.

FINAL

The loss ratio improvement of 1.2 points to 60.2% was driven by lower catastrophe losses,
offset by a 3.6 point increase in the attritional loss ratio. This was an anticipated outcome
and was mainly due to the crop reinsurance book new this year, as well as the increased
property pro rata writings, offset by reduced attritional loss ratios on the international
book.
Total gross written premium for the second quarter was $1 billion, an increase of 14%
compared to the prior Q2. This growth is due to several factors, but largely can be
attributed to $54 million of crop premium associated with our strategic crop reinsurance
relationship that resulted from the sale of Heartland last year.
In our U.S. Reinsurance segment, second quarter gross written premium was up 17% to
$475 million, driven by the new crop treaty and the impact of a large premium portfolio
out in Q2 2016. The second quarter combined ratio in this segment was up 8 points,
primarily due to the weighting of crop and property pro rata earned premium in the
quarter with higher attritional loss ratios.

Bloomberg Transcript

While both lines have higher combined ratios, they maintain attractive ROEs due to their
low capital consumption. The increased loss ratio was offset by a 1.5 point drop in the
expense ratio, mainly due to lower contingent commissions in the quarter.
Our International Reinsurance segment second quarter gross written premium was $320
million, down 6% partly due to some large one-off deals with strategic client written in the
prior year. Net written premium for the quarter was down 3%, but up 7% on a year-to-date
basis due to the impact of timing on the receipt of several accounts. The combined ratio
for the second quarter dropped to 93.7% from 115.8% in Q2 2016, due to lower
catastrophe losses given the Fort McMurray wildfires and the Ecuadorian earthquake last
year.
The attritional loss ratio also dropped 6.2 points to 50.1%, due to continued favorable loss
trends. The lower loss ratio was offset by a 2.6 point increase on the expense ratio,
primarily driven by the higher mix of pro rata premium affecting the commission ratio.
Our Bermuda segment second quarter gross written premium increased 47% to $238
million or up 51% on a constant dollar basis. The growth was derived from new product
opportunities, timing of certain accounts, additional pro rata treaties in property, credit
and casualty line, increased writings in UK motor, post Ogden rate changes and some
large multi-class programs with core client. The combined ratio increased to 90.3% from
88.9% due to a 7.9 point increase in the loss ratio, offset by a 6.5 point decrease in the
expense ratio.
The loss ratio comparison was affected by a sizable capacity reserve release in 2016, a
shift in business mix and an increase in the current year loss ratio due to the change in the
Ogden discount rate this year. The drop in commission was caused by a larger mix of
business with naturally lower commission ratios.

FINAL

Turning to the 6/1 and 7/1 renewal, Everest continued to dynamically allocate capital to
opportunities with the best risk-adjusted returns. Rather than chase the market down on
non-performing deal, we reduced or declined these and selectively deployed capacity
towards deals that were priced well.
On balance, this approach resulted in similar amounts of capacity deployed with only a
marginal deterioration in expected returns. This ability to successfully shift risk capital to
the benefit of our overall portfolio which grew at 6/1 in Florida and at 7/1 in the U.S.,
Canada, Latin America, Bermuda, London, Zurich, Singapore, China and Australia,
highlighting our very diversified portfolio and global origination capabilities. We also wrote
more structured and customized transactions that are somewhat more shielded from
market pressures.
International property rates were on average down about 5% for us this 1/1 – this 7/1 with
some isolated pockets of rate increases in loss affected area.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the U.S. property markets, June 1 XOL rates continue to edge down. Lower-rated,
smaller reinsurers, and non-traditional players bore more of the brunt of the rate
pressure. As cedents gravitated to higher-rated leading reinsurers like Everest, who
received larger lines overall and better signings on the more attractively priced layers.
We also cut participation on poorly performing XOL deals. Despite declining their
placements, we typically continue to trade with many of those clients on different
products or different attachment point. We saw ongoing demand for our capacity on
higher layers, where we currently find better risk adjusted returns. This combination of
strategies resulted in a better than market outcome for us, as we saw rates for our
Florida XOL June 1 book being closer to down only about 3%, and the rest of our U.S. July
1 book being closer to flat.
In addition, having been impacted by Hurricane Matthew and AOB claim issues, some
Florida exposed pro rata deal saw improved reinsurance terms, and we deployed more
capacity accordingly to that.
With our strong franchise, we have been able to increase our depth in various U.S. and
international markets, continue to expand in areas dislocated by loss activity or grow with
existing clients in new lines business.
Repeatedly, we are a go-to-market for shortfall covers, as market stabilization in these
specific lines prevent deals from completing at aggressive firm order terms. In our
causality book, reinsurance terms are mostly stable but original rate and loss trends
pressure economics. We judiciously deploy our capital and cutback when necessary,
favoring lines with healthier returns.
Recently, some large casualty deals were not completed at the firm order terms, resulting
in either not placing the deal and the clients retaining it net or the buyer had to improve
terms for the reinsurers to get the deal fully priced, both signaling the casualty market is
trying to find a floor.

FINAL

The persistent strength and financial success of the Everest franchise reflect the value
that we are constantly trying to deliver to our reinsurance clients. We continually strive to
build enduring and strategic client relationships, highlighted by the fact that 75% of our
reinsurance clients have been trading with us for at least a decade and over 50% of our
clients worldwide have been trading with us for over 30 years.
Leveraging our leading global franchise, our empowered underwriters nimbly provide
customized solutions to our client, earning us a first look at new and unique market
opportunities. Consequently, we remain optimistic about our future and our ability to
deploy capital profitably despite the tough market. All said, the mid-year renewals
continued the macro theme of delivering the most value for reinsurance clients at the
best cost.
Thus, the reinsurance market continues to sprint towards: one, more capital efficiency
through size, scale and diversification; two, alternative risk transfer mechanisms to
enhance capital efficiency and best match capital to risk; three, increased focus on
distribution to access profitable business which is becoming increasingly more important;
and four, improved operational and expense efficiencies.

Bloomberg Transcript

Those reinsurers that can execute on these objectives will succeed in both good and bad
reinsurance markets, but those that do not could be disintermediated or diminished as
the reinsurance value chain compresses. Everest continues to remain nimble in its
approach to this change in market environment, adapting its operating strategies to
ensure success today, and into the future in the new reinsurance world order.
Thank you. And now, I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.

Jonathan M. Zaffino

{BIO 16652236 <GO>}

Thank you, John, and good morning. Our global specialty insurance operations delivered
a solid quarter of performance. The significantly transformed Everest Insurance platform
continue to take shape and the momentum we are generating in the market as a result
remains encouraging.
The second quarter marks the highest level of quarterly gross written premium realized in
our insurance operations history. The achievement of this milestone was a result of highlydiversified growth generated from over 150 specialty products despite no premium
contribution from the now divested Heartland Crop portfolio.
Importantly, this quarter build upon the underwriting profitability achieved in the first
quarter of this year. Most notably, when compared to the second quarter of 2016, we
achieved an excess of $30 million of improvement to underwriting profit. The many
strategic actions executed upon since 2015 are beginning to take hold and evidence
themselves in our results.
Turning to the financial results for the quarter and year-to-date period. As in prior
quarters, due to the divestiture of Heartland in late third quarter of 2016, I will discuss
Page 7 of 20

comparative results excluding this business.

FINAL

For the second quarter of 2017, the Global Insurance operations produced $569 million in
gross written premium, an increase of $164 million or 41% over second quarter 2016, a
tremendous result considering the challenging market conditions.
On a year-to-date basis, we achieved $1 billion in gross written premium, again another
record performance. This represents growth of $240 million or 31% over the comparable
period in 2016. Contributions were relatively balanced across most underwriting divisions.
The significant addition of new products which continue to gain scale, coupled with strong
performance from our many existing product areas, namely Accident and Health in the
quarter, contributed to this excellent result. This represents the 10th consecutive quarter
of growth for our Global Insurance operations.
Also in the quarter, our new product launches and recently assumed portfolios
contributed 19% to total premium production, along with an additional 4% from our Lloyd
platform; numbers that are consistent for the year-to-date period.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let me offer a bit more context at the divisional level. Our property portfolio experienced
a meaningful growth in the quarter and year-to-date period. The U.S. wholesale property
book, aided in part by the previously announced renewal rates transaction, closed at the
end of the first quarter was a large driver of this growth. Further contributing was the
steady expansion of both our Inland Marine and newly-launched retail property groups.
Growth in various other property portfolios globally was balanced and in line with our
expectations. Globally, this line represents roughly 28% of our year-to-date premium
production.
Everest Specialty Underwriters. The division focused on professional and management
liability in various other specialty products also grew nearly 25% over the prior year-todate period. Growth, however, was not experienced across the board. Some of our
management liability books were down significantly in the same period as we simply did
not find the rating environment to be supportive of our profitability ambitions. We have
been able to redeploy our resources to areas within ESU that better meet our objectives.
The Everest Risk Management division, which houses our primary and large account
casualty operation, our monoline work comp unit, the commercial casualty team, and our
multinational group also achieved meaningful growth in the quarter and year-to-date
period. Overall, premium production increased 41% and 33%, respectively, over the prior
year quarter and year-to-date period and profitability remains solid.
This business is also strong bellwether of the growth in our brand across the market. In
the case of large account primary, we work with our brokers and risk managers to design
thoughtful risk financing casualty programs, inclusive of a suite of services.

FINAL

There are many hurdles to entering this business, yet we find ourselves in a position of
growing strength as the operation continues to mature. Everest Underwriting Partners, our
delegated authority operation, was essentially flat in the quarter and, in fact, down 3% in
the year-to-date period. Yet, profitability was the strongest we've seen in several
quarters. Impacting our growth were various underwriting actions taken to address a few
underperforming portfolios, namely non-standard auto.
Finally, our Lloyd's operation also continued its expansion. The syndicate contributed $24
million to the insurance growth in the quarter and $45 million year-to-date. The steady and
cautious build of our portfolio continues with a balanced contribution from several lines of
business, including professional indemnity, financial institutions, liability, accident and
health, and contingency.
Again, we remain deliberate in our growth pursuits and we'll continue to seek
opportunities for profitable expansion. So, again, meaningful growth coming from
balanced contributions across the global portfolio. Yet, not all divisions are growing as
profitability remains our number one objective.
Turning to net premiums. As we've shared in the past, net written premium slightly lags
gross written premium growth due to the marginally more conservative reinsurance
position we've taken to support the growth across our underwriting divisions.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net earned premium in the quarter was $364 million, an increase of $70 million or 24%.
For the year-to-date period, net earned premium of $688 million increased by $118 million
or 21% over the prior year period.
Earned premium growth has lagged net written premium growth due to a few factors.
First, our growth rate has accelerated in the recent quarters as our new underwriting
divisions become fully operationlized in the market. Second, various lines of business we
are writing, long-term very profitable lines, earn over a period longer than 12 months. As
these businesses gain additional scale, we expect earned premium growth to accelerate,
which we are confident will lead to growing underwriting profit.
Turning to the combined ratio. For the quarter, the GAAP combined ratio was 99.1%,
almost a 10 point improvement from the second quarter of 2016. While we are pleased to
have produced an underwriting profit of just over $3 million in the quarter, there were
some headwinds from various cat events that distort the progress we expect to show on
a run rate basis, which I'll get into. On a year-to-date basis, the GAAP combined ratio was
98.8%, a 4 point improvement over the first half of 2016.
Our attritional results for the quarter and year-to-date period are 93.6% and 95.7%,
respectively. This compares favorably to 2016 second quarter of 95.7% and 95.8% yearto-date. So, again, improvement in the quarter and stability on the year-to-date result.
The quarter's loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improved significantly from the
prior-year period to 70.3% from 80.2%. As you'll recall, the second quarter of 2016 was
impacted by significant cat activity from the Texas hailstorms and the Fort McMurray
Page 9 of 20

Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2017-07-25

FINAL

wildfires, which combined had a 13.1 point impact to the loss ratio. While this quarter was
also impacted by a variety of well-publicized cat events, it was not of the same magnitude
of last year.
On an attritional basis, the second quarter 2017 loss ratio improved to 64.8%, 3 points
better than the 67.8% attritional produced for the first quarter of this year and 2 points
better than the attritional loss ratio of 66.9% in the second quarter of 2016. We are
beginning to see the drift down in the attritional loss ratio based upon improved mix, the
benefits from the many new businesses launched and the strategic underwriting actions
of the past two years.
Looking at the year-to-date period, the GAAP loss ratio improved to 69.3% in the prior
year period of 74.3%, a 5 point betterment. The attritional loss ratio also improved a full
point to 66.2% from 67.3%.

Bloomberg Transcript

A few additional comments, first, as I mentioned the second quarter experienced another
elevated level of cat activity in the U.S. PCS cat events 17, 32 (31:38), the Colorado
hailstorms in particular impacted our North American results by almost 4 points. Second,
the significant convective storm events across the first and second quarter added roughly
2 points to our attritional loss ratios; certainly, all manageable outcomes based on the
profitable growth in our earned premium base, but nonetheless creating some quarterly
pressure on results.
We also recognized a small amount of adverse prior year development from our nonstandard auto book of nearly 2 points in the quarter. This is an area we continue to deemphasize in our go-forward portfolio. Offsetting these increases to our lost ratio was a 4
point improvement in the Accident and Health division's accident year loss ratio. Our A&H
group delivered an outstanding quarter.
Our expense ratio in the second quarter was 28.8%, down from the first quarter result of
30.2%. For the year-to-date period, the expense ratio is 29.5%, up slightly from the 28.5%
in the comparable period of 2016. Our operating expense ratio for the second quarter
was 12.5% compared to 12.4% for the prior year quarter, essentially flat. Year-to-date
operating expenses were 12.8% for 2017 compared to 12.2% last year.
Again, we anticipate the expense ratio has stabilized as we continue upon our growth
plan, and as earned premium continues to come through. As we have stated in prior calls,
an expense ratio of roughly 30% remains very competitive in the specialty insurance
segment.
Turning to the operating environment. The second quarter trended quite similar to the
first quarter. Suffice it to say that it's a competitive market and underwriting excellence is
paramount in this environment. Clarity of risk appetite, clear knowledge of the rating
environment, and the thoughtful assumption of risk are all key attributes of our approach.
As in prior quarters, the overall level of rate change can vary meaningfully by major line of
business. In general and outside of commercial and personal auto, there are various
Page 10 of 20

FINAL

degrees of rate pressure; workers' compensation, particularly in California, professional
liability and various causality lines are all feeling some degree of mild pressure generally in
the flat to mid single-digit range, again consistent to prior quarters.
Commercial and personal auto remain the outliers and are each achieving low doubledigit rate increases across our portfolio. As discussed in prior calls, we feel that U.S.
property market continues to find the bottom. While the rate environment has not turned
consistently positive as yet, we feel it is flattening out, again with some caveat between
cat and non-cat exposed areas. So another quarter of predictable trend for our each line
yet with a tone of stabilization across the overall portfolio.
In conclusion, we are pleased with our results to-date. As our portfolio continues to gain
scale, we are encouraged by the increased resiliency of our platform to achieve
underwriting profitability. Our attritional results are especially encouraging. Our many new
and existing colleagues continue to execute well on their individual underwriting mandates
and we look forward to continuing our momentum and reporting back to you on our
progress next quarter.
Now, back to Beth for Q&A.

Thank you, Jon. Operator, we are ready to take questions at this time.

Q&A
Operator
We'll have our first question from Elyse Greenspan.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. My first question is on the Reinsurance growth. Pretty strong growth
again in the quarter. Last quarter, you guys had pointed to about high single-digit growth
as a sustainable level that you saw at the time for that book; the second quarter was
stronger than that, and I think part of that was probably due to some of those property
pro rata signings you pointed out. But how do you see, I mean the rest of the year
trending just in terms of on the growth prospects of your Reinsurance business just based
of how you saw June and July renewals and how you're thinking things through right now?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Elyse, this is Dom and I'll ask John to comment as well. But as we mentioned and you
mentioned, part of it was due to the shift to a couple of new proportional deals, which
that premium then will have an impact on the remainder of the year, so that will affect
premium growth. And then also the crop – the new crop reinsurance transaction, which will
also have similar impact on the remainder of the year. But absent that, the renewal

seasons are pretty much over other than we had in July 1, but again most of the activity is
in the first half of the year in terms of renewals and new business opportunity.

FINAL

The growth areas for us though continue to be mortgage credit, structured solutions, and
that's where absent the other items I just mentioned, that's where frankly the growth
opportunities are and that our previous guidance on that in terms of growth as you
indicated a high single-digit would still remain. Unless John has anything to add to that.

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

I agree.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Does that answer your question?

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then, in terms of the Insurance business, pretty strong growth and a lot of
commentary that you guys gave. If the growth remains at 40%, do you think that based as
how you put it all together that you could maintain an underlying margin in the low 90s?
And one question I had on, you did call out, John the convective storms of about 2 points,
is that stuff that sell outside of your cat definition in the Q2, meaning that the margin
might have been better adjusting for that, I'm just trying to tie that together? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Yes. The 2 points that Jonathan referenced falls within the attritional number that he
quoted, so that's not, in our vernacular it's not a cat, all right. They're cat events, but they
don't yet disclosed by us as a cat or recorded in our numbers as a catastrophe. It is in the
attrition.
And again, in terms of the growth, no, I think, we said for some time that we would
anticipate an improvement in our attritional, and we're at those levels where we think it is
sustainable. We have great diversification across the entire platform. So, we're not
dependent on any one line of business or any one product, which not unlike the
Reinsurance sector, enables us to increase our capacity or increase our appetite in those
lines of business that we feel are giving us the requisite profit and return on our capital,
and de-emphasize those classes of business that are not. It doesn't mean we totally
withdraw, but it allows us to shift our capacity around. So, several new business units and
allows for great diversity in of course the entire platform. John, if you want to add?

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

No. (39:31) well done.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then one last question. Can you talk the losses in the quarter, you guys had
some losses in South Africa and Peru. Can you just talk about your exposure there, and

what kind of returns are you getting in normalized years in both of those markets?

FINAL

A - Jonathan M. Zaffino

{BIO 16652236 <GO>}

Good morning, Elyse. It's Jon. So, we have write a significant portion of our business
outside the U.S., and have been strong in many countries around the world including
those. And we write in each of those countries, we have a strong franchise, an attractive
book of business, and writing for many years. They would typically run in the 80s across
the cycle. So, 80s combined ratio, it could go up or down based on cat activity.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning. First question is on the follow-up in the Insurance
segments. The – if second quarter top-line growth is 41% ex-crop, and a margin
improvement of a 210-basis point, it's very impressive. I just wonder, you mentioned it's a
very competitive marketplace. Can you tell us a little more how exactly do you gain
market share in the marketplace, and why actually improving your margin? Because
assuming if you grow very fast, probably, there are certain so-called, I don't know, you
could term the new business apparently apply to these line of business as well. Can you
maintain the margin or even improve the margin going forward?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Kai, this is Dom. I don't necessarily agree with your assertion or assumption that growth
comes – with growth, comes underwriting deterioration. It's as I just kind of described in
response to Elyse's question of diversification of costs, many different product segments
allows us to maintain our underwriting integrity and increase capacity for those lines
business where we're getting adequate returns.
We do think that we are improving our attritional and there's still some improvement that
we think we can garner, particularly in the property segment, remembering at the first half
of the year. For property as Jonathan pointed out, had a number of cat events but also as
we described in non-cat cat events, adding 2 points to the attritional. And we anticipate
that as the year plays out that we'll have some improvement in those areas. So we would
certainly anticipate an improving combined ratio picture on the Insurance side, again
coming from diversity, diversification amongst business unit and products within those
various business units, and remembering that we are a specialty insurer and we are not

writing small commercial. We're not in the BOP business or those areas that are subject
to, in our view, some of the more competitive pressures in the marketplace.

FINAL

A - Jonathan M. Zaffino

{BIO 16652236 <GO>}

I would add to that Kai that there's really a couple of things here to remember. Number
one is that we have doubled our underwriting staff over the last two years. So we have a
lot more boots on the ground, seeking profitable opportunities in the lines of business we
have chosen.
Secondly, we have launched literally dozens of products, so to Dom's point about
diversification across the platform, it's significant. It's coming from a number of different
areas and to the point I tried to raise earlier it's not – growth is not linear across our
platform, it's not at all moving in lock step. There are several actions being taken still to try
to drive a better attritional result. So we're seeing now the effects of all those efforts that
have happened over the last couple of years.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you for the expansive answers. My second question on Reinsurance side. You
talked a little bit more about what caused the deterioration, 210 basis point, what are the
moving parts? And you mentioned by the cropping reinsurance about property pro rata
treaties. Could you quantify how much each basically contributed to the year-over-year
deterioration and do you think that that will be a kind of normal stable run rate going
forward?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Will what be a stable run rate? The attritional that we have on the Reinsurance portfolio?

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Yeah, exactly, yeah.

A - Jonathan M. Zaffino

{BIO 16652236 <GO>}

Well, some of that is dependent upon what happens with future rate levels, right? And I
don't know that we have all the details I could give you there. And we do have some of it.
So growth in crop, that have 4.6 point impact. We had some of the increase due to pro
rata, had an impact of approximately 3 points. So that will give you some indications on
the attrition.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's in the...

A - Jonathan M. Zaffino

{BIO 16652236 <GO>}

That's what was driving the higher attrition.

That's in the U.S. Reinsurance segment?

{BIO 16652236 <GO>}

FINAL

That's U.S., yes.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay, great. Last one...

A - Jonathan M. Zaffino

{BIO 16652236 <GO>}

And on the international side, we had a 6 point improvement in some of the operations
there. Middle East, Africa showing some improvement in the non-cat loss trend. On the
Bermuda side, we had an increase due to higher ELR on some of the treaties we've
written. So it varies across the entire portfolio. And the reason I kind of go through some
of this in detail is to reflect the fact that it's what I said before, Everest generally has an
operating strategy, moves around various lines of businesses. And I can't tell you
necessarily what one month, for example, will bring us and we could change our portfolio
again. So...

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right. And...

A - Jonathan M. Zaffino

{BIO 16652236 <GO>}

...it's a little too difficult to answer.

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

And, Kai, this is John. Just to add a little bit color to that. And a lot of it is you also may be
better to look at the year-to-date numbers, as opposed to the quarter, because there's
always going to be quarterly volatility just from large risk losses that happened, non-cat,
cat events, or weather loss that happened that moved these things around. So we think
the year-to-date attritional combined ratio is more reflective for the Reinsurance
operations.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Great. Thank you so much. I'll probably get back in the queue. Thank you.

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. Good morning, everyone. You guys have always advised (46:52) yourselves on
expense ratio and expense management were not being much better than peers. To
what extent do you need to grow the Insurance business to be competitive from an
expense management standpoint?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

What do we need to grow the expense ratio to? Is that...

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

No, no, no, the overall volumes for you as a scale where you think that you cannot have a
competitive run rate expense ratio better than peers?

A - Jonathan M. Zaffino

{BIO 16652236 <GO>}

Hi, Josh. This is John. I think we're there, candidly. I think we're...

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

You're there now?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jonathan M. Zaffino

{BIO 16652236 <GO>}

We're there now. I mean, if you look at where we are year-to-date, I think that expense
ratio compared to those who write the lines of business we do across the geographies
we write them, I think it will stack up very, very well. In fact, well above the peer average.
Secondly, when you look at a lot of the activities that we have pursued, our investments
have been all across our platform. We're equally excited about the investments we're
making in our claims departments, our actuarial teams, technology, et cetera. So I think we
have a pretty good feel for the expenses that are coming into the system and against the
earned premiums that we're forecasting. I think we feel pretty good about it.

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay. And as you grow optimal personal capital, you are not buying back stock, you're
using it to grow your own business. Are you growing at the pace of excess capital
generation or is that something that you factor that if you had more capital you could
grow faster or are you growing faster than you're generating capital?

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Our capital growth is kind of consistent with our premium growth. Our premium growth is
– we have sufficient capital for the growth that we've had for the first half of the year. If
anything, our excess capital position has maybe just inched up very little bit, but not
enough to warrant that we would go back in in terms of them as short-term. We purchase
particularly at the levels that our stock is at today.

We'll go next to Meyer Shields, KBW.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. Two really quick questions. One, is it fair to infer within U.S.
Reinsurance that the movement to higher attachment points is limiting your exposure to
what seems to have been really bad non-catastrophe weather?

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, Meyer. This is John. There's certainly some of that that would, and I think that you saw
that last quarter as well that some of the noise. So, in general, market losses of a certain
size are going to be more an insurance loss than a reinsurance loss. And I think
directionally, given what we've been doing with the book, it would mean that it would take
larger, the real noteworthy headline cap losses and not just the things you see on TV with
the good video images. It would really take larger ones to cause larger losses for us.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. And then broadly, I guess, this would be Insurance and Reinsurance. There's
been a lot of commentary about sort of accelerating social inflation. Are you seeing that
and how are you booking that in your current (50:28)?

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

I'll ask Craig to speak to that.

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Social inflation, and its impact on our portfolio.

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

I think we always take a look at what the inflation is, when we look at loss cost trend on
the overall portfolio, Meyer, and we look at not only social inflation, but we look at
everything that's going on; claim inflation, social inflation. We look at the frequency and

Page 17 of 20



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2017-07-25

severity of the claims as they come through as well, but that's always part of our process
as we go through picking our loss estimates.

FINAL

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Yeah. And, Meyer, it's John. Just to add a little more. I think also there is no one simple
one-line answer to that. We have – across the group, we have 300 IBNR groups in many
lines of business, in many territories around it and what and how social inflation or claims
inflation or other things like that are driving loss cost. It is dynamic. It varies. I would say
though that we have spent a lot of time between feedback loops between pricing
actuaries and underwriters and reserving actuaries, and the underwriting in pricing to
make sure that we are thoughtful in how we think about that and are able to respond to
what we see as changing market conditions.

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

And that's not something that's new to the industry. It's something that all companies
have to deal with. As you look at our reserving history, I think it demonstrates that we're
properly taking those factors into account in establishing our reserve position.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right. No, no, that's very helpful. I'm just – I'm trying to get a handle on whether on the
sort of simplistic trends or aggregate trends that we look at from the outside, whether
there's anything material going on?

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

No. Loss cost trend has obviously been rather tamed for a number of years. And it's a
little tough to project when that social inflation, for example, kicks in but general inflation,
of course, has been relatively modest other than healthier trends, of course, which
impacts the work comp line most significantly.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank for. Just a couple of follow-ups. First one, there's a – on your Lloyd's business,
recently there is some additional interest in the acquisition in the marketplace. You are
building your own at this time, do you still prefer build versus buy?

Page 18 of 20



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td

FINAL

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Across all of our businesses that's our preference. It doesn't mean however that we
wouldn't if something came across our desk that looked very strategic and could propel
us to a different level more quickly, and didn't have huge integration issues and/or legacy
concerns, we'd certainly consider it. And of course, if you're pointing to Lloyd's. But I
would say that Lloyd's is a platform. It's not necessarily the entire strategy, if you will. It's a
platform that enables us to execute our Continental European strategy as well as outside
of North America and Europe. And we can – we have other areas that we're pursuing or
other platforms that we're considering again internal build, that would enable us to move
forward on those ventures.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Last one if I may for Craig is about the tax rate though. What's your normalized tax
rate, if you think about your budget level of catastrophe losses?

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Well, we typically have looked at a range before, Kai. When we look at our tax rate, we
essentially go and we look at with and without catastrophe losses, as you heard us say in
the past. So last year for 2016, was a mild year for tax rates. But – and we had a full year
effective tax rate of about 10%. What I would say to you is if we had no catastrophes in
the year; in other words more taxable income that rate could go as high as up to 13%. But
that would give you a relative range of where I would expect to be.

Mr. Addesso for any additional or closing remarks.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Again, thank you very much. And thanks again to all for your participation this morning in
the call and your questions. As we mentioned, the growth in the first half for us has been
strong, both Insurance and Reinsurance, but our first priority continues to be underwriting
profit. That's why you see us continually optimizing our portfolio on the Reinsurance side,
for example, as we change attachment points, increase pro rata, non-renewal of certain
layers, diversify into various regions and rotating to other risk classes like mortgage, credit
or structured solution. So it is with an emphasis on underwriting profit.

FINAL

In the Insurance segment, our underwriting strategy is product specialty and diversification
again, which is as I said earlier allows us to provide capacity to the most attractive areas
and also clearly minimize the impact of any one-line of business to the extent it reaches
some difficulty. So, diversification and specialization remain the cornerstone of what we
do. And so for the reasons that I just mentioned, we remain optimistic that through the
cycle we can outperform the overall market.
Again, thank you very much and I look forward to meeting with many of you in the weeks
ahead. Have a good day.
