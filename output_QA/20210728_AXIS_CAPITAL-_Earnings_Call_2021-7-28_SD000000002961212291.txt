Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. This has
been another strong quarter for AXIS, an additional data point that reinforces the positive
momentum in our positioning and performance which we believe is the outcome of a
multiyear effort to build a more profitable and resilient company.

Bloomberg Transcript

In both the Second Quarter and first half of 2021, we reported record operating earnings
per share underpinned by excellent production, strong underwriting and solid investment
income. We believe that we're only just beginning to show what we're capable of
achieving.
While the broader industry benefited from a relatively low cat quarter, the big story for
AXIS is the continued strengthening of our core underwriting performance. Our current
year ex-cat combined ratio of 88.7%, for the quarter, almost 3 points better than the prior
year, marked the seventh consecutive quarter since the Fourth Quarter of 2019 that we
have driven improvements in our underlying core results.
Our insurance segment followed a very strong start of the year with an even better
Second Quarter. Indeed, our insurance business is delivering performance on par with the
best companies in our industry, including strong growth and improvements across almost
all underwriting metrics to deliver an all-in quarterly combined ratio of 85.
Our work over the last few years has positioned us very favorably and the market is
experiencing the strongest conditions, and we're firmly on the front foot, leading to
record new business production. I'll expand on it later in our call, but we expect favorable
market conditions will continue well into 2022, providing us with an even more broader set
of opportunities to build on our progress.
Our reinsurance team is also leveraging current market conditions to further optimize
their contribution to our consolidated portfolio, and the team is delivering on its goals.
We're growing where it makes sense, holding the line where conditions are not as
attractive as they should be and meaningfully reducing catastrophe PMLs, all of which are
leading to a stronger, more profitable portfolio.

FINAL

I'll make a couple of observations about our premium production and reinsurance. We're
building the book of business that will drive the earnings profile that we want. Excluding
property and catastrophe, where we're targeting lower exposures, gross reinsurance
premiums written would be up 14% in the quarter. Importantly, as many of you have noted,
given the improved construction of our portfolio, we're keeping more of what we're
producing and net written premiums are up 8% this quarter, and that's what will be driving
profitable earned premium growth in the coming periods.
Moreover, our reinsurance team's consistent approach to underwriting profitability
continues to deliver sub-90s accident year ex cat combined ratios and an all-in quarterly
combined ratio of 90.
We're pleased with the progress that we're making across our company. We believe
we're making the right moves, and we have the wind at our backs. We worked hard to get
to this point, and we feel great about the direction that we're headed in. Throughout the
business, our team is playing to win. I'll now pass the floor to Pete, who will walk us
through the Second Quarter financials. Then I'll come back and discuss market trends.
We'll have our Q&A. Pete?

Peter Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Thank you, Albert. Good morning, everyone. This was an excellent quarter for AXIS, with a
number of positive highlights underscored by the continuing improvement in the
company's core underwriting results. During the quarter, we generated net income
available to common shareholders of $228 million and an annualized ROE of 19.3%.
Operating income was $171 million with an annualized operating ROE of 14.4%.
Diluted book value per share increased by $2.47 in the quarter to $55.50. This was
principally driven by the net income and partially offset by common share dividends. As
Albert noted, the consolidated current accident year combined ratio ex-cat and weather,
was 88.7% and or more than 2.5 points better than the prior year quarter, principally
driven by improvements within the insurance segment.
The consolidated current accident year loss ratio was 58.2%, a decrease of 3.3 points
over the prior year as both the ex-cat and cat loss ratios improved. The quarter's pretax
cat and weather-related losses net of reinsurance were $29 million or 2.5 points. There
was no change to the net loss estimate of $360 million established for the COVID-19
pandemic in 2020.
The consolidated G&A expense ratio was 14.1%, which is consistent with our expectations.
Overall operating efficiency and expense control remain important goals for us, and we
continue to target a G&A ratio in the low 14s for 2021. And lastly, on a consolidated basis,
fee income from strategic capital partners was roughly flat year-over-year.
Now we'll discuss the segments. I will start with the insurance segment where we had
impressive performance across a number of metrics. Gross premiums written increased
by 22.3% to $1.3 billion, a quarterly record for the segment. I would also note that the
Page 3 of 15



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2021-07-28

year-to-date production of $2.4 billion is a record for the first half of the year. The increase
primarily came from new business and favorable rate changes in the professional lines,
property lines and liability lines.

FINAL

During the quarter, the insurance current accident year combined ratio ex-cat and weather
was 84.5%, a 6.8-point improvement from last year, reflecting the combination of rate
change and underwriting actions we have taken to strengthen the portfolio.
The current accident year loss ratio, ex-cat and weather, decreased by nearly 4 points in
the quarter with all lines contributing with positive rate change. We saw the greatest
movement in the property lines resulting from not only the impact of favorable rate over
trend but also from improved experience driven by the underwriting actions that we have
taken.

Bloomberg Transcript

The acquisition cost ratio decreased by 3.2 points in the Second Quarter compared to
2020. Approximately 2/3 of the decrease is due to changes in business mix. As we have
written less high-cost property MGA business and more lower-cost professional lines and
liability business, where we get a favorable ceding commission. We also had about 1 point
of benefit in the quarter due to just some timing differences.
Now let's move on to the Reinsurance segment. The Reinsurance segment's gross
premiums written of $673 million for the Second Quarter was $6 million lower than the
prior year, due to decreases in property and catastrophe lines from nonrenewals. This
was partially offset by increases in liability and professional lines driven by favorable
market trends. We are comfortable with the reduction in premiums in our property
business as this is establishing a less volatile portfolio as is demonstrated by our much
lower reported PMLs.
During the quarter, the reinsurance current accident year combined ratio ex-cat and
weather increased by 0.9 point. This was caused by an increase in the G&A ratio due to a
decrease in fees, the ex-cat loss ratio and the acquisition cost ratio both are essentially
flat with the prior period.
Net investment income was $105 million for the quarter compared to net investment
income of $45 million for the Second Quarter of 2020. The quarter's exceptional net
investment income was primarily attributable to positive returns from our alternative
assets, principally the credit funds, real estate funds and private equity funds. This was
partially offset by a decrease in income from fixed maturities attributable to the
decreased yields on the portfolio.
At quarter end, the fixed income portfolio had a book yield of 2% and a duration of 3.1
years and our market yield was 1.4%. Overall, with continued improvement in most
operating metrics and positive momentum in our core underwriting book, this was a very
strong quarter for AXIS. That summarizes our Second Quarter results. With that, I'll turn
the call back over to Albert.

FINAL

Thank you, Pete. Let's do a brief overview of market conditions and outlook. We'll then
open the call for questions. We're continuing to see positive rate action across both of our
segments. For our Insurance segment, this was the 15th consecutive quarter in which we
reported overall rate increases and the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit average
rate hikes.
This quarter, the average insurance rate increase was a bit over 14%, which is up more
than 1 point sequentially from the First Quarter of this year and roughly flat with the prior
year period. We can see -- we continue to see a dynamic market responding to loss
trends and supply and demand pressures with some lines accelerating their rates of
improvements, while others have crested and some exhibiting a deceleration in the pace
of rate hikes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Nonetheless, substantially all lines are showing increases at or above loss cost trends.
Looking at our insurance segment by region. The North American market is showing the
larger average increase of 15%, while London International is up 13%. By class of business,
Professional lines saw the strongest pricing actions with average rate increases at 20%.
This is ahead of both last year's Second Quarter and this year's First Quarter, driven by
the rapid escalation in cyber lines. These have delivered accelerated increases in the
quarter, which reached more than 40% by June.
In other professional lines, London and Canada are stable, averaging close to 20%, while
in the U.S. rate increases are averaging in the low double digits. Liability lines averaged
close to 13%. Primary Casualty has remained generally stable at these levels, while the
pace of increase in AXIS Casualty is down from its highs. Marine liability remains strong in
the high teens. Property rate increases clustered at about 12%. That is only very modestly
down from last year's quarter, but sequentially, it's up from the First Quarter of this year.
Other specialty lines continue to do well in the low to mid-double digits with renewable
energy, where we're a global leader standing at close to 20%. Aviation is up more than
12% and several lines within our marine book are up in the mid- to high teens.
So with all the changes in the dynamic market, conditions remain quite strong, with 97% of
our insurance portfolio renewing flat to up and fully 60% of our portfolio by volume,
achieving rate increases of 10% or better.
Let's move on to reinsurance. We estimate that the overall reinsurance rate change was
up about 12% in the Second Quarter as compared to 11% in the first. By region, the North
American market was strongest with averages increasing about 13%, followed by EMEA,
LATAM at 12% and Asia at 7%. By class of business, liability came in just above 20%,
professionalizes followed at 15%, and property and cat trailed with averages only in the
mid-single digits.
Looking at the big renewal since we last spoke, for the June Florida renewals, there
continue to be an abundance of capital with heavy competition for the higher layers, all of
Page 5 of 15



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2021-07-28

which pressured pricing.

FINAL

While pricing was reported to be in the plus 5% to 20% range, the higher rate increases
were mostly in the harder to complete lower layers, most exposed to frequency losses.
For AXIS, we've continued to reduce our exposure in Florida as we do not believe that
pricing in this market has reached attractive levels.
Finally, during the July 1 renewals, which impact approximately 10% of our portfolio, we
saw overall rate increases in the 8% range. The July renewals relate mostly to North
American accounts where, on average, rate increases were about 10%. Other regions
were up in the low to mid-single digits. Specialty lines, including aviation, marine and A&H,
were in the 10% to 15% range. Putting it all together, our combined insurance and
reinsurance portfolios are averaging rate increases in the double digits for both the
quarter and the year-to-date.
And while we're seeing pricing increases coming down from their peaks in many lines,
others are moving up the net of which is we still anticipate that positive market conditions
will continue, with average price increases in line with or above loss costs into 2022 and
likely beyond.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you've heard me say in the past, it's essential that our industry maintained pricing
discipline as we face the cumulative impact of a number of headwinds, including low
interest rates, the longer-term impacts of the COVID pandemic, climate change and
extreme weather as well as loss cost inflation.
It goes without saying that we shouldn't confuse rate change with rate adequacy. The
recent price increases bring industry profitability to a barely acceptable level of rate
adequacy after many years of severe price competition and loss cost inflation. The
industry has not yet gotten ahead of the curve on loss costs or reserve adequacy. And
must sustain its discipline, especially in a low interest rate environment.
We're doing our part by pricing and reserving on the basis of prudent loss cost trends. But
given everything we see, we feel great about our future. We're encouraged by the
positive momentum in our performance, and we're capitalizing on favorable market
conditions. We're building a stronger, more resilient portfolio that we believe will
consistently deliver superior results.
We believe that the changes we've made to our company in the last few years have
resulted in much stronger market positioning and attractive specialty insurance and global
reinsurance markets and a more data-driven collaborative approach to portfolio
construction that prioritizes the profitability and stability of our consolidated results.
We're building an optimized hybrid underwriter that will deliver attractive returns to our
shareholders. We have a strong franchise grounded in the delivery of superior service to
our clients and partners in distribution. We have a terrific team, and we continue to recruit
great talent. We believe the future looks very bright for AXIS, and we look forward to

questions. Operator?

Questions And Answers
FINAL

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question today will come from Brian Meredith with UBS.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

I got a couple here for you, Albert. The first one, let's talk a little bit about cyber. Perhaps
one, can you remind us kind of the size of your cyber book gross and net basis? Then on
the cyber book, I appreciate that you're getting some substantial rate increases. What's
going on with terms and conditions and kind of contract structure to perhaps mitigate
some of the loss activity?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. So I think that with regards to the changes in terms and conditions, as you know,
we're one of the leaders in cyber globally. So we've been on top of this thing very much
since the beginning of last year. So since that time, we were noticing that there were
significant model changes, increases in ransomware attacks. I think the view of
aggregation and systemic risk in cyber really started to increase.
And so since last summer, we started to make significant amendments to our risk
appetite and to the portfolio construction. Among the things that we did, we reduced our
limits. We increased deductible and we set up much more stringent underwriting criteria,
including stronger vetting of insured cyber defense capabilities. We've also increased the
services and support we provide our insurers to make sure they're better prepared to
defend against breaches and to respond post the breach event.
And as you also know, we reported to this last quarter, we also purchased more
reinsurance to protect ourselves through the transition period. The good news is there
are other -- the leaders in the industry are kind of acting with us. So there's a, I would say
a consistent effort, which makes these actions a lot easier to put in effect because
everybody is looking at it that way.
So what are we thinking as a result of that? We're seeing significantly less exposures
because the more stringent underwriting criteria are affecting it. And just to give you a
sense, notwithstanding the fact that our Cyber submissions are up meaningfully yearover-year. Our quote count is actually down by almost half year-over-year. We've reduced
limits. We've reduced certain classes of business. Pricing is going up.
And so -- right now, actually, if you look at the Second Quarter, it's essentially a 100
combined ratio business. So the problem with cyber, if you would, it's not necessarily -and by the way that 100 combined ratio is before the rates that we're starting to earn
now.
Page 7 of 15



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2021-07-28

FINAL

The issue with Cyber is not so much the profitability of the current business, but given the
views around aggregation, it requires more capital to support it. Therefore, you need to
make more profits to support that capital.
And I think we need to continue to adjust the pricing to make sure that this line of
business delivers adequate profitability to support the capital that we need to put behind
it. But we're big believers in the long-term attractiveness of Cyber, it's only because our
society needs it.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. And anything as far as the size of the book?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Sure. We have approximately $300 million growth, and we've got a quota share of 65%
against it. We've got some XOL against it. So basically, it's less than 150 net all in. So we
think it's very well contained for the size of our balance sheet and for everything that
we're doing.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Great. Great. Then the second question, if I look at your underlying loss ratio in your
insurance business, it's been kind of running, let's call it, roughly 52% for the last most
recent six months. Is that a kind of decent run rate right now, at least considering where
we are with earned rate versus trend?

A - Peter Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Brian.

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Go ahead, Pete.

A - Peter Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Brian, this is Pete. I would say yes, that's where we expected it to be. I think we really
looked at the step to 55% last year was what we expected and we told you we thought
that would come down 200 to 300 basis points given the rates we already put on the
books in the second half of 2020. So I think the 52% is a pretty good run rate.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Then last question, just with respect to kind of capital management here. If I look at
your stock still trades below book value, your financial leverage is definitely coming down.
It's not quite at 25%, but coming down. Is there any visibility into maybe when you would
be willing to start repurchasing your shares?

A - Peter Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}
Page 8 of 15



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2021-07-28

Yes. Brian, that's something that we will continue to look at. Probably will not do anything in
the near term. Obviously we're in the middle of wind season.

FINAL

But when we get towards the end of the year, especially with our PMLs coming down so
much, we'll take a look at what we really think we want. We'll take a view of it probably in
December. At that time, we'll make any announcements.
But you're right. I'm happy the leverage ratio is coming down, we do want to get it to that
20, 25-ish range, and that day is coming down nicely. But I really want to wait until the end
of the year before we really do anything there.

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

If there's one comment that I would add, obviously if we have the opportunity to grow our
book of business at double-digit returns, we're also -- we're going to want to take
advantage of that, too.

Operator
Our next question will come from Meyer Shields with KBW.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Let me start with one quick follow-up. Can you talk about what's going on with, I guess
reinsurance costs on the Cyber book?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I'm sorry. You broke up. Are you asking about what's going on with reinsurance on the
Cyber book?

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

In other words, the cost to buy reinsurance because you've protected yourselves very
thoroughly. I'm just wondering whether -- or what the trends are in the cost of that
protection?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

We have a 1/1 renewal. So we'll take -- we've got some time to work on it. Obviously our
quota share partners are going to enjoy the benefit of the very significant pricing
increases that we're obtaining on the book. So we're confident that we'll be able to
renew it. But to be fair, that's a 1/1. We'll have to deal with that in the second half of the
year.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. One other underwriting question. Can you -- I know it's really, really early, but can
you give us any thoughts about how much of the rising PML for European windstorm
would be exposed to the German flood?
Page 9 of 15



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2021-07-28

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Not -- the short answer is not that much. The reason is what you get is the 50 to 100
to 250 PMLs. These are really affected more by year one in 10, one in 20, one in 30 kind
of areas. So it's a little early because as you know, these are not very well modeled losses
for our customers, and there are some very specific local concentrations that we have to
work through. Certainly, I promise you that if this thing turned out to be any kind of a
material loss you'd hear from us. But right now, we're just following it.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. No, that's helpful. Then a final question. The decrease in investment income from
fixed maturities was a lot sharper than I would have expected, recognizing administrative
were down, but it seems to have moved faster. Can you talk us through what's going
through there? What's going on there?

A - Peter Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes. I think -- Meyer, this is Pete. Actually, when I look at it, it's down the way it's down
sequentially given that we're about a 3-year duration and kind of new money yields are at
about 1.4%, and the book was at 2.1% -- the, I'll call it, decrease of middle single digits was
kind of what I expected in the quarter. So I don't think there's anything plenty going on
there other than the fact that yields are just really low right now for new money.

Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

Our next question will come from Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank.

Q - Phil Stef ano

{BIO 18965951 <GO>}

Yes. Looking at the reinsurance book and your focus on the cat and property in particular,
the gross was down, but the net was up, and I was hoping you could help us to square
that against the nice decline that we've seen in PMLs and how that's been able to trend
versus the net book being up?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yes. I think the most important part is that there's been a huge amount of work made in
the construction of the portfolio. I think that's the greater efficiency of the portfolio,
getting rid of the bulky exposures are very important, and I think more balanced and
geographically with regard to the portfolio, all of which helped in driving the PMLs down.
Now of what we're keeping in terms of the P&L, it's not just a cat that goes to retro. So
although we've reduced sessions, we've reduced retrocessions in other lines also. Where
we are today we're seeding to our third-party capital partners over 50% of our cat book,
and that is the largest percentage we've ever shared with our third-party capital partners.

Okay. Got it. And Pete, I think you had said in your prepared remarks, the insurance
acquisition expense ratio had a slight benefit from timing issues. Can you provide a little
more color on what that was or what happened there?

FINAL

A - Peter Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Phil, it was a number of things, but it was things like true-ups for profit commissions that
ran through some ceding commissions that got booked through. So -- all in all, they added
up to about 1 point.
So when I think about what's the right look at what that acquisition cost ratio should be
long term, I kind of look more at the year-to-date number of about 18 as a good proxy.
But it was a number of small things that we kind of got cleaned up in the quarter, Phil.

Operator
Our next question will come from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

My first question -- just wanted to get a little bit more color on -- Albert, you seem pretty
bullish on the pricing environment. But you did say right, that there's some lines that are at
loss trends, but it sounds like for those mines where pricing is equivalent to trend? Would
you expect price to stay stable?
Because I know you also said that you think pricing will stay at or above loss trend going
into 2022. So just trying to, I guess for the lines that have gotten a good amount of rate
and now they're closer to trend. Would you expect that they will just kind of stay stable
from here as we go through the end of this year and into 2022?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well I'm not anywhere near as bullish as I'd like to be. I think ultimately, I do believe that
we need to be -- we need to maintain strong pricing. But I think we're already seeing in a
number of areas where the pricing is off its highs.
I want to be clear, the rate of change is off its high as pricing is still going up. If you think
about us through the first half of this year being at a 13% kind of average and when you
think of loss costs being more in the low to mid-single digits, that's a long way down.
So I think there's a journey down over the next several quarters, call it 4, call it, 8, call it,
you know how many, I don't know. But I think that I feel very, very strongly that the industry
is not yet in control of its loss cost trends.
And I think because until it does and given the low interest rates, I think that we're going
to continue to see, hopefully, some discipline for pricing ahead of loss costs. That said, we
fully expect that levels will start to gradually come down from where they are at some
point, they'll stay double digit for a little while. At some point, it will be single-digit
Page 11 of 15



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td

Date: 2021-07-28

increases. But as long as we have an opportunity to sustain pricing that is at or ahead of
loss costs, we can continue to improve the profitability of our book, and I feel confident
that we will have those opportunities for a number of quarters to come.

FINAL

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Then, Albert, in terms of loss trend, right, it seems like from what we've been hearing
from other players, right? Like inflation and just like social inflation and what's going on the
course hasn't been so bad if things have been slow to reopen post-COVID. But -- what
are you seeing on the loss trend side? And do you have any concerns just as it comes to
inflationary expectations?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yes. Everybody knows, I think unexpected inflation is not a friend of the industry. So of
course not only do you get a problem on your bond portfolios because they tend to go
down in value, but very often reserve development.

Bloomberg Transcript

I've been following the debate that's been going on in the last few days. And my
perspective on this is it's always the difference between price index related inflation and
social inflation. If you don't mind, I'll just give you my views on that.
So I think that right now, given what we're looking at price-index-related inflation is a
manageable issue for the industry. Why do I say that? Because we get to reset values for
the exposure for the insured values on an annual basis. So whatever the impact of
inflation is on property values, on payrolls, on revenues, that's the exposure base and you
get -- and you capture that.
Then secondly, to the extent that you've got -- you monitor prices -- what's important is
the claim handlers properly evaluating the cost of adjusting a claim and they -- when they
look at the claim, they take a look at where they are in time, they look at the cost of
goods sold, they deal with that. Then again we have an annual process of changing pricing
if we need to. We've got a loss cost train analysis as part of our annual planning process.
So less of an issue if I think it's manageable. And certainly, in our case, I know I've heard
people say that they've had to increase reserves for urea and others because of various
inflations, we took -- we kind of estimated that and we feel pretty good about that.
I'd say that social inflation, that's a different situation. I think that's more of a concern for
the industry. Now I define social inflation as including factors, that will include politicians,
regulators or courts kind of redefining wordings in favor of claimants and increased
propensity to sue new causes of action and ultimately, larger awards, jury awards.
And again as you know very well, those are more of an issue in longer tail lines because it
can take years to discover that the loss trends are higher than you anticipated at pricing
when you wrote the policy.

FINAL

And I think we and the rest of the industry are certainly seeing that for the 10 years. So
that's led to adverse development in professional lines and liability lines. It takes a while to
kind of catch up as the situation evolves.
Now certainly, the strong pricing we've seen over the last 12 to 18 months in professional
lines, in liability lines, are a result of that. But I think what matters to me is that what we've
seen up to now is only barely getting us to where we need to be for right now. I think
we'd be diluting ourselves if we think that the impact of social inflation will stop. Social
inflation is tied to perceptions of social and equity. We know that COVID has affected
people differently that we've got to cater recovery. I believe that social and equity will be
a clear and present danger for the industry, for some time, which is why I think it's
imperative that we don't lose our discipline and price ahead of loss costs.
As to what we're doing at AXIS, we're making sure that we're pricing and reserving on the
basis of prudent losses. We've reduced our limits, which are a good defense against
inflation. We've managed our attachment points. So I think we're addressing it, but this is
an issue that the entire industry needs to continue to address.

That's helpful, Albert. One last one on you guys lowered your PMLs, a good amount this
quarter. I know one of your kind of target for this year was to get your cat load down by
about 2 to 3 points relative to the recent average ex-COVID. So does this put you within
that range? Does it put you better than where you expected? It just looked like a good
level of decline that we saw across some of your peak PMLs this quarter?

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yes. It's a meaningful level of decline. It's exactly what we were planning on doing. I mean I
feel really proud of the team. We're literally delivering on all of the goals that we set for
the team. These are appropriate levels of PMLs.
I've also said that as an organization, we'd ultimately like to bring our balance of property
in cat closer to 20% of our overall net retained premium. We're not quite there yet. I'd like
to get there through growth of other lines. But where we are right now is we're entering
the 2021 wind season in the very best position we ever have as a company and exactly
where we want it to come into it.

Operator
And our next question will come from Josh Shanker with Bank of America.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Just an outstanding quarter in insurance. There's no doubt about it. When I think about,
Albert, you're a great student of history, looking at an 84.5% underlying combined ratio
with a lot of rate that has yet to be earned through behind that. How sustainable do you
think margins can be in a diverse book of insurance business that can produce those kinds
of underwriting results?

So Josh from you, thank you very much, I'll take the complement. The other thing that I
would say is the reinsurance result wasn't bad either. I would say that. But let's get to your
point on --

FINAL

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

We've seen those kind of reinsurance results. Those are more common to see it in
insurance is truly, truly something special, I think.

A - Albert Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

So good. But let's go back to the issue. There is nothing unusual or special about the
combined ratio that we delivered in insurance this year. It's exactly what we expected
based on the work that we've done in this book for many, many years, the runoff of the
discontinued businesses, the changes in risk appetite there is nothing unusual.
And to your point, I have no reason to believe anything other than that as we earn the
higher rates that we've been writing in the last 12 months, as we continue to improve our
portfolio, I think there's more progress to come.

A - Peter Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Josh, this is Pete. I'll just add, Albert.
As I mentioned a little bit earlier, I feel really solid about where the loss picks are, Josh.
But just in the quarter, the acquisition cost ratio for insurance had the benefit of some of
those timing items I mentioned to fill.
So I definitely -- 84.5%, great, current accident year combined ratio, excluding cat -- But I
think a run rate might be just about 1 point higher than that, which is still phenomenal for
us given the improvements we've done over the last couple of years.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

When you think back to like 2001 through, I guess maybe the '04, '05 accident year, it
turned out that those initial picks were very, very conservative, and they throw up a lot of
favorable development. But there was a huge amount of change in terms and conditions.
Insurers like yourselves weren't necessarily willing to take the better margins until there
was evidence of the eight claims trend coming through too.
I mean there's been some changes in terms and conditions in this cycle, but it's not nearly
as revolutionary as it was 20 years ago. I mean you're not -- obviously these are your best
picks, but how do you think about the conservatism and the potential that the 2019
through 2022 accident picks are ultimately have potentially been, materially, overstated,
given past trends and hard market cycles?

FINAL

So I'm not going to try and guess how overstated they might be, but I will say the
following. We feel very clear that in our approach, we are doing a number of things. One
is we're assuming a higher kind of more than technical loss trend in our reserving, and
we're booking our reserves to reflect the ongoing uncertainty around the loss trends, is
number one.
Number two, as we've discussed, you can mathematically figure it out. We are not fully
reflecting all of the pricing in our loss ratios right now. And number three, we are not
giving any credit to portfolio construction in our loss ratio year-over-year changes. So we'd
like to believe that there is prudence in our loss ratios. We'd like to believe that there may
be an opportunity. But I would be loath to project any more than that.

Operator
This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back
over to Albert Benchimol for any closing remarks.
