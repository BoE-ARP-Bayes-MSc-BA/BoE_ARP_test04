Presentation
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome you to today's Hannover Re International
Conference Call on Q2 2021 Financial Results. For your information, this conference is
being recorded.
At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr.Jean-Jacques
Henchoz, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.

Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Well, thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our conference call
presenting our results for the first half of this year.
As usual, I'll start with an overview before our CFO, Clemens Jungsthofel, goes over the
financials in detail. I'll then comment on the outlook for the year thereafter. For the Q&A,
I'm additionally joined by my board colleagues, Klaus Miller on the Life and Health side;
and Sven Althoff for P&C.
I'm pleased to report that with a group net income of EUR671 million Hannover Re has
successfully taken the next step towards achieving its full-year guidance.

Additionally, we continued to grow our business at attractive terms, at 12.2% the return on
equity, return to pre-COVID levels even though the results of our Life and Health business
group were still impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

FINAL

Gross premium increased by 14.2% adjusted for currency effects. This is mainly driven by
our Property and Casualty business group, where we recorded continued strong top-line
growth on the back of improving market conditions.
The price improvements in P&C markets also support the technical profitability of our
portfolio, which is in line with expectations at a very healthy level. Overall large losses
stayed within the budget. Thanks to a benign impact from natural catastrophes in the first
half.
In addition, our net estimate for COVID-19-related losses remained unchanged compared
to year-end 2020. Hence, the combined ratio of 96% is a good reflection of the
underlying profitability in the first half-year, and additionally, we have built up a further
buffer of EUR150 million for large losses in the second half of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

As mentioned, the ongoing global pandemic, it's still having an impact on life and health
reinsurance results. The main insurance market affected by COVID-related excess
mortality continues to be the U.S. even though as expected the numbers decreased over
the course of the first half-year.
Outside of the U.S., we recorded losses in particular in South Africa where Hannover Re
also has a strong market position. All in all, losses connected to COVID-19 amounted to
EUR263 million in the first six months.
As already disclosed in Q1, the restructuring within our U.S. mortality portfolio led to a
positive one-off effect of EUR129 million, partly mitigating the COVID impact.
Finally, we reported pleasing premium growth of 7.3% adjusted for currency effects. At
2.7%, the return on investment is ahead of our expectations, driven by favorable ordinary
income for capitalization according to Solvency II continue to be excellent confirmed by
our strong solvency ratio of 250% at the end of the second quarter, well above our
threshold of 200%.
The operating cash flow in the first half of 2021 was a particularly strong EUR2.7 billion,
mainly driven by attractive reinsurance growth as well as very favorable results on the
investment side. The figure for the first quarter included a positive one-off from this
restructuring within our U.S. mortality portfolio of EUR640 million, driven by this positive
cash flow, total assets under own management increased to a record high of EUR52.8
billion. This growth was additionally supported by ForEx effects and the issuance of
EUR750 million in hybrid capital in March this year.
This new bond issuance is also visible on the next slide, bringing our total hybrid capital to
EUR3 billion. We still have flexibility regards to our total hybrid capacity and shareholders'
Page 2 of 20

equity is up by 0.5%, which is quite positive bearing in mind that we pay the dividends in
the second quarter. However, the group net income in the first half of 2021 was already
sufficient, comfortably cover this dividend payment.

FINAL

Finally, the change in OCI was only slightly negative because negative valuation effects
were mitigated by positive currency translation.
On that note, I'd like to hand over to Clemens, who will explain the figures in more detail.

Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 20496428 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Jean-Jacques. Good morning, everyone. I hope you are all well.
As Jean-Jacques mentioned, the performance of our P&C business group was very
pleasing in the first half of 2021. Gross written premium grew by a remarkable 17%
adjusted for currency effects, which accounted for 5 percentage point. The growth is
highly diversified, was particularly strong momentum in North America, Germany and
South East Asia. And on top of this, we successfully expanded our structured reinsurance
book where we continued to see a very healthy demand.

Bloomberg Transcript

As already reported in the first quarter, the recognition of premium from the underwriting
year 2020 supported the growth. But as mentioned also in the first quarter, this effect will
dilute over the course of the year, bringing the premium growth closer to the growth
numbers we reported for our renewals.
Major losses came in at EUR326 million, clearly below our half-year budget of EUR476
million, and as you know, in line with our usual practice we have kept the unused part of
the budget within our IBNR as a buffer for the remainder of the year.
Additionally, we still feel comfortable with the overall net loss estimate of EUR950 million
for COVID-19 and hence, did not see a need to change anything on this front.
The runoff of our reserves was at normal levels in the first half of 2021, development in
second quarter was more favorable than in the first half. As we have not changed our
conservative reserving approach, I would expect the confidence level of our reserves to
be stable compared to year-end 2020. Altogether, the 96% combined ratio is fully in line
with our expectations.
Net investment income increased based on the strong ordinary income and lower
impairments, other income and expenses amounted to minus EUR109 million, mainly
driven by negative currency effects, as we've seen in the first part of EUR77 million.
Altogether the EBIT increased strongly to EUR778 million. Thanks to the improved
underwriting result, which was heavily impacted by COVID losses in the previous year.
Finally, the tax ratio was slightly below the normal level due to a favorable earnings
contribution from lower tech subsidiaries. As mentioned the total net large losses
Page 3 of 20

Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2021-08-05

FINAL

accounted for EUR326 million in the first quarter, EUR150 million below our budget,
together with the regular budget for the second half this means we have a large loss
budget of EUR774 million available to absorb losses in the second half of this year.
This is a comfortable starting point, I would say, but as we all know that we have already
seen significant losses in the third quarter, with the biggest impact expected to come
from the cloning events in Germany and neighboring countries as well as impacts from
the riots in South Africa.
There is still uncertainty around the flood losses. But our initial estimate would be in the
range of 200 million to 250 million for our net position. For the riots in South Africa, we
expect a net high double-digit million loss.
Adding up those losses this means that we have started to utilize our actually Q3 budget,
but more importantly, that we still have a significant buffer available for the remainder of
the third quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the next slide, you can see that the largest individual event was the Texas winter
freeze, with the total net loss of EUR136 million, this number reflects an increase
compared to the end of the first quarter, which is mainly the result of late claims
notification.
Still the overall impact from natural catastrophes was below expectations, on the manmaid side we have seen an above average frequency of losses. Altogether, we have
already used up around two-thirds of the full year budget set aside for man-made losses.
The next slide as usual shows the technical profitability of our P&C portfolio by reporting
line, picture is a mixed one as usual for our highly diversified portfolio yet we also do see
material deviations. We do not see material deviations from the target combined ratios,
large losses like the Texas freeze and man-made losses had an impact on a combined
ratios in some of the segments as you can see, but the overall is 96% combined ratio, is
fully in line with our target.
On the next slide, let's move to Life and Health. The pleasing business growth is reflected
both in premium and in value of new business. We were particularly successful in
expanding our financial solutions business in the APAC region, and in longevity, the growth
is starting to also come from outside the U.K.
As Jean-Jacques mentioned the technical result was still affected by losses in connection
with COVID-19, the main impact is visible in our U.S. portfolio where we have recorded
losses of EUR167 million as expected the impact in second quarter was lower than in the
first given the progress in vaccination.
Apart from the U.S., the (inaudible) of the losses from South Africa and as explained at our
Q1 conference call, the restructuring part of the ING portfolio in our U.S. mortality book led

Page 4 of 20

FINAL

to a positive one-off effect affecting different line items in the P&C [ph]. In total, the
positive impact was EUR129 million partly mitigating the COVID-19 losses.
Furthermore, the underlying mortality experience in the second quarter was more
favorable than in previous years. The ordinary investment income was, I would say, in line
with expectations, the fair value of financial instruments decreased materially and the
negative impact was driven by the valuation of a derivative embedded in a life insurance
contract in the first quarter as we've reported in the first quarter already, while in the
second quarter, the valuation increased slightly.
Other income and expenses are mainly driven by a further increase in the contribution
from our financial solutions business. A large portion of which is recognized according to
the deposit accounting method.
Currency effects was slightly positive in the first half-year and altogether, the EBIT of
EUR179 million hits satisfactory and adjusted for the different positive and negative
extraordinary effect actually slightly better than expected.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the next slide, as usual, we also have a look at the non-IFRS metric for business
growth in life and health, the value of new business according to Solvency II. On this slide,
you can see that we were quite active in all reporting categories and also the pipeline for
new business remains healthy.
The business opportunities we have seen and are seeing going forward a highly
diversified, but the opportunities are particularly good in developed markets and -- by
reporting categories in the area of financial solutions.
Looking at the indicator for new business value, at the bottom, we have achieved roughly
half of the full-year target, but as you know, transactions in life and health are often right
about the -- and the value of new business is also closely linked to the duration of the
business written. In any case, I think it's fair to say we are well on track in terms of new
business production in life and health.
The next slide, the investments, the development of our investments in the first quarter
of 2021 was very satisfactory in the first half. The ordinary investment income is particularly
strong, this is mainly driven by increased contribution from our alternative investments, I
wouldn't say that these contributions are extraordinary but the distributions of our private
equity funds can naturally be volatile from quarter-to-quarter, this also means that one
should not simply extrapolate those (inaudible) for the remainder of the year.
Further drivers for the strong ordinary results are the increased asset volume in the slide
strategic shift in our asset allocation, which is certainly helping to stabilize the book yet
[ph] in our fixed income portfolio.
Realised gains are mainly the result of normal portfolio management and around EUR50
million are linked to the partial disposal of listed equities in the first quarter.

FINAL

Impairments and depreciations decreased compared to the previous quarter, where we
had recorded some impairments in the volatile market environment. So this year's
number is more or less as expected low levels, I would say, to a large extent comprising
regular depreciation on our real estate investment.
As explained in my comments on life and health, the derivatives valuation was negative.
The overall return on investments was 2.7%, meaning that we are on a very good path to
achieving our full year target of roughly 2.4%.
Unrealized gains decreased by around 500 million, mainly due to the increase in interest
rate, in particularly in the first quarter. In the second quarter, we've seen some reversing
trends bringing the total to a very high level of EUR3 billion.
On the next slide, a quick glance on the asset allocation, I think it's -- the asset allocation
has developed pretty much in line with our strategy, the most notable change, as you can
see is that we've slightly increased the share of corporate to 32%, here we invested
according to, I would said, a broad-based approach with a focus on developed markets.

Bloomberg Transcript

The contribution to ordinary investment income is diversified as usual. The highlight is
probably the recovery as mentioned in the contribution from private equity, to the very
strong levels, we had seen before the market volatility caused by the pandemic in 2020.
On the next slide, for the first time, we have also included the final result of the 2020
annual reserve review by Willis Towers Watson, which we usually published for our
investors, let's say. This year the report was available ahead of the Q2 publication and
hence we thought it would not make sense to withhold that information until October.
So looking at the numbers, the overall redundancy level have increased by 80 million in
the year 2020, should not be surprising because it's fully in line with our comments from
March. That still -- it confirms again that the results we achieved in a challenging year 2020
was not at the cost of our reserve and quality, and that the buffer of more than 1.5 billion
remains to be very comfortable.
To conclude my remarks, the overall results for the first half of 2021 does include a few
larger extraordinary effects but both the reported net income and the underlying business
development very much support our guidance for the full year.
And I hereby, hand back to you, Jean-Jacques for the target matrix and for the outlook.

Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Thank you, Clemens. A look at our target matrix confirms the successful business
development in the first six months of this year. Growth is significantly ahead of the
strategic targets and our main profitability target for the group. The return on equity is
well above our minimum target.

FINAL

The EBIT growth targets in P&C and Life and Health are somewhat distorted by COVID
claims. The targets are more oriented towards normalized growth over the course of the
strategic cycle.
The mid-year treaty renewals were again successful for Hannover Re, we were able to
further grow our business as improved pricing, one could argue that the price increase of
3.2% in total and 6.4% in non-proportional business is a slow down compared to the
January and April renewals.
However, I'd like to point out that the rate increases in the mid-year renewals in 2020
were the strongest in terms of rate increases for Hannover Re and therefore the 3.2%
rate increase achieved this year comes on top of a higher basis than in January and April.
In North America, one important driver is the continued positive trend in primary insurance
markets, both in terms of pricing and volume growth. Both factors have a direct positive
impact on our proportional portfolio because we wrote the business at overall stable
commission levels.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Australia and Latin America, rate increases were most visible in loss affected areas. The
development in credit insurity was slightly more stable, but here too, the quality and
volume of our book went up. Altogether, the growth rate of 14.7% is the highest in this
year's P&C renewals and I'm very pleased with the overall outcome of these mid-year
renewals.
This brings us directly to the next slide. Looking back at all important renewal dates in
2021, the expectation for the full financial year looks quite favorable. The volume in most
areas is going up at attractive profitability levels, for the entire portfolio, Clemens already
flagged the pickup in loss activity in the third quarter, which together with the outcome of
the hurricane season and other loss activity will determine the profitability levels and also
the momentum for further price increases in 2022.
In general, I'd expect the underlying pressure for rate increases in reinsurance to carry on
to the next year. Mainly because interest rates are expected to stay on the low level and
also climate change related loss trends, which you again became visible with the recent
flood and drought events, will not only further support the need for pricing discipline but
should also act as a driver on the demand side.
Finally, the currently higher inflation levels will also have to be reflected in the upcoming
pricing negotiations. In Life and Health reinsurance growth is expected to be well
supported by our strategic initiatives and most pronounced in financial solutions and
longevity.
In both cases, the profitability expectations are clearly above the cost of capital. In
mortality, there remains uncertainty around the further development of the pandemic.
Excess mortality will be most visible in countries where progress with vaccination
programs is slow. However, the trend in depth in countries where vaccination programs

Page 7 of 20

Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2021-08-05

have slowed at a higher level is also dependent all the management of the pandemic in
the respective countries.

FINAL

In particular, in the important U.S. markets, we've not seen a reversal of the decreasing
numbers of COVID-related depth. The premium in mortality is expected to be stable and
the same applies for the overall development in morbidity.
As mentioned earlier by Clemens, the business development in the first half of 2021 is in
line with our guidance for the full year. The improved technical results in P&C is fully in line
with expectations and our COVID-19 reserving, in P&C's confirmed to be adequate at
EUR950 million net.
Additionally, the losses already impacting the third quarter. Do not have an immediate
impact on the guidance because we have a large loss budget of EUR774 million available
for losses occurring in the second half.
COVID losses in Life and Health were slightly higher than expected. But on the other
hand, the performance of our investment portfolio is ahead of expectations for the full
year.

Bloomberg Transcript

So even though some factors within our guidance deviate from our initial planning, we
continue to feel comfortable with the guidance for group net income and has kept it
unchanged.
Also unchanged is our positive view on the dividend policy and the potential to pay a
special dividend if profit targets are reached and our capitalization remains strong.
This concludes my remarks and we would be happy to answer your questions. Thank you
very much.

(Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Vikram Gandhi, Societe
Generale. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Hello. Good morning, everybody. I've got three questions, all related to P&C. Firstly,
appreciate the COVID loss estimate is unchanged at EUR950 million but if you can shed
some light on the moving parts within that EUR950 million, whether some of your
estimates are going down, some are going up, lets say, quick insurity coming in a bit
benign, BI going up. Any color there would be appreciated.
Page 8 of 20



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE

Secondly, can you help us with the overall level of IBNRs within that 950 million?
And thirdly, if you can help us understand how the runoff result has developed over the
second quarter on P&C? That would be great. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Thank you. Sven will address your questions.

A - Sven Althoff

{BIO 19104724 <GO>}

Yes, good morning also from our side. Happy to give you a little more insight into our
COVID numbers. So you already heard from Jean-Jacques that the net number stayed at
950 million as the year end closing 2020. We had very little movement on the gross side
of the loss. We saw some additional claims coming in from the contingency event,
cancellation business, which was roughly 30 million higher compared to the previous
quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

All other reviews that developed very stable. So this is the only markable increased on the
gross loss. The reason why is the net position stayed unchanged, is that due to seasoned
advisors more of the property claims moved from bulk IBNR into treaty specific reserving.
So that we could book those losses against our web professional structures keeping the
net position overall unchanged.
On the credit insurity side, you're right. What we have seen so far is relatively low level of
reserves coming in relation to the 235 million, we have booked on that side, but we have
not decided to reduce that number in the second quarter. We will obviously, closely
monitor that situation but I would say that 235 million we are starting to see some
prudency by now.
And it comes to the distribution of pet versus IBNR losses on COVID, we saw an increase
of the pet number going from 15% from the first quarter to 21% in the second quarter,
which of course is fully in line with expectations. The overall level of IBNR, be that bulk or
be that treaty specific IBNR is still at the level of 54%. So we currently feel rather
comfortably reserves with our 950 million on the P&C side.
And it comes to the run-off result in general, the first half of the year and the second
quarter in particular that not show any development which were outside of expectations.
So the run-off, the ordinary run-off result for the second quarter standalone was a positive
190 million, as I said, fully in line with our expectations.

Our next question comes from Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous. Please go ahead. Your line is
now open.

FINAL

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi, there. Good morning. First question, apologies, if I ask this at every renewal, but I
wonder, Sven, if you could just recap again. How we should think about the reflection of
pricing changes on proportional business? I guess, I think the effectively you're not
obviously reflecting the underlying original change in pricing, you're just reflecting any
changes in exceeding terms. But maybe if you just give us a bit of color again around that
to the extent to which the headline price doesn't necessarily reflect the underlying
economics of the business.
Second question related to pricing. I guess, I'm just interested in opinion on European cat
pricing and then the outlook. I mean, for years, it's been regarded as a diversifier and
therefore it gets heavily subsidized and the pricing doesn't necessarily react too much to
loss experience. Do you think that's going to change with the effect of these losses
and/or higher profile or higher awareness of risk?

Bloomberg Transcript

And the final question was on the reserve surplus of the year-end '20. How is COVID
reflected in that? I'm assuming the COVID claims are not part of that reserve surplus,
there's no assume surplus on the COVID claim within the reserves. But I'm more
interested in the good news that COVID helped, particularly, in terms of the nine
frequency because I think everyone experienced, an increase -- a technical increasing
reserve surplus in 2020 because ex-COVID claims notifications were benign. So how's
that been sort of reflected in the analysis? Thanks.

A - Sven Althoff

{BIO 19104724 <GO>}

Yes. Let me start with your question on the pricing size, Andrew.
The pricing effect on the (inaudible) side is, of course, mainly driven by the (Technical
Difficulty) consistent, so production including commission, for example, but we are also
reflecting some of the price increases, we are seeing from our leading companies still the
primary market, is when we are looking at price adjusted improvement.
We always take a haircut on the (inaudible). For the simple reason that we are not in full
control of what are the underlying factors when our exceeding companies are reporting
about their rate increases. We not always have full transparency to what extent those
before the numbers are risk adjusted. So therefore, we are taking a haircut, but the
combination of the two would be what we are giving numerous information on the same
pricing on the approval.
When it comes to your question on European cat pricing, we as Jean-Jacques already
said, we still see positive movement in both the insurance and free reinsurance markets.
So a general assumption would be that there will be a small (inaudible) plant in European
cat pricing in general. But of course, we expect higher increases on the lot impacted the

Page 10 of 20

FINAL

business, would be expected this stage that this is going to be much more significant
increases and you saw for 2020 that I would say we don't have that expectation right now.
And lastly, yes, of course, you're right. The general benign environment in 2020 in many -of business due to COVID, like for example, in motor business, but I would say given that I
don't have a precise number for you, how much status played in to increase in
redundancy that we have reported. Debt reduction frequency is mostly involving very
young underwriting years. We are normally -- we are not needing reflecting any
redundancies in our deposit come [ph] or if we do both very, very limited extent. So this
should not have been the main driver of us showing a higher redundancy --

Our next question comes from Kamran Hossain, RBC. Your line is now open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to ask about the Life and Health business. You've pulled
out, I guess, for the first half South Africa was a major part of the claims that you saw in
the life business. Could you maybe talk about how this is Q1 versus Q2, you didn't
specifically go out just South Africa in Q1, but you did it in first half. Just eyeballing a
chance of kind of COVID deaths in the first half of the year, it was pretty bad at the
beginning of Q1 and it didn't really kick up until right at the end of Q2. So just interested in
weather is any late reporting factors or something else going on there? And I guess given
the ex-U.S. component of the life claims in Q2 about EUR50 million I think just kind of -envelope. Is that a reasonable number for us to -- into the third quarter? Thanks.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Yes. I'm happy to take that. First of all, most of all our claims are still been from the U.S., so
60% of the claims we have seen this year is from the U.S., about 20% was from South
Africa and this picked up especially with the delta variant in the second quarter. Main issue
is that the vaccination rates in South Africa are still very low, although they're now picking
up and this is what I would expect around the world in most of the countries, where we
currently have been, let's say, little bit surprised about the COVID claims, Latin America is
one other example.
Vaccination rates will go up significantly in the next couple of months in these countries. So
I'm not really concerned for the full year, I'm still concerned for the next one or two
months. But in total, this is a small part of our bottom line result.
And -- sorry, what was your question about the 50 million? I didn't quite get that.

Q - Kamran Hossain

-- the ex-U.S. COVID claims in Q2, they look like they're around 50 million, given that
Patrick is now going at a higher pace now, in terms of deaths and it was pretty much in line
with what you saw at the beginning of Q1. Just trying to get an idea where the 50 million
for the quarter is a reasonable number for us --

FINAL

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

There is certainly a little bit of late reporting here. We have even in developed countries,
the late reporting of four to six weeks for the cause of death, and you can certainly
expect this in South Africa as well.
What is -- especially, a very special in South Africa, a lot of our business in South Africa is
cash financing business. And this has a certain risk, which comes with lapses and with
mortality, but there is an implicit buffer for these cash financing deals.
The client usually wants to have the option to recapture the business after a certain while
and especially when we believes we paid back the initial financing amount and this has a
buffer implicitly built-in and as long as we ultimately get back our money, higher mortality
claims even increase profitability because the treaty just runs three, four, five years longer,
as long as we still get back our money and so we have absolutely no negative from this.

Bloomberg Transcript

But it might take a little bit longer. So this can be seen as just an additional financing.
Because in certain years like this year, there was a loss and there was no repayment or
recuperation of the initial amount, but if the treaty just runs three-four years longer, we
might not even have a claim there.

Our next question comes from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. Please go ahead. Your line is

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. So maybe three questions in a bit quick followup. The first one. So first is on (inaudible) the profitability outlook on Slide 23 today. As
Americas bit lower and Asia-Pac a bit improved. And also Asia-Pac you mentioned
somewhere significant premium growth under APAC growth initiative. Could you just help
us understand what's the magnitude here? I mean and -- what's the rationale for the
Americas lowering results? That could be important.
Then the second question on credit insurity, there is 20 million launch -- mention. Also the
combined ratio 1H is much worse than 1Q, 94% in 1H, 83% in 1Q, is it all coming from this
large loss or is there also something else? Because I think I also heard you're trying to say
that credit insurity still benign for COVID.

Then third question is, seeing your report comment about IO part, harmonization policy
for third country insurance for the convergence plan and you highlighted it as a risk. We -good to know whether you, I mean, how big is the problem you think this could be?

FINAL

And just very, very quick one, fourth one is, there is a mention of another layer of extreme
mortality cover placed, you comment on whether any life mortality has seen any recovery
from some of these parts? Thank you.

Thank you. So, Sven will address the P&C question and mortality will Klaus. On (inaudible)
we don't have an immediate answer to your question, I think we might need to come
back to you thereafter on exactly where the information comes from. Sven, first.

The reason why we changed the profitability outlook from plus or minus for APAC to plus
and the Americas from plus to plus, minus is just a reflection on the combined ratios, we
are reporting after the first part of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

You can see on Slide 10, that the Americas are currently over and above their target
combined ratio, the main driver here, of course, is winter storm Uri, whilst at the same
time the APAC region is significantly below its target combined ratio in the first half of the
year.
There are no structural problems in those portfolios from a profitability point of view, but
we just felt it appropriate to switch our two guidances around particularly for the U.S.
because we still have the full hurricane season ahead of us, so it's always a little difficult to
predict how much of a positive catch-up we will have for the remainder of the year to
eventually bring Americas into line with the target combined ratio.
On credit insurity, you're right, as I said, the actually reported losses from COVID so far
have been below or significantly below our expectations. We have nonetheless decided
going into the underwriting year 2021 to have a relatively high ultimate loss ratio picks
compared to the historic average for the simple reason that many economies are only
just starting up after long lockdown period from COVID.
We still have positive government measures in place in many countries, which are bound
to go into run-off at some stage, which of course is leaving the question will we see a
heightened level of insolvencies later in the year. So out of precaution, we have therefore
decided to start the year conservatively from an ultimate loss ratio point of view. And of
course, you're right, one of the ingredients here is the credit loss, we are reporting due to
payment delays for a project engine in Africa. Hope that answers your question on the
P&C side.

FINAL

Then I will continue with the retro cover on the life and health side. I guess, you're
referring to our increase of the pandemic cover, we have recently placed again. So far we
had for this year, and last year we had 255 million cover, which is about to attach or has
already attached.
So we have placed another EUR18 million starting with 1st of January 2021. That means we
have covered this year. Same terms and conditions as previously but the reference year is
always the last year. So we need significantly worse experience for these EUR80 million
compared to last year. And last year obviously was higher than the year before.
So, it still attention says, 110%. But the reference here, is last year. So, it's a little bit more
out of the money, but the EUR255 million, we have in place already are covering us for
this year.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Right. And we have recorded some benefits already in 1H?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

No. We have not taken that into account. The reason for that is, we have an expectation
that currently the index is at about 112%, but if the mortality is significantly lower in the rest
of the year and we're not talking about population mortality in general, we talked about
the weighted-average of the population mortality in the U.S., U.K. and Australia, and the
waiting is according to our portfolio, if this is significantly better and for instance in
Australia that could be the case because they are all keeping their distance, they don't let
anybody into the country and they keep mortality very low, this also keeps infections very
low and maybe mortality in Australia could even be better than the attachment we
currently see might disappear by year end that's possible or it grows if there is another
variant of the virus. So this is the reason why carefully accounted for we didn't take that
into account so far.

Our next question comes from William Hardcastle, UBS. Your line is now open.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Hi there, guys. Two quick ones, one long term. Just thinking about the reserve
redundancy, very good to see this going up year-on-year, despite the tough 2020
backdrop. I didn't quite get the answer they're relating to how I should think about COVID
at year end, and how that influences year-on-year, is this blurring the number or could you
just give me a quick answer, follow up also on that if that's possible?
And how do you think about this number, do you tend to give us the absolute number, so
the 1.5 billion or as a percentage of net reserves when considering adequacy sales, when
looking at the business?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then a bit more shorter time, I guess, is there any more information you can provide
on the European flood loss anything to do with industry loss assumptions, how you derive
your estimate? And whether there's any assumption of retro attaching and perhaps
there's an extension to that. Is there any aggregate protection you have in place that
would therefore more -- be more like these be utilized should the remainder of year see
increased activity? Thanks.

A - Sven Althoff

{BIO 19104724 <GO>}

The reserve redundancy as Clemens already mentioned, there is a zero impact from
COVID in the reported numbers. So we are not reflecting any redundancy out of our P&C
COVID reserve and the EUR1.5 billion we are reporting form -- the way we are looking at
it, we are of course not only looking at the absolute number but also on the relative
number in relation to our overall reserves.
Here we could see a slight uptick coming from to 5.5% in 2019 to 5.6% in 2020. So the
increase of 18 million was a little higher in proportion than our general increasing reserves,
which of course is a positive developing -- development considering that we have more
than -- we have EUR950 million of new reserves from COVID alone, which of course goes
into that take relation as well.
On the flood loss, we said that we expecting a net position of 200 million to 250 million,
of course, extremely early days in assessing the situation, but (inaudible) we would say
that the associated market loss was this range is between EUR5 billion and EUR7.5 billion.
It's also a little too early to tell how exactly our reinsurance structures will or retrocession
of structures will come into play because so far we have mostly worked on bulk numbers
and in order to know the precise effect on how our retrocessional cover is going to attach,
we need more treaty specific information in order to see what may trigger, what may not
trigger.

FINAL

So we will, of course, be able to report on that when we are talking about our Q3 figures
in a few months time. But for now, I can't give you a precise information here.
To your last question, I mean, on the property side we are buying three vehicles of
retrocession, one of the proportional contract, our -- transaction, then we have our event
tower what we call our whole account -- loss protection and the last ingredient is our
aggregate cover on large losses, so to answer your question, yes, we do have an
aggregate cover in place, right now given the general benign NatCat environment in the
first half of the year, even with the flood loss we are not near the attachment point yet,
but in case, we should see frequency and severity for the rest of the year, this protection
of course potentially will come into play.

Our next question comes from Thomas Fossard, HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is now
open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes, good morning, everyone. Two questions. The first one will be on the top line growth,
so since the start of the year combining PC and live free, you grow your growth region
premium by EUR1.3 billion. It's pretty significant number. Could you maybe tell us how
much capital this has required to support the growth in the business? That would be the
first question.
And the second question. Just following up on Will's question regarding the redundancy
on the P&C side and because you're bringing this information to us today. Can you talk a
bit more about combined ratio -- reported combined ratio. And I would say the economic
combined ratio because I mean, actually it's now two years in a row where you're
reporting nice improvement in pricing. But I mean you're combining -- your reported
combined ratio is relatively flattish or in line with your guidance but flattish, implying that
actually you're not showing yet any improvement in the margins. So I guess that there is
something going on in the background. So, yes, it would be interesting to talk about
economic combined ratio. And at the end of the day, if there is a -- to go back to the 1.8,
or to somewhat I would say, higher redundancy reserve at the percentage of reserves,
using the current relatively hard market cycle, which will increase again your confidence
level?

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Maybe we start with that P&C question on combined ratio, Sven.

FINAL

On the combined ratio is always what we have said over the last couple of quarters when
we changed our guidance from 97% to 96%, is that -- this is a food and approach from
our point of view, we are not translating rate increases one-to-one and two -- ultimate
loss ratio reductions when it comes to our Actuarial picks.
We do take cuts on that and by -- reserve -- conservative initial reserve, which the
profitability will show, but it will show all the time. It will not only show in one calendar year.
But hence, we are comfortable with our 96% combined ratio targets and of course also
quite a bit of our growth is coming from the structured business where margins are
typically in the 2% to 3% area. So what the traditional P&C business is of course seeing
very good levels of rate increase.
The margins on the structured business are relatively unchanged. Here of course our main
competition other financing instruments and you all know what the interest rate
environment looks like right now. So therefore margins on that size have been relatively
stable and that business is standalone would produce combined ratios over and above
the 96% target combined ratio.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Thank you. Clemens, a word on capital consumption?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 20496428 <GO>}

Yes. On capital consumption, Thomas, I mean, I don't have the exact nominal number top
of my head, but if I try to answer the question by looking at our Solvency II ratio both at
year end where we stated a roughly fleet 235 and now at 250, say, the main driver
between some movement on credit spreads and interest rates and currencies such as
being, the main driver was with 10 to 12 percentage points, certainly the hybrid.
And I would say a single digit number is really attributable to the business growth. So that
has to some extent, the effect to number, but not to a material extent.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

I could add something from the life side here. I know that this is the smaller number of
compared to P&C but even they are you cannot just expect that the premium growth will
be reflected to 121 in the capital requirement. The main areas where we are growing is
longevity, and financial solution and the premium number in financial solutions, just comes
from cash. Cash financing and build lines of business longevity as well as cash financing
diversified very well in our internal model. So, the additional capital requirement are
minimal from the life side.

Our next question comes from Ashik Musaddi, JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is
now open.

FINAL

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Just a couple of questions I have is. First of
all, sorry to go back on the reserve rudimentary number. I mean, you're at 5.6% at the
moment, historically I think Thomas was flagging this as well. I mean, you were at the
higher number. So, would we have any intention to move to a higher number? What
needs to happen for you to move to a higher number when given the pricing backdrop?
Would you say that you'll be going to work 6%, 7%? Or you're okay with the current level?
And secondly, I mean, if I look at the life insurance because I mean, if I you had large
doses on COVID in this quarter as well as investment income was pretty low compared to
historical standard but yet the earnings were pretty strong on a relative basis like after
COVID and or investment. So what is driving that underwriting thing in life business would
be good to get some color? And just last question is on investment income, your ordinary
investment income increased quarter-on-quarter by about 30 million, 40 million is that the
function of second quarter dividend or is this some one-off some alternative investments
as you mentioned on the course? Thank you.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Clemens --

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 20496428 <GO>}

I'll start with a first one and then catch up with you probably on the last one, I didn't fully
get it but we can probably pick up that one. So on the reserving side to be honest I think
it's fair to say that, we don't really plan the redundancies sort of as part of our planning
process we do we will do a reserve study of course at the end and we see how, all the
elements it's been mentioned etcetera, how that comes into play and how we can build
up redundancy. Having said that, I think we do feel comfortable with the reserve level that
we have at the moment, but we would also be prepared to build up further buffers as the
surpassed by. And if you wouldn't mind, -- would you mind repeating the last question?

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yes, sure. I mean, your ordinary investment income increased by about 30 million, 40
million quarter-on-quarter. So, I think last quarter was 330 million to 335 million this
quarter is 375 million. I think the increase -- I just want to understand is that increase just as
-- because second quarter is dividend heavy, the probably you've got some dividend and
that's why it hits an increase or is it driven by any one-off revaluation or anything like that
from alternative investment?

A - Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 20496428 <GO>}

Yes, it's really coming from -- mainly from our private equity portfolio. Well spotted, it's
really -- we've seen already is in the first quarter that we saw a pickup particularly
compared to last year on distributions from our private equity investment portfolio and
Page 18 of 20

Date: 2021-08-05

FINAL

that has actually accelerated further in the second quarter. So year-on-year, that's really
the increase in contributions in our ordinary income. There's a slight impact also from our
inflation linker. We do see a higher contribution from our inflation linker, but there is a time
lag in the way we amortize these into our ordinary income. So we will see further impacts
probably in the first quarter.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

You mean the positive impact?

A - Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 20496428 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

And Klaus, maybe --

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

Yes. I'm very happy to take the life and health question. We have the pretty strong
underlying profitability for our book. This has been a little bit difficult to see in the last
couple of years where we had some brock impact, some disability impacts from Australia
so three, four years ago, but the shift you have seen in our portfolio even for the last 10
years was way from risk business 12 financial solutions business and longevity. And we're
working on that for about 10 years now.
And the financial solutions business has a profitability, which is basically stable in these
times with COVID, longevity is stable or even positively impacted. And of course, we have
significant mortality claims. We have paid 260 million last year, 260 million already this year
in the first half, so more than half a billion of claims, but the underlying profitability is
extremely strong and extremely stable. On the longevity side we expect profit, profitable
cash flow in the next 20-30 years of more than 1 billion. But there won't be any spikes. It
will just come through in the ordinary way, and the way how we calculate and I reserve for
that. So, I'm personally not surprised by those relatively strong results excluding COVID.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

But you would not say that this is like driven by longevity one-off, just because -- just is the
opposite effect of mortality. You would not say just that, there is some underlying as well.

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

It's not run by any one-off on the longevity front. The longevity result was 3.5%. And that's
exactly in line with our expectation, 3.5% of premium margin. Not a really good margin, I
always argue against it, we shouldn't look at it this way, but the expected margin on the

Page 19 of 20



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE

longevity side should be something between 2% and 4%. And we are just in that range
right now.

We have good momentum in P&C with the pricing, solid pipeline both life and non-life.

And we can confirm with a good level of confidence. Our outlook for the year and the
guidance in spite of the continuing COVID burden in Life and Health, in P&C COVID as
discussed is expected to be stable and we can confirm that with this outlook and
assuming result inline with the guidance we intend to pay an attractive dividend, which
would include an extraordinary dividend if conditions are met. That would be the key
messages for today. And thank you very much for joining and see you next time.
