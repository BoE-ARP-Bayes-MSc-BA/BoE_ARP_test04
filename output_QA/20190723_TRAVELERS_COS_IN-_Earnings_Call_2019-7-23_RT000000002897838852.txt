{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The overall
results for the quarter were solid, benefiting from the continued successful execution of
our strategic agenda. We said for years that the primary measure we use for managing
the business is return on equity, and we've also said that any strategy to deliver leading
return on equity over time, requires a strategy to grow over time. To that end, a few years
ago, we laid out a strategy to achieve profitable growth in the context of the forces of
change we've previously identified impacting our industry. We established key innovation
priorities and invested in capabilities consistent with those priorities.
The successful execution of that strategy has contributed to growth over the past several
years, and contributed to the growth in earnings this quarter. Earned premiums were up
4%, to almost $7 billion, adding meaningfully to underwriting income in the quarter.
We've also shared that improving productivity and efficiency is a priority, and efforts we've
been undertaking for some time to leverage technology investments and workflow
enhancements are paying off. Again this quarter and year-to-date, we've grown the topline and managed general and administrative expenses to about flat, while continuing to
make important investments in the business.

FINAL

All of that together with strong performance from our investment portfolio, contributed to
core income of $537 million, a 9% increase over the prior year quarter, and core income
per diluted share of $2.02, a 12% increase over the prior year. Core return on equity was
9.2%.
In terms of underwriting margins, this quarter we delivered a solid all-in combined ratio of
98.4%. As a reminder, our expected weather losses are seasonally highest in the second
quarter. But as you can see on Page 4 of the webcast, the underlying combined ratio was
up 1.3 points over the prior year quarter. There were a number of favorable items
impacting the underlying result including a lower level of large losses, and improved
expense leverage. But I'd like to highlight and put in context two items contributing to the
increase. Non-catastrophe weather losses and some continued deterioration of trends in
the tort environment.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll start with the weather, which of the two had the larger impact. For the quarter total,
weather losses in the aggregate cat and non-cat, were well within a range of what we
would consider normal. But breaking that down, catastrophe losses were favorable, while
non-cat weather losses were worse than what we would consider a normal level for the
second quarter. That resulted in the nearly 2 point increase in the underlying combined
ratio compared to the prior year quarter. Again, all-in weather losses weren't far off what
we planned for, so we consider this bucketing.
In terms of the tort environment, the trends we discussed in the fourth quarter of last year
impacting bodily injury severity in Commercial Auto have developed a little worse than we
expected in the Commercial Auto line. And while we anticipated those trends extending
into the other liability coverages, they extended into the primary and excess coverages of
the general liability line, somewhat more than we anticipated, that drove the adjustment
this quarter.
On the whole and looking back over the last three quarters, the issues continue to be
most heavily associated with commercial auto related losses. Manifesting in two places, in
the Commercial Auto line as you would expect and also in excess coverages of the
general liability line, where the underlying losses are auto related.
The run rate earnings impact of this updated view of the tort environment is a little less
than $20 million per quarter after tax. The current quarter underlying result also included a
catch-up of about the same amount from development of the first quarter.
The aggregate impact of the first and second quarter adjustments, added around 0.6667
point of ratio, which amounts to about $0.14 per share. Also, I noted unlike Commercial
Auto where the returns are still clearly inadequate. The returns in the general liability line
both primary and excess are much healthier for us.
Turning to the top-line, production was once again excellent in the quarter. We grew net
written premiums by 4% to a record $7.5 billion. Our premium growth reflects high levels
of retention and positive renewal premium change, broadly across the portfolio. As I
pointed out before, that speaks to the high quality of the business we're putting on the
Page 3 of 23

FINAL

books. We're growing our new and renewal business with confidence in terms of
accounts, geographies and industries that we know well.
In business insurance, we achieved renewal premium change of 6.7%, including renewal
rate change of 3.6%. In both cases, the highest levels since five years, while maintaining
historically high levels of retention. We increased renewal rate change and renewal
premium change, both year-over-year and sequentially in each of our product lines, other
than workers' compensation.
In our leading Bond & Specialty business, we once again achieved strong production in
both our Management Liability and Surety businesses, with record levels of retention and
new business in Domestic Management Liability.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Personal Insurance, higher net written premiums benefited from renewal premium
increases in both our Agency Automobile and Agency Home businesses. And in all-time
high for domestic new business. We have momentum in all of our businesses, and in an
environment of persistently low interest rates, ongoing uncertainty surrounding weatherrelated losses, and continuing challenges in the tort environment. We will continue to
leverage the power of our franchise to meet our return objectives, including by continuing
to selectively and thoughtfully seek prices and improved terms and conditions.
You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Tom, and Michael about our segment results. To sum
it up, our performance this quarter and year-to-date reflect both the successful execution
of our long-term strategy and our relentless execution in the marketplace every day. With
leading data and analytics in the hands of our frontline underwriters, the best talent in the
industry and deep relationships with our agents and brokers, we remain well positioned to
continue to deliver shareholder value over time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.

Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Thank you, Alan. Core income for the second quarter was $537 million, up 9% from $494
million in the prior year quarter. And core ROE was 9.2%, up from 8.7%. Earnings per share
and core earnings per share were up 9% and 12% respectively our second quarter results,
include $367 million of pre-tax catastrophe losses, down from $488 million in last year's
quarter. But the lower level of cat losses was more than offset by higher levels of non-cat
weather. As we have previously disclosed, our definition of catastrophes is limited to
industry events where our losses exceed a specified dollar amount, generally around $20
million.
In the second quarter, a larger portion of the weather losses we experienced fell below
our cat threshold and thus adversely impacted our underlying combined ratio. But again as
you heard from Alan, overall weather results cat and non-cat combined, were well within
the range of what we would expect.
In terms of weather expectations, during our fourth quarter earnings call, we explained
that our expectations for cat losses for 2019 would trend up for two reasons. One is that
we've seen growth in our premium volume, and the overall exposure level in the business.
Page 4 of 23

FINAL

Two is that we're placing a little more weight on recent periods. And that results in a bit of
an uptick in terms of our view of normal cat load per dollar premium. Adding the
seasonality of our cat losses in our second quarter total weather results were no surprise.
Pre-tax underlying underwriting gain, which excludes the impacts of cats in prior-year
reserve development, decreased by 19%. Higher non-cat weather-related losses,
adversely impacted the underlying combined ratio of 94.9%, by nearly 2 points, compared
to the prior year quarter. Also and to a lesser degree the change in the underlying
combined ratio was impacted by several favorable items, including lower large losses and
improved expense leverage, partially offset by a modest impact from the continuing
challenges in the tort environment as Alan mentioned.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net favorable prior year reserve development in the second quarter was a $123 million
pre-tax, down from $186 million in the prior year quarter. In Business Insurance, net
favorable PYD was $71 million. In terms of highlights, the net favorability resulted primarily
from better than expected performance in workers' comp, which improved by about $275
million. Partially offsetting the favorability in workers' comp is unfavorable development of
approximately $125 million in general liability for both primary and excess coverages and
Commercial Auto. This represents the estimated impact of the continuing challenges in
the tort environment that drove the nearly $20 million of after tax run rate increase in the
current quarter's underlying losses.
Second quarter PYD in business insurance, also included a $60 million increase to
environmental reserves for accident years prior to 2010. As a follow-up to last quarter,
second quarter PYD, also included a modest impact resulting from a handful of additional
states, extending the statute of limitations for molestation claims. The impact on our book
from these legislative changes, in the second quarter was much smaller, than the first
quarter impact from the adoption of similar legislation in New York.
In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable PYD of $39 million, was driven by domestic
Management Liability. In Personal Insurance, net favorable PYD of $13 million was driven by
favorability in our domestic businesses. Last week, the UK updated the Ogden rate, which
is the discount rate applied to lump sum bodily injury payouts. The rate change was
modest. And as a result, we expect to book only a small benefit in the third quarter.
Net investment income, increased by 8% from the prior year quarter to $548 million after
tax as higher fixed income returns were complemented by higher returns in our non-fixed
income portfolio. Fixed income NII increased by $25 million after tax, due to the higher
average yield on invested assets and an increase in the amount of average invested
assets. Higher returns in the private equity portfolio, reflected the broader market
recovery.
Looking forward, with interest rate expectations now lower than they were three months
ago. We have updated our outlook and now expect after tax fixed income NII for the
remainder of 2019 to increase by approximately $10 million to $15 million per quarter,
compared to the same period a year ago.

Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity

As we discussed in our earnings calls for the last two quarters, we added a new
catastrophe reinsurance treaty for 2019, providing coverage for PCS designated events,
for which we incur $5 million or more in losses, above an aggregate retention of $1.3
billion. While the impact on written premiums was reflected entirely in the first quarter, the
new treaty impacts all four quarters on an earned basis. For the second quarter, the
impact of the treaty increased our consolidated underlying combined ratio by about a 0.5
point as expected. Through June 30th, we've accumulated a little less than $800 million
towards the $1.3 billion retention.
As you think about the elevated non-cat weather this quarter, it's important to keep in
mind that much of that weather activity was from non-PCS events that did not count
towards the treaty. On the topic of reinsurance, I'll direct your attention to Page 20 of the
webcast and provide an update on our catastrophe reinsurance program. The structure of
our cat reinsurance treaty is generally consistent with the prior year. We renewed our
Northeast cat treaty, effective July 1st with substantially similar terms and flat pricing.
Our cat bond, Long Point Re III, is in the second year of its four-year term. And in the
annual reset for the 2019 hurricane season, the attachment point was adjusted from $1.9
billion to $1.79 billion, while the total cost of the program was flat year-over-year.

Bloomberg Transcript

A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage, which also includes a
description of our gen cat aggregate XoL treaty that covers in the accumulation of certain
property losses, arising from multiple occurrences is included in our 10-Q, which we filed
earlier today, and in our 2018 10-K.
Turning to capital management, operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.2 billion, were
again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended
the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion. Net unrealized
investment gains, increased from $1 billion after tax as of March 31st, to $1.9 billion after
tax as of June 30th, due to the decrease in interest rates during the quarter. Adjusted
book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was
$90.05 at June 30th, 3% higher than at year-end, and 6% higher than the end of the
second quarter last year.
We returned nearly $600 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter,
comprising share repurchases of $376 million and dividends of $217 million. On a year-todate basis, we have returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders.
And with that, I'll turn the mic over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.

Gregory C Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance produced segment income of $351 million for the
quarter, and a combined ratio of 101.1%. The combined ratio includes catastrophe losses,
which were essentially in line with our expectations for the quarter.

FINAL

The underlying combined ratio of 97.4% was 0.9 points higher than the prior year quarter.
There are several moving pieces underneath the 0.9 point year-over-year change, so
we've added Page 9 to the webcast, to illustrate the components.
I'll start with the notable items that increased the underlying combined ratio year-overyear. The most significant item was non-cat weather, which was higher than the prior year
quarter by about 1 point. Next are two items that we've discussed with you previously. The
first is the 0.5 point impact from lower earned premium, due to the new cat treaty. And
the second is the approximately 0.5 point run rate impact related to the Q4 2018 reestimation of Commercial Auto losses.
The last of the unfavorable adjustments relates to further deterioration of the trends
related to the continuing challenges in the tort environment that drove the re-estimation
of Commercial Auto losses in the fourth quarter, as you heard from Alan.

Bloomberg Transcript

The most recent data showed loss experience that was somewhat higher than our
revised expectations from the fourth quarter. This included further modest deterioration
in Auto, and extended into general liability for both primary and excess coverages, to a
higher degree than we had previously anticipated. For these adjustments, there is about
0.5 point of ongoing run rate impact, and about 0.5 point of catch-up from the first
quarter of 2019.
As for the favorable year-over-year items, first, we had about a 1.5 point from domestic
large losses, returning to a more normal level as we expected. And second, we had about
a 0.5 point driven by continued benefits from higher earned premium volumes and
disciplined expense management. Importantly, we continue to achieve this expense
leverage, while investing in strategic initiatives that position us for the future.
Now to the top-line, net written premiums for the quarter were up 2%, over the prior year
driven by strong underlying production results. Partially offsetting the production results,
were some items that were generally timing in nature. For example, we changed the
timing of one of our reinsurance treaties from the first quarter to the second quarter.
Adjusting for those items, the top-line trends were in line with recent quarters.
In terms of domestic production, we achieved strong renewal premium change of 6.7% in
the quarter, including renewal rate change of 3.6% both their highest level in the five
years. The renewal rate change was up 1.3 points from the first quarter, and more than 1.5
points from the second quarter of last year. This is a strong result, particularly given
continued rate decreases in workers' comp, while the commercial auto and property lines
continue to lead the way, our general liability both primary and excess as well as C&P
lines, also saw meaningful increases. Importantly, at the same time as we achieved these
pricing increases, remained historically high retention of 85%.
Last quarter, we said that in addition to price, we've also been focused on improving
terms and conditions particularly in our property coverages. In this quarter, terms and
conditions, things like deductibles, sub limits and insurance to value tightened further,
contributing to rate adequacy. Even after our updated view of loss trend resulting from rePage 7 of 23

Date: 2019-07-23

FINAL

estimation of losses in the auto and general liability lines, which increased our overall view
of domestic lost trend by about 0.5 point. We estimate that pricing that is rate plus the
portion of exposure that acts like rate was in excess of loss trend on a written basis for
the quarter.
New business of $531 million in total was essentially flat to a strong prior year quarter.
We're very pleased with our production results and our continued granular and deliberate
execution. As you heard from Alan, given the low interest rate environment, continued
uncertainty around weather-related losses and some upward pressure from the tort
environment, we'll continue to seek rate and use all the other available levers to meet our
return objectives. As for the individual businesses. In select renewal premium change and
renewal rate change both ticked up from the first quarter, while retention remained
strong at 82%. New business was strong in comparable to the prior year quarter. We're
pleased with the returns in this business and these production results reflect our strategic
execution.

Bloomberg Transcript

In middle market, renewal premiums was 6.1%, with renewal rate of 3.4%, up more than a
1 point from the first quarter and 1.6 points from the second quarter of last year, while
retention remained historically high at 87%. New business premiums of $275 million, were
down from a strong prior year quarter. For the most part, we attribute the new business
dynamics to our underwriters prioritizing improving price, terms and conditions at renewal
and being disciplined in managing risk selection, related to our exposure to the auto line.
We're very comfortable with our execution. We continue to invest in our strategic
capabilities and are confident that we're well positioned to profitably grow over time.
Page 18 of the webcast shows production statistics for our international markets, across all
three of Travelers segments. Although these statistics include more than business
insurance, the overall trends are consistent with what we're seeing for the BI portion of
international and reflect the rate, risk selection, risk control and other measures we
continue to execute to improve profitability.
Lastly, I'd like to touch on our national property business, which had a notable increase in
new business this quarter. In this space we've been seeing more opportunities in the
marketplace and we've been selectively writing some of them. Importantly, many are
accounts that we've quoted or written before. So, we familiar with them and we're writing
them at prices and on terms and conditions that meet our discipline standard. With that I'll
turn the call over to Tom.

Thomas M. Kunkel

{BIO 16615934 <GO>}

Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty delivered another quarter of strong results. Segment
income was $174 million, a decrease of $30 million due to a lower level of net favorable
prior year development. The combined and underlying combined ratios were an excellent
74.9% and 81% respectively.
Net written premiums, for the quarter, were up a very strong 9%, with solid growth across
all businesses. Considering the high quality of our Management Liability portfolio, we are

Page 8 of 23



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2019-07-23

pleased that the domestic retention remained at a historically high 90%, with renewal
premium change higher at 4.2%.

FINAL

New business for the quarter was a record $65 million, up 20% from the prior year
quarter. These results reflect a successful execution of our various marketing, product and
underwriting strategies to profitably grow these lines.
Domestic Surety net written premiums were up 4% over a very strong prior-year quarter.
Our existing portfolio remains well positioned to continue to provide leading returns over
time. And our competitive advantages allow us to thoughtfully and selectively add quality
new accounts. So Bond & Specialty results were strong, and we feel terrific about our
marketplace execution, competitive advantages and our ability to continue to deliver
excellent results.
And now I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.

Michael F Klein

{BIO 1843589 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Tom. And good morning, everyone. Personal Insurance grew income, revenue
and policies in force in the second quarter, with improved performance in both Auto and
Home.
Segment income for the second quarter of 2019, increased $105 million, relative to the
second quarter of 2018. Our combined ratio for the quarter was 100.2%, an improvement
of 4.7 points over the prior year quarter, driven primarily by catastrophe levels that were
nearly 7 points below last year.
The underlying combined ratio of 94.6% was up 2 points from the prior year quarter,
driven by an increase in non-catastrophe weather losses, and the impact on earned
premiums related to the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty, partially offset by earned
pricing that exceeded loss trend in Agency Automobile, and a lower underwriting
expense ratio.
Weather losses in the aggregate, were better than the prior year quarter, and we're
pleased with the overall results. Recall that the second quarter is our seasonally highest
quarter in terms of expected weather losses.
Turning to the top-line, net written premiums for the quarter grew 6%, with Agency,
Homeowners and other leading the way with growth of 11%. Personal Insurance had strong
retention in renewal premium change, and record new -- domestic new business for the
quarter.
Agency Automobile, once again delivered strong results, with a combined ratio of 94%
for the quarter, a 1.4 point improvement from the prior year period. The quarter benefited
from a lower underlying combined ratio and lower catastrophe losses, partially offset by
lower net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio
Page 9 of 23



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2019-07-23

FINAL

continues to benefit from earned pricing that exceeded loss trend, including continued
favorable frequency trends.
In Agency Homeowners & Other, the second quarter combined ratio was 104.5%, 9.1
points lower than the prior year quarter, due to lower catastrophe losses and higher net
favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by a higher underlying
combined ratio. Higher non-catastrophe weather losses were the main driver of the 7.7
point increase, in the underlying combined ratio to 92.9% as compared to the prior year
quarter. While weather in total was favorable relative to the prior year quarter, a significant
component of the weather activity came from non-PCS events this quarter, in addition to
PCS events that did not meet our catastrophe threshold.
Turning to quarterly production, agency automobile retention remained solid at 84%, with
renewal premium change of 4.6% and a modest increase in new business from the prior
year quarter. We remain focused on actions to grow this book at returns that continue to
meet our objectives.

Bloomberg Transcript

Agency Homeowners & Other delivered another strong quarter. We achieved renewal
premium change of 6.7%, of 1.4 points from the first quarter, and up 3 points from the
second quarter of last year, with retention remaining strong at 86%. The pricing we
achieved reflects actions we're taking to address the higher loss activity that we and the
industry have experienced in recent periods.
New business was up 26%, driven by our successful roll-out of Quantum Home 2.0. QH2.0
continues to be well received and is performing as expected, driven by sophisticated
pricing segmentation and the ability for agents and customers to easily tailor the product
to meet their needs.
During the quarter, we continue to make investments in the business. For example, we
rolled out QH2.0 in three more states, and the District of Columbia. And QH2.0 is now
available in 28 States. We remain on track to complete the rollout in most of the remaining
states later this year.
In addition, we announced several new initiatives. First, we've partnered with American
Forests, the oldest National Conservation organization in the US to plant up to a 1 million
trees in connection with our initiative to encourage more customers to enroll in paperless
billing, resulting in more efficiency for us, a better experience for them, all while benefiting
the environment. Second, we are working with Wildfire Defense Systems, to help provide
Loss Prevention Services in California that supplement local firefighters and other first
responders in the event of a wildfire. This new service gives California policyholders an
added layer of wildfire protection at no additional premium. It is also an additional tool to
help us manage our exposure. These are the latest examples of initiatives that continue
to position us well, to deliver value in the eyes of the customer and to grow profitably,
while investing in the business.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)
(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your line is
open.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning. I'm sure people are going to have a fair amount of questions
on the underlying combined ratio shift in 2Q year-over-year. I really think you explained it
well in terms of the impact of non-cat weather and the tort environment deteriorating. I'm
wondering given the pace of price improvement, do you think at some point over the
course of the rest of 2019 or 2020, we could see underlying margin improvement given
how those trends are unfolding?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Jay, we give you an outlook for the underlying underwriting margin in the outlook section
of the 10-Q and we do it by segment. So you can see there what it is that we're thinking
going forward. In particular where in BI where we're calling for continued improvement
really it's three things, it's non-cat weather, it's we would expect improve results in
international and in the fourth quarter of last year, you've got the timing impact of the
fourth quarter auto adjustments, but is a lot of levers we have to pull to manage overall
margins and profitability and including price terms and conditions and we're working on all
those things relentlessly in the market every day and that'll impact, premium that we put
on the books and that also will earn in overtime.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Alright, that's helpful. Thanks. Alright. So expectations of continued improvement and then
I was wondering if you might have the rate impact or the rate benefit in domestic
business insurance excluding, what I would imagine is a drag from workers comp?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Jay, workers comp continue to be negative in the quarter and we have given that as a
separate statistic from time to time we do it. When we think it's relevant and we need to
do it to clarify one thing or another but, there's some competitive sensitivity there and we
don't intend to continue to update that number and probably would prefer not to give it
to you now, but clearly the numbers that you see for rate in RPC and BI would be higher
but for workers comp which is negative.

sure you saw a pretty decent expansion their of your core margin and if I'm reading
correctly or it sounds like your outlook calls for consistent levels of profitability into 2020.
So, I guess could you talk about what you're seeing on the competitive environment
sounds like it might be more competitive now, than it was last year and sounds like if
you're looking for consistent levels of profitability you're not concerned then with any rise
in physical damage severity in your margins there?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Michael F Klein

{BIO 1843589 <GO>}

Sure Mike. This is Michael Klein. I would say on the competitive environment we talked
about it the last couple of quarters, we certainly see as you can also find a moderation in
rate increases being filed by our competitors, I think broadly speaking, it's in pattern with
the methods that we've been sending that we're moderating rate in response to the
improved profitability and I think we're working to be in step with the marketplace there.
In terms of loss trend, we do continue to see upward pressure on severity in Personal
Auto more than offset over the last couple of quarters with improvements in frequency, I
think what we're working to do is to balance our pricing with the long-term view or trend
over time and outlook reflects the fact that we think we can do that and shift to a little bit
more growth in Auto at attractive margin, so that's the view on our outlook.
The one exception inside the outlook you'll note, that we talk about the fourth quarter in
particular and so I'll just remind you that as you look at the fourth quarter of 2019 and the
comparison to 2018, there's a challenging year-over-year comparison there, because we
had both very strong quarter in terms of profitability in the quarter and in the fourth
quarter of '18, we recognize some of the favorable loss trend, that we had been seeing
throughout '18. So there was a good guide catch-up in the fourth quarter of 2018. So
broadly consistent with the exception of the fourth quarter, which is really just a year-overyear comparison challenge.

Q - Michael W. Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thank you Michael for the details there. Switching over then to workers
comp, you mentioned this time reserve development was from multiple accident years. I
guess one, was there anything from accident year '18 and anything from the first quarter
of '19 in that and then I guess, secondly on comp. Some competitor were talking about

changing in loss trends maybe slightly getting worse and California recently came up with
some uptick in severity in California. So, I guess at what point do you become concerned
on pretty substantial margin pressure in that line?

FINAL

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

So, Mike its Dan Frey. I'll take at least the first part of it on PYD. Sort of clarify right so there
wouldn't be anything in PYD from the first quarter of '19 we'd count that as current year
and we would have called it out if there was a significant catch-up there. With the long tail
nature of workers comp the majority of our prior year reserves development is going to
have come from years prior to 2018 just because you have a better chance to see how
those were seasoning, but there is a small piece from 2018 as we see the favorability in
some of the older years continue to bid into 2018.

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Hey, good morning. Couple of questions first probably for Greg. In you're prepared
commentary. I believe you said in addition to price you're getting tightened terms and
conditions if that's correct, just want to clarify whether your disclosure of pricing changes
is taking into account terms and conditions tightening as well?

A - Gregory C Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Yeah. Terms and conditions is all net in inside our book of business yield. When we talk
about terms and conditions were predominantly seeing that on the larger portion of the
property segment. So think insured the value, thing deductibles, all peril deductibles,
sublimits, so that's where we're seeing some of those terms and conditions
improvement. So as we make those changes on the renewal block that certainly has an
impact from a favorable point of view from a loss cost net on the book of business.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Mike are you asking whether that's somehow adjusted in the rate number, Is that your

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Yeah. If it's mathematically taken into account within the disclosure rate.

FINAL

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

It's not mathematic -- I mean the rate numbers are pretty pure just price calculation.
Although to some extent it could show up on the exposure side, right? So, if deductibles
went up for example that would be negative for exposure but it would not factor into the
pure rate calculation.

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. I may follow-up and lastly on tort inflation, would you say it's gaining
momentum in terms of the inflation rate and do you think there are any underlying causes,
I believe in litigation finance there's a bunch of -- there is a couple of public firms and
there's a been lot of capital raises there over the last couple of years and it's kind of
gaining momentum as an asset class maybe that's one of the underlying drivers if you
have any thoughts there that would be helpful. Thanks.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. So it's -- so what we're describing is the result of squaring triangles and coming up
with numbers and then looking for causal factors in the environment so there's a fair
amount of estimation here and it's not -- there's no math formula that gets us to the
answer to that question necessarily, but I would say broadly what we're reflecting in our
numbers, we would describe it as a more active and more aggressive, plaintiffs' bar.
Now, litigation finance is sort of its own topic and we certainly read about that we can see
numbers on that. We know more money is being raised for that as an asset class we don't
dismiss that as a factor. I will tell you that, that is one aspect that at least now this could
change but at least now we're not seeing that as a particularly significant driver in what
we're referring to as change in the tort environment, that could come, I mean we see the
funds being raised for that and so and by the way to the extent we see that and
anticipated it, that would get reflected in our loss PIKS as well but we're not seeing that as
a standout issue.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. My first question I'm going back to the commercial Auto and GL PIKs
that went up in the quarter, I guess what I'm trying to tie together is a the increase that
you guys saw there and then also the commensurate increase in rate. So do you -- can

Page 14 of 23



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2019-07-23

FINAL

you kind of try to bucket I guess how much of the rate was driven in your view off of just
this higher loss trend environment, because when we think about going forward it does
sound like you guys are a bit more positive on pricing inflecting relative to loss trend in
terms of just thinking about your outlook but if trend keeps going up that's going to
obviously offset that rate versus trend phenomena.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

Yeah. So, Elyse we did give you some perspective on outlook for RPC in the outlook
section of the 10-Q and certainly everything we know about loss trend goes into our
pricing models and our view of rate adequacy and our view what rate we need to achieve
our return objectives, I will say that does, that come in on a lag basis, we've got to see it,
we've got a put it through in our models to the extent there are regulatory filings, there's
a process there, then you got to put it on the books it's got a earn in, so there is a lag
between the recognition of these trends and the time price goes into the market and
gets its put on the book. So it's a long way of saying that Commercial Auto was at an
inadequate return before we saw some of these transit just got worse and I think to a
large degree the pricing that we're seeing now is reflective of longer-term terms in
Commercial Auto, although some of what we're seeing in the quarter will be reflective of
recent trends.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then my second question, so you guys said the increase PIKs are about $20
million going forward, that's about 50 basis points within end business insurance. I know
there's two buckets, one being Commercial Auto and then one being the GL portion, but
you guys did increase your commercial Auto Picks two quarters ago in the fourth quarter.
So just trying to get a sense of the conservatism that you guys have now that this has
been addressed and why -- maybe instead of half a point. It's not one point that you
chose to increase to your loss PIKs in the current quarter?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah, Elyse our objective isn't missing it high or low, our objective is always to get it right.
We're trying to come up with an estimate of losses. We price the product based on an
estimate of losses and an interest rate curve. And so our objective is always to get the
right price and so we weighted through a lot of data we've got terrific actuaries that
experts and help us think through this we've got management input on top of that and
our objective is to just get it right, so can we tell you boy, we swung a big stick at it and
we're done this is it? No, we can't but we can tell you that based on everything we see in
the data and based on our experience. We think we got the PIKs in the right place.

Q - Bijan Moazami

{BIO 2087745 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I guess I want to understand
a little bit more what's going on in the Commercial Auto business and in particular you
guys picked up a fair amount of premium volume this year and last year was it all great or
was it something else and this big tick up BI severity, is that broad-based or is it related to
a subsection of the Commercial Auto or is it geographically located?

A - Gregory C Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Hi, this is Greg. Yeah, Commercial Auto as you can see in the quarter we had an 8%
change in net written premium. The predominant dynamic underneath that is broad RPC
across the portfolio. We're clearly seeing the commercial Auto challenges that we believe
the industry is also so it really isn't a segment of the book, it's a broad dynamic and
hence, the reason why we've been achieving RPC so broadly across it.

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Hey, it's Dan. I'm not sure that it goes all back as far as pre- 86. It's certainly in the year -action years older than 09, it's really a continuation of what we have seen in
environmental over the last several years. We do see an improving environment in terms
of the number of claims that come in because it is old we do expect it's a runoff. The
reaction here in this quarter is simply that things have not improved quite to the degree
that we would have anticipated in our prior PIK. So, you're right to think about this as
mostly very old stuff you're right to think about it as generally improving over time in
terms of the volume of these things slowing down it just hasn't slowed quite to the
degree that we had previously expected.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey, thanks. Good morning. My first question I guess is just on the renewal rate number
sequentially and I'm trying to get a feel for maybe how much of that increase just had to
do with the mix of the premium that you wrote in the second quarter versus the first,
Page 16 of 23



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2019-07-23

because I noticed that there was less workers comp or you're obviously not getting rate
but there's a lot more property. Well, I'm guessing the rate is better in the 3.6%. Is there
any way to kind of tease out the impact of just control for mix and that 3.6% versus the -or the 130 basis point increase sequentially?

FINAL

A - Gregory C Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Yeah. Ryan, this is Greg again, yet comp wasn't off materially and obviously every month
we pride ourselves in our pricing to the local execution very granular partnership with our
distribution. So it depends on the accounts that are coming up, the loss experience that's
associated with them and we do our best in partnering with them but can't really, say that
there was a comp dynamic drive in that. It was really the exposures that came up for
renewal.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

And the exposure increases in workers comp is it fair to kind of use the exposure increase
for all of BI as good barometer of what you're seeing in comp too?

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

No, not necessarily and we don't disclose comp at that level, but not necessarily but Ryan
I'm looking here for the data. My instinct is that there's not a big mix factor driving the
overall rate change.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. And then, Alan, my follow-up was hitting on interest rates. First, I'm
curious what the new money yield is today for the company and then second of all just
thinking about buyback versus where the stock is trading like I haven't seen it trade at this
price-to-book valuation in quite some time and I know Alan, you've always talked about
structural returns overturns in this business being linked to a certain extent to wherever
interest rates, are, and I guess we're back to very low levels of interest rates. So I'm
curious looking into the back half of the year has your appetite for buyback changed at all?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Ryan, let me start with the buyback and then I'll see if Bill wants to comment on the new
money yields but in terms of buybacks our first objective for every dollar of capital that we
generate is to invest it back in the business, when we think we can do that and generate a
return for it and when we can't we're going to give it back to investors and our alternative
is to put that in a fixed income Bond portfolio and we don't think that's what our investors
expect us to do as between dividends and buybacks, we think by and large buybacks is
the preferred solution it's less diluted to book value per share and so we're not trading in
the stock, we're rightsizing capital and we'll continue to do that.
Of course, we wouldn't be buying back stock if, we thought the stock was trading at
above intrinsic value and we don't. So, this really is it's not tactical we're rightsizing capital
and it's a strategy to deliver shareholder value and over the last 10 or 12 years we get this
question from time-to-time when depending on where the stock is trading and so this has

come as a concern before or at least as a question before maybe not a concern. And I
would just point out since 06 we brought back something like $35 billion worth of stock
and at an average price per share of I think $66 or $67 buck a share, so we feel pretty
good that we've bought the stock back thoughtfully and in a way that's created
shareholder value and no change in our philosophy.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Though you want to come on new money.

A - William H. Heyman

{BIO 3429455 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Ryan, in terms of new money yields in the second quarter the new money yield was
between 3.25%. It ended the quarter what was the bottom of that range and it's probably
about there now. We think more in terms of the relationship between new money yields
and mature yields and obviously in the fourth quarter of last year we were reinvesting at
book yields comfortably above money running off. We were above in this first quarter but
less so but obviously in the second quarter we slipped below and rates were at the
lowest point in that cycle. To measure the GAAP and on a daily basis, it's random so we
do it over periods.
We look at the curve and spreads, we look at what is running off, we look at the mix of
assets we're buying which also changes and we also look at sales were making in the
market and we do make some sales. Especially, in areas where the tax reform act
changed that the profitability to us of certain products. I can tell you that the GAAP as we
measure it is excess of 50 basis points and can run higher than that and Ryan the net
effect of everything built this year as in the outlook for NII that the Dan shared in his
prepared remarks and that's in the outlook section of the 10-Q so that would all be
reflected in that number.

It's not a perfect comparison, but schedule keeps showed $625 million or so of releases

Alright. It's Dan, I wouldn't say more conservative and say more conservative loss pics, I
would say we're simply doing what we always do which is every quarter we're going to go
through all the data as it comes in relative to the expectations that we had in the previous
set of picks clearly we've moved over time favorably in prior year reserve development in
workers comp.
We do take those things and reflect them in our most recent views what you see this
quarter is simply another quarters worth of data where things have come in more
favorably than what we would have embedded in the prior PIK. I don't think this is in
anyway the unwinding of some increase in conservatism in prior PIKs

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, that's hopeful. Thanks, and then I guess this is for Michael, when we -- if we take out
the Personal Auto and Agency Homeowners from total personal lines, it seems like the
remainder the direct consumer and international actually saw about 200 basis point in the
quarter loss ratio on a year-over-year basis, excluding catastrophes reserve development.
Is that mix? Is that international?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 1843589 <GO>}

So, we obviously dispose the segment, we disclose the components and you're talking
about the delta, I would say and we sort of talked about this in past quarters the Canada
the international book, which is predominantly Ontario Auto but broadly Canada has been
underperforming we're being impacted their by similar trends and experience that you've
heard others in the industry talk about we've got a game plan to work to improve that,
but it's a challenging environment I will say on a positive note we've gotten a 7-point rate
increase approved by Ontario earlier this year, we have another rate increase on file with
the regulators as we speak and to that and some distribution management underwriting
actions were working to improve the performance there. But yeah, the delta there is really
a dragging primarily from International.

Yeah, Yaron that's a hard one to pick here on the fly, we're talking about going back and
looking at it, we've said for a few quarters that they were close one way or the other, a
couple of quarters ago when we said written was a little bit ahead of trend it was -- now
based on our new view was probably a little bit behind trend, exactly what quarter-to-date
the inflection point, is hard to pick there's a lot of estimation in all of it. We can tell you that
as you heard Greg saying his prepared remarks where we are today and it's not just rate,
it's rate and exposure. Where we are today even taking into account our updated view of
loss trend we feel like on a written basis we're expanding margin.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. And then if we turn to the homeowners, so the deterioration in the
loss ratio comes in the face of strong net premiums written growth and the Quantum to
product and in-home. Is the Quantum product is the growth strategy performing as
expected and it's just a matter of severe non-cat weather that's kind of thrown a wrinkle
this quarter or -- I want to stop there.

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 1843589 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure, and this is Michael. I would say the short answer to your question is yes. The
Quantum home two product is performing as expected as we monitor the loss
experience there and in particular, the data that's most credible still at this early stages is
frequency but the loss experience is performing as we expected in the product and in this
quarter really the miss on underlying is actually more than explained by the non-cat
weather variance.
I will take a step back and just talk to you sort of more broadly about homeowners
profitability and just remind everybody that we have been talking about a bit of pressure
on underlying loss experience in property, some of that weather related, some of that
non-weather water-related and while non-weather water wasn't a significant impact this
quarter. It doesn't mean it's gone away and so that's behind my comments about
continuing to drive for price change in homeowners in order to address some of those
underlying profitability challenges but again, we think it's really weather-related and a little
bit of non-weather water-related less about the product itself.

FINAL

Thanks and good morning. Maybe two quick follow-ups on the total climate. The first
question I have is what should give us confidence that this I guess Adverse trend line will
not spread across other segments. Is it more so the inherent, I guess nature of
commercial auto which leaves it, open to the plaintiff bar chasing it or what else is going
on, on a bit more deeper basis?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

Amit. I think we have said in prior quarters that we do see this thematically across liability
lines, so whether it's bodily injury severity in personal auto or whether it's the CMP
product or we have said we see it broadly but we've also said that there's this is driven by
a commercial auto underlying dynamic and the reason and I think we went into this little bit
in the fourth quarter, but the reason is there's a high degree of Homogeneity to those
losses and so in terms of the plaintiffs bars business model there's just a lot of
attractiveness to that as compared to other claims the slip-and-fall for example where it's
going to be highly dependent or any way more dependent on facts and circumstances
and it's a little bit more complicated to litigate. But again as we said in the past we do see
this thematically and we are taking that into account in all of our loss picks. Just so far, it's
been for the most part a commercial auto dynamic.

Q - Amit Kumar

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. The second question is and my only question is if you look at the past trend lines
and I think all of us have lived through adverse total climate, is your margin guidance -- is
the thought process that it stabilizes here or are we at an inflection point or what should
give us confidence that said this does not deteriorate or continue to deteriorate further
and then sort of swing back? I mean how do we think about the inflection point here on
this slide? Thanks.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

I mean -- me and Greg did say in his prepared remarks that we did increase our loss PIKs
for BI as a consequence of what we're hearing. So, we are -- we think that the starting
point was higher in the inflation rate from here is higher, as I said and my answer to a prior
question do we think we've taken care of all of this, we think so otherwise we would have
done something different, having said that we're not trying to be aggressive or
conservative, we're trying to get it right.
Our loss estimates or yield losses go into our pricing and so it's important that we
sharpen the pencil and put our very best estimate on it and that's what we've done and I
think you can look back over some number of years and in our business and our track
record and whether it's in commercial auto or whether it's in personal auto or other
issues, this is insurance that's lost loss estimates and an underlying laws dynamics are
going to change, and all you can hope is that you've got the right data the right analytics,
the right experience and the right expertise to see it and react to it and we think if you
look back over time in our business, we've done a pretty good job of reacting to that and
this unfortunate when it happens but that's the business we're in and we think that we've
done all the right things.

Hey Brian, this is Greg. Yeah, first one you when you do that math, you're looking down
from a really strong period in the prior year and we've shared with you in the past all
those strategic initiatives we've been executing in the business really to free up our
underwriters and give them more capacity to be active in the marketplace.
The word active we will use based on different environments in the business right now
active is really addressing what you said making sure that we do have the right terms and
conditions and most importantly the right adequate price on the product and so our
underwriters have been using a lot of that capacity right now to improve the margins on
the business and we think, in terms of the book of business and your question on
retention, we think it's a really high quality book of business and we do everything
possible to work with our distributors to try to keep those retention levels up there while
improving the margins on the business also.

I would like to point out, 2011 was a very different environment in terms of where we were
in terms of rate adequacy and return. So it's difficult to draw a comparison every point in
the cycle is different and I'm not sure there's a lot of comparison.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you, got you. And then second question just quickly here. I know you guys are in Q2,
but you do have an excess and surplus line non-admitted carrier. Can you give us any
differentiation between those two markets as far as what you're seeing happening it non
admitted versus admitted?

FINAL

A - Gregory C Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Yeah, Brian this is Greg again. Yeah, sure. We see some of the industry statistics also
where there has been an uptake in some of the larger states from a non-admitted point
of view just as a reminder, we have two areas where we write non admitted business one
in our Northfield business, which is a less complex solution a smaller business exposure,
you can think of it that way and then we also use the not admitted business across our
property book of business but as you said certainly not a real big part of our product
strategy and that's because, we think we've got really modular and customized product
offerings and what we need to do to address terms and conditions in this market our
product portfolio has been able to do that, so we've been comfortable with that portfolio
mix.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great, thank you.

Operator
