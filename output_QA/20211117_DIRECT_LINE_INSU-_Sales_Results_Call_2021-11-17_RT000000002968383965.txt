{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for the second time and just a little
over a week. As we mentioned in the ﬁrst of (Technical Diﬃculty) half year results I spoke
about how we start from a position of strength with leading customer service, strong
brands and market-leading claims capabilities. But our biggest course of friction has been
our IT systems, which our technology transformation is aimed to address, providing our
pricing and underwriting teams with a step-changing capability.
So, why we've chosen Commercial as the next session to to provide you some insight on.
Well, there are three main reasons. Firstly, Commercial is furthest through this
transformation and show what can be achieved when you combine new technology and
data architecture with an agile way of working. Secondly, they demonstrate what can be
achieved if we get all the elements of the ﬂywheel working together. Over recent years,
it's driven strong growth and improved margin with only a small proportion of this driven
by market hardening.
And thirdly, Commercial is an increasingly important area of the group, both because it
provides a strong diversifying beneﬁts, but also, because of its ability to innovate and
deliver change at pace, its building knowledge and capability that the entire group can

learn from. So, I'm going to pass over to Jon Greenwood, the Managing Director of
Commercial to kick us oﬀ. Jon?

{BIO 17958326 <GO>}

Thank you, Penny, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased and proud to be here
today to talk about our Commercial business. For those of you that don't know me, I've
been with Direct Line Group for 20 years, starting life in our personal lines business and
taking responsibility for our Commercial business in 2010 prior to the IPO.
In that time, we've been pursuing our strategy of focusing on the SME market, supported
by a fundamental rebuild of our technology and data architecture. The Commercial
market is a very dynamic market, and over the last 10 years, we've been constantly
refreshing the business.
We believe that the business that we've built takes advantage of the opportunities this
brings and you will have seen the evidence of this in our ﬁnancial results. Today, you'll
hear from Sonya Bryson, our Managing Director of NIG; and Rebecca Clapham, our
Managing Director of Direct Line for Business.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll kick us oﬀ by highlighting the key messages, which we would like to convey through
this presentation. Firstly, we know that to compete in the SME market, it's necessary to
cater for a very diverse range of customers from sole traders through to complex
businesses. And so, we've been on an intensive journey to develop our multi-product,
multi-channel oﬀering, which gives customers the choice of how they deal with us.
Secondly, we transformed our technology systems, which has delivered in turn a step
change in our pricing capability and our use of data.
Thirdly, we've shown that we know how to succeed in this market and have signiﬁcantly
improved our proﬁtability whilst at the same time, delivering growth. Fourthly, we have a
highly entrepreneurial and innovative culture, which has enabled us to deliver a series of
successful initiatives and get ahead of emerging market trends.
And ﬁnally, this all means that we look ahead conﬁdent in the belief that we can continue
to grow.
Moving on to slide 6. I'll now provide an overview of the journey that we have been on
whilst transforming the business. It's been one of improving ﬁnancial performance,
coupled with investing in technology, all of which all of which has been done whilst
disrupting the SME market with numerous product and channel launchers, which you can
see in the timeline across the bottom of this slide.
The graphs show that two years prior to the IPO in 2012, we were a loss-making entity.
Since then, we have built a track record in not just improving the margins of the business,
but also in consistently delivering growth.

FINAL

In today's presentation, I'll explain how we've managed to achieve this. So, earlier I
mentioned, how critical it is to hold a diverse portfolio of strong product and the brands
in order to win in the complex SME market.
On slide 7, you can see, how we've built a business that caters to that market and provides
access to our products through a broad set of distribution channels. At the time of the IPO
in 2012, Commercial was made up almost exclusively of NIG and the recently launched
Direct Line for Business.
In 2018, we recognized the growing opportunity in the PCW channel and we created
Churchill for Business. And we've continued to innovate with the aim of getting ahead
and market trends both for Commercial and the rest of the group. Our most recent
initiative is focused on the trend away from outright car ownership and towards
subscription-based ownership, with the associated requirement for ﬂeet insurance.
We've already made an excellent start working with new entrants like Zoom through our
partnership arm UKI business solutions.

Bloomberg Transcript

And once the book is modest in size today, we believe it is strategically important for the
future. We see a strong overlap between the move to electric vehicles and the move to
subscription-based ownership, which is why the Commercial division has led the way in
developing our recent EV proposition. I'll come back to this later.
In summary, we have built a business that leverages a number of strong brands across a
range of established and growing channels, which means we are well-placed however the
market develops.
So, moving on to slide 8. I'll now provide some more details on the size of the market and
the potential it represents. Whilst it's diﬃcult to accurately size the SME market, we
believe it's worth around ?9 billion, which means that at the end of the third quarter, we
estimate our share to be approximately 7%. This in turn means that there is a signiﬁcant
opportunity for us to grow our share.
2021 has been a year of double-digit growth, enabled by our many investments and
initiatives, which have landed at a particularly favorable point in the cycle. Whilst the
market may turn at some point, we believe we are still well-positioned to grow. We see
growth from two key opportunities.
Firstly, using our improved capabilities to continue winning share within our existing
footprint. And secondly, expanding our footprint into slightly larger risks. Sonya and
Rebecca will talk more about these opportunities later.
But before I hand over to Sonya, I'd just like to spend some time talking about the data
and technology transformation that we've delivered. As I mentioned earlier, it has been a
key element in improving our competitiveness.

FINAL

So moving to slide 9. We've been retooling and improving the quality and visibility of our
data and the level of insight that we gain from it. This has delivered a step change in
capability for us over recent years. Our data is one of our most valuable resources, and for
Commercial lines, it's been one of the greatest opportunities, because it was previously
diﬃcult to access, and therefore, underutilized.
That's because, as with any growing business, multiple products and systems were
introduced at diﬀerent times resulting in a fragmented and complicated architecture.
Recently, signiﬁcant work has been done to re-platform much of our business and capture
the wealth of data that it produces. This diagram eﬀectively summarizes the constituent
parts of our new architecture, which we have totally rebuilt.
There's a lot of detail on the slide, but let me just take you through it step-by-step. First,
across the top, we've re-platformed all of our major brands. Secondly, we've built a data
layer, which essentially means we have consolidated and standardized our data into one
accessible system.
Thirdly, this data layer is enriched by external data sources, seen on the left-hand side of
the diagram. We import this data for both individual pricing and to enrich our pricing
models.

Bloomberg Transcript

Fourthly, this rich data ﬂows smoothly to the analytics layer where because the data is
standardized, we can use our models to quickly analyze and interrogate it. And ﬁnally, as
you can see on the right hand side, we can then ﬂow this modeling directly into the live
environment through the deployment layer without any loss of granularity.
Along the bottom of the slide, you can see our business insight layer, which makes the
data available to all of our people. We've dramatically increased the reach of insight
through our use of dynamic online dashboards.
So, hopefully that gives you a feel for how we have completely rebuilt the way we store
and leverage our data. But what does that mean for business performance? I'll now talk
you through how these new capabilities have driven a step change in our competitiveness
and our ﬁnancial performance.
Moving on to slide 10. The table shows how this new architecture has driven signiﬁcant
changes in where we spend our time. As you can see from the boxes on the left, the
pricing and modeling teams previously spent around 50% of their time pulling data
together, and wrangling it into a usable format.
Thanks to our new technologies, the analytics teams can now spend more of their time
focusing on delivering greater beneﬁts to the business. The analytics activity in the third
column has seen a remarkable four-fold increase in the time invested in this most valuable
of activities. So, what does that mean for our pricing capability?

Page 4 of 22

FINAL

Firstly, we've increased our suite of models from 15 to 92, generating a huge increase in
our pricing accuracy. Secondly, these changes, coupled with the adoption of agile ways of
working, have made a huge diﬀerence to the rate of change. Some products have seen
pricing updates move from yearly to several per week.
Thirdly, our new infrastructure is also designed for the future allowing us to enter the
world of alternative modeling by utilizing machine-learning techniques. The introduction
of these new techniques has allowed us to refresh models such as those, which look at
conversion and retention, with considerably less data and much faster than was previously
possible.
We believe this ability can give us a real competitive edge. So, what impact have these
changes had? Well, it's been key to improving our current year proﬁtability through
signiﬁcantly improving technical pricing accuracy, which has then enabled us to target the
right types of risk and tap into pockets of value we see in the market. This step change
has been a core component in Commercial's transformation and underpins our business
strategy along with the pursuit of new opportunities, which I will return to later.
But ﬁrst, I'm going to pass over to Sonya to talk about the NIG's strategy in more detail.
Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Sonya Bryson
Thanks, John and good afternoon. By way of introduction, I've got over 20 years'
experience in the commercial market, the last 10 of which have been here at DLG. So, the
purpose of this section is to provide an overview of the journey we've been on in NIG,
how we've transformed our business and how we are now winning in the broker market.
I'll start with an overview of NIG. What we do and where we trade. And then, move on to
the key ingredients for success in the intermediated SME market. And ﬁnally, why we are
winning in that market.
So on to slide 12. So ﬁrstly, we've been around a long time. So our NIG brand is wellknown amongst brokers with a reputation for strong customer service. This is crucial in the
broker market. Over recent years, we've been on a journey of improving NIG's
proﬁtability at the same time as growing, this is incredibly diﬃcult to do at the same time.
And so, for the next few slides, I'll walk through how we have achieved this and why we
believe we're set up well for the future. But ﬁrst, a bit more detail on what we do. So, NIG
was originally a provider of Personal and Commercial lines, but are now solely focused on
commercial entities in the SME space, and it's all intermediated by brokers.
The NIG book has evolved over time. And today, we underwrite various products that can
be easily categorized into four key areas. First, our complex business accounts for just
under 40% of GWP and has seen good growth, particularly, this year. This is our regionally
traded business, serviced out of 10 oﬃces. The majority of which are strategically located
for easy access to key brokers and markets.

FINAL

Our ﬂagship product here is Motor Trade, where we ensure vehicle garages for motor
sales, repairs and servicing. It's a product that's been part of the NIG stable for a long
time because of our expertise and it's also a market that is changing capacity. And so, our
reliability here really gives brokers conﬁdence.
Second is our niche business, where we have particular specialist expertise that sets us
apart from the market. There are three main cohorts here. We've set up a dedicated
service center for our schemes business, which is business where brokers we trade with
have a particular specialism, and they carry out the majority of policy administration.
Niche also includes our agricultural insurance brand FarmWeb. We're now in the top
three for provision of agricultural insurance and our proposition here stacks up really well
against the market leaders.
And ﬁnally, municipal housing, there are only a few other insurers playing at scale in this
space and it's another market that's quite ﬂuid in capacity, but our expertise means we
have weathered the peaks and troughs well in recent years to remain a consistent and
recognized provider.

Bloomberg Transcript

Third is e-trade, which makes up around 18% excluding the motor lines, and is an online
system that allows brokers to self-serve the common set of package policies such as
property owners, oﬃces, shops, trades bill and the like. This space is evolving as brokers
continually seek eﬃciencies and more complex business is being e-traded.
Keeping their journey as simple and as eﬃcient as possible without compromising
underwriting integrity is key, and we continue to enhance the system and aim to be bestin-class.
Finally, the Motor business, which is around 18% of GWP, and also has seen signiﬁcant
growth in the last 18 months, primarily in the van and mini ﬂeet arena. But across the
piece, we've worked hard to improve the proﬁtability of the book over recent years. The
portfolio certainly wasn't broken, but the ongoing soft market, some large claims, and a
few weather events brought the trajectory in sharper focus.
From there, we implemented a plan of rate carry, both ahead of our competitors and
ahead of claims inﬂation, alongside using data and good old-fashioned underwriting. We
took a forensic look at the book to target sectors of underperformance. It was quite a
tough journey, especially to be an outlier of at this rate strategies. But the slide I'll cover
next will demonstrate we knew how to navigate it, and we have come out stronger the
other side.
Moving on to slide 13, where I'll outline what it takes to win and what is a crowded SME
market. It's critical we understand what makes a diﬀerence to brokers, so that we're ﬁrst
on their speed dial. The technology and data transformation that Jon walked through
earlier are core underpin to this. But to really excel in this market, there are ﬁve key things
you need to get right.

FINAL

Firstly, you need strong broker relationships. This is, without doubt, a relationship
business and nurturing those relationships over time really pays dividends. Secondly, a
great (Technical Diﬃculty) especially claims. It's essential to reassure brokers and
customers that we're there for them when they need us.
Thirdly, you need a comprehensive product set, that needs to appealed to a broad range
of customers' needs and innovation to ﬁnd ways to add value for brokers. Fourth, having
robust eﬀective underwriting is critical. This has been a key part of our ﬁxed journey over
the past four years.
And ﬁnally, of course, you need ﬁnancial stability and capacity. Overall, what we've
learned over recent years is that if you get these things right, you can win in the broker
market. I'll now bring to life how we have achieved this and what it's meant for the
business.
So, on to slide 14, so, what have we done to make sure we meet the needs of brokers. Our
systems journey has meant some heavy lifting and the improvements in data that Jon
spoke about, has helped us grow NIG and I've put some of the key points on this slide.

Bloomberg Transcript

As I said, this (Technical Diﬃculty) great broker relationships and we know that giving
brokers access to empowered underwriters who can and will make trading decisions is a
key diﬀerentiator. We'll continue to look for ways to expand our regional footprint where
there's opportunity to add value in local trading regions.
An example of this would be the dedicated center that we set up for the smaller brokers
to trade with us, those who rarely get any kind of service from competitors. We give
brokers choice about how they trade, and so, we've enhanced our award-winning e-trade
system, award-winning again only last week. And that now utilizes robotics, automation
and AI to enable our brokers a quicker customer journey and improved conversion.
Now, this really is eﬀortless trade-in with around 75% of NIG policies now e-traded and
despite those volumes, we're achieving customer satisfaction feedback scores of over
90%. As a further build, we're aligning our e-trade products to our regional ones to
ensure brokers have full channel choice. A recent example would be the mini ﬂeet
product, which has been revitalized with a new rating set, a refreshed underwriting
appetite, and acceptance criteria much more aligned to the regional ﬂeet product.
Now whilst we're mindful that e-trade business is certainly less sticky, the growth we've
seen in that product with absolutely no marketing activity demonstrates that brokers want
to use the system for quick and eﬃcient trading.
So, onto customer service, we provide ourselves on service and this was evident during
the pandemic when we continued to serve brokers without interruption and our
availability delivered a really strong Q2 trading performance. But that's actually only half
of the story. You need to follow it up with a brilliant claim service.

FINAL

You'll remember Jessie spoke about improved claims processes in June and we've
beneﬁted from that in Commercial. The improved ﬁrst notiﬁcation of loss process and the
digitized claims handling now allows customers to notify these digitally, uploading
photographs and video to support their claims, which reduces the time it takes us to settle
them.
We can even pay some claims that they have received. So we've leveraged our
technology capability and strong broker relationships to see where we can expand our
products and propositions. We've done this through new products such as Add-On Cyber
and Professional Indemnity for deﬁned trade men and we're looking at areas where we
can expand that further.
But beyond that, we've looked at what other value-adds that will give brokers an edge, a
real USP, and so we made a brave decision to launch NIG Risk Assist mid-pandemic to
give brokers and clients help managing their business through an online portal. It's
available 24/7, oﬀers advice, training and relevant support such as business reactivation
toolkit, which guided businesses through reopening once lockdown restrictions eased.

Bloomberg Transcript

We've had over 50,000 policyholders registered their interest in the toolkit and now have
over 6,500 active users. Anecdotal feedback form them has been really positive about its
power to help win and retain customers, because they can see the value it adds to their
business. But all of this must be supported by robust and competent underwriting.
Our experience in underwriting has been the other proof point on our journey. This was
brought to life by the way NIG navigated the FCA test case on business interruption
policies last year in response to the coronavirus. 15 years ago, following the following the
SARS outbreak, we have the foresights to future-proof our product and our BI exposure
was very limited to just a few broker schemes wordings.
Now, in addition to the e-trade business, we've been re-platforming our complex
business on to activists over the last three years, to improve the data sophistication and
risk data capture that Jon mentioned. It's given us much more agility to change rates
quicker based on the insights from the improved modeling and means we can actively
focus on risk selection based on that data.
The re-platforming has also enabled us to update our products and the way we trade
them, replacing outdated proposal forms with currency and the facts, and providing
instant online policy documentation to the customer.
We're over three quarters of the way through that journey now with just one more product
to go, and we've seen an increase in average new business premium of nearly 30% in two
of our core products that have beneﬁted from the move. And this last point brings all of
these steps together as we expand our strategy of more than before. And ideas nailed to
the S of SME, but the strength of our underwriting alongside the data and systems
improvements demonstrates we're capable of much, much more within the SME footprint.

FINAL

We've been extending our reach and growing by writing more emphasized business now,
which has been accelerated by the market changes. Our broker relationships have
deepened and to drive this to the next level, we've launched lead and follow line
products to respond to the market cycle. This is where larger risks are scheduled as
insurers pull back their capacity and we've also established a new team of experienced
brokers to deliver our niche oﬀering. This is designed to further diversify our portfolio in a
controlled and measured way, seeking growth in new areas.
So, on to slide 15, what does it all mean? This chart shows the GWP journey and an
awesome 15% growth on prior year demonstrating that we've successfully navigated a
period of ﬁxed and systems transformation alongside a period of tooling up, and we're a
go-to-insure of choice for SME business, which of course we're thrilled with.
And by building on what we already do really well, we hone the nuances of the overall
NIG proposition for SME customers and our pricing capability and underwriting discipline
will mean, we'll continue this fantastic work and strike the right balance between growth
and proﬁt, was further demonstrating our relevance in an ever-changing market. This is
why we have conﬁdence in our capability and momentum to drive future success. I'm now
going to hand over to Rebecca to talk about the DL for B. Thank you.

Good afternoon. I've been at DLG for 14 years holding roles across both Personal and
Commercial lines, specializing in product development, trading and regulatory
disciplines.
We're really proud of Direct Line for Business and what we have achieved. It is a real
disruptive brand oﬀering customers and alternative to using brokers. Our mission is to
create and capture the direct market through innovation and the ability to deliver change
at pace, all underpinned by great technology. It really is an exciting place to be.
Since its launch in 2007, it has delivered consistent growth up to a premium base of ?147
million in 2020. In recent years, through technology transformation, we continue to
expand the footprint of Direct Line for Business. So, we have massive potential to go
further. We estimate the market size could grow to around ?3 billion, and so we have a
strategy that continues to innovate and build unique customer oﬀerings in order to win
end market.
We have all the right ingredients to achieve that. We have enhanced the way our products
are structured to give customers more choice and ﬂexibility, to truly build a policy around
their diverse needs. And we've rebuilt our systems and rating capability to give SMEs
insurance this great value.
This required both a retooling of our business, but also a mindset change in how quickly
we react to changing customer demands. This transformation has increased our customer
base by over 25% since 2016. But we know we have only just started.

FINAL

Over the next few slides, I'll walk you through how we've achieved this and why we are
conﬁdent for the future. As you can see on slide 18, we took numerous steps to transform
Direct Line for Business, to design a solution, to better serve customers, and capitalize on
the opportunity to create and capture the direct commercial market.
First, we needed to oﬀer ﬂexible cover that could be tailored to a customer's needs
through using modular pick and mix style products backed up with strong customer
propositions. We used the underwriting appetite and experience we had in NIG and
expanded our products set to serve SME customers who we believed would come direct.
Our new customer journeys ensured simplicity for customers with plain English used to
explain cover and provide transparency. We knew we could capitalize on the group data
enhanced our rating capability to ensure our pricing delivered sustainable growth and
was competitive.

Bloomberg Transcript

We set up segment alliance squads so we could build deep customer and product
expertise. Squads are empowered multi-skilled teams brought together to focus on a
speciﬁc mission. We have built on our strong brand recognition by expanding our
marketing capability to give us opportunity to segment our customers. Our customers, be
anything, from a gardener to a ﬁrm of graphic designers, we need to be able to tailor
communications for our varied customer base.
And ﬁnally, and most importantly, our new technology stack which Jon talked to you
earlier, alongside the creation of in-house engineering capability provided the agility to
respond quickly. Our IT infrastructure is modular and we have engineers embedded in
our squads, which means, we can quickly design and execute the business strategy. This
creates speed in things like price, product and customer journey changes, allowing us to
respond to our improved data it's telling us.
On slide 19, here you can see a timeline of all our key activity. And as you can see that it's
been a busy ﬁve years. We decided that to create and capture the market, we would start
small and iterate, building our products for one customer segment at a time. Alongside
the building of new products, we also took steps to transform our ways of working to
ensure we could fully capitalize on the modern systems we have invested in.
One of the key components was the implementation of the agile operating model, which
creates squads empowered to execute against a focused mission. This enables us to
deliver change at pace and at lower cost. This capability is absolutely essential to win in
this market as each product is bespoke and tailored to speciﬁc risks. This methodology
has been replicated across our motor and home core businesses to create that same
agility.
Projecting forward, we believe we will be able to continue with the healthy cadence of
delivering new products for further expanding customer base.
On slide 20, you'll see having the right tools and products and an agile mindset means
we now have all the four elements of the ﬂywheel that Penny talked about. This has
Page 10 of 22

enabled us to deliver strong growth. It also means, we are perfectly placed to take
advantage of a growing market.

FINAL

So, starting with customer focus, our ﬂexible pick-and-mix SME product suite means we
can serve over 850 trades by allowing them to build their insurance cover around their
business needs. Our easy-to-use product builders means customers can personalize the
cover, they choose to what's right for them.
And our Plain English ensures customers get the right information they need to help them
make the right choice. Our agile systems and ways of working mean we can respond
rapidly. During the pandemic, we got our customer-facing colleagues working from home
within 48 hours. We also launched market-leading propositions, which meant we looked
after our customers when they needed it the most.
Our MoneyBack Mileage proposition gave customers refunds when they weren't using
their van as much during lockdowns. Our free legal essentials product was given to all our
SME customers giving them vital access to legal advice when navigating through
unchartered territory like furlough schemes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second, our group wide claims expertise and scale has given us the opportunity to
deliver market-leading propositions, giving customers access to rapid resolutions when
they need to make a claim. We were the ﬁrst commercial insurer to oﬀer property
emergency cover to landlords.
We also replaced stolen tack within 24 hours using our robust claim supply chain. This is
when our service really matters most to customers. Their livelihoods are at stake. And so,
the claim service we provide is of paramount importance to us.
Third is eﬃciency, our new systems mean we can deliver more product change ourselves,
meaning quick iteration of our customer journey and product oﬀering is available. We've
also improved the eﬃciency of our marketing spend signiﬁcantly overtime to test and
learn activity meaning we can achieve more from our investments.
Finally, we continue to innovate for sustainable growth and we're excited about what the
future holds. Our online journeys have continued to evolve and adapt to more eﬃciently
serve our customers. Customers now have multiple channels to choose from when they
need to service their policy. We have squads actively working on the delivery of our next
product enhancements, and targeting new customer segments, which will allow us to
serve even more trades.
So moving to slide 21. Hopefully, I've given you a feel for why we are so excited for what
we believe we can achieve in the future with Direct Line for Business. We have a proven
track record of disrupting the SME market and delivering proﬁtable growth. With our
technology transformation and ability to deliver change at pace, we look ahead with
conﬁdence. And with that, I'll pass back to Jon.

Thanks, Rebecca. DL for B is a great example of where we have seen an opportunity in the
market and move decisively to capitalize on it. It's just these types of opportunities, which
we are constantly on the lookout for.
Churchill for Business is another great example. As I brieﬂy mentioned at the start in 2018,
we saw an opportunity to use our powerful Churchill brand in the PCW channel. We set
up a small team, and since then, they are focused on this growing channel, selling
landlord, van and trades person products, and they're due to launch a shop and business
from home product very soon.
At H1 this year, Churchill had grown its GWP by over 60% year-on-year. For 2021, we
expect premiums to reach in excess of ?25 million.
Moving on to slide 24. We're increasingly seeing an overlap between our Commercial
and Personal lines businesses and so we have continued to build expertise in a range of
areas that we believe will also help a wider group.

Bloomberg Transcript

Starting on the left. We have a number of partnerships that enabled us to build capability
in the increasingly popular car subscription space. And I've already mentioned our
partnership with (inaudible) where we're providing motor insurance to customers within
their monthly car subscription.
We believe that car subscriptions will become increasingly important for customers
making the transition to electric vehicles. Clearly, sustainability is a huge focus for us and
at the start of this month, we launched a new EV proposition with a company called Zoom
EV, with the mission to make electric easy.
We're oﬀering new Direct Line car customers a free bundle of EV essentials, such as
discounts on public charging points, ﬁtting of home charges, and reduced costs on home
electricity. In the Investor Insight Session at the end of June, Penny and the Claims
management team spoke about our expertise in repairing electric vehicles, and all the
activity that we have in trade to prepare for the growing demand for them. This
proposition builds on that expertise and seeks to help our customers make the switch as
easily as possible.
So, to close. Hopefully, we've shown you today how we've managed to transform our
commercial business. Commercial is an important part of the Group, both in terms of the
diversiﬁcation that it brings and through its focus on innovation. We intend to increase the
pace of change in the coming years, harnessing our multi-distribution strategy and
utilizing the tools, which are now embedded in our business, whilst looking for new
emerging trends.
We've already proven, we know how to succeed in the SME market, but we know there is
more to go up, both through targeting growth through our existing products and by
increasing our customer footprint. I've now spent 11 years leading this business. And I

Thanks. Okay. While Jon sits down, I just want to take the opportunity to thank Jon, Sonya
and Rebecca. I'm enthusiastic about giving you the chance to understand our business
better by meeting the teams who drive it forward, but I also recognize that takes a
considerable eﬀort on their part. What I really want you to take away from today, is the
passion, the expertise, and the energy that sit behind this Commercial business and the
opportunity that lies ahead for it.
I'll pause there and then open it up, and enable you to ask questions of the team. So, I'm
going to hand over to Molly who's going to coordinate our Q&A this afternoon. Molly?

Question And Answer

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The ﬁrst question comes from the line of a Freya Kong
calling from Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Q - Freya Kong

{BIO 20097488 <GO>}

Hi guys. Thanks for the presentation. Inside I think you talked about growth expected to
slow in commercial. What sort of growth should we expect going forward and is this slow
down because you expect the cycle to turn or something else? And secondly, what is your
view of competition in the SME market and who do you see as your key competitors as
you move into the medium segment, what sort of commercial risks or customer segments
are you looking to target? Thanks.

A - Mark Evans

{BIO 21104710 <GO>}

I'll take the ﬁrst question on future growth and then I'll pass to Sonia to cover the question
on who we see as our key competitors in the M or SME. So look, I mean you've seen
hopefully that we've been on a tremendous journey. We've now got a fantastic range of
distribution channels, we've got investment in technology which means that we have a
huge amount of conﬁdence in our pricing capability.
We think our service oﬀering is one of the best and that all points towards a very high
level of conﬁdence in our ability to grow in a hard or a soft market. I mentioned in my
presentation that many of our initiatives have landed at a particularly good point in the
sense of the market has been hard particularly in 2021 and to a degree in 2020, and that
certainly helped us. But my belief is that we can continue to grow I think Penny when she
spoke last week referenced the fact that, we would expect growth in the mid-to-high

Page 13 of 22

single digits after or in a diﬀerent market in diﬀerent market conditions. And I think that's I
think that's good guidance. Sonya, medium.

FINAL

A - Sonya Bryson
Yeah. So I guess, the ﬁrst part of the question who are our competitors. The really good
news is there are existing competitors. And so we already know lots about them, we know
about their footprint, we know where we kind of bump-up against them. And we also
know why we're diﬀerent and we value why we're diﬀerent. In terms of the types of
business that will grow into, I mean this is much, this is very much about growing into our
existing footprint.
So we're not changing our retention we're not changing our reinsurance anything like that
it's just about using more of the space that's available. And so, we will do things that
aren't we're not typically known for in NIG, but it's pretty common place in the M space.
I'm not going to go into product details because we've not released that yet, but we will
be having a quite controlled look at distribution about who we give access to those
products to. Because we want to do it in a controlled and measured way, but a very
determined way. Thanks Freya. Molly?

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of at James Shuck calling from Citi.
Please go ahead.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Two questions from me. First the just on NIG. It
does ﬁt strangely within the portfolio, it's a B2B business essentially in the rest of Direct
Line is predominantly retail one, and it's broke a business. So, you just kind of elaborate a
bit on why you're committed to that, wouldn't it make sense as being a home with
someone else?
And then secondly, Direct Line's of business, I mean the growth has been okay over the
last decade or so, we would still doing only about GBP150 million in premium. If I look
across the pond for the U.S., I can see some very interesting startups are growing much
quicker than that. I'm just keen to get your views about the structure of the U.K. market
and whether it's diﬀerent to the U.S. and why the U.S. seems to be accelerating much
more quickly when it comes to the solar platform? Thank you.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

I'll take the ﬁrst one, John might want to comment on the second one, I suspect. Look, I've
talked about where NIG ﬁts before. So yeah, it's a broker business. But actually we are all
about kind of people and small businesses so it ﬁts across the portfolio in that sense.
It's delivering a strong return, it wasn't several years ago, but it certainly is now, so that's
another positive thing and I think what the team have given you today is several examples
of where there are crossovers and learning's moving between the portfolio and diﬀerent

directions, whether it's pricing or underwriting agile ways of working EVs, some of the
data techniques which run across the group.

FINAL

So for us yes, it's a slightly diﬀerent distribution channel route than we use in other
spaces, but actually there's a huge amount of synergy across the group and that's the
reason we stand behind it and a proud to own it. John.

A - Jonathan Greenwood

{BIO 17958326 <GO>}

Thank you Penny. So the U.S. versus the UK SME market and Direct speciﬁcally. So I think
there's a point of real diﬀerence and then I think there's a point of real similarity. The point
of real diﬀerences is the commercial insurance market in the U.S. I think is structured very
diﬀerently, the state-by-state nature of the U.S. market. I think in itself is fundamentally
diﬀerent to the UK. So I don't draw too many parallels other than to say that we certainly
visited some of the U.S. startups and looked at their journey.

Bloomberg Transcript

And one of the things that they have in common with us is a commitment to increasing
the make their businesses digital and data-driven and we're doing the same thing. And
we believe that the kind of trends in society more generally, support the shift towards
commercials as particularly small commercial businesses, buying directly.
And you'll have seen one of the investments that we've made is in the new platform for
DLG has given us the ability to produce products on a modular basis. I think Rebecca
referred to it as a pick-and-mix, so it's extremely ﬂexible. We couple that with digital
journeys, which are very intuitive and then our expertise in pricing and I think we've got a
very powerful combination of strength within the group that mean that as that trend
continues, we're very well positioned to take advantage of it.
If you were to break down the Direct Line for business performance, the fastest-growing
part is the part, which is focused on small businesses as opposed to landlords and vans.
So we're getting double digit growth in that particular part of the business. So maybe
more in common with some of the other businesses that you've observed in that sense.

Q - Analyst
Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you very much. I've got a couple of questions. The ﬁrst one is
perhaps on some midterm targets related to proﬁtability of the commercial. I appreciate
you might not give precise numbers here but can you guide us at least where --

FINAL

commercial stand within their 93% to 95% range and how do you think about the cycle
there?
And the second one I guess, one of the purpose of the session at least in my mind has
been to see what the beneﬁts of the transformation and commercial can mean to the rest
of the businesses and motor and home. So, just wondering whether you could maybe
draw some parallels of what has worked in commercial irrespective of the cycle because
quickly in commercials you've highlighted you had the beneﬁt of hardening weights and
motor and home you might or you might not necessarily next year? Thank you.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Okay. John, do you want to comment on the ﬁrst one on and then Neil may want to add?

A - Jonathan Greenwood

{BIO 17958326 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, we operate quite short answer we operate within the same range. We've
been moving toward that you'll see that we're now within the range and that's where we
intend to stay.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That's probably covered it. So read across I mean, I think what are we saying? We're
saying that a lot of the things than transformation eﬀects that have happened in
commercial that we've driven there. We're also driving in motor and home although
homes probably a year or so behind the others. So in that sense it's summer and
commercial yes had a few tailwinds from hardening at the bottom end of the market.
But we're convinced this growth there regardless of that, because of the things that we've
done on pricing because of the automation and technology that's gone into customer
service and broker service speciﬁcally, because of the use the use of data. Now, if you
look across the group of what's going on we're investing in data architecture and use of
data group-wide.
So not just in commercial we've put the new motor system in over the course of this year,
which massively improves the functionality for our pricing colleagues and so we have a
backlog of things that they are working through to take advantage of that they have not
been able to do in the past and so the shorthand is it we've got a particular thing to do
with pricing practices that will juggle around, where rates at across the market in a few
weeks time.
But actually the fundamentals behind that of the investments that we've made in
commercial, those similar Investments are going into motor and a coming on stream and
a notch behind that and home as well. So I think there is some read across that there are
beneﬁts to come through in other parts of the opposed that I think. Molly, we've got
another question.

ahead.

FINAL

Q - Faizan Lakhani

{BIO 20034558 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. So the ﬁrst question is on the
medium size risk that you're looking at. Historically, the quite volatile relative to the small
segment of the market, you look to use more reassurance here?
And second question is on the competitive environment. A lot of your commercial peers
have potentially scarred by the business interruption saga if you can call it that. How much
of the beneﬁt do you see in the market share from the players who were sort of publicly
sort of struggling with ABI scandal? Thank you.

A - Jonathan Greenwood

{BIO 17958326 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll certainly take the ﬁrst of those questions. So we believe the reinsurance program that
we have in place is well-suited not just to the smaller risks that we that dominate our boat
but also to medium-sized risks, so we're quite comfortable with the existing reinsurance
program.
In terms of business interruption and the eﬀect its had on our competitors you can see
quite mixed results from our competitors in terms of their performance over the last two
years I wouldn't be speciﬁc about where in particular we've won business from, but it's
undoubtedly true that whilst our competitors were coping with or dealing with the impact
of business interruption claims that would have had an adverse eﬀect on them which we
will certainly have had some beneﬁt from consistently which particular insurers we've won
business from.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

I think the only thing I'd add to that is we also see sell-through the pandemic service
diﬀerentials. So one of the things the technology I think is enabled as us to carry more
volumes on the servicing side. So, I think there are a number of factors as to where they've
been diﬀerential performances between the competitors in that space.

Q - Faizan Lakhani

{BIO 20034558 <GO>}

Who are your main competitors across SME commercial space?

A - Jonathan Greenwood

{BIO 17958326 <GO>}

All names you know already. So, Aviva, AXA, Alliance, RSA, Zurich, Gouveia, AGS, the list

of coming to the table as well. So that's what I mean by it is a really crowded space and so
you really need to know what brokers respond to, to be able to come top of the pile.

Q - Analyst
Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. My ﬁrst question. Do
you have any M&A at pockets in the commercial space? And my second question is on
the current inﬂation, because on the -- you've got you seem to have a lower claims
information versus your peers, you've got the beneﬁt from those and the presence of your
own. You have similar and competitive advantage in your commercial lines. And what
does that look like and getting the inviting claims inﬂation outlook? Thank you.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Okay. So, I've got the second question. So, it wasn't a very clear line, so I apologize. Let's
do the second one on claims inﬂation, just while John take you through that one. Can you
just repeat the ﬁrst question for us?

Q - Analyst
Yes. My ﬁrst question is in the commercial line. Do you have any M&A at pipe?

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Now -- right.

A - Jonathan Greenwood

{BIO 17958326 <GO>}

So, I didn't quite catch the question, but I'll try and anticipate what I suspect was in there,

So, we beneﬁt from many of the taking that second and his ﬁrst, we beneﬁt from many of
the same advantages that our personal lines colleagues do so for instance, the because
they've been repaired in the commercial book also go into the arcs and therefore, we
were able to have a greater control of inﬂation as a consequence of that. In terms of what
we're actually seeing in inﬂation we've not yet, seen a material shift in inﬂation on any of
our lines of business there it's still essentially ﬁnishing still within the range that we would
anticipate.
The good news is that we have been consistently carrying premium rates ahead of claims
inﬂation. So we have some headroom from that perspective and of course as and when
and if we were to see changes in inﬂation, which we very watchful of the moment we
would respond to it appropriately. Second question.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

M&A, strategic M&A. I think the short answer on that is we're open-minded, we monitor
the situation if the right book came across and we are comfortable with it then we would
certainly look at it. But nothing's report at the moment. Molly, have we got any further
questions?

Q - Analyst
Hi there, thanks for taking my question. Firstly on investment spend increase. How much
are you spending on these platforms? And how much is required to maintain these
systems or keep them cutting edge going forward?
And the second question is on the transformation journey. I think the commercial
transformation has taken ﬁve years since you decided to upgrade the systems. Just
wondering where we are journey for the other businesses, the retail businesses. And it is
the cost to build out on those platforms lower given the learnings that you've had so far
from come to commercial business? Thank you.

A - Jonathan Greenwood

{BIO 17958326 <GO>}

So I take the ﬁrst of those two questions. I think the good news is the heavy lifting is
complete now. So, in terms of the investments that we needed to make to upgrade our
platforms, they are largely done.
Of course, we will continue to invest but the sums required to keep those systems
updated a far more modest on what be speciﬁc about the amounts that we spend or
intend to spend going we intend to spend going forward, but I think the overarching
point is that the heavy lifting is done and it's now just a question of keeping those systems
updated as and when.

FINAL

I think on more broadly at across the business. Look, we've been investing in the
technology platform across the business for some years now. So and if you think about it
we replaced everything on motor pretty much there on rescue with a place of ﬁnance
systems. We've done a lot of the infrastructure with cloud enabled everything with
invested in data and I could go on.
So we are a long way through that journey and the motor kind of policy administration
systems the claims upgrade and the new pricing systems going in earlier in this year is a
pretty critical landing for us in that Journey. So we should see the cost of investment in
technology come down and normalize over the next year or two and we've given kind of
that sense for what's left to do. Well right now, we're focused on kind of taking advantage
of the systems that we put in, in particular in pricing.
So getting the backlog of external data sources and models and in plate that we've
wanted to do for some time. We continue to invest in data and we're beginning the
process of bringing home onto the same architecture as the motor system, which is a
much smaller program than the original ones. So, we're a long way through the journey
on retail as well, and starting the process of kind of taking the beneﬁts at what we've built
rather than just being in build phase. Molly?

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Yes. Hi, Penny. And thanks for an excellent presentation. So just a couple of questions,
please. First on just growth for the market as a whole, you absolutely set out your
competitive advantage. But if I look at ABI data assay for the market as a whole. It's been a
shrinking market and big shrinking market property.
This and I'm going back over 10 years, motors is not as bad, but it still a down market.
And your growth of 4% per annum is particularly impressive in the backdrop of that. But
what's your base assumption for medium-term goals for the market as a whole? That's the
ﬁrst question.
And second, can you talk a bit about regulation. And obviously, it's a huge amount going
on the personal line site. And so, what's the outlook on the commercial side? And is there
a feeling that what you're seeing on the personal lines I'd like actually approaching of you
is what that group into the SME market at all? Thanks.

{BIO 17958326 <GO>}

FINAL

I'm going to take them in reverse order. The second question around the impact of
pricing practices on commercial or the commercial division within DLG is very modest,
because it only really aﬀects a subset of our van business. So in that sense at this moment
in time very modest, we obviously keep an eye out for any future changes but at the
moment that's the only one that's on the horizon.
In terms of growth in the market, I think what particularly excites us has been the growth in
the S and the micro of SME. And that of course, is highly relevant to our portfolio of
businesses because they're very much focused on that end of the market. So diﬃcult to
see precisely what impact the pandemic is going to have when very unusual times but we
would still see positive prospect for the UK commercial sector and in particular, micro and
S of SME, which is our is our particular focus.

Q - Alan Devlin

{BIO 5936254 <GO>}

A couple questions for me. First of all, the NIG is focused on the year the broker market,
while the deal for businesses focused is a disruptive brand focusing on disintermediating
the brokers. Is there any, any conﬂict are and how do you manage the conﬂict of the risk is
you know the core brokers on the NIG side?
And the second question on the mortar and van part of the business which like 20% of
both businesses, do they have the same access to the garage network as a personalized
business house and if so, what kind of competitive advantages that give you in that part of
the market? Thanks.

A - Neil Manser

{BIO 5571223 <GO>}

So the conﬂict question ﬁrst, I've run this business for ten years now. So it's a question that
I've often faced. I can honestly say is not caused as any problem having a commercial
business which contains within it an oﬀering that is direct and an oﬀering that is through
insurance brokers.

FINAL

We quite simply aim to be brilliant in both of those channels and we support our brokers
wholeheartedly, providing them with the best possible service as we can and I think
you've seen in the growth ﬁgures that Sonya has talked about that we've been well
rewarded for the quality of the oﬀering that we have through NIG. Ultimately customers
will decide which channel they wish to purchase their insurance products through. The
great thing that we have is the ability to serve them wherever they choose to buy their
insurance.
Your second question that -- repair centers. Yes, we do use our repair centers. For the
direct book, we use repair centers roughly the same proportion as in the personal lines
business slightly less so for the repairs that come through the intermediate channels and
it gives us all the same advantages around control of costs that are personal lines
colleagues beneﬁt from.
