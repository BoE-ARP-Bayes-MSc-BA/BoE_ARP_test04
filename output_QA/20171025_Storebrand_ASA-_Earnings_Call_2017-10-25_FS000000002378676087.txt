{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Thank you, Kjetil. First of all, it's great pleasure for me to present very strong results for the
third quarter. I'm very pleased especially with the strong operating results, close to NOK
600 million, actually NOK 596 million and an overall strong development also in the
ﬁnancial results. The front book is developing very good on all diﬀerent elements. But the
most important news this quarter is of course around the acquisitions that we made clear
this morning and also yesterday. It's the acquisition of the management company,
SKAGEN, and also the acquisition of the individual pension provider, Silver.
I will give you a brief introduction to this. Also (00:02:27) of course, this is really the story
we have been telling for the last ﬁve years. So it's a twofold strategy. It's all about creating
growth and value from the front book in Savings and Insurance, and combined with that,
that's the capital life of the growth. Combine that with capital release from the currencies
back book which now have reached their peak capital consumption level.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have used this quarter very much on development of the organic growth. We are also
very great to do that this quarter. But in this quarter, I've also added substantial growth in
the Savings and pension of our fee-based business, our capitalized business through the
acquisitions of SKAGEN and Silver.
And if we just jump to slide number 7 to give the highlights from the acquisition of
SKAGEN, this is a asset management company. You have the details in the previous slides.
It is a company that has a leading position in Norway when it comes to (00:03:37) and it's
a leading provider for retail savings in Norway. And that is a very complementary strength
compared to Storebrand that has a leading position when it comes to pension in the
Norwegian and the Nordic markets.
Together, we combined our market share in (00:04:00) markets up to a number two
position, moving from Storebrand's today's position of 4% market share up to 17% market
share with this acquisition. We also see a lot of opportunities when it comes to
distribution, distributing Storebrand's products through the retail bank distribution
network and also on the institutional area. We have a lot of possibilities to work together
in Norway and in Sweden (00:04:39) our presence, but also with a strong presence that
SKAGEN had in Europe when it comes to distribution.
And of course, adding this acquisition and also the acquisition of Silver together, we
move up to a better scalable business, now up to about NOK 720 billion assets under
management. SKAGEN in itself has NOK 80 billion assets under management.
The ﬁnal beneﬁts are quite clear. It's that increased scale in asset management in itself
that is good opportunities for our cost synergies but also for scalable business in diﬀerent
segments and markets. We said that we had our fee-based business shift our total
business to one (00:05:38) nonguaranteed income streams and revenue streams. And
that there are cost synergy opportunities both cost synergies and more income-based
synergies going forward.

FINAL

The transaction are accretive in the market and we see that although they together will
reduce the solvency ratio with together 3% points. It creates a long-term good income
and it also increases our dividend capacity.
If I then just move to slide number 15, that is the summary of the transaction of
Storebrand. It's NOK 1.6 billion in payment. It's 75% in shares in Storebrand and 25% in
cash. There is some (00:06:40) mechanisms and also a split of proﬁt sharing, a split of
performance fees going forward. And I just want to say that we will really like to see these
coming through because if they do, that will create top results (00:06:58) for Storebrand.
The ground payment is NOK 1.6 billion for the underlying result stream in SKAGEN.
Just also brieﬂy then on slide 17 and 18 on the acquisition of Silver. This is close to 20,000
customers in Norway that will be remove a from guaranteed product into a fee-based
non-guaranteed product. In this transaction, we will have close to NOK 10 billion in paidup policies with the investment choice, the non-guaranteed part – or the non-guaranteed
product. And we already have our systems, our solutions in place to take care of this onboarding of this portfolio.
And as you see on slide 18, (00:07:57) portfolio, the company portfolio in the life
insurance company paid NOK 620 million and expect an increase in the administration
results of approximately NOK 60 million in the years to come based on this transaction.

NOK 517 million (00:08:15) Yes. Thank you, Lars. And with that, Lars, I think I give the word
to you.

Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Thank you, Odd Arild. I'm proud to present – and I'm starting here on page 18. I'm proud
to present the strong numbers this quarter. NOK 596 million in operating results is a new
record as far as I know. I guided last quarter that the operating result is expected to land
somewhere between – or somewhere above NOK 500 million for the quarter on a
normalized basis. I repeat the guiding, and these results are somewhat above what we
can expect going forward.
There is, however, no speciﬁc items that improved the ﬁgures signiﬁcantly by themselves,
rather a number of smaller positive contributions from across the business. At the same
time, good returns allow us to continue with buﬀer building. The EBIT is strong due to
good results and a low tax rate in the quarter.
Turning to page 19, the solvency position is impacted by three main elements – margin
improvement, technical adjustments and operating value creation. Starting with the ﬁrst
Page 3 of 13

FINAL

movement on the left hand side, model improvements of this quarter contributed a
negative 1 percentage point. We're constantly working to improve our models and this
time it has led to a marginal negative 1 percentage point. Over time, model improvements
have contributed positively.
On a more technical nature, volatility adjustment was reduced by 3 basis points to 18% in
Norway and by 1 basis point to 3 in Sweden. This led to a 1 percentage point fall in the
solvency margin. The steepness of the interest rate curve around the 9- to 10-year point
impacts the forward curve beyond 10 years even without a change in the interest that
(00:10:09). This contributed another negative 1 percentage point.
The third element is that the equity stress factor increases when equity markets go up.
This led to the volume of negative 1 percentage point for combined negative contribution
of 3 percentage points from primarily technical factors. Importantly, the operating
earnings and asset return contributed positively 3 percentage points, in line with previous
guiding on ongoing operational capital integration. Add to this in the transitional capital
of 10 percentage points for a regulatory solvency of 160%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning the page to page 20, this movements give us a solvency overview, a picture into
the sensitivities related to movements in rates, equity market, spreads, and UFR. The
sensitivities are more or less unchanged from the previous quarter.
Turning the page once again to page 21, it is satisfying to see that the growth in the top
line is picking the speed. The top line growth adjusted for changes in currency rates
between Norwegian krone and Swedish krona is up 5%. That is driven by an 11% front
book growth more than making up for the decline in the back book revenues.
Insurance resulted (00:11:32) the quarter and year-to-date despite low growth in
premiums. Cost control remained satisfactory. Financial results are done from last year,
but still at the satisfactory level. The tax rate for the quarter is negative, i.e. we had tax
income due to a sale of a property which has released the tax liability. Our expected longterm tax rate remains slightly above 20%.
And with that, I ﬁnish the run through of the numbers, and we open up for questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. The ﬁrst question comes from Paul De'Ath from RBC. Please go ahead. Your
line is now open.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yeah. Hi there. And thanks for taking my questions. A couple please. Firstly, looking at the
SKAGEN acquisition kind of going back to one of the questions (12:42) the presentation
this morning, really, can you tell us anymore about why as you think that Storebrand as an

FINAL

owner will help you turn around the fortunes of SKAGEN and ultimately you're keeping
the business quite separate from Storebrand. So there's not that much kind of in the way
of synergies to come through from combining the entities? That's the ﬁrst question.
And then the second point, just more broadly on M&A as a strategy, you've obviously
done two acquisitions today. Were these just kind of opportunistic given the situation that
the companies were in or is going through M&A more of a longer-term strategy for you?
And if so, are there more opportunities out there that you can see? Thanks.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Thank you. Start with SKAGEN. I think we strongly believe in the quality of the
investment processes in SKAGEN. We see that there has been strong turnaround from the
today's management in SKAGEN. We also believe that Storebrand has a goal toward
stable (14:08) as SKAGEN will be a very good factor to also calm down the markets
around ownership in SKAGEN in itself. We (14:24) that we will keep SKAGEN investment
strategies, the product functions (14:31) and the brand independence. But also very clear
that we will work together when it comes to distribution, when it comes to operating
platform and to make this that scalable, I think, the (14:48) that is possible to take you out
in that respect. And we are starting that journey now in close relation with the top
management in SKAGEN, and we're looking forward to engage into that and to work
together with the SKAGEN management on that point going forward. So to sum that up,
we're very clear about what is independent and very clear about what we should work
together on.
When it comes to M&A strategy, I think I will say that looking at Storebrand's business, we
have a very attractive front book that is growing very steadily this quarter with 20% in
(15:29) and 10% in asset management. We don't need to have a very active M&A strategy
to keep our business growing forward. That has been a very clear statement from me. For
a while, (15:42) on that.
What you saw here was two very clear opportunities in the market where we have directly
in our core strategy growing asset management and savings (15:59) opportunities and
additional assets in an equity way for our shareholders. We saw that we can switch that
balance from guaranteed business into fee-based nonguaranteed business, in the way
that we create stronger results and also stronger dividend capacity going forward. And it's
also an opportunity we use and you should not expect those to be coming on a quarterly
basis back to the market with this kind of acquisition. This was the opportunity that was
very close towards (16:38) and we are very pleased to see that we were able to (16:44) that
opportunity and create this values as we see it.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Excellent. Thanks.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. I've got ton of questions. I'll try to limit myself to three initially. The
ﬁrst two on the Silver portfolio. When I tried to do my sort of back of the envelope sums, I
think I mean to get to the NOK 60 million, I basically need to assume that you make
roughly the same revenue margin on the acquired assets as you're doing your existing
assets and that there's basically almost no increase to the cost base. I'm just wondering if
that's sort of in line with your assumptions or whether I'm missing something there,
perhaps you could just share a little bit what your assumptions are around that.
The second thing was on the – could you say something about this sort of ALM in the
acquired portfolio, whether there is a duration gap, for instance, et cetera? And then,
perhaps ﬁnal question, diﬀerent subject. I just wondered if you could say a little bit more
about why the modeling changes had a negative impact on the solvency ratio? I guess,
my very lay and ignorant view is that model improvements usually lead to a requirement
to be less conservative. But I mean, generally – I guess they generally tend to increase the
ratio. I just wondered if you could put me straight there. Thank you very much.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hello, Peter. Let me start with the ﬁrst question. The Silver portfolio will be converted to
better (18:41) with investment choice. We are assuming the same price on those products
as we are doing on our current paid-up policies with investment choice. And as you look
at the vendor mix of (18:58) unit-linked portfolio, there is a substantial part which is
occupational pension with general lower margins and (19:09) you have on the personal
products. So, that's an expense that these have somewhat higher margins on average.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Shortly just on question number two, these are – or the NOK 8.5 million is non-guaranteed
product. So there's no ALM – no liability-driven asset management there. It's actually
more about customers (19:33) preference and life cycle portfolios.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

(19:38).

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And then the last question there on the model improvements (19:44). It's important to
remember that work and what we do every year is that we are using Q3 to update all
assumptions regarding the total business also (20:02) regarding the small changes in
diﬀerent assumptions and small loan changes and (20:10). And we do not expect (20:14)
on a quarterly basis, but that's what we showed this quarter.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
And as I said initially as well, this has led to signiﬁcant improvements in the solvency over
time but there are adjustments done every quarter, and in this quarter it was also a
negative eﬀect.

positives and some negatives.

And the next questions come from Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your
line is now open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. Ashik here from JPMorgan. Just three questions I have. First of
all, I mean can we get some color about the SKAGEN assets under management. It has
gone down for last four years in a row. So, what was the reason for that? Can we get some
color on that? That is one question I have.
The second is the non-life combined ratio, especially claims ratio has improved quite a lot,
7 percentage point, in past one year and I can see that on slide number 26 that it has
been consistently getting better. So, is this the right number 68% or are these numbers
driven by resolved releases? So how should we think about normalized number and what
is the reason for such an improvement because 7 percentage point improvement in one
year seems quite a lot.
And the third question is how should we think about this capital generation because you
were doing around 3% in the last two quarters and then this quarter was around 2%
operating earnings capital generation. So how should we think about that number? What
is the normal run rate? I remember, your past guidance is 5% to 10%. So, what should we
think about that? And just related to that is, the model changes has been there for the
past three quarters which are negative items, minus 2, minus 2 and minus 1. So shall we
continue to model a negative number going forward as well or do you think that this is
just a timing issue? Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Okay. I'll start with SKAGEN and (22:34) the question was around development in asset
management within SKAGEN. It of course has been a tremendous journey from the start
of the company in 1993 and they have some fantastic years when it comes to performance
Page 7 of 13



Company Name: Storebrand ASA

Date: 2017-10-25

FINAL

and also we're starting in asset management and 2013 was really top year of SKAGEN. We
have seen for the last couple of three years that there has been outﬂow from SKAGEN,
mainly has been institutional clients that has – that's the company. And we believe that it
has to do also with some hurdles around the ownership of the company. We of course
feel the processes around investment are now in place. Strong management is taking this
going forward.
We will add on with our competence, rather we can of course spot SKAGEN and we also
of course will work with long-term incentives for the key (23:54) we make sure that we
have a stable development with growth going forward.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
On non-life for claims, I guess we've said we're going for a 90% to 92% combined ratio.
We've had some reserve releases within (24:16) product. We also have some seasonally
good results in health insurance this quarter that are far better than the results. So I think
90% to 92% combined ratio is still in our guidance on that.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

So you would say that this quarter was exceptionally strong – last three, four quarters has
been exceptionally strong and we should revert back to 90% to 92%.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl

Bloomberg Transcript

That's our best guess and we look forward, yes.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

If you look at the movement in solvency, I think you're right that we have seen very strong
(24:57) earnings on asset returns over the last quarters which are led to improve the
solvency margin, so above what is typically expected on a normalized basis. At the same
time, we have seen a drag on the solvency ratio from interest rate curve (25:19) on equity.
And especially this quarter, we have 1 percentage point negative impact from decreased
wholesale (25:30) adjustment and 1 percentage point negative impact from increased
equity stresses. At the same time, those are increasing or decreasing depending on
movements in the capital markets. We have very strong returns in the equity market as
well, which have materialized on our buﬀer cash ﬂow and have enhanced that to good
asset return and (25:57) higher capital generation from assets return this quarter, but
(26:03) negative impacts from increased equity stress on the other hand.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
When we sum up the guidance on the capital generation, we still look at 6 to 10
percentage points each year coming from operational and (26:21) returns.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

That's after dividends.

And the next questions come from Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is
now open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hello. Good afternoon. Thanks. Just two questions for me. So ﬁrstly, I just wondered you
talk a bit about how the Solvency II ratio has developed and there has been (27:17) by you
guys over the last two years or so. I mean, it's clear you guys as the management team
have done a good job in optimizing the model, improving the Solvency II ratio and it has
now stabilized above the increased target range of 150%. From the outside, it just seems
like now you got a much better footing. We are seeing more sort of action in other areas,
i.e., M&A, a bit of negative model change coming through perhaps unwinding some of
the positives that have already been actioned. And also giving back a bit of the
transitional beneﬁt. I mean, I just wanted to gauge how we should be thinking about the
Solvency II ratio from here. I mean, do you have like an upper bound in mind? Is this
actually a sort of good level to be running the business too? Or do you think we should
still go higher from here? Should we expect you to sort of use the additional ﬁrepower
that you've got if you're generating capital over and above that 150%? And what are the
priorities? I mean, is it M&A? Is it cash return? I guess that's the key (28:26) after the deal is
done today. That's quite a long question.
Secondly, I just wanted to pick your brains on the SKAGEN deal. I mean, what do you see
as the addressable cost base for us to form our own view on synergy potentially? I guess
the chunks of the business is going to be kept separate, but I mean the NOK 50 million to
me seems like when you say it's fast-paced, but it does seem a bit conservative. So, any
color there would be great. Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you for your questions. First, to talk about the solvency ratio, we have (29:06)
around over the solvency ratios. We like to be although we see a normal span of solvency

Page 9 of 13



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2017-10-25

FINAL

to be between 150% and 180%. And we have also stated in our dividend policy that you
should expect extraordinary dividends if we move in the – well, up in the upper scale or
above this 180%.
Today, we are at 160% (29:36) with the transitional rules and 150% without, we expect to
continue to build (29:48) capital less. Also, always, you have to address (29:52). And we
intend to do that to create the (30:03) and give the solvency ratio going forward based on
our normal business, but we see that we have (30:12) extreme capital life growth in the
front book combined with situation, obviously, that the back book has turned the corner
and it's on (30:24) for the back book. So this will be capital positive and solvency creative
business going forward. And we want to be in that span as we have talked about and that
we assure the market on our latest Capital Markets Day.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Just a follow-up on that quickly, I mean – I guess if the back book has now peaked, as you
all reached peak levels as you're saying and we're going to start to see a lot of capital
being spun oﬀ, then what – I mean why did you have to issue equity to do the deal today?
Surely, there'd be plenty to come and maybe you'd be able to bridge it by doing
something else.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

We didn't have to do that before doing the deal today. That was – we see that the deal is
accretive with this equity portion in the market. We also see that is a good alignment
between outsized buyers and the sellers, and that really like the story and like it'll also be
carryover in Storebrand going forward. That's together with the split of the performance
on fees and so on. Makes a good alignment with the sellers and the buyers in that deal.
So we felt that this was a very good way of ﬁnancing the deal altogether. But it's not
based on that we have to do it that way. We feel that we have a good solvency position as
we expect to increase that also going forward.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
And then on the SKAGEN synergies and cost base.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yeah, on the SKAGEN synergies, I think, well, you, Lars, have all the numbers. But on top
of my mind, it's around above NOK 400 million in cost base in the SKAGEN company.
And it's also around NOK 600 million in cost base in our own management business. So
together, it's something slightly above NOK 1 billion in total cost base for these two
businesses.

And we do have a question, one more from Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan. Please go
ahead. Your line is now open.

FINAL

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah, hi. This is Ashik here again, sorry. I mean can we get some color about the cost base
of your business compared to SKAGEN because if I look on slide number 33, it looks like
your external assets under management is NOK 136 billion, but your total cost base
including distribution is only NOK 500 million, whereas SKAGEN is roughly, say, twothirds of your asset base, and their cost base is NOK – how much, NOK 700 million? So,
pretty small relative asset under management third-party, but pretty high cost base. So
why are you giving this NOK 50 million guidance on savings and not more? Is that
something to do with in-house internal transfer of revenue in Storebrand which is not
there in SKAGEN? So how should we think about that? And again secondly, if I go back to
the capital generation, you continue to have this asset re-risking beneﬁt in solvency ratio.
So till what time can we expect that number, that positive number to continue?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Starting with SKAGEN and the cost base, of course it's a very good brand business we are
running in Storebrand, very much based on what we do for our life insurance companies
in Norway and Sweden. We leverage on that and do external business mainly in
institutional markets. And of course, with much lower cost base, but also much lower fees
compared to the active business we do and (34:54) of SKAGEN. So the cost structure is
very diﬀerent in these two companies. And I also like to add that of course there is
signiﬁcant cost base, but the main focus for us now is to leverage on the diﬀerent
platforms that right opportunities we'll see in our combined pension and savings market
that we see going forward will be more and more of the same markets in especially
Norway. And taking this position, taking a part of this growth together is really what is
driving us in that ﬁeld and not cost reductions (35:35).

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

I just have a follow-up question on that as well. I mean it looks like your revenue margin is
pretty high in SKAGEN. I mean 120 basis points versus your own revenue margin is around
70%, 80%. So is it driven by asset mix because 120 basis points seems a bit large
compared to what typically it would be for an asset manager in Europe?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

It's driven by both asset mix and also by the fact that it's a pure outlook in SKAGEN.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
I think we can add also that the SKAGEN business, you should view that not only as an
asset management but also as a wealth management business, combined with an asset
manager. So the distribution cost is a lot higher than it is with us. We have mostly digital
and captive distribution, while here you have a big distribution network. So, that's an
important part in order to understand the diﬀerences in cost base.

Well, I think (36:45) your second question regarding capital generation and our Solvency
II. I'm not sure that (00:36:53) you have some – you mentioned something about reducing
SCR through re-risking.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

No. I mean, it could be asset re-risking as well because if I look on slide number – where
you have the split of the solvency ratio, slide number 19, there is something called asset
return business mix change has 1 percentage point improvement in the solvency ratio. I
guess you mentioned that in past as well that you see this regularly. So how much more
room to do asset re-risking is there or business mix change? So any thoughts on that
would be great.

Actually, this quarter there are actually taking more risk than they have done – or
increased risk due to (37:37) markets. This is really that you have had strong returns which
has created more buﬀer cash ﬂow which is a very good under Solvency II. (37:55) we
could of course increase Solvency (37:58) today with taking more in scope. But what we
are trying to do with the Solvency or the cash ﬂow mix or the asset mix is really to evolve
at that level of (00:38:11) capital. It's we are trying to see (38:14) solvency capital as well as
the volatility in that number. So there are diﬀerent (38:21) but at the moment, we are just
trying to (38:28) level on capital generation. As such, those are these things need to be
viewed in connection with (38:34)

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. That's clear. Thank you.

And we have another question. And the question is coming from Matti Ahokas from the
Danske Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Two question please. Just to clarify on the SKAGEN acquisition. If
we assume that the current proﬁtability does not increase, will that also mean that there
will be no further earn-out, so this would be the ﬁnal price paid for it. The second
question is also on the capital generation and from a slightly diﬀerent angle, the 6 to 10
percentage point increase that you've guided on, how much of that – or how much is the
impact of the lower SCR in the guaranteed business in 2018 and 2019? Just trying to get a
feeling of how much of a relief could we expect to see in terms of – in capital next year
and in 2019. Thanks.

FINAL

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
If I start with the SKAGEN acquisition and the earn-out model, if SKAGEN does well and
perform well in terms of better performance fees as well as increase in assets under
management, we will be extremely happy to pay a little more in the earn-out. We will still
get the bulk of that value creation. However, if we are not able to turn it around and the
business does not perform well, this is the limit to how much we have paid. So we have
(40:15) deal where we share some of the upside but where we have basically looked the
downside.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Well, (40:27) your second question, we have (40:29) down in back level because (40:36)
portfolio is still growing, although the average interest rates are coming down in that
portfolio as well. But I don't think that's something that we will have to revert (40:49) on a
later stage.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Please do. That's really interesting. Thanks a lot.

Operator
There is no questions coming through. I will now hand the call back to you. Thank you.
