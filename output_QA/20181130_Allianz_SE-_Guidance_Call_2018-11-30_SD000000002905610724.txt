Good morning, to everybody in the room. Good morning to those who are following us
online today. Welcome to the Allianz Capital Markets Day here in Munich.
Please allow me some brief housekeeping before we start. As always, our legal
department kindly asks you to note our disclaimer about forward-looking statements in
the back of the handout. Second, let me remind you that this event will be recorded and
broadcast live on the Internet. And ﬁnally, as you can see on the agenda in front of you,

we will have a joint Q&A session after the end of the formal presentations. So please save
your questions until then.

FINAL

That's already all from my side for now. And without further ado, I hand over to our CEO,
Oliver BÃ¤te.

Oliver BÃ¤te
Good morning. Warm welcome to Munich. Thank you for your attention. I'm really happy
to see a lot of shareholders and friends in the room and those we would like to be friends
in the room. We have some others still left. But I think we're trying to do our best today to
make the last hesitant investors and others to make a real big fans of
Allianz.
I have a strong crew on stage today. So this is not a one-man or one-person show. Allianz
is an institution that delivers. It's far less dependent, that's the good news, on its CEO than
people think. And we will try to showcase that today.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now before we dive into the future, just a little recap of where we are coming from when
we launched the Renewal Agenda three years ago because people have gotten used to a
lot of good news and no surprises from Allianz. But in itself. And given the environment,
that is no and was no sure thing.
So what I'm going to talk about is 4 things. First, take a little stock of the last three years,
what has happened, talk about what we're going to do in the next phase of our Renewal
Agenda. And the headline is called simplicity wins. We're trying to decomplexitize what
we do and harness something that you have never seen in economics in our industry. That
is called scale. Factually, we have these economies of scale in our industry. And we'll talk
about how do we turn something from what we can call a conglomerate discount into a
premium.
Then a little bit on capital management from my side. Giulio will talk a lot more about
capital management and how we are going to deliver. Then I'll brieﬂy touch upon the
targets, not just the numbers, what is the philosophy behind the way we set targets. And
we will remain what you've always known, conservative Germans at the heart with the
global power to deliver beyond what people think is possible.
Now you know that we are a global ﬁnancial leader. But just as a little bit of a backdrop.
We're expecting more than EUR 11 billion in operating proﬁt. By the way, people tend to
forget that we are earning more than EUR 3 billion in United States. When people say,
what is your global footprint? We're earning more than EUR 3 billion in the Unites States
and growing. The value of new business from Asia, which was very low a few years back, is
growing constantly. And we haven't compromised on capital strength. I think there's very
few institutions in our industry that have the balance sheet that we do have.

FINAL

And again, on the asset management side, I think it's still underappreciated. We're
managing more than EUR 1.5 trillion in assets under management for third parties. That is
not including the money that is managed for us. And we have the vast majority with our
asset managers because we believe they are the best, not just because they're with us.
Now going a little forward, I hope that happens. When we said to set our targets. And I
would like to particularly go on the earnings per share growth, the 10-year average that
Allianz had achieved between 2005 and '15 was 2.6%, through the ﬁnancial crisis, of
course. But that was the number. When the current management team took over as a
team, the analyst estimate of what we would do over the next few years was 2.4%. That
was the consensus.
Now we said we need to rebase the expectations of our investors to how Allianz can grow
its earnings. And we targeted 5%. Now as of nine months, we are looking at 7.1%
compounded EPS growth over the last three years. And we'll talk about how we are going
-- what are we going to do going forward. So this is 1.4x what we gave ourselves as a
target. And we really believe it's a stretch target. And it's 3x of what the analyst
community considered to be possible in 2005.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now you will may immediately say, if you're a cynic, yes, yes, yes, when you do a share
buyback, that is easy to do. Well in order to do share buybacks, you have to do a few
things. And one of them is to have the money to actually spend it. Now you can take the
money and borrow it by leveraging your balance sheet. But you can also do something
else. You can try to improve operating performance. And you can do it in a sustainable
way.
So this page A5 is super important because we had given ourselves operating proﬁt
improvement targets across the entire universe of Allianz, not just thinking through how
we can help our colleagues in Newport Beach to refoot themselves. Remember, we had a
few hundred billion in outﬂows. The tide turned only in the Second Quarter of 2016. '17
was the most successful year in the history of the ﬁrm, EUR 145 billion net inﬂows. And in
this year, which probably is one of the most diﬃcult in the history of bond management,
we're having positive ﬂows. Very few do have that.
And the same, Allianz Global Investors, we are seeing be on a not-so-successful business
model, hodgepodge of leftovers has proven to be extremely strong and are growing,
while active asset managers, particularly those owned by large other ﬁrms, have been
pushed to the wayside.
Now the key objective beyond turning around PIMCO and refooting the Asset
Management segment was structurally rebuilding the Life Insurance business. And we
wanted to have new product set that reduced the capital consumption massively.
Remember still 65% of our risk capital, because of the reserve build-up, is in the Life
Insurance segment. And we had to transform it. Now we have overperformed our target,
82% is in the new lines, on average, 60% to 70% less capital consumptive than just a few
years ago. And our new business margin is north of 3.4% and that -- given that a
signiﬁcant part of our portfolio is still in Europe with very low interest rates. And we tried

Page 3 of 59

FINAL

to do the almost impossible, move all of our life businesses to earn a return on equity
north of 10%. So making sure that with the volatility, we would never fall below the cost of
capital.
93% is what we have been done. We have 2 or 3 small ones left. And let me tell you, we
are working on making those either improved or ﬁnd a diﬀerent destiny. Instrumental, of
course, was the sale of our Korean business at the end of 2016, what people still tend to
forget. At the peak, the negative value was north of EUR 1.5 billion.
The other thing I'd like to mention is, why are we doing so well for consumers and our
shareholders? Because we change the dependencies on traded equities and other
instruments that we consider to be overvalued by moving consequently over many years
into being a leader in alternative assets. We gave ourselves a target to have EUR 110
billion in the portfolio in the alternative asset space, obviously, a signiﬁcant part in real
estate. As of today, we are closing in on EUR 130 billion, outperforming our own
expectations. And that's very good for our shareholders because it detaches us from the
volatility that you've seen in the equity markets and consistently delivering on something
and building the competitive advantage that we have. That is excess liquidity that is not
under stress.

Bloomberg Transcript

So that is what I wanted to talk about. We have made a lot of progress on digital and
transformation. But IvÃ¡n de la Sota will talk a lot more about that. So let me just move
onwards.
The other thing that is very important is now we're starting to harness the beneﬁts of
working on the proﬁtability side. Because if you improve the margins consistently and if
you work on managing productivity up, you start to see growth coming in. And it's very,
very important to notice that this is not a low-growth business anymore, whether you'll see
that in property-casualty, in the life new business space, in third-party assets under
management or the total internal growth. And I think people do not have that in their
mind as they think about Allianz. And these things are actually going in tandem.
Only if you exceed in customer loyalty, you have the proper productivity is growth
coming. They are depending on each other. And they are not independent of each other.
If you're trying to grow without having the prerequisite, you will wreak havoc eventually
on margins. So it's very important that you see -- and I'm very proud to see, after a long
time in spending on IT, that we see productivity growth coming through, at the same time,
that customer loyalty is really picking up.
Let's move forward. Now that you know the shareholder returns relative to the index have
been very strong, thank you very much for your support. And we do not intend to change
that picture.
Now let me summarize, therefore, the last three years and how do we move. The ﬁrst one,
PIMCO is back to top performance. GI is substantially strengthened. In Life and Health, we
have restructured the business model to make sure we have the power to grow. And in

Page 4 of 59

FINAL

P&C, we are closing in on the 94% combined ratio and the growth in the business while
others are losing top line.
So therefore what is next? What is next? What do we do? And the messages are we have
to do 3 things to drive the renewal agenda for the next chapter. We need to aim to
outperform across the portfolio, not just in the vast majority. There's no room for leakage.
We really need to transform the core of the business, not just optimize it. It's particularly
important for the Property-Casualty business after many years of laying the foundations of,
for example, retooling our key infrastructure massively. And we need to rebalance our
capital allocation internally even more towards the business where the growth and value
creation is. Move away from the focus on top line across the portfolio on those where the
value is even if that's very diﬃcult. So on top of that, I'd like to move forward.
Now why is this so important? We believe we are entering an era that is a lot less benign
than the last three years have been, particularly in terms of the stock market. So we spent
a lot of time analyzing our environment that was basically driven by signiﬁcant economic
growth globally, fairly stable political environments and booming capital markets. And
having low interest rates, yes, we knew. But we had enough time to deal with that and we
also had good time to deal with regulation. The next two years, ladies and gentlemen, are
going to be very diﬀerent. You saw that over the last few months.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we asked ourselves, how much do we want to be dependent on an environment that
supports us? And the answer is absolutely nothing. We want to do what we have under
our control. And we can say. And we don't mean it in an arrogant way, we don't need help
from anybody to get this done.
Now let's talk about it, how we think about it conceptually. So what we've done the last
three years is to lay the foundations, to do the groundwork with our Renewal Agenda 1.0.
Remember the turnarounds we had to do in Asset Management, the transformation in the
Life business and bringing technical excellence to Property-Casualty. So delivering on the
outperformance agenda, the transformation, the rebalance requires 3 things in terms of
focus.
Number one, bringing productivity to the core of our DNA. That is very important.
Creating scalability to what we call the Allianz Customer Model. And we're starting in
Property-Casualty on the retail side and SME. And again being more strict in capital
allocation and giving targets to our businesses on where the capital needs to go,
including building new businesses like our European Direct Platform that are acting in a
legacy-free way environment.
The tools are going to be the same. We do not want to every three years have a new way
to run the company. We need stability. Some of our top investors this morning just said,
we're investing in you for no surprises. We need stability in the way we do things. But we
need to tweak a little bit the ambition.
So I don't want to go through the details. But just give you a couple of examples. A lot of
that is about culture. For the last 11 years I've been here, I was CFO, we have basically
Page 5 of 59

FINAL

spent a lot of time with our businesses to negotiate plans and then making sure ambitious
plans that are being delivered upon. It was very much checked against the competition.
But to be honest, it was all about how do I make my plan or outdeliver. It was less about
how do I beat the best in the market. And that is what has to come now.
The aspiration for all Allianz businesses has to be to beat the best in every market. And it
is very tough to do and we may not always be able to do that. But that is the aspiration.
The other one is the constant feedback you get. Well if you do a business transformation,
your people will be unhappy because you're letting employees go and so on. It's just not
true. Our most successful change leaders do reposition the business for the future and
mobilize the people, even if that includes job losses at times, which are not the objectives.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second thing and that is very important is we need to move out of the boom and bust
cycles that we have in our industry. When there are soft cycles, the markets go down.
There's cost-cutting programs where you take money out of marketing, advertising, you
stop investing in IT. This is not what we mean. What we mean is to move to a diﬀerent
level of operational excellence starting with a very simple concept. The simpler we design
our products and processes, the better it is for our consumers and the better it is for our
people. And I will talk a little bit about that in a second.
Therefore, we will continue our drive to outperform the market. As it stands today, we
have about an NPS outperformance of 71%. I think it's more going to be like 72% by the
end of the year. We need to move north of 75%. And by the way, more on a personal
note, today, about 40% of our businesses are loyalty leaders, i.e., in customer satisfaction
are the best of their markets. We need to move far beyond that to 50%. Because only if
we excite our clients, we will be great.
Now every business is trying to do that today. So it's not about the ambition, it's about
how do we deliver. But if you think about that 2014 at the end, only 47% of our businesses,
it's quite embarrassing actually, were better than market average. Just in three years, we
moved this number north of 71%. And there was a massive contribution by our business
leaders. And we're going to continuously push on that. It requires more intuitive products
where the word intuitive and insurance rarely make it into the same sentence, right? So
that is really what we have to do.
We have to make sure, very parochial things, that processes are trouble-free for our
people and our clients. And we are going to implement the most advanced technology to
measure customer satisfaction in real time frontline steering called, what we call, Voice of
the Customer. So no more telephone calls out asking people what they think. Having
instant replies is what we're going to do.
The same is very important on employee mobilization. And we need to get better at that.
And I say it openly, we have to make sure that we are more purpose-driven in our culture,
less expert-driven and really train our people to not just be leading the people into
technical excellence or towards technical excellence. But to be helping the business to
transform.

A key prerequisite is, by the way. And I'm going to talk about it a little more and IvÃ¡n will
do even more so, is to get rid of what we call legacy. We are excellent in inventing new
things. We're very good at reconﬁguring the platform and bringing new products. What
we are not so good at is making sure that the so-called back book is disappearing as
quickly as it can. And we've now laid the foundation over the last few years by
harmonizing our global IT to move. And we think we're unique in our industry to discard
the legacy. That will require energy. It will require signiﬁcant investments against
increasing productivity. And our people will have to deliver that in a way that is legacyfree.
Now how do we deﬁne outperformance? There are many ways per market how you can
do that. As an investor view, you would use some of these matrices, particularly for Life
and P&C. And you can see that in Life Insurance. And I think many investors do not have
that on their radar. We are closing in really on best practice in terms of margin. Allianz is
coming from a very diﬀerent point and starting point. And we are now ready for growth
and innovation.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now return on equity is not really the best number to assess an asset management
business. Run rate revenue growth will be the number, in our opinion, for the future.
Sustainable earnings growth will be very, very important, not AUM. I think the AUM focus
is totally wrong because a lot of low-margin business is ﬂowing into balance sheets. And
we're already there because we are leading in proﬁtability already and we have proven in
this environment to grow revenues like few others.
And that leaves us with the focus on our core business Property-Casualty, the foundation
of Allianz' success over many years. We're getting very close to the 94% aspiration base.
But there's much more potential. There's much more potential, there's further upside,
particularly through productivity. You've seen it this year coming through, growing
particularly the retail space and doing massively better on analytical excellence.
So let me repeat, we do not need the market to help us. We do not need a
transformational M&A to ﬁx a problem that we don't have. We're going to do it when it
makes sense. But ﬁrst, we make sure we are the best at what we do across the portfolio.
Now there's a couple of examples of how you can use technology. And I thought about
how much time I spend on it. Since IvÃ¡n and the colleagues are going to give you a look
into the machine room, just take as a note that we are not looking at, for example, artiﬁcial
intelligence as a mumbo-jumbo thing that is somewhere in the back, geeks that we hire
from Google and do something outrageous that we don't understand. This is about
making everything that we do better every day. It's focusing on customer complaints,
what is the average claim ﬁle duration in the business, how to bring the Net Promoter
Score up and how do we bring fraud protection up. These are real examples. This is an
example out of Turkey thinking through how we drive it through the business. So you get
these examples every day. What you don't get is the impact it has on the business if you
execute properly.

This is the last conceptual slide I'm going to use. But let me just summarize what is it that
we are trying to achieve. We call this simplicity wins and we mean it. And we are a fairly
complex organization and it's -- we're not going to be super simple tomorrow. So this is a
journey that we are on. But it starts with something that we haven't really focused on
enough, making sure we have massively fewer and more intuitive products that our
consumers really like. And if we have to diﬀerentiate, we want to diﬀerentiate in modules
so that additional variation doesn't cost us in the machine room. And we want to make
sure we have no negative surprises. The key driver, by the way, for customer satisfaction is
not the average NPS that we have. It's getting rid of these detractors. We have the good -get good in the machine room like any good manufacturing company is today.
Digital is not about replacing humans. Everybody says this is about the human-free
enterprise. It's just not true. What we are going to take out is all the complexity that our
people internally and externally don't want to have in the ﬁrst place, that is trouble-free
processes without legacy. Let me tell you, the last year, we had a lot of IT challenges
internally as we moved to a global data center structure. So doing that sounds easy. In
practice, getting to global scale and having stable operations is not an easy thing to do.
Then enhanced data analytics come on top.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now the third one is very important for you as investors to think through. Our business for
200 years has not been scalable. In fact, most of us get a conglomerate discount because
you say, how can you manage something better than the capital market? So we need to
prove that to you. And we've started already 10 years ago -- 14 years ago with a
sustainability program on technical excellence. This is what we are really good at, taking
rating and pricing technology across markets, product design in Life and globalizing it. So
we're very good at it.
What we've not been able to do is to bring it into the machine room. So harmonize
products and processes in a way that we can replicate them across countries. And IvÃ¡n is
going to talk about how we do that. And it was not born in my brain or some conceptual
adviser. It was born by our CEOs. And 3 of them are on stage today that have gone
through the journey the last few years to say, are our products locally really so much
diﬀerent than our middle managers are telling us? And they will tell you the story of how
harmonized our platforms can be. And again, now we have the IT stack to actually do it.
Last but not least is not just around reducing cost per unit, it is also bringing revenues up
because we want to replicate innovation across the markets and not just productivity. Now
we're not doing it afresh. So if you are worried about something that may sort of rupture
the operation, please remember that we already have global platforms highly successfully
dispersed across our enterprise today in asset management and the corporate lines,
Allianz Partners. But also in Allianz Investment Management, our really strong platform
that is delivering us between 40 and 50 basis points every year in risk-adjusted
outperformance. So we're going to do that and again we'll talk about that today in more
detail.
The idea is -- and Page 20 is just an illustration. We have to therefore bring the scale to
something that you eventually need to see in hardcore numbers. We have to bring growth
up beyond where it is, organically, not through M&A. We have to move the proﬁtability
Page 8 of 59

Date: 2018-11-30

FINAL

signiﬁcantly. And we can do a lot more. And and this is where it starts, to bring the
customer satisfaction beyond what people believe is possible on the industry average.
Now let me give you one example that gives you an illustration of the power of what we
are talking about today. This is an example from our Spanish operation that Allianz sets, in
many ways, the benchmark for eﬃciency. And have worked on it for 20 years, by the way,
also outgrowing the Spanish markets on a consistent basis organically. Now we did an
analysis of how can we move even further on productivity over the last 18 months. Then
we said, is there any potential to work on the legacy? And the answer was no because
only 3% of the revenues, that's nothing, are in so-called legacy products. 3% of the
portfolio is nothing. Most of other business, we have 40%, 50%, 60% in legacy.
Then we took a deep look in the IT cost that is dedicated. And I have to tell you our cost
allocation mechanisms have some room for improvement. And you start to look and you
ﬁnd almost 20% of the total IT budget was dedicated to just 3% of the revenues. And let's
assume these 3% are actually proﬁtable from a loss ratio percentage. If you allocate cost
properly, it's not making money.

Bloomberg Transcript

So the key message is that even in the best businesses that we run, the upside potential
from removing legacy is massive. And therefore, a lot of what we're going to do is, in our
hands, is cleaning up those legacies. And that is easier said than done.
Sorry, let me go back a little bit. The other thing and that is very important is we believe.
And having looked at a lot of the insured techs and the startups, that we actually have
most of what we need in-house. And as you know, we do invest in the innovators. And
what we're going to do is to create a direct platform for Europe. Now this is not meant to
compete with our other distribution channels for the same client base. Factually,
cannibalization between our direct businesses and our traditional agency platforms is 0.
Let me repeat that, cannibalization is 0. But we've been missing a massive opportunity
across products in moving to the Allianz brand because that's what our consumers are
expecting. They're saying, you're camouﬂaging the fact that you are not giving me what
we want. First observation.
Second, why do we do it the way we do it? We want to create, for the ﬁrst time, a legacyfree oﬀer, direct oﬀer to consumers that is consistent across markets, very consistent with
the story that I just tell you, proving the scalability. But there's a second component. We
are going to create an operating platform that is designed to cost that is also going to
operate on a legacy-free basis, to create an internal benchmark for our German, our
Italian, our Dutch colleagues to see where we have to go with our operating cost in the
legacy businesses over time. It's much more convincing because you can show the how,
not just the what if you have a platform inside. That is the objective of what we're going to
do with EDP.
So now I move to capital management and give you a few things because you say, you're
going to hold me, not just Giulio, accountable for what we do. I think we can be very
proud of what we've done the last three years. We honored the commitment that Michael
Diekmann and Dieter Wemmer gave many years back. But we need to work very hard to

Page 9 of 59

Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2018-11-30

FINAL

actually honor that commitment, making sure the Life balance sheet was improved, the
capital was upstreamed and we actually did execute the share buys that we did back.
So what are we going to do going forward? We will remain with the same discipline that
we've had the last few years. So there is no itching, no, I have to do it. And the discipline is
very, very simple. We have the same hurdles we have for share buybacks or capital
management overall that we have for internal growth and external growth, there is no
diﬀerence. There is no diﬀerence. And if we buy something, we'll talk about it, we apply
the same mechanisms that we apply to managing capital in many other ways. And we're
going to get even stricter because we have internal growth also on the page.
And I put it on the page for very good reason because we have still businesses that where
we put capital in that does not have the right returns. We started in Life, remember, with
the ROE targets for the Life businesses. And we're going to apply it across the portfolio.
Where is the value growth is where we need to go. So we have the same principles.

Bloomberg Transcript

In addition, on the M&A side, there are 2 criteria that are very important. First. And we
really mean it, we need to be able to extract value from what we buy that is consistent with
what we have to pay. And the quality of the franchise needs to be as such that it enhances
the performance of Allianz. It just does not just enhance the size. And that is very, very
important for you to know.
And the record of what we have done over the last few years just speaks to it. You can go
through the page in terms of what we bought. And everybody says we don't sell. It's just
not true. We sold the last banking assets, Oldenburgische Landesbank. We have a small
license left in Bulgaria. We have taken out the back book in Taiwan. We sold the Korean
business. We sold the AGF U.K. business. And so we are constantly pruning the portfolio
and we are working on the Life back books. But what we are not going to do is to risk our
reputation by separating from clients that we expect to continuously be our clients. That is
also very important. And I'd like to mention that at this point, we really care for our
reputation very much.
By the way, the Korean number is obviously understated given its economic eﬀect. That
has allowed us to build the solvency and massively increase the capital returns in order to
move to a return on equity number where we are today and that we are very proud of.
And to be honest, I am puzzled given that we are north of 13% ROE without any
accounting tricks that we are trading where we are trading because we have many peers,
many, many peers that have massively lower returns and promises. And we don't believe
in promises unless you deliver them.
Now let me talk a little bit about the targets and what we are giving ourselves as a target.
Now before I go to this page, there are targets that are not on the page. But they are
equally important. And I'd like to mention that. We want to be respected by our peers,
our communities and the societies we live in. I am really proud, for example, that we won
the Dow Jones Sustainability award as the #1 in our industry this year in the second year.
We may not have it always. But that is what we want to be.

We are trying to be a company that people are trusting and are proud of and not just one
that produces ﬁnancial returns. And that's very important. So for the next few years, we're
going to spend a lot of time on reputational risk because we do not want to end up where
other people are ending up. That being said -- and that's important because it will require
some decisions to exit certain businesses or do stuﬀ that is maybe less attractive in terms
of returns short term but very attractive in the long run. So you need to trust that Allianz
makes decisions for many years to come, not just for the next 4 quarters.
Now let me go through the numbers. The most important message today, again, that I'd
like to repeat is we don't need help from M&A and others to grow earnings. We don't
need. We don't even need share buybacks to grow the earnings because we are giving
ourselves a 4% organic growth target year-per-year over the next three years. And we
haven't had that in a long time.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now why are we saying 5% plus? Because you can assume that we're going to generate
signiﬁcant amounts of capital on top of the organic growth. And as we have very strict
return on equity targets, we will not let the capital sit idle. So whatever we don't need,
we're going to give back to shareholders or put it into productive investment. That is the
commitment we have made three years ago. That is the commitment that we renew. But in
this environment, we don't want to rely only on capital management. We want to rely on
our own earnings power.
Proﬁtability, we call at 13% plus. Now plus, Giulio will say, plus doesn't mean 13.1%. And
he's going to talk a little bit about what that means. But we also want to be very clear, we
are going to move in an environment where volatility is going to be very strong. And that
is why we are making sure that we don't overpromise on something that is there. But
having the returns that we have today and moving north of that, I think, is a very strong
commitment from the team.
We are removing the 220% headline. We want to make sure that it's north of 180%. Giulio
will talk about why this is a very important message for you. And last but not the least,
we've said this is not just about performing for shareholders. It's performing against
expectations of our clients, most importantly, because ﬁnancial performance is the
outﬂow of delighting clients. So we're going to move north of 75% and having loyal
leadership ambitions that are stronger than we have them today and making sure that our
employees are mobilized to deliver on the transition. So no excuses for transformation in
terms of mobilizing our people. This is the target.
Now if we execute that, we would like to see the following happening. We started in the
past with a discount because of the issues we had in PIMCO and the Life business. And
that was clear and we had been working, including the last few years before 2015, to
make that a much more resilient balance sheet. And I think we've achieved that beyond
our expectations. The last three years, we committed to disciplining ourselves on capital
management, which we haven't been before. And making sure that proﬁtability in all
segments goes back to where you expect it to be and beyond. We're closing in on best
practice in many segments. And we are very proud of that. We're starting to deliver on
organic growth. But what we really need to get to a premium valuation, we believe, is to
outperform on productivity, on scalability by being a more simple company, in particular

with regards of what we do with our clients and our people and hopefully also in internal
organization.
So these are my messages for today. And that reinforces the equity story that we have
shown to you three years ago. When you invest in Allianz, you sleep well because you
have the downside protection you need from one of the world's best risk managers. We
are well diversiﬁed. We have an outstanding capital position. And the investment portfolio
is getting better by the day.
We have a very attractive dividend policy. We don't believe we constantly need to
promise people more share of payouts because we know and you know that capital
management is not a side constraint. It's at the core of what we do. We have a dividend
ratchet. And we are going to bring the money back to you if we can't invest it. You need
to trust us that we do the right thing with your capital.

Bloomberg Transcript

And there is enormous upside. Almost all our competitors have given up on global scale.
Every single equity story you read is we give the power back to the markets, we are going
to sell portfolio, we're going to focus on 3 markets in Southeast Asia, soon 4 here. Think
through what this means. We have a diﬀerent ambition. We have an ambition to say we
can really grow earnings better than anybody else because we are going to get to scale.
We're going to outperform through continuous productivity gains. And we're going to
rebalance the capital to where the growth is. That is our promise. And therefore, we can
believe we can organically grow much more than we can do in the past, plus the capital
management eﬃciencies on top of that.
We thank you for your support. And we hope that what we are going to do will delight
you as it has the last three years. Thank you very much for listening. And I hand over to my
colleagues.

Good morning. Our industry is complex, Oliver has already told us. This is changing at
Allianz. And simplicity is the name of the game. We're going to transform the core of our
business in depth. We're talking about the business with our intermediaries, the business
where our main proﬁt pools are; and we're going to develop new models at scale, the
European Direct Platform to be disruptive and innovative; and we're talking about the
online world and the proﬁt pools of the future.
Simplicity and harmonization at scale. And when we talk about simplicity, we just -- we
don't mean only the products and its components, we mean the processes, the business
tools, the customer journeys and also the organizational structures. So the best of Allianz
will be available by implementing business models to all the organizations. And by the
way, simplicity is also the best starting point to apply data and analytics and artiﬁcial
intelligence thoroughly and again in depth with full impact in the organization.
Today, we're going to talk about 2 main pillars: the Allianz Customer Model and the
European Direct Player (sic) (European Direct Platform). Let's start with the ﬁrst one. And

FINAL

let's start deriving a little bit the logic of the Allianz Customer Model. We ran a survey, a
little survey with 500 online people giving the answers. It is not statistically signiﬁcant. But
we did it in several countries and it conﬁrmed our main hypothesis. And the ﬁrst -- and the
word cloud that you see is the words represent how often these were found in the
response.
So price is there quite prominently. And we know that we are in a price-sensitive industry.
Complexity, we were relieved that our theory is conﬁrmed. And we talk about complexity
of products, too many guarantees, diﬀerent sums assured, diﬀerent deductibles, diﬀerent
language and diﬀerent products, a world of mistrust for the customers. But the new
insight was the rejected claims. We still reject too many claims. We are starting to measure
the rejected claims. And it might be technically correct that we reject the claims if the
guarantee is not covered. Economically, we cannot pay something that is not priced in the
product. But it is not about economically correct, it is not about technically correct. What
is important is the customer perception. And with the frequency of 10% or even lower %, a
customer will not remember after 10 years what he has bought. And he will be purely
disappointed when the claim is not covered. So it's not about technically correct. It's
about customer perception. And we will see what are the implications for the products
design at Allianz.
And the ﬁrst thing that we believe that we have to do is demystify products. It is diﬃcult to
create an emotional bond with the customer and the products, even more so in the digital
world when you don't even hand a paper to the customer. You want to make it paperless.
And we want to demystify the products. And we want to make the products simple. The
language has to be understandable. It has to be a trustful environment, even more so
intuitive. In today's world, with the online customers especially, if it's not immediately
understood, they move to another oﬀer. There is no time for booklets. There is no time for
complicated explanations.
And the next thing is that products have to be comprehensive. Our product idea is a
simple product made out of packages. The packages are ﬁlled -- preﬁlled with the
guarantees. And the basic package shall be comprehensive so that the basic package
covers the most likely event and the customer is not disappointed. It is necessary if we
want to build a truly relationship based on trust. We believe that this is the right approach.
Of course, we want to be and we are already, in many ﬁelds, innovative. Mobile ﬁrst, we
need to adapt to the lifestyle of our customer. Our customer is spending hours in the
phone. If he wants to do, based on a self-service basis, anything around the policy, he can
do it by mobile. But also our intermediaries shall be mobile and be able to sell closer to
the customer on-site through the iPad, through a mobile device, on-site closer to the
customer, the products and services.
Data-driven. Of course, data-driven, to know more about the customer, anticipate its
wishes, oﬀer directly the package that he really wants to and data-driven to improve the
processes to make them really customer friendly and eﬃcient. And very strong and
powerful, the idea of one logic, here comes in the idea of the master product that I would
like to elaborate upon.

The master product means that we are not only designing simple products for Allianz and
comprehensive products for Allianz. The master product means that we want to have one
logic for the Allianz products through one organization and throughout the group. And
this means that we are working in patterns, that products are parameterized, that we pass
-- that we design the master product, for example, in motor. And this product can be used
with little IT intensity as a basis for the home product. And new products are launched
again with little IT intensity so that there is a high reusability of products in a horizontal
basis across one company. But what is even more important is that we can become
global. We will start and we start using global products through the Allianz. This is a
vertical component. We will launch, for example, next year in Ibero/LatAm in the 6
countries not only 1 product which follows the master product idea in home through the
diﬀerent 6 countries. But it will be the same product for 6 diﬀerent countries. So it will
follow the same logic.

Bloomberg Transcript

What -- how do we combine it with the go-to-market strategy? We believe that this is just
an environment. I have made the personal experience implementing this simplicity
product design in several markets in Ibero/LatAm and in the region of Ibero/LatAm. And
there was no noise in the implementation. Of course, we did it smart. When we changed
from a traditional type of product with many questions and lots of free choices for the
customer, the cherry-picking of the guarantees, while launching the products in the ﬁrst -at the beginning, we were a little bit more competitive to make it smooth. But there was
no noise at all coming from the intermediaries. It was good for the customer, simple and
understandable. And what is good for the customer has to be good for the intermediaries
as well.
And with respect to the go-to-market strategy, I would say that this is just a framework
because the local companies can decide what are the guarantees that we put in, what are
the price the commercial -- what is the commercial price, what are the sums insured and
what are the deductibles. So the go-to-market strategy, we take care of it as well.
Anyway, we discovered. And this was completely enlightening, that products are already
the same. We just make eﬀorts to present them diﬀerently. Klaus-Peter RÃ¶hler and myself
had the honor to sponsor a project, an Allianz project which was called -- is called product
harmonization. And we started with the expert of diﬀerent countries, of 5 countries. And it
was astonishing. After several iterations, we identiﬁed that in home, Motor and SME,
similarities were around 90, even beyond 90%. If we look at it from the claims side, since
the diﬀerences in the coverages were more marketing-oriented types of coverages, from
the claims side, the similarity of products is close to 99%. So we do have already the same
product.
And within this product harmonization project, we set the basis to have in Allianz a
common taxonomy and to start walking the path of common products. We created the
product lab. The technical components of the products are common. The coverages that
the Allianz world will use for developing products will be common pieces that will be
taken out from the product library with a technical solution. And the best practice product
will be also included in the future in the product library. So common language and
common taxonomy that will lead also to a common database that will give us, in claims,

FINAL

the best information to start being global in evaluating the data and being even more
powerful in pricing and customer insight.
So we are talking about the products. But we have to move on. The ACM, the Allianz
Customer Model, is not only the products. The simplicity that we've built into the product
spread across the whole organization. And here we have a conventional organization. Any
long-standing insurance company in the world could look like this. We have a huge
number of products. The products are diﬀerently in logic and diﬀerent from a structure
point of view. Decommissioning of the old books has not yet taken place. So there are too
far too many product portfolios. And this translate into diﬃcult processes. You see all the
entangled processes. All the tasks around the policies are very complicated and each -and probably the organization is very much oriented towards silos, towards lines of
business with every line of business designing diﬀerent end processes. Along time, with
the increase of products and processes, we end up with a situation where complexity
grows exponentially. How can you cope with this chaos. So to say, with this entangled
picture with one IT platform? Probably this organization has many IT platforms and you
can be sure that there will be not only one database from which you can extract all the
information, insurance-relevant information and customer information. And if you add to
this that a multinational group could have a sum of companies that looked like this, what
are the reusability of assets? Very little reusability of assets. But let's move on to the Allianz
customer world, how it could look like.
In a world of the ACM, we work with a master product, all products are the same from a
structural point of view. There's a little number of products. These translate into a very
clean picture, an organization made out of one piece. All the processes, all the tools, all
the customer journeys are one. We can cope with one back oﬃce with a whole set of
products. We become truly clean and eﬃcient. It is a perfect environment to have a robust
IT, a scalable IT and a high-performing IT. And again, one database for insurance topics
and one database with all the customer information. And if all the companies act like this
in a group and they work with the same business model, anything that will be developed,
any new asset, any new product, any innovation can be plugged in and it is immediately
available for the whole organization, a huge advantage. This is the world of the ACM, of
the Allianz Customer Model. And this is the world we are pursuing at Allianz.
This world brings in many advantages. The products are understandable for the customer.
But I would say that the customer is -- in a nutshell, what receives the customer is the best
value for money and we are able to anticipate the needs of the customer. With the
processes, digital is digital by default. All processes are clean and designed end-to-end.
And with the customer journeys, a little bit of the same. We do have only a reduced
number of customer journeys that we know very well, that we optimize and this is also,
again, through simplicity, a very well-known environment, an environment that creates
familiarity and trust for the customer and the intermediary.
Distributors. For the distributors like the ACM, it makes them better entrepreneurs.
Everything is available for the distributors. They become a one-stop shop for the
customer. They can do anything around insurance and solve anything immediately with
the customer, little administration through automation and real time to upsell and to give
real valuable advice.

FINAL

And for the Allianz, for the Allianz, it's the world of growth and proﬁtability. Every -- all the
best of the Allianz, the best products and all the products and tools and assets developed
become available to the whole group. And also quite importantly, we do have then, in a
world of the business models, a management that has the same culture and a
management community that is very much strengthened, being completely aligned.
Oliver was talking about beat the best. And this is our philosophy. In the Allianz Customer
Model, we do have the proof and our companies are better where we have implemented,
basically, better in NPS. They are faster and give better service to the customer like better
quotation times and most of the companies are best in class in eﬃciency. So what we
manage is to break the dichotomy between -- we manage to break the dichotomy
between growth and proﬁtability and between low expense ratio and customer
satisfaction.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now we want to make it happen. It is already started. But we want to accelerate. We want
to -- we are consolidating the implementation of the ACM in Ibero/LatAm. Later on, we
will see with Petros that in the CEE, we are very much advancing with spectacular results in
the implementation of the ACM. But now we want to move on to the next level of
implementation. The ACM shall be implemented in Germany together with Klaus-Peter
RÃ¶hler. We want to drive change. We want to adjust the model for the needs of a larger
organization and ﬁne tune it for the needs of a more sophisticated market and then
Germany shall help in implementation in other big markets. At the same time, in parallel,
we will implement the model through the master product concept and through
decommissioning of the old product portfolios in the whole Allianz world with the
certiﬁcation process. So we are really accelerating and moving on. As I said, the best of
Allianz available for all companies and with full impact.
Let's move on to the direct player. The value proposition is very simple. We have -- we
believe that we have a great opportunity. Our customers are on -- are digital in all their
diﬀerent aspects of life. We do use our mobile telephone as we do use our computer.
They have become computers and spend hours in the mobile phone. We do make our
banking transactions online. There is one exception, maybe the bakery. But for sure, also
the exception is the insurance. So we do have to think why it is like this. And the
opportunity is even bigger because out there, they are already in the online world
searching for advice. The hybrid customers and the ROPO customers, 70% of the
customers, 2 clicks away or one click away from becoming online customers. So the ﬁrst
one to crack it will have a huge opportunity and we want to be among the ﬁrst. We
believe that we have all the ingredients with our brand, with our insurance competence,
with our know-how about the customer and with our openness to instill from the start-ups
new capabilities in the organization to be agile and to learn and to integrate new talents.
The new global player will be disruptive. We will start in 4 countries, as you see, then with
one product with Motor, then we will move on to other countries and expand to other
products. It will be global and disruptive. One brand, Allianz Direct, will be the brand. We
want to capitalize on our treasure that is our brand and to build a relationship in the
online world with a customer which is disintermediated to generate a real pull eﬀect. We
want to have one common platform that will be developed for the purpose, as Oliver was
saying, without legacy and this platform shall serve and bring innovation for the whole of

Allianz world. One master product across countries and one insurance carrier and one
steering. Global. Global steering with the best talents from Allianz and with local
implementation with systems and structures. But also some of the services will be, of
course, global like a call center or claims.
Very ambitious targets, as you see here. And have strong ambition. In the medium term,
we believe that if we solve the problem of trust for the customer, we will be able to -- not
to grow. But to multiply the business. And beat the best philosophy with reverse
engineering ideas, we put the targets in place and then we squeeze our brain to get to
these targets, targets that are, from an operational perspective, highly detailed and
address all the eﬃciency issues and all the customer issues.
And here we are. If we -- with the EDP and the Allianz Customer Model, this is the new
Allianz. We are changing Allianz and simplicity is the driving force of the new change. We
want to transform and disrupt the current customer models and the new customer
models. We want to strengthen our 2 options of -- the options of the new world and the
options of the existing world. We want to combine the beauties of being a multi-liner. We
have the access to the customers and we can sell all products and exploit the full
relationship with the customer. But at the same time, we want to do it in an eﬃcient way,
in a way as if we were a mono-liner, to bring the best oﬀer to the customer. So closer than
ever to the customer, delivering best product and services with eﬃciency. We want to
accelerate growth and enhance proﬁtability. And this is a journey that has already started.
Thank you.

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

So good morning to everybody. Welcome to Munich. I like now to give you some more
insights about the operating performance moving forward and also capital management
because it's the combination of operating performance and capital management that
leads to excellent ﬁnancial performance and better generation.
So starting from the operating proﬁt growth that we anticipate for the future, as you can
see, we are anticipating an operating proﬁt growth of 4% plus. Now when you look at the
slide, you can see that we are starting from the midpoint of the outlook which -- for 2018,
which is EUR 11.1 billion. So if we start from that point. I would emphasize the plus. If you
take the EUR 11.1 billion as a reference point, I would say the plus has a signiﬁcant
meaning. Now if we are starting from a point which is diﬀerent from the midpoint, you are
moving maybe more towards the upper end of the outlook then maybe you want to
emphasize more the 4 instead of the plus. So I believe this can give you some guidance
about how to read this number. But no matter how you look at this, I think that's -- we
have a strong commitment to grow our operating proﬁt performance moving forward.
When you look at the diﬀerent segments, the performance is mostly driven by PropertyCasualty and Asset Management with a growth rate of 5%. Now when you look at the
Life/Health business, you see a growth rate of 2%. Now we need to consider here that we
are taking into consideration that we are going to have the deconsolidation of Eurovida
moving forward. So if you adjust for that, the organic growth, excluding the

Page 17 of 59

Date: 2018-11-30

FINAL

deconsolidation of Eurovida, it's more like 3percentage plus. So that's what we have from
an operating proﬁt performance.
Now I'd like to give you some insight into the drivers. We had talked a lot about
productivity as we were meeting together. And I tell you, the topic of productivity ﬁts very
well into the strategy. You heard it from Oliver and also from Ivan. Also, we believe now
that productivity has to be a core skill set also for the insurance industry. I tell you, at the
beginning of the year, I've been doing sort of a road show here in Munich, meeting CFO
of industrial companies based here in Munich. I will not mention these companies. But
you know there a lot of great good companies here in Munich. And that was very
interesting to see what they do in industrial companies on productivity. So we took some
lessons from them. Then what we do here in Allianz, every time we put a focus on
something, we're going to develop KPIs. Then you can see here some of the KPIs that we
have been developing in order to measure our productivity improvement moving
forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

For you, we try to simplify the story because I believe, at the end of the day, you want to
see something which is tangible and recognizable. And so we have translated what the
productivity improvement is going to do into our operating proﬁt. And we expect to have
an increase in operating proﬁt of about EUR 800 million moving forward in the next three
years coming from productivity. If you see, EUR 600 million will come from PropertyCasualty; EUR 100 million is coming from the Life business, this is after taking into
consideration for policyholder participation; and EUR 100 million is coming from Asset
Management. If you put this number in relation to the 4% plus growth that we were
mentioning before, this is about 2% plus of growth coming from productivity
improvement.
So that's a commitment and I believe a commitment is always a starting point to see also
results ﬂowing. But I know your question is always is it really diﬀerent now? And I will say
yes, it's diﬀerent now and I'd like to show you this slide. If you see on the left-hand side,
we have the development of our expense ratio in P&C over time and you have also the
comparison to plan over time. And 2018 is going to be the ﬁrst year where the expense
ratio is going to be below the level that we had in the prior period. And also, as you look
at the delta, actual versus plan, we are anticipating this year that we are going to be better
than plan. That's not been the case in the prior period. So you can see already the
numbers, that something is changing. And the reason for that is stronger focus, action
plans that we are putting together. We are also reaping the beneﬁt of actions that we put
into place in the future. And also, productivity is now part of management compensation.
So there is a combination of factors that is already bringing to tangible results in the
current P&L.
Now as we are focusing on productivity, clearly we don't want to forget what has been a
core skill set of Allianz on the P&C side, which is our technical excellence. You can see that
over time, we have been able to improve the attritional loss ratio and we see that there is
still room for improvement. We are very proud about our technical excellence level. But
we still believe that there is room for improvement also on our attritional loss ratio.

FINAL

Just to give you an idea on the steering of the P&C portfolio, we have over 700 technical
portfolio. It is looking at 700 technical portfolio. And we are then segmented this portfolio
into ﬁxed, growing and maintained portfolio. So there is deﬁnitely room for improvement
also in some part of our business. Also, we should not forget that we have now in the
future the possibility to access -- use also data and also use artiﬁcial intelligence in order
to harvest the information out of this data. So there is also improvement that we are going
to see on the loss ratio moving forward. So the combination of some improvement on the
loss ratio plus the productivity improvement on the P&C side is going to lead to a 5%
operating proﬁt growth for the P&C segment moving forward.
Now switching gear and coming to the Life business. You can see, as I was saying before,
that the expected growth for the operating proﬁt in Life is 2%. If you adjust for the
Eurovida, expect the deconsolidation, it's going to be 3% plus. Now we need to consider
that we are replacing capital-intensive products or in-force book with capital-light
business. So from that point of view, you should also expect some sort of -- if you want
dilution of the growth of the operating proﬁt because for 1 unit of reserves, the reality you
need less proﬁt to get to a good ROE. So we are including here also the fact that this kind
of capital release is contributing positively to our earnings per share growth. So the
operating proﬁt growth is about 3%, once you can see also for the eﬃciency of capital,
you can translate this into a 4% to 5% sort of EPS growth coming out of the Life business.
What we have been doing is also to look beyond 2021. Right now, we have a value of new
business which is about EUR 2 billion, which is signiﬁcantly higher compared to the level
that we had just a few years ago. So this level of new business at EUR 2 billion, which we
expect to grow at 5% over time, is going to contribute to the operating proﬁt growth in
the midterm. And that's the reason why we expect the operating proﬁt growth as we go
beyond 2021 to go higher than 4%. That's the dynamic of having a value of new business
of EUR 2 billion. Just a few years ago, we were at about EUR 1 billion. And increasing this
value of new business by 5% is going to contribute to operating proﬁt growth moving
forward.
Now coming to the asset management segment, we are anticipating a growth rate of 5%.
And here, we are showing you also the assumption. And if you look at the assumption
relatively conservative, if you ask me, at the end of the day, we are anticipating a growth
rate of the assets under management by about 3.5% per annum. Think about that a lot of
our assets are in the U.S. where currently, on a ﬁxed income portfolio, you get deﬁnitely
more than 3.5%. We have also some equity. We usually don't normalize equity at a rate
which is 3.5%. So deﬁnitely that is an assumption that I would say is rather on the
conservative side. We are also assuming stable fee margin. That might be somehow
surprising to you. But in reality, that's what we see. In our business, we do not see a lot of
compression of fee margin and we expect the fee margin to be stable moving forward.
And we are taking also a sort of conservative view on the performance fees moving
forward. On the cost to income ratio, we are conﬁrming the 60% cost to income ratio
below for PIMCO. And in the case of AGI where the current cost to income ratio is about
70%, we are anticipating that we can go 67% or below. So when you put all this together, I
think this gives you the idea that the baseline scenario is not supported by making
aggressive assumptions about the development of the capital market, which means there
is some resilience for some volatility. Clearly, if we get signiﬁcant turmoil in the ﬁnancial

Page 19 of 59



Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2018-11-30

market, that will be a diﬀerent story. But that's a sort of conservative resilient basis how we
are setting up the plan for Asset Management.

FINAL

So when we put all this together, you can see that the 5 -- 4% plus commitment is based
on solid work and solid assumption. And that's the reason why I feel pretty conﬁdent
about our ability to deliver on this number moving forward. Then clearly, the capital
management is going to add on top of the 4% plus operating proﬁt growth.
And now I'd like to talk about the topic of capital management. And as you know, when
we speak about capital management, it's a lot about discipline. And I would say, it's about
discipline, ﬁrst, on getting the operating performance right because once you get the
operating performance right, then capital liquidity is going to ﬂow. And that's a
component is about discipline on using this capital. And we are very committed to this
discipline. But we want also to have the optionality to make sure we can deploy the
capital in the most value-accretive way.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now there are 3 dimensions which matters as we speak about capital. One is clearly the
capital generation, which is Solvency II. The second dimension is the liquidity, which is a
function of Solvency II or whatever capital requirement we have at the local level, at the
subsidiary level, including other sort of restriction. Then the third topic is leverage
because clearly, through leverage, you can change the composition of capital or you can
change also the liquidity situation. So these are the 3 dimensions that counts as we are
thinking about capital. And now I'd like to go into the 3 dimensions.
On the capital generation, I'd like to focus on the business evolution. And there is a
number in this slide that might capture your attention, which is the business evolution or
the SCR, because if you look at the business evolution, the SCR, that's about a cumulative
EUR 2 billion for the next three years. You are used to see a diﬀerent number. You can see
also our numbers in the past.
So why is that? I think it's a combination of 3 things. First of all, we have -- we are picking
some noise when we do the actual calculation. So there is a little bit of noise as we try to
decompose in actual -- our calculation of the SCR evolution. Then also we are deﬁnitely
growing both on the P&C side and also on the Life side more in our projection compared
to what we have done in the past.
Just to give you an idea, the capital intensity ratio of P&C according to our model is about
35% to 40% so premium. So if we increase premium, we will need to consider that we
have to put 35% to 40% of capital. I personally believe this number is slightly
conservative. But that's what I'm getting from the risk guys. That's the reason why I
believe, in actual reality, it's not coming through as large and this might explain a little bit
of the gap.
Now so we are projecting based on our model that the business evolution, the SCR, is
going to be higher. On the other side, when you look at the operating earnings, we are
expecting EUR 38 billion of cumulative operating earnings moving forward, which
compares, if you take the last three years annualized in 2018, this compares to about EUR

FINAL

35 billion. So we are expecting more SCR from the business evolution. But we are
expecting also higher operating earnings. So when you run the math, you get back, after
accounting for taxes and dividend, you get back to the 10% business evolution per annum
that we have been discussing in the past. So at the end of day, there are moving pieces
but we go back to the expectation that our business evolution contribution to Solvency II
is going to be about 10% per annum, which is a nice contribution also considering the
level of solvency that we have.
Now let's talk about cash generation. On the left-hand side, you can see what has been
the OE. The subsidiary remittance to group over time. And you can see, we have been
running really a very strict capital management philosophy, getting signiﬁcant amount of
cash into Munich. Clearly, as we do this, eventually the excess capital contribution from
the OE is going to reduce because we have already got the capital into Munich. But we
are still, when you look at 2018, we are still looking at very good numbers. And if I would
give you a guidance of what we expect in the future, I would say the guidance would be
to have an OE remittance which is somehow in the midpoint of the range that you see for
2018. So OE remittance is going to be, I would say, north of 85% to 90%. That's what we
expect to get from the OEs.
Now when you move to the right-hand side of the chart, you can see what is the
remittance from a group point of view, including interest expenses and overhead. So
when we are referring to higher than 80% of remittance, this is also taking into
consideration for the fact that we need to pay interest and we need to pay the overhead.
So we are speaking of a relationship of -- if you want cash to net income which is higher
than 80%. Then, we take the dividend that we pay and when you run all the math, you end
up with a number which is of a free cash after dividend of EUR 2.5 billion plus. So this is
what we have available every year, we're generating every year to do buybacks, to do
M&A. Clearly, on top of this, we have also cash here in munis. So I would say from a cash
situation, we have ample ﬂexibility clearly to deploy capital in a diﬀerent way. So we have
strong capital and we have also a very healthy cash situation.
And now we come to the leverage ratio. If you see, the leverage ratio is about 27%. There
was a slight increase compared to the prior period. This is not a session where we speak
about development year-over-year. But just for you to know, in reality, the debt level is
pretty much consistent with the level that we had last year, slightly lower. But the net asset
value went down because of the movement of the interest rates. So if you adjust for that,
we are pretty much stable at the level of 2017.
Now the question is what is the target level that we are aiming at? I would say that 27% is a
good indication of the target level. I would say you don't want to go below 25% because
that will not be eﬃcient from a capital management point of view. On the other side, 30%
is the limit where the rating agency might ask a few questions. So clearly, you can stretch
above the 30% ratio in some situations, especially if you do -- if you are pursuing a
standard growth opportunity. But fundamentally, the range that you want to have longterm is between 25% and 30%. So 27%, I would say we are positioned at the midpoint, if
you want, of this sort of a range.

FINAL

And now I'd like to address very quickly because we discussed this many times and we
said we're going to put this in writing, what is our philosophy about M&A. I will not spend
time on the strategic ﬁt. I'd like to talk about the ﬁnancial performance and the valuation.
On the ﬁnancial performance, what is very important is that we have a clear
understanding of the balance sheet and the proﬁt pattern of the target company. That will
be critical, have a clear understanding of what we might potentially buy. Also, it's very
important that any target is going to add capability. So it's going to have a nice market
positioning because this leads into getting strong operating performance. And the third
point is we have been talking about simplicity all the time. And so there will be a
contradiction to do any kind of acquisition, which will not ﬁt into the simplicity story, will
not be something, which is kind of easy to integrate.

Bloomberg Transcript

The ﬁnal point which is very important is on the valuation. We know that if we do a
buyback, a buyback means that we are investing the cost of equity. So any acquisition has
to beat the cost of equity. So at the end of the day, it has to be cost of equity plus the
spread. We can debate how much the spread should be depending on the situation. But
it must be cost of equity plus spread. Also, we are always checking what is the accretion of
earnings compared to the buyback. And we know that in the short term, the accretion of
earnings of an M&A versus a buyback might be less. But somehow we want to see the
crossover points and also the diﬀerential shouldn't be clearly too large even in the shortterm. And ﬁnally also it's very important, the payback period, call it that way. So we say
the ROI has to be at the cost of equity within a reasonable time, which is 3 to ﬁve years,
because clearly, there is no point to do any kind of M&A if you need to wait for your
retirement to see the beneﬁt coming through.
So this is the way how we are thinking. So we discussed this many times. And now you can
see this also clearly on the slides.
Now coming to the capital level. As you know, we had a target range of 180% to 220%.
And now as you know, we have been running higher than the 220%. And there are
technical reasons for that. And just think about credit spread narrowing or widening or
just think about there is a change in the calculation of the additional insurance reserve in
Germany, this is going to create a change in the level of Solvency II. This has nothing to
do with the creation of proﬁt on a statutory basis in the short-term. So the solvency ratio
can be about 220% and that's not really driven by the fact that we are not managing
capital properly.
So we have decided to deemphasize the upper end. Clearly, we still put an emphasis on
the lower end of the range because when the solvency ratio goes down, there is no
reason to start discussing whether it's fear or no fear, whether it's a technical reason, it's
not a technical reason. The solvency ratio, when it goes down, you are just having a
diﬀerent kind of conversation. So we are conﬁrming the low end of the range. But that's
very important, we are committed to an ROE of 13% plus. And as Oliver said before, plus
doesn't mean 10 basis points. It means deﬁnitely a healthy ROE above the level of 13%. So
that's the way we look at capital, at capital eﬃciency moving forward.

So nothing has changed. So from the point of view that remove the upper end of the
range doesn't mean that we want to keep cash in muni, that's something we don't do.
And our track record is showing this, just see what happened this year, what happened in
2017. We are conﬁrming the dividend policy, which is a 50% payout with the ratchet. The
ratchet is a feature which we shouldn't neglect. This means that if the net income is going
down, we are still committed to pay an amount of dividend consistent with the dividend
level of the preceding year. And we continue also with the policy of ﬂexible buyback. So I
think, from this point of view, there is no change in dividend policy and there is also no
change in our capital philosophy.
And coming to the last slide, the fundamentals of the business are strong no matter how
you look at the business, whether you look from an operating performance, from a cash
generation amount level. If you look from a capital generation level and future
contribution, I think in all dimensions we are doing pretty good. I understand that you like
earning per shares growth. We like earning per shares growth, too. I understand you like
ROE. We like ROE, too. So from that point of view, I really believe we are speaking the
same language.
And with that, I think you deserve a break. Since it is before 11, you can even have a
cappuccino which is something which is in Italy is borderline. But we can make an
exception in this case. Thank you.

All right. So welcome back. I hope you enjoyed the short coﬀee break. We're a bit early.

Klaus-Peter RÃ¶hler
Thank you, Oliver. Also warm welcome from my side. I have the pleasure to provide you
insights about Allianz Germany and our successfully ongoing transformation.
Now before I get to my presentation, I would like to introduce Allianz Germany. We are #1
in the German market with 20.4 million retail customers. That statistically equals that every
fourth customer is insured with us in Germany. We had EUR 35 billion of revenues 2017.
And our operating proﬁt amounted to EUR 2.3 billion. That makes us to the most
important entity in Allianz in terms of proﬁt and revenues. And our excellent RoEs: 15% in
P&C, 18% in Life and 14% in health, are well above the group's ambition level.

Now we have seen a decade of very slow growth in Allianz Germany with stagnating
proﬁts. The only exception is Allianz Leben. And we are now well underway in our eﬀorts
to transform our business model. And the main focus is on P&C. And in P&C, simplicity is
really the center lever to make a step change in productivity and growth. And this is what I
would like to show you.
Now the 4 building blocks to transform our P&C business are, ﬁrst of all, a broad market
coverage; second, digital processes; technical excellence; and a strong claims network.
But the most central building block is the simpliﬁed product model that was presented by
IvÃ¡n del la Sota.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's start with the broad market coverage. We need that for our customer experience and
for the growth. And we oﬀer with our multichannel setup our customers an
interconnected network of touch points for easy access anytime and anywhere. And in
this multichannel system, all our channels contribute to the most recent growth. We
achieved in the ﬁrst nine months of 2018 plus 4.3%. That's a new track record for the P&C
carrier in Allianz Germany. And we are currently expanding also our channel portfolio.
You might have read that we are making a joint venture with Zurich and will acquire their
motor insurance business. And that will add another 0.5 million contracts to our portfolio
and more than 250 million premiums. And on the other side, it will give us access to their
20 million members of the ADAC. I think that's a nice asset for growth.
In digital processes, we have made signiﬁcant progress towards a real digital model for
roughly 90% of our P&C business. We have digital quote-and-buy processes. And for our
newly launched products, this number is 100%. And we are not only limited to digital
quote-and-buy processes. We are implementing digital processes in all parts of the
company: claims, contract changes and so on. And our goal is to fully digitize our
business model while keeping the ﬂexibility to meet our individual customers'
expectations and also to oﬀer human interaction where needed to instill trust, to show
empathy and to provide real-life help.
Now technical excellence. We have achieved in the ﬁrst nine months a combined ratio in
Allianz Germany of 94.9%. Our normalized combined ratio is lower. It is at 93.6% due to
the fact that we experienced severe NatCat especially in the First Quarter of this year.
Very important for proﬁtability is to have a strong claims network. And we have slightly
more than 50% of our new motor business now with garage steering. That is a 120%
increase over last year's quota of garage steering. And it's fundamental for our
productivity because it gives us much more eﬃcient processes and lowers our claims
costs. And at the same time, for customers, it enhances their experience because a
smooth and fast claims processing gives a positive customer perception.
Yes. The central building block is the simpliﬁed product model. We heard a lot about it. I
will get to it in detail because we are applying it already in Allianz Germany.
Now our eﬀorts are to drive simplicity. And there are 2 levers to do that: ﬁrst of all, to
radically simplify our open book business; and the second is to transfer our legacy
Page 24 of 59



FINAL

Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2018-11-30

portfolio to the new product model of the ACM. Now we are in the process of applying
the ACM model to all our retail and SME business. We have heard about the architecture.
But what does it mean in practical terms? It means that our core or basic coverage is the
same for all of us. The oﬀers only diﬀer by modules that are being added but not by the
quality of the underlying core or basic coverage. And in motor, we even extended this
improved basic coverage to our in-force contracts in order to put our existing clients in
the same position as the new clients. Now part of the ACM is also to transfer all the inforce clients to the newest tariﬀ generation. And we also do this because it gives us the
opportunity to radically shut oﬀ old tariﬀ generations. We want to reduce their number by
90% in the next 10 years.
Another point is we wanted to reduce the technical input parameters to get a quote. And
we were quite successful. In motor, we went down from 21 input parameters to 11. That's a
reduction of 50%. But we don't stop there. We also went to our processes. We are quite
advanced at straight-through processing. The newly launched products will achieve
straight-through processing of 90% by the end of 2020. For motor, I can already tell you,
we are at 88.3%. We started the year with 59%. So the ACM really gives us a huge upside.
And it helps us also to improve our underwriting productivity, increases by 10.5%. And the
claims settlement productivity, 5.9%.

Bloomberg Transcript

I would like to highlight the lower part of the chart. We learned from our group CEO that
3% of legacy portfolio consumes 80% of the IT cost. And shifting all the old products to
the new model allows us to systematically decommission the old IT systems and, with that,
generate additional potential.
Another building block I said are our eﬀorts on technical excellence. And let's take a close
look. We can see that with Motor 2.0, we have brought technical excellence in Allianz
Germany to the next level. We implemented state-of-the-art risk modeling. We
considered some 800 risk parameters partially from external sources. We used machine
learning to identify interdependencies and to select the best of 23 risk models. We
combined that with modern pricing techniques. We developed a real-time pricing engine
that allows us to adjust prices in a very eﬃcient way because we decoupled the pricing
engine from the tariﬀ.
We also use behavioral pricing models since conversion rates are impacted by that. For
example, we use them to determine if we oﬀer an annual or a monthly payment. And last
but not least, not to confuse our customers with potential price changes, we give a price
guarantee of 2 weeks for every quote.
Now we also apply real-time monitoring. That means that we control the conversion rates
and the customer behavior on a real-time basis on all our platforms. And the results allow
us to daily adjust the prices if we want even by tariﬀ itself. This has allowed us to have
conversion rates close to 50% in the last renewal season, a fantastic target achievement.
Now combining this technical excellence with the cost reductions we have already
executed allowed us to target much lower tariﬀ levels without changing our proﬁt
expectations. And this fueled growth. And therefore, in 2017, we had the most successful
renewal season in 16 years.

Simplicity and productivity are one side of the coin. The other one is customer-centricity.
And let's take a look at our motor oﬀer under the aspect of customer-centricity. Now
important for you to know is that with almost 40% of our P&C premiums and 9 -- 5 out of
11 million retail customers, motor is a key product and not only for Allianz but for the
whole industry. It is actually the anchor product. With 400,000 new customers per year, it
is by far the most important entry product. And it gives us an enormous cross-selling
potential. That's why we started our transformation with the retail motor product and
reviewed it right from scratch.
And let me show you what we did in terms of customer-centricity. Based on a profound
market analysis, we used 170,000 customer feedbacks and the strong involvement of our
agents. We designed an oﬀer now that is simple, that is comprehensive, that is convenient
and that is attractive. Now for simplicity, for once, we reviewed the product but also the
customer journeys. And today, you can have from us a quote online in 60 seconds,
making the Allianz quote-and-buy process the fastest in the market.

Bloomberg Transcript

We also created a comprehensive oﬀer. We don't want to have negative surprises of the
customers anymore. No matter if they sign up even for a basic version of the product. Let
me give an example. In former times, motor insurance only covered damages with
huntable animals, wildlife, game. Today, the new motor insurance covers collisions with all
kind of animals. Now needless to say that we made this improvement not to have
negative surprises anymore because it can't make the diﬀerence if it's a deer or a cat.
We also worked on our service oﬀer. We enhanced it. We guarantee, for example, our
customers today after a motor breakdown to be on the move in 60 minutes. The
customers love this. They give us NPS of more than 90%. And this is just one of many
features we added.
We also made our oﬀer much more attractive, for example, by introducing a discount up
to 20% for garage steering or up to 40% for telematics. And all of these elements have
helped us to have a conversion rate of 45% during our last renewal season. It's an
impressive number and beats much of what we have seen in the past.
Now it's not only important to have a fantastic customer journey during the sales journey.
But actually, it's more important during the moment of truth, in the part of claims. And I
would like to show you our digital claims process where we focus on making the process
most convenient for our customer. Please, the ﬁlm.
(presentation)
Yes. I think this shows clearly that Allianz can be digital, customer-centric, intuitive and
eﬃcient at the same time.
We did not only redesign our product. But also, we invested a signiﬁcant amount of
money in making our customers aware that we redesigned the oﬀer. And we launched a
broad, integrated multichannel marketing campaign both last year and this year. Last
year's Disney campaign you might have seen, it helped us really to increase the customer
Page 26 of 59



Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2018-11-30

FINAL

awareness and sympathy for Allianz. This year's campaign emphasizes very much the
value-for-money aspect. Our oﬀer is as attractive as you expect. But at the same time, it's
less expensive than many customers think. We provide excellent value for money. AUTO
BILD just assigned us 5 stars out of 5 for our motor oﬀer in their price ranking. Yes,
combining such a strong message with an integrated multichannel marketing campaign
really creates a lot of tailwinds for the new business. And that's what we have seen.
But why is it so important in Germany to have a multichannel setup? We observe,
especially in the German motor market, a very hybrid customer behavior. Still, 95% start
their online research as the customer surfs. Then 57% of these clients, to get a quote, use
the online channel or both. To make the signature, 61% of these clients still rely on an oﬀline channel. In Allianz, it's even 70%. I think that makes very clear to you why it's so
powerful to have a multichannel approach in Germany. There's a lot of room for the
direct, there's a lot of room for the oﬀ-line. Now combining our integrated marketing
campaign with our channel-agnostic pricing and our distribution setup to really capture
these hybrid clients, we were able in the oﬀ-line market to increase our new business
contracts by 127%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's just summarize. Motor 2.0 led us to the real comeback in the German motor market.
In the renewal season 2017, we had a growth of new -- net new business contracts of
124,000. Our share of 30% of new Allianz customers is important for our cross-selling. We
received numerous quality seals not only for the quality aspect but also value for money.
Simply, it was the best renewal season since 16 years.
Do we stop here? No. We want to scale the success. Based on Motor 2.0 as a blueprint
that is fully aligned with the Allianz customer model, we want to continue our
transformation. There are 3 elements. First of all, the Allianz customer model, the product
architecture, the simpliﬁed product architecture. The second is our new ability to develop
products IT-wise, agile that needs less time and the products are much more reliable. And
third, the back-oﬃce process in the ACM are streamlined and uniﬁed. And these 3 factors
allow us to develop our products in future much more cost-eﬃcient. For example, for our
new PrivatSchutz, which we will launch in Q4 2014 (sic) (Q4 2019), we expect an IT cost
reduction to deliver the product of 35%.
Now what's the road map we have ahead of us? We still maintain a focus on motor retail.
And we want to integrate the ADAC motor business exactly on the ACM platform. We
expect for motor retail in the next years a growth of 5%. We already launched -relaunched our motor SME oﬀer. Here, we expect the growth in the next years of 6%. Our
next important project is PrivatSchutz. And this we want, as said, to launch in Q4 2019. We
expect also signiﬁcant growth here. And last but not least, 2020, we want to launch the
SME product. And with that, we have really covered 80% of our product portfolio. And to
grow there, where there is good loss ratios, where there is low expense ratios is a big
driver for proﬁtability.
All in all, we will, after a decade of stagnation in P&C, go for 4% growth and an expense
ratio reduction for at least 30 basis points every year. That's a very promising outlook. And
we have a very strong team. We will deliver this.

So ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome also from me and from the whole live stream
from Allianz Leben. It's a real pleasure for me to present today the amazing growth story
of Allianz Leben and how we want to leverage it in the future.
So in my presentation today, I will give you a little overview of Allianz Leben and its market
position. I will go into some new digital business models in Life. And I will describe how
we want to scale our strengths on an international level, becoming a production center for
Allianz in Europe. And ﬁnally, I will conclude with an outlook on our proﬁtable growth
targets.

Bloomberg Transcript

So let's start with some key facts and ﬁgures. Allianz Leben is by far the clear market
leader in Germany in Life with 10 million customers, 21 billion gross written premiums and
a market share of 23%, which is increasing strongly in the last years. But we are also a very
important and stable contributor to group operating proﬁt and solvency. So the OP of
Allianz Leben was more than EUR 1 billion in each of the 4 last years. And our solvency
ratio will be at the end of the year by more than 400%.
Now the cornerstone of our success and our strategy was the early adjustment of the
company to the low-interest rate environment and the consequent transformation of its
business mix. Since 2013, we have introduced several capital-eﬃcient products, which
meet the demand of the customers by balancing the chances for attractive returns and
security and stability. Today, more than 85% of our business is within new and preferred
business lines, lifting our new business margins to around 4%. But this is also important
for us, this shift in the new business, to have a strong asset allocation and to stick to our
attractive crediting policy.
Another important pillar of our strategy is productivity and utilizing economies of scale.
This is reﬂected in a best-in-class expense ratio of around 80 basis point. Now please note
this number contains the sum of all administration and acquisition costs. And by being
put into relation to the assets under management, I think it's a good KPI for
benchmarking.
Based on these strengths, we have experienced an outstanding proﬁtable growth in the
last years. And for 2018, we are expecting a value of new business of around EUR 700
million.
So that's our growth story. Now the question is how we want to leverage it even further.
And we want to follow 3 routes. The ﬁrst one is by addressing new target groups, such as
aﬄuent clients, foundation and pension entities. So generally speaking, we want to be
partnered to all customers who are searching for stability and who have a long investment
horizon. In many cases, we are doing this in very close cooperation with our colleagues
from Asset Management, for instance, when it comes to the transfer of pension
obligations.

FINAL

Now the second route is we want to bring our solutions into the digital landscape. I will
give you later on examples for retail and corporate. But already here, want to point out
that we are not only talking about digital interfaces. This is a much more comprehensive
approach, changing the whole way we are operating, also with respect to product
models, services and simpliﬁed processes.
And ﬁnally, we also want to transfer our products, our know-how and even digital assets
to other OEs to scale them on an international level.
Now I want to go now a little bit into these new digital business models. And we'll start
with an example from our retail segment. In July, we launched FOURMORE. FOURMORE
is the ﬁrst application of a totally digital customer-centric product concept. What we try
with FOURMORE is to address customers we haven't reached so far because they were
not willing to buy normal life insurance either because of they don't want to have these
ﬁxed payment obligations or because they were missing digital accessibility. So
FOURMORE is designed to be totally ﬂexible with a pay-as-you-like and withdrawals-atyour-disposal approach. It is fully digital with easy-to-use self-services and radically
simpliﬁed processes. And it oﬀers the participation and the investment in a strong
investment portfolio with guarantee elements and an integrated steering of both. So one
basically could say it combines the traditional strengths of Allianz Leben with ﬂexibility
and simpliﬁcation.
Right now, FOURMORE is just oﬀer for digital-only clients. But we will also integrate it in a
multichannel approach. And we will launch the online sales applications for tied agent
and brokers in the next weeks. We will also, based on positive feedback, open it for
aﬃnity business, which is also an interesting segment for this kind of application.
Now one thing I want to point out is that we did integrate FOURMORE into our product
architecture and our back-oﬃce systems. That's a bit similar to what other companies do
with these digital products. Because we think it's the basis for further scaling because we
want to be able to transfer this product concept also to other lines where we think that
this kind of ﬂexibility is interesting and also, maybe in the future, to other countries.
That's the example from retail. Now I come to the corporate pension business, which in
Germany accounts for approximately 40% of our new business. Insurance-based pension
schemes in Germany means that we actually have 2 customers: the employer, who is in
Germany the policyholder and hence selects the provider; and the employee who
decides about participation and the amount of money he invests. Now with FOURMORE,
we want to address both stakeholders. With the employer portal, we want to oﬀer a endto-end digitalization and reduce the administrative burdens for the employer. And with
the employee portal, we want to oﬀer a conﬁgurable and easy-to-use access point for
workers.
Now what do I mean with conﬁgurable? This means that you can adjust and set up this
employee portal according to the relevant pension scheme oﬀered by the company to
the information the employer wants to give his workers and even his corporate logo. We
do that in form of real mass customization, meaning that we have a standardized set of

Page 29 of 59

tools. And you can combine them individually in only 5 to 10 minutes to meet and
conﬁgurate such a speciﬁc portal.

FINAL

We are very enthusiastic about this new approach. Within only three months since we
launched this approach, more than 1,000 customer-speciﬁc and employer-speciﬁc portals
already have been set up.
So it might not be rocket science, Oliver, as you said. But it's a very step forward. And
above all, FirmenOnline will help us to ﬁrst win more customers on an employer level, to
oﬀer these products and pension schemes because administrative burdens will be
reduced. It will enhance the participation of these employees because they have a easier
access point. And the third thing, it will also enable us to implement new product models,
such as Save More Tomorrow where digital end-to-end processes are a necessity. So I
think FirmenOnline is a very interesting approach for us, which we also will look if we can
transfer it to other countries as well.

That's the word, scalability, going to an international level. And that's exactly also what we
want to do. How do we want to scale our strengths at Allianz Leben on an international
level? Now basically, what we want to do and what this concretely means is that we ﬁrst
want to transfer our know-how and our products also to other countries in retail business.
Second, we think that we have great growth opportunities when it comes to the -- creating
integrated solutions for international clients in corporate pensions and protection. And
thirdly, the sharing of digital assets.
Now this chart shows you some examples, very concrete examples which we have either
already implemented or we are currently working on. So for instance, when it comes to
the colleagues in Austria, we help them to set up a new business line for disability
products. In this case, we also share with them an electronic tool for underwriting, which
we use in Germany. And they can use it as a software as a service also in the Austrian
market. Another project we are currently working on is the transfer of Perspektive, which is
one of our core products in the German market, to other European countries. And this
chart also shows -- gives you a little feeling how our cooperation between Allianz Leben
and other local OEs could look like. So which part of the value chain is be covered by
Allianz Leben and which one by the local OE, for instance, in the case of freedom of
(foreign language) framework.
One area where we see enormous growth potential as Allianz is corporate pension and
protection on an international level. We already settled a cross-country transfer of pension
obligations with our colleagues from France, which I think is a very interesting prototype
for other cases. And we will deﬁnitely strengthen our footprint -- footstep in cancer risk
protection by a global underwriting approach which will be organized from Stuttgart,
Allianz Leben and Allianz Re.
And the third thing, as I already mentioned, the sharing of digital asset with this one
example. But I see many other opportunities, for instance, providing components of our
ABS, that's the core system in Germany, to other OEs in other European countries.

FINAL

So this already brings me to my outlook. In general, I think as Allianz, we see enormous
growth potential due to the demographic changes. And we want to exploit these growth
potentials because I think we are perfectly placed. We have a strong market position. We
have innovative products with good performance. And I think by utilizing scale eﬀects, we
will further enhance our productivity and even further improve our already best-in-class
expense ratio.
So it is our target to grow by 5% regarding assets under management as Allianz Leben
and to constantly deliver a value of new business of more than EUR 700 million.
So much about Life. Thank you for your attention. And I think I hand over to Line now.

"Isn't there somebody who knows what we need?" was asked by these 2 entrepreneurs
we just saw. And we know. And the answer is simplicity. But to be able to answer the
question more speciﬁcally, we stepped into the shoes of these 2 entrepreneurs in Vienna
who are about to launch their hair salon. And as we saw, they have a lot of practical things
they need to deal with, including buying insurance. And the feedback they give to us is
that they ﬁnd the insurance industry very complicated and very time-consuming for them
to deal with.
And we have done extensive research across Europe into the small commercial segment,
the micro SMEs. And this customer segment gives this feedback to the insurance industry,
"We're too complicated for them."
And why is it they have this feeling? First of all, the volumes are in retail and in the more
larger corporate. So the industry has prioritized those segments stronger. But the micro
SMEs get stuck between retail and mid-corp. They're more complicated than retail. So we
haven't so far prioritized or found a way for how to automate how we interact with them.
So therefore, we treat them the same way we treat larger corporates with then more
complexity.
But what does this segment look like? The small commercial segment is actually a quite
big market. Outside of the U.S., the market is roughly EUR 60 billion. And within this
segment, the micro SMEs are growing strongly, 4%. And they're also underpenetrated
with insurance. Only 2/3 would have in place the insurance coverage.
And also for Allianz, it's -- our SME book is roughly EUR 3 billion, which would represent
only roughly half the market share of what we would have in other segments. It's,
however, very proﬁtable with a combined ratio of 90%. And it's the loss ratio contributing.
The expense ratio is too high due to complexity. And for this SME segment last year, we
had an operating proﬁt of EUR 430 million, which is a very relevant sum for us.

FINAL

So let's get back into the shoes of these entrepreneurs again. What they need to do now
is to focus on their clients. Our job is to provide them with the insurance solution they
need. And we decided to make a totally new solution for the micro SMEs that should be
fully automated. And through the full automatization, we will then create the simplicity
and get to the productivity as well. And I'm now going to show you what we made, which
will be launched in Austria as the ﬁrst country in February next year.
So the ﬁrst feedback the micro SMEs gave to us when we interacted with them is that they
don't trust insurance. And the way they buy insurance is actually they ask their peers. So a
hairdresser would ask another hairdresser for where one should buy insurance. However
when the customers interact with us, they're very satisﬁed with the service we give them.
And we decided in the digital solution that we made that this is the ﬁrst thing we're going
to show. And this is claims in Austria and true numbers, to create then the trust that we
deliver quality. Then they punch in their company and street address as the next thing.
And they move on.

Bloomberg Transcript

What we then do is we inform them that we will use external data, publicly available data
about their business. And this we do to automate how we then are able to deliver price a
little later on. Then we inform them that we found them and where they are. And we also
inform them -- if they rather want to have personal interaction, we inform them about an
agent close to them that they can contact or they can contact a call center if they want to
do that. So the digital and personal interaction goes hand in hand here.
Then we show them what the external data has provided. So this is a hair salon. We show
them that they have 2 FTEs and -- or employees and what their turnover is. And this we
would need to do to automate the pricing a little later. Then they conﬁrm or correct the
data based on their knowledge about their business. And this data will then also be
matched now very strongly with the internal data we have for the pricing. So now the
geographical information systems about the NatCat, pricing and all of this then kicks in.
The second information we got from the micro SMEs is that they want speciﬁc information
about the risks they're exposed to. So therefore, we decided to make a industry-based
visualization of risks. So here, you see a hair salon. And then the entrepreneurs can click
around and learn about the risks which are speciﬁc for them. And we use global and local
then claims data to provide them with this information. Then they move on. And then we
ask them for the sums to be insured for the coverage they would want.
And for Austria speciﬁcally, here, we will ask them 2 questions which they would need to
answer about their risks. So 2 risk questions sitting in. Then we provide them with the
suggestion for a insurance solution. And based -- and this is based on the data and any
information, all of this we have about them. And here, they can then either buy up or
down based on their budgets and also how they perceive their risks. And the prices here
are dummy prices. So don't hold us to those.
And typically, what a micro SME would need is a liability coverage. It's a property content
coverage. And it's a business interruption coverage. And one thing that's very unique for
micro SMEs is that they need to stay in business for their clients. If they're out of business,

their probability of bankruptcy increases a lot. So we also added quite a bit of assistance
services into what we then oﬀer to them. Then they look further. And they choose to
continue to look into the product. Then they have chosen the comfort package, the 2
entrepreneurs see that. Then they can look through more in detail what the product then
would provide for them.
Then they move on. And then they move into the digital buying process, which is a pretty
standard process with the contact data. Then the payment details, we are suggesting
monthly payment. And they choose the method to pay with. They put in when they want
the policy to start. And they go through the legal consent process. They can download
digitally the policy there. Then done, they bought the insurance. And we, of course, then
thank them for choosing Allianz as their insurance partner.
So what I just showed you is what it will -- the look and feel for what it will be in Austria
from February next year when it comes to buying insurance as micro SME.
And now I'll give you then some insights more from the machine room. The back end is
around what was the old solution and what is the new solution and what is it we have
done to be able to transform how we now interact with the micro SMEs. So in the new
product, the marketing and the communication, it's digital. And we can go on to more
platform partnerships with the diﬀerent industries. We'll do more individualized risk
explanations and communications. And we'll move to one-to-one communication.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the distribution side, you've seen it's fully digital. And it's ﬁt for all channels. So this is
a digital solution all channels can use in their interaction with the customers.
And the key thing which we've changed which has made this possible is the pricing and
the underwriting. It's -- as you saw, it's fully automated. The customers will have to answer
2 risk questions. And then it's 7 clicks to get to a product and a quote. And this is to be
compared with today where sometimes a customer would have to answer 40 questions
about their risk situation. So no wonder that they ﬁnd it complicated to interact with us.
Then we also immediately deliver the policy today digitally, whereas -- or in the new
solution, whereas today, it's paper-based and can take days to be delivered.
So what is it we've done in the back end then in the machine room to make this
transformation happen? The key thing we did when we set oﬀ to make a new solution for
micro SMEs was that we said it should be fully automated.
What we cannot automate, we will not cover. For Austria, we've been able to cover 86% of
the micro SME segment. And the way we made that happen is that we simpliﬁed the
products, like Ivan has been talking about. We killed a lot of complexity. It's a lot of
unnecessary complexity that was killed. So that was number one.
Number two, we enhanced the use of external data and internal data dramatically and the
analytics running behind it. And through data and analytics, you can automate.

FINAL

Number three was around technology. And over the course of the last three years, we've
built a lot of new technology tools in this group for data, product development, pricing,
underwriting, claims, marketing, distribution. And what we mainly did was we pulled
together things we have built in an end-to-end solution which was fully automated. We
made a few new things but mainly used things which was already in place in the group.
And Klaus-Peter explained how Motor 2.0 had new pricing technology. And it's exactly
the same one that's been used here then.
Then the fourth element which was key for this transformation was that we activated the
intelligence of the Allianz Group. So we used best practices from Spain, Italy, U.K.,
Germany and Benelux in developing this new solution. And we're actually going on air in
Austria with the data from Italy and Spain and also the pricing from Italy and Spain
because, in Austria, we do not have much exposure in the segment yet so we don't have
that much data and information there. And the last thing we did was we interacted closely
with the customers, getting their feedback around what we were developing all the time.
So let's have a look at what the customers gave us, feedback.
(presentation)

Bloomberg Transcript

So the micro SME segment doesn't only want protection, they also want help from us to
manage their risks. And we took that input seriously. And we've developed 3 things.
Being digital, we can now provide loss prevention based on the industry. And this hasn't
been possible in the segment earlier for pure cost reasons. So that's one thing. The micro
SMEs will have to deal with workplace safety, legal requirements, like larger corporates.
And that's, for them, quite diﬃcult. So we have -- we are now oﬀering assistance service to
come on site to make them feel safe that they're within their legal requirements, delivered
through Allianz Partners, which is our in-house service provider.
Then we're into the most critical phase for the micro SMEs. That's when something bad
happens, when they have a claim situation, where we're also now oﬀering assistance
services through Allianz Partners. It can be an electrician or a plumber coming on site to
make the business continue.
And here, we've added one new thing, which is IT and data support. And this is linked to
the increasing risk in the society around cyber risks. And many micro SMEs would
struggle with dealing with this. So if they have questions, they can call a call center around
IT questions. And if they have a data breakage, they can send in their devices to us and
we can try to help them to recover their data.
So when it comes to services. So far, we're not doing much. We're in the solution adding
what I just said around loss prevention and assistance. And also, on the claims side, we
are now embarking on the automation with a digital claims solution for reporting claims.
And we are gradually looking into how to automate also that claim side here. We're taking
the ﬁrst steps to deliver the services. And more is to come here.

Scaling up. As I said, we did extensive research across Europe into the micro SME
segment. And we found now -- no diﬀerences between the nations. So the micro SME
needs are the same across the countries. The diﬀerences we have ever found were
between blue collar industries and white collar industries. And this we've dealt with by
making the journey more industry speciﬁc, as we just showed there for the hairdressers.
So scaling up the micro SME solution, what we made is within the Allianz customer model.
So it's a global product, the one that Ivan presented. We used Allianz best practice,
several countries contributing. So thereby also creating a global product. We're using
Allianz core technology available for all operating entities or countries in Allianz. We're
using Allianz Partners to deliver the services. And it's fully automated. And when it's fully
automated, it's easily scalable.
So what's going to happen now, we will implement in Austria in February, then the rest of
CEE will roll out with Czech ﬁrst. Then Germany and Benelux are followers. And our
ambition is to double up on the market share in the micro SME segment. And now we're
opening up to partner with SMEs to create business.
(presentation)
So now Petros is going to tell us what more than micro SME he's going to do.

This is a very good pass for me. Thank you. Thank you, Line.
Indeed guys, it's impressive. I remember being roughly 30 years in this group. And when I
hear my colleagues. And I started from life, the implementation we are doing in life in
Slovakia and now in Austria to scale up the German product in those countries,
something unthinkable some years ago. The Allianz Customer Model with Klaus-Peter and
then Ivan, implementation of a concrete way of running the business identical in the
countries. And I will go through that later, is also quite of an innovative approach.
Then the micro SME concept, which is also deployed as a pilot for Austria and then
scaling up those activities in the countries, I would clearly say this makes a community of
countries, where I would say, honestly, we feel the pride of being part of it and delivering
in a very concrete way in the context of the Renewal Agenda. And our region is a true
example of transformation, where the applicability of the concept of the Renewal Agenda
is very much visible, not only conceptually but also through the results.
I would like to drive you through this. I would call it quite impressive, if you allow me the
wording, Germany the last three years, since the beginning 2015. And then the outlook,
the way ahead until 2021.
We are talking about 11 countries that have been managed in a scattered way for quite a
few years. And we put together -- we have put together this organization in the last three

years since 2015.

FINAL

EUR 4.4 billion revenues; EUR 491 million operating proﬁt; 8.3 million customers; with an
ROE of 14%; and our NPS above market, 75% of the communities, those are the numbers
that reﬂect the achievements of 2017.
And since the outlook and the expectation, the way ahead is also quite impressive,
somebody could say, "Okay, the starting point is weak. And therefore, the improvement is
signiﬁcant." I want to remind you that the starting point of this journey is already in 2014,
where this community of countries was performing EUR 350 million operating proﬁt. So
already, 2017, we were 40% above the starting point three years ago.
Then we commit an additional 45% improvement on operating proﬁtability at the horizon
of 2021, combined with an improvement of our revenues, of our top line of 25%. We
expected to achieve an overall customer base of close to 10 million with a starting point of
8.3 million today. Then ROE, 14% plus 3%, it makes 17%. I would say a quite interesting
ROE from an investor's perspective.

Bloomberg Transcript

And this is done -- and I want to be very clear on that. It's not only a numbers-driven
exercise. There are 11 diﬀerent communities, diverse countries, diﬀerent aspirations per
country, diﬀerent degree of maturity on what insurance is about, diﬀerent degree of
ﬁnancial literacy of the customers. And therefore, putting those 11 countries together
represents, I would say, a quite interesting challenge. It's like a micrography of what the
Allianz group is about in a global scale.
I want to go through not very much in detail but on the large picture of what has been
achieved up until now and what is the expectation, the way ahead. Then I would clearly
distinguish our activities, all those -- the last three years in 2 categories, in 2 diﬀerent
distinctive chapters. The ﬁrst one is what we call outperform. It was characterized by what
we have been undertaking in the last three years. Then the true transformation, the way
ahead with the Allianz Customer Model being at the epicenter of our priorities, the way
ahead.
Looking backwards, 2015 to '17. Then I would try to use a rather provocative example in
your eyes to make this a little bit more clear because sometimes, people when they see
productivity improvement or performance culture, complexity reduction, they can
imagine a variety of things behind those buzzwords. I could take the example of this
session today, the investor discussion and the presentation of today.
And let's assume that there are 20 people preparing this room. There are some people
that are working on the acoustics, on what we see, the visuals. But also on the setup of the
room, the tables, the chairs, the plugs you have close to your seats. So this setup has
been ﬁnalized by a team of 20 people.
And let's now go backwards and say that in a country like the ones we represent in the
region, this has been done before 2015 by a variety of ways with 40, 50, 60 people and

Page 36 of 59



Company Name: Allianz SE

FINAL

with a similar, probably, outcome of the exercise but with diﬀerent ways and diﬀerent
rhythms of productivity.
What we have been doing between 2015 and '17 is to try to identify that there is a
benchmark, there is a best practice. There is a benchmark of 20 people doing this activity.
Then we have tried to assess the distance of each and every country towards the
benchmark. This hasn't been done centrally and instructively. It has been done in a rather
collaborative way.
Then the local entities, the local units, have come to us with their own ambition level for
each and every setup. So if, in each and every country, we would have had the
opportunity to build a community like the one we have today here, each country would
have committed to do it with 25, 30 people or 32 people, a diﬀerent point than the one
they had as a starting one in their mindset.

Bloomberg Transcript

And this is what the outperformance kind of category of homework is about. It is what I
call a hygiene exercise of understanding primarily whether the resources we allocate for
certain activities are really the right ones and whether we truly drive complexity reduction
in the right sense.
Overarching principle of this lever. And I want to make this very clear to you is, ﬁrst of all,
the quality of people, the understanding of the local communities of undertaking this
exercise properly. It's not something instructive. We cannot do it for muni. We have to
have locally the right resources and the right mindset. Then, clearly, our ambition -- and
it's only reﬂected in the numbers we have achieved. You will see those on the outlook, in
the last page. It is clearly the ambition we have to be outperforming distinctively diﬀerent
than the other components of the group. We have clearly an ambition as a region to show
that we can make the diﬀerence. And this is something I would say that conceptually is
embraced by the entire community of our region.
Then transformation. Transformation is relevant primarily to the Allianz customer model,
to the way we intend to run the business in a more simple and a more agile way through
simplicity, customer centricity and then regional business model, which would allow us, at
the end of the day, to achieve an operating environment of one legal entity. It's like we are
having in 11 countries one unit operationalizing our activities within the communities.
Simplicity and harmony. And here, I want to make the diﬀerence to what Klaus-Peter was
mentioning earlier because it is indeed diﬀerent to manage a context of a large country or
a smaller one standalone. And there, indeed, we are talking about business model
transformation and production line that would allow you to support properly the
requirements you have set at market level. But then if you have 11 countries to manage in
the same context, you needed deﬁnitely a steering mechanism, a governance model,
certain components of the culture you implement into the community that would allow
you comfortably to run this activity the way ahead. It's not simple. It's not easy. Believe
me, sometimes the excitement on the eﬀort is much stronger than the reality of things that
are happening and that they can happen.

I would take the example that is my preferred one from the cultural bucket, job mirroring
and mobility. And here, again, I would refer to the previous example of this room. So the
transformational journey we're undertaking now goes beyond to the ambition of having
25 or 30 people preparing this conference of today. Our ambition now is to create exact
mirroring tasks in every working position. So the guy who is setting up the tables has to
do exactly the same job in each and every country. The person -- the specialist who is
specialized on acoustics, he or she should be activating him or herself in the same exact
way to make sure that the delivery is outstanding and it meets the expectations of the
audience.
So this kind of mirroring the activities, it creates a more, I would call it, industrialized
approach on servicing internally throughout human resources, our customers. But it
deﬁnitely creates a certain degree of comfort because also it's not about having the same
characteristics in every job. But primarily creating a certain element of mobility that
accelerates this community building. So we have people that are intending to move from
one country to another to service those activities. And I think this is amazingly powerful.
So we break, I would say, to a certain extent the traditional barriers between the countries
by making people working together in a closer way than this has been encountered
through the past.

Bloomberg Transcript

A typical example. And I don't want to exhaust you. I think you have heard and seen a lot
today about simplicity call. And this is again a pure reﬂection of the Allianz Customer
Model, the way it has been implemented in the region.
The second set of column, where you see motor product and you have those 4
alternative, it is the exact same product you will have from the end of First Quarter next
year in all the countries of the region. This is going to be the motor product, as simple as
that, as visible, as clear as it is in this picture, 4 packages that are reﬂecting the exact
needs of the community.
People are thinking many times that we play the role of the expert and we deﬁne the
packages. This hasn't been done this way. And I want to make it clear. 5,000 people were
part of an exhaustive market research, 32 focus groups with 250 participants where we
checked the exact components of the package to make sure that not only the
communities accept the solution but they also appreciate, they enjoy that this is the right
thing to do. So I would clearly say that this is the outcome of a market-driven approach on
designing, deﬁning and implementing the product.
Then 4 products, instead of 1,000 coverage and combinations, this is also impressive
because we tended to underestimate. If I ask you how would you depict a typical motor
product, you could give me your ﬂavor. And I'm sure it's going to be more or less quite
homogeneous. But if you go in each and every single corner of our countries, you would
realize, for example, that in one of our countries we have a cover for motorcycle clothing.
So an add-on to a motor policy for a motorcycle clothing cover, which means that if the
car hits a motorbike rider and the rider is wearing valuable clothes, he has the right to
collect the compensation of the value of his clothing.

FINAL

This cover was sold in 43 pieces in the speciﬁc country. So we have 43 clients that have
bought this cover. And this cover has been there for the last three years, stable, not
moving at all, without any either appetite to increase penetration because evidently there
is not much of a community of this speciﬁc clientele. And therefore, the degree of
complexity that this example generates, if you magnify it to 1,000 covers, which were the
ones we identiﬁed as being relevant in the countries, you can understand the challenges
we are facing and the importance of implementing properly the Allianz Customer Model.
Then, on the right, I think, it was also mentioned earlier in the context of the
implementation in Germany, we are indeed focusing on servicing the claimants as well
with a common customer journey that would allow them to go from notiﬁcation until
ready to go with the clarity of an application where we can follow up all the steps of the
policy.

Bloomberg Transcript

Scalability of the business model, more than evident. I would focus in a few words on 2
things. One, Austria and Russia have been integrated in our region since the beginning of
this year. So last quarter of last year, then part of our plans and our numbers beginning of
this year. I can tell you the speed and the properness of implementing the regional
agenda within Austria and Russia gives us also the comfort to claim that the scalability of
the business model is really there already, is already done and we know how it can work.
And this is relevant not only to internal candidates but, I would say, also primarily to
external potential activity that would allow us to scale up our businesses.
We are now exploiting the opportunity of Slovenia. And we are working on Slovenia on a
simpliﬁed product value proposition. We are selling in Slovenia only the simpliﬁed
products, motor and property. And this is done through a branch oﬃce from the Croatian
activities. And we are also exploring the opportunity of stepping into the Baltics through a
branch oﬃce again from the Polish activities. It's going to be part of our preparatory work
for next year for strategic dialogue. So I would clearly say the scalability of the business
model is already there. And it makes a lot of sense to undertake all the necessary actions
and collect as much activity as we can aﬀord to make this happen.
I would close my presentation with this page, which is really a trivial one. And it reﬂects
our plans and our numbers. And I wanted to make sure that we understand that, in our
community, EUR 700 million proﬁtability, which is doubling the proﬁts from 2014 and it
gives a CAGR growth of OP of roughly 10% per year, is something already there, stamped
and committed from our organization. Our internal ambition is to reach EUR 1 billion. And
I'm telling you this very bluntly. The region should go to EUR 1 billion. We have the right to
do it. We have the right way of running our businesses that would allow us to scale up our
activities the way ahead. And this ambition clearly drives our expectation of improvement
and higher penetration in those markets.
This is not only, as I said earlier, a numbers exercise. It is a people exercise. It has to do
with the right attitude. We are greedy in making more and allocating properly our
resources in this eﬀort. And I think, clearly, the community we are building around the
countries would allow us to comfortably undertake this challenge.

All right. So thank you very much Petros. And a big thank you to the other 3 speakers of
the second round. This now concludes the formal part of our Capital Markets Day.
But before we start the Q&A session, I hand it back over to Oliver for some closing
remarks.

Oliver BÃ¤te

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Thank you very much. I would like to put a lot of these pieces into perspective so that
you get a consistent message. And I'd like to start by saying you now got a view this
morning into an amazing engine that is Allianz. It is trying to do something that hasn't
been done before, which is to create true scalability in the network across the enterprise,
both, as you saw, in small markets and in very large markets, the most important market
that is the home market in Germany.
Now let me take a little bit of step outside of Allianz and put this whole thing into
perspective, again. So you understand what really the equity story is. What is very
important, because you can ask yourself, question is to demystify the stories that you see
also in other equity stories. The story is Europe is shrinking, motor insurance is
disappearing, there is no money to be made in home markets, let's all move to China.
Yes. There is growth in China. But there is massive opportunity for value creation in mature
markets. And Allianz is going to be a leader in doing that. And that means we do what we
know what we do. And we don't have to hope for political environments, for (by end)
markets, for friendly politicians, for benign regulations or markets that help us where
others have been hundreds of years and we are a new entrant. We are focusing on what
we know and what we do and we do that, too.
Second people are saying, "Well it's not just margin under pressure, there is no growth in
mature markets." It's just not true. In a market that is polarizing between the winners and
the others, we are intending to take shares both in terms of customer satisfaction, in terms
of margin and in terms of customer share on the back of something that we know better
than others. And we have the portfolio that others would like to have.
And the last thing is. And we say it with all conﬁdence, we have created a technical
environment over the last few years to be able to do that. So we are not distracted by
huge integrations by having to bet on benign capital markets, on benign natural
catastrophes, on benign growth in China, just look at what happened to the FANGs and
the tech stocks last year, if that ever happens to some of the ﬁnancials in these emerging
markets.
Now we do, do reallocate resources to growth markets. Some of them are right under our
nose, whether that is clients moving digital or into new ecosystems. Some of them are
indeed Asia, where we are playing catch-up, there is no question. But guess what, when
Page 40 of 59

the Chinese government had to think about who they want in their country with the ﬁrst
holding, they didn't look at the obvious candidates. They looked for people that think 30
years on and they bring them in. Because we don't want to be big for revenues, we don't
want to be big for accounting earnings, we want to be big in terms of impact. And
therefore, we are carefully allocating capital and we will be proﬁtable. So what we will not
see is super expensive acquisitions to buy distribution or joint ventures where all of the
value goes to other people. So we will organically move the portfolio to where the growth
is but in a way that doesn't disrupt the earnings power of this group.
That leads me to the fact of capital management, again, because there were questions. In
2017. And Giulio showed it, we paid out 94% of the total cash generation. In 2018, we paid
out 90% of cash generation. There is no reason to think that we are going to change our
policy going forward if we cannot deploy the capital to grow our global franchise. That is
what we have done. And we'll do it. But we are no ATM. We are not just going to overpay
and pay out just to make somebody happy for an overnight tick in the share price. We are
growing value for those that want value to grow.
Thank you very much for listening.

All right. So thank you for your attention and your patience so far. And now we are very
happy to take your questions.

Questions And Answers
A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Do we have the microphones? Then let's start at front row, please. Let's start. Michael ﬁrst.
Then we'll work our way backwards.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
This is -- I heard one of my colleagues say these half days are fantastic and I agree. The
ﬁrst question is your contract has been lengthened to 2024. The impression I have from
today's presentation is that the 2021 targets you're giving us are kind of almost like a taste
of what you might achieve in 2024. Is that right? Is there a sense that there's a lot more
growth to come later in the plan? Because some of these things that you presented today
will not actually hit earnings until afterwards. So I'm thinking about the new business
value. I'm thinking about some of the direct stuﬀ. And the second question is much more
simple. In Allianz, we used to be -- used to EUR 0.5 billion of capital release from
shrinking the back book. And that helped drive the payouts and stuﬀ. And I was just
wondering, has that disappeared? That seemed -- and the last one. And it's really the
obvious one, could you repeat the idea that we've no big deals? I think you said
complexity versus simplicity. But from the point of view of conglomerate discounts, if you
could completely rule out big deals, your share price would go up massively.

Can I immediately start with question 1 and 3. And then Giulio does also question 3 and
then question 2. Is that a good -- is that a good one? So on the ﬁrst one, that's exactly
right. We have decided, particularly given the massive polarization or environment, just
think about society rich and poor, the tensions we see from populist and all of these
things, that we need to set the business model for the next 10 years, not for the next three
years. And that has huge implications. We've carefully analyzed. Think about digital. We
had made a explicit point today not to talk about digital startups. You know why? We are
learning that these technologies are super important. But they're playing out totally
diﬀerently than all the forecasts. So when you're Google, you can take out margin without
being an insurer because you just auction distribution capacity. But so I'm not afraid of
Google becoming an insurer. But we are thinking through how do we get client control.
And that means by being the best of where clients want to go. And we are growing there.
It is about acquiring people in the net and bringing them onto the platform that gives
them the most value. So we're building it for the very, very long run. But the key thing is
we need to prove we can scale. We need to prove that we are not just acquiring
businesses and integrating them and saying I'm shifting portfolio from life to P&C. That is
a short-term trick. The long-term trick is to prove to investors we can add more value than
the local best practice. And that is to be done. Then you can scale. By the way, that also
pays into your M&A question. It's not just being clever on timing. When we acquire or do
partner, take LV in the United Kingdom, which was an extremely important transaction
because it both proved that you can convince the oldest friendly society in U.K. to partner
with us, it was also on very favorable ﬁnancial terms. But the key message is it's not an
asset. It's part of an ability to scale our capability globally, which we have not proven as an
industry. So it's the latter one. Now on the very large ones, you always make a mistake
when you rule out something. But I'd like to go back to the principles that we set
ourselves. If somebody came with a big idea, how can we then justify that if we can't
prove we have all the integration risks under control, that the returns are being met, that
we know that what we're doing, that the capital is there. So by deﬁnition, anything that is
beyond a certain size is going to be very, very diﬃcult to execute, very diﬃcult to execute.
And that's why, for example, we said we are not going to buy something large in P&C in
the U.S. because what you have to pay to relative to the synergies we create for the
foreseeable future will be very, very diﬃcult to do. So I don't want to ever say never do
never because you don't know what's going to happen. And then you will say honesty
matters. And I have learned the last few years that telling people what you're going to do
and then doing what you tell them is very important. But you can assume we are going to
be extremely careful with your money.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

The other question was about the solvency evolution in the life side. It has not
disappeared. But it has reduced. The reason for that is as I was -- as I said also in the
quarterly call, we were not including in the past in the business evolution Allianz Life
because Allianz Life was not part of Solvency II. Now we are including that. This is not a
big amount. But it can make EUR 100 million compared to the EUR 400 million that you
are referring to. And also, we are growing a little bit more compared to the past. So I
would say the business evolution of EUR 400 million minus for life is now more about
minus EUR 200 million. That will be my guess. But that's also important. I don't know
whether it really matters considering that we have a solvency ratio 230 and a general
business evolution of 10% per annum. So -- but to your point speciﬁc to that, yes, it's a
little bit lower compared to the guidance we gave you before.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
Maybe you can say something about the new business value transformation into
operating proﬁt in life because that's...

FINAL

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

We're deﬁnitely looking into that. And as you see, as we move into the midterm phase,
which is beyond 2021, the earnings are going to pick up. Because right now, we are
running at a value of new business, which is about EUR 2 billion. That was not the case a
few years ago. If you go back and you look at our new business value a few years ago, that
was signiﬁcantly lower. I tell you we had a new business value even now, EUR 1 billion.
Now the diﬀerence is, to be fair, the new business value, you could have applied a
multiplier of almost 4. And now you need to apply a multiplier to get to the operating
proﬁt of 3. But still, if you run it twice, the amount of any new business even if the
multiplier might be diﬀerent, at the end of the day, you understand that the value
accretion -- operating proﬁt accretion is going to pick up as we continue to put VNB at
this level.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
And we are working on Michael on making that much more transparent in the sense of
when is the VNB materializing in earnings relative to expiring business. So over the next 18
to 24 months, you will get a pretty precise picture on that.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yes. Maybe I want to say -- I don't know if you are going to get a picture. For sure, we are
going to get a picture. Because at the end of the day, the point is the following. When we
talk about value of new business, I think sometimes we are not putting the emphasis that
we should put because value of new business looks like something esoteric. Now if we
get also for internal management conversation, there's sort of -- if you make EUR 10
million more of value of new business, this means EUR 3 million more operating proﬁt
next -- in the next two years. If you get EUR 100 million more, it means EUR 30 million. I
believe we are going to have diﬀerent conversation on driving these KPIs. So it's deﬁnitely
something that we're going to develop internally. And then this is going to help us also in
the conversation with you guys. But that's really about driving the business internally.

A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Okay. We will stay in the ﬁrst row. Jon. This gentleman over there. Thank you.

Q - Jonathan Michael Hocking
Jon Hocking, Morgan Stanley. I've got 3 questions, please. Firstly on the resilience of the
balance sheet. Oliver, you speciﬁcally referenced the volatile outlook. I remember the
previous plan. There was a speciﬁc initiative to reduce interest rate risk for the life
business. I just wonder whether you've done anything or plan, to do anything to make the
balance sheet more defensive given your view on markets. That's the ﬁrst question. The
second question, just on the EPS targets. You've got very strong organic growth in the
P&C business. And you've got a productivity improvements you mentioned. I'm just
Page 43 of 59



Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2018-11-30

FINAL

wondering why that doesn't feed through to bigger EPS contribution from P&C into the
group target. And so mechanically, you can probably get to more than 4%. Then just
ﬁnally, the legacy, I just wondered how quickly the legacy will be retired or whether that's
feeding into productivity targets and to what extent is that just retail, P&C and commercial
and whether there is some in the life as well.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Now with the question about the balance sheet and the strength if we wanted a
capitalization level, you are referring speciﬁcally the interest rate sensitivity. We have a
target. And the target is to have an interest rate sensitivity below 11%. Right now as of Q3,
we were at minus 7%. So at the end of the day, our strategy is to run and start to do a ratio
match. So the only sensitivity we're picking up in reality is coming from the convexity. So
from that point of view, clearly, we are looking at the resilience of our balance sheet to
shocks. And this goes beyond the reality interest rate sensitivity. That's also about credit
spreads. And that's about equity market. So from that point of view, we have a risk
appetite. And based on this risk appetite, we deﬁne what kind of interest rate sensitivity
can we absorb, what kind of credit spreads sensitivity we can absorb. So that was the
question on the capital side. The other one was the translation of operating proﬁt in P&C.
And if I understood the question, into EPS. Yes. Absolutely, I will say if we have an
operating proﬁt growth in P&C of 5%, I will say that the translation into EPS, I will go pretty
much the level of about 7%. So this is contributing clearly on top of what life is doing. You
can almost apply almost the same multiplier, we'll say. You saw the 3% becoming 4% to
5%. I will say on the P&C side, the story is not much diﬀerent. And you, Oliver?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
Can I say something about risks because that's his? We have systematically worked on
reducing tier risk in the book. And in diﬀerence to other companies, we have found that
given where we are also in terms of proﬁtability, never look -- forget the other component.
Selling back books was something as a risk and an earnings question. Selling as
something at a loss and then thinking that you've improved ROE going forward from an
economic standpoint is not the right thing. And as we showed you earlier, we have 93% of
our businesses making a double-digit return on equity. Our need to really sell back books
either for risks or for return reasons has dramatically declined over the last few years. And
I just wanted to mention that. So both earnings power and the risk proﬁle, now you still
have the volatility from the artiﬁcial risks that we don't economically have. That's the credit
spread. Because we are making sure through reverse stress tests that we do not have a
true economic exposure. And let me clarify that the true risk and spread risk is liquidity
risk, right? Do you have to sell ever a bond at a discount? That unfortunately is a question
that Solvency II doesn't ask. So we really focus on making sure never having to sell a bond
at a loss. That is what we focus on, something that's not in the model. And that's why we
maintain such a high buﬀer of capital and liquidity. And you need to understand that has
a price. We see that. And given -- and that is what people don't look at. The strength of
the balance sheet at 13% ROE at Allianz is a very diﬀerent number in other balance sheets.

A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Okay, next. Perhaps, we move to the right. Could we have, yes, next, Andrew -- that's
gentleman over there?

FINAL

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. A couple of questions. Just for Giulio. I think the
implication is that your interest rate assumptions assume no change in yield curves from
this point. Therefore, I'm assuming your EPS encompasses some ongoing decline of
running yield. If you could just clarify that. Secondly, on Slide B16, in Ivan's presentation,
there was an expense ratio you gave for the European direct business. I think it's 12%. Just
to clarify, is that an all-in expense ratio? Or is that excluding marketing expenses? It seems
pretty low. On SME, I mean, the biggest SME market is the U.S. It's about $100 billion
premium. And there's not that much innovation there right now and quite a lot of
greenﬁeld insurers being quite successful. Would that be an area that Allianz would
consider exporting its SME revamped product into? And the ﬁnal question for Oliver. Your
NPS is set relative to the industry in each country. The insurance industry is a terrible
industry. And is that ambitious enough? Isn't it -- shouldn't you think about NPS not
relative to a pretty bad industry?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
I don't think NPS is terrible everywhere. But I think it's a fair observation that there are
markets where other industries have a much higher customer satisfaction than we have.
And it's a very fair observation. But it starts -- we would like to sort of walk before we run.
So the number one is let me go back to what -- where we are coming from. And you can
call that embarrassing because the benchmark is not the right one. In 2014, only 47% of
our businesses, we count P&C and life separately, had a Net Promoter Score top down
that was better than the market. So you can also be very self-critical and say that was less
than half. And that is taking the traditional competitors. By the way, most of them that are
at the top are mutuals because they have a very eﬀective way of thinking about that.
Today, that number is, as of nine months, 71%. It's going to be 72% where we're above.
We have only 4 businesses where we actually went back for various reasons. And we
intend to really move to the industry. That is the ﬁrst step. Then we need to move. The
second one. And Nick had a question, how do you actually measure that? I'd like to also
point out to the fact that we have an independent group of agencies that do get these
numbers to compare us to traditional and nontraditional competitors. And as these
numbers are targets for management, we get them independently audited. So the
numbers that we do have. And we can show them relative to the ones, are real facts, not
self-measured numbers because you may get from other people we are also great. And
the second step. And that is very important, these things that drive the NPS are either
willingness of our clients to recommend other most important ones. This perceived price
value perception, the quality of the product and the service, that is really, really important.
And the power of the brand. What we have learned the last three years and that has made
a big impact, that we have under invested in communication to our consumers, we have
overinvested in commission. And we have under invested in the value perception of our
products because people do not understand how good Allianz products really are. That
has been one of the biggest movers next to improving underlying products. So the
upside that we see from getting this right is massive. And that speaks to your point to
what -- where the benchmark should be. But again, let's walk before we run. And let's get
to where we need to be. Michael earlier said, it's a 10-year journey. It's not a 3-year sprint.
Now to the other questions.

Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2018-11-30

Yes. So when we do our projection regarding interest rates, we use a diﬀerent approach
for the insurance business compared to the Asset Management business. In the insurance
business, we are pretty much assuming the interest rate level of June. And we just say
nothing else is going to happen. So it's pretty much ﬂat on the level of June. We would
move this level only if there is a big change between June and the planning period. So
that's what we do on the insurance side. In asset management, especially in the case of
PIMCO, we are assuming some sort of increasing interest rates. And this explains why the
assets under management growth is 3.5%. You would expect more on the sort of a stable
condition. That's because we are assuming some sort of drag coming from high interest
rate level.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
So there was a question on SME then. Conceptually, that's exactly the right answer.
Unfortunately, until 2020, to be -- again, this is Allianz, honest where we need to be
honest. We are still working on the IT platform for the old Fireman's Fund business. As
you know, we are operating through AGCS, the mid-corp and SME business. So we will
not be ready for the next 18 to 24 months until we ﬁx the IT. And I think that's really, really
important. Now do we say the opportunities over by then? We don't think so. But let's -again, let's get the infrastructure ready. And then we'll move from there.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Can I pick up the question direct. The 12% includes all the costs. So marketing costs
and so on. Now it's not that we have invested a lot in pushing the direct operation,
especially outside Italy. So from that point of view, is the expense ratio of these
companies. But you might assume that there were some underinvestment in marketing.

A - Ivan de la Sota

{BIO 19492628 <GO>}

This is a target expense ratio. It doesn't include, at the ﬁrst stage, the change of brand.
And it's a very ambitious target because it depends on achieving, I mean, deep
improvement in external expenses and in acquisition costs both.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
That also explains a little bit your question of why are some of the productivity gains not
feeding through. We intend to use a signiﬁcant part of the massive improvements
productivity to reinvest in growth. And that's why you see also organic growth picking up.
Because as we said, communication in the brand, the empathy of the brand, the value
proposition is something that we have to get better at.

A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

All right. Let's go to the middle here. James and then Nick afterwards, okay, to keep it
simple.

Q - James Austin Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

James Shuck from Citigroup. Three questions from me, please. Oliver, around the
scalability of things, which all sounds very sensible and you've given plenty of examples
Page 46 of 59



FINAL

Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2018-11-30

today of where that's going. It seems to me that the evolution of the company is going
more towards that of a service center. I'm just wondering what the natural extension of
that scalability is. Do you start to oﬀer your own products and services to third parties as a
revenue and income stream in order to accelerate and grow even further that scalability?
Secondly, just on the U.S., obviously, you make a lot about being global scale. U.S. P&C is
somewhere where you've had a mixed track record. And you're currently not there. At
some stage, do you make the decision that you might look to grow there organically,
leveraging the scale that you've been talking about? And ﬁnal question is just around the
actual price point that you're trying to target for customers. So I'm interested to know to
what extent are you actually able to maximize your margin through kind of halo-type
eﬀects and better servicing rather than just productivity type gains.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te

Bloomberg Transcript

I would like to actually also allow some colleagues. And I haven't thanked the team here,
who is carrying a lot of the work, right? You always look at us. But the reality is the people
that deliver every day sitting on the right-hand side. And let's include them. Let's take a
simple example of scalability. Why did Allianz say move to us, right, if we are already the
biggest guy? Why do you have someone with a strong brand a proud background?
Because they want a partner that can help them to scale. So you've partially answered
your question in the sense of that is exactly what is happening now. Why do banks come
to us that have normally -- given the business to 5, 6 diﬀerent providers are coming to us
and says, "We want to work with you globally because you can actually ensure product
service quality, scalability of services." Last but not least, we are by design, not by
accident, the largest assistance company in the world. Everybody is trying to say we are
moving from payer to partner. But the reality is who's there, it's us.
(technical diﬃculty)
Example that -- so it's exactly right. Now are we where we would like to be? Let's go a step
back. The operational delivery has to be outstanding. So the question about the U.S., yes.
But we need to be honest and transparent and say is the operational excellence in the
U.S. P&C business where it needs to be? No it isn't. And until it isn't, we will not allow it to
scale. But guess what, the ﬁrst nine months after we reject some of the platform, the
growth has been already 8% right? So the areas where we are really good, the brokers are
coming to us and bringing us the proﬁtable business that we are seeking. But we are not
ready everywhere yet. Not yet in the U.S.

A - Klaus-Peter RÃ¶hler
Maybe a comment, Oliver, if you allow, because I think it is important. Growth, we always
see it as a acquisition of customers. There is an element in growth inherent to our pricing
capabilities and our pricing techniques. And we have been observing the last few years,
by screening properly our pricing positioning in the market, that there were cases where
we left on the table some euros for no reason. We were less expensive than the next
competitor by EUR 10, EUR 15. And this was something that the market was appreciating.
But the market also was willing to pay to us another EUR 10 or EUR 12 without disrupting
the relationship with the customer. This is something that now we are doing it much more,
let's say, meticulously, analyzing our pricing position, not only in terms of being the
Page 47 of 59



Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2018-11-30

cheapest or the more expensive but understanding also the dynamics, the comparable
dynamics to the other players in the market. And there is an element of growth behind
this exercise indeed.

A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Let's continue with this gentleman in the middle, Nick.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Nick Holmes at SocGen. Just a couple of questions. The ﬁrst is, Oliver, going back on to
the subject of Asia. I know you articulated the old world argument very convincingly. But
Asia is surely a key part of scalability and a global platform. And it's been conspicuously
absent, I guess, in your plans that you've outlined today. So I just wondered, if you could
elaborate more on where you see your Asian franchise going, in particular China, there's
been a very interesting development there for you. So that's the ﬁrst question. And the
second question is just looking at the expense ratio. Very good that you've targeted 27.5%
for the P&C expense ratio. But you're almost there, aren't you? And I just wondered
whether that's a bit kind of being conservative, whether you think realistically you could
deliver more on that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Now with the expense ratio, I would say, okay, we are not almost there because we still
expect the expense ratio for 2018 to be above 28%. So it's still some improvement, yes.
But yes, the answer to your question, can I see the number to be below 27.5%? The
answer to your question, yes, will be potentially, yes. Then there is also a point that
Michael has raised. He was saying looks almost, Oliver, you are preparing for the next
Capital Market Day in three years. I believe a lot of things that Ivan and the team is doing,
they are going to also kick in down the road. So I would also say the 27.5% is anyway not
supposed to be the end of the story. And then we can debate about the timing. But there
is more to come.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
Nick, you always ask very good questions on where the gaps are. And you're right. You're
right. I'd like to however without deﬂecting, I'll talk about it, the fact that growth is at
home and under our nose. And we'd like to -- we made the same mistake. We always said
let's go somewhere else. And let's not ﬁnd it where it is. And when you really study
granularity of growth even in a market that top line grows 2%, their pockets are growing in
value 4% or 5%, 6%, 7% a year that we need to capture. So that's the ﬁrst. So no more
excuses at home. And Klaus-Peter was very clear. After 16 years of declining customer
numbers is unacceptable. So let's start there. No excuses. And don't accept excuses from
anybody else. Second, don't forget the United States. We have more than EUR 3 billion
operating proﬁt. We have an amazing asset management franchise in the United States.
The United States is going to continue to do well. We have a life insurance company that
after 2008, you nicely always pointed out to the improvement potential there in the past.
We've made extremely proﬁtable. He was the CFO when we came and says you need to
have double-digit ROE. He was thinking about where to move. Now he made it happen.
That's why he's here today by the way, one of the reasons. So we have EUR 1 billion

earnings coming from the U.S., also on the life insurance side. Then asset management
and life together. Then you have all kinds of other issues coming on top. So we believe
the U.S. is super important for us before we get to Asia. So we have more earnings
potential at home, more earnings potential in the U.S. That is already 25%. And then we
can do more. We just need to get the timing right. Then we get to Asia. The honest
answer is we are still playing catch-up. We are playing catch-up to many other people. We
started early in the -- in early '90s. And because of many reasons, internal, mostly in
capital market, we lost touch. And we are rebuilding our position very systematically, very
systematically. But before we go to you and gave you a great Asia story to be honest, we
needed to ﬁx the basics. Now we have tripled new business value in the last three years.
George Sartorel who I would like to mention with his outstanding team has tripled new
business value. We were not properly present in the life insurance side. We had issues in
China, left, right and center from old joint ventures. We've cleaned it up. In Thailand,
we've just changed the shielding structures. There was a lot of cleanup to be done, just to
be very transparent. Now we've said we're sowing the seeds not just in traditional
business so in the life business that we -- where have been overtaking in terms of EPE
growth, even some of the large incumbents. So please do look at the number in terms of
both relative and absolute growth of Allianz versus the peers, even the dominant 2 in the
markets. We operate Indonesia, Thailand, others. We are better than them. What is the
disadvantage we still hold? We are not strong enough in the megacities. So that's Hong
Kong and Singapore. And I don't see a short-term change to that. So that's why we have
said, "Okay, what is going to open up?" And that is China. So in addition to totally
changing what we're doing on the life side in the past because we said we want to do it
the right way. So what is the wrong way? One, being a small partner in a huge bank
assurance transaction where you show earnings but you never see any cash because
everything goes to the bank. The other wrong way is to grow in the wrong products that
have massive tail risk in terms of asset allocation, right? China is a very diﬃcult and
dangerous place in terms of the insurance -- life insurance products there. So we don't
want to do that. That makes us forgo growth short term but ensures that we have a viable
business long term. So what we do? The ﬁrst thing is we said we do want to jump S
curves. We do not get into traditional motor insurance. But we partner up with JD.com in
order to create something that is truly scalable in the new world. And there, the
equivalent of what Amazon is in the United States. The second one is to say we want to
bring asset management and our other products like credit insurance fully into China,
therefore securing the ﬁrst ever insurance holding license was absolutely critical for us
because it is going to allow us to bring all our businesses, including asset management
onshore. And then being able to decide who do we actually partner with. And we are
working on exploring further options now that the government has clearly communicated
to its own country that Allianz is highly welcome and preferred. And I can tell you we have
lots of opportunities. But let's please talk about it once we are delivering not to promise
something that isn't there yet. Thank You.

We'll keep this for the next Capital Markets Day. Okay. Let's continue with the second row,
Vinit. And then afterwards Peter. Okay.

Company Name: Allianz SE

Date: 2018-11-30

It's Vinit from Mediobanca. So if I make 2 questions on simpliﬁcation, one for the
operational side and one for CEO and one question on PIMCO, please. So 3 total
questions. So ﬁrst question on strategy -- on simpliﬁcation. I seem to remember that it was
ﬁve years ago that we were discussing the German story in the P&C side. And one of the
real top takeaways was the modularization of the P&C product. And that was supposed to
be a key driver. Now if I look back at the German numbers, they seem to have delivered.
So my question is that, are you trying to ﬁx a problem that isn't there? Or are you
upsetting a very nice functioning product suite by having this only one motor product or
whatever is happening? So that's the question for the German motor essentially. Second
question is just -- again if I look at slightly longer historical perspective, Oliver, starting
with the subsidiaries being incentivized to give capital back to Munich. And now it seems
that the subsidiaries are being incentivized to also take products from Munich. And I know
Petros said that there is a collaboration. And any comments will also be useful. But is there
a risk that you're demotivating the rank and ﬁle by forcing down this -- or taking away so
much power away as it looks like from the outside? So these are 2 strategy questions.
And one question is on PIMCO on Slide C8 of Giulio that -- one of the last assumptions,
which just seems to be very critical to me, is stable markets, et cetera. Is it not an
assumption that PIMCO's product suite, which you had updated us in 2015 CMD, the
product suite, is it a fair assumption that it is a bit more able to manage very volatile or
reasonably volatile

Bloomberg Transcript

(technical diﬃculty)
quite diﬀerent assumption then? So just want to understand if the PIMCO product suite is
giving you any more comfort on that.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
I would like to have the CEOs answer the question of whether Munich is shoving down
something their throat.

A - Klaus-Peter RÃ¶hler
So if you take Allianz Germany, on the P&C side, we have lost in the last 10 years 1.6
million policies. I think that's a lot. There were years where we almost lost above -- shortly
below 1 million. Now that shows that modularization, in itself, does not help. You need to
have the building blocks that I showed in my second slide. And the building blocks, they
go on to the simpliﬁcation. And the simpliﬁcation, in the end, has the 2 methods. It brings
the expenses down. On the other hand, it gives more customer centricity. Then there's the
part about technical excellence. And I say, here, we have really made a major catch-up
with our pricing capabilities. And last but not least, also the sales excellence is coming
through. We are much more eﬀective on our sales networks than ﬁve years ago. So I
would say, that really makes the diﬀerence. And the motor is just the beginning.

A - Ivan de la Sota

{BIO 19492628 <GO>}

Yes. I would like to add that the ACM, the simpliﬁcation model, is something that came up
from the bottom up through experiences with companies and through the support and to
Page 50 of 59



Company Name: Allianz SE

Date: 2018-11-30

-- and additions that the CEOs have added and brought to the concept. So it is fully
assumed by the organization. And I think that everybody understands now why Allianz,
not only the language. But also the fact that we want to really create -- make something
out of the group.

FINAL

A - Petros Papanikolaou

{BIO 4690304 <GO>}

Then, Ivan, if you allow, I think it is important for us to understand that in the commodity
world, simpliﬁcation is a must. In commodity products like motor and property, there is no
question about simplifying at the limits of what simpliﬁcation can be. And there is no
reason of doing it in a country-speciﬁc way since the modules are clear, the needs are
quite clear as well. And therefore, the package solution is the only one that will drive
simpliﬁcation, not only in terms of selling process but primarily in terms of IT infrastructure
that you need to support this, where we have all the important beneﬁts in terms of an
expense ratio and earnings then.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
Change. We used to all have what we call the Allianz target model that was developed
with the people but out of the Munich. The product comparison that Ivan did, Klaus-Peter
did when he was in Italy, Joachim MÃ¼ller did in Germany, it was the CEOs saying you
know what is the similarity. Then learning that, by the way, the biggest resistance to
change is not them or us, it's in their own organizations.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

The question on PIMCO, the resilience of the business model, clearly, we have been
working on the resilience of PIMCO. And there are 2 ways to work on that. One is also try
to diversify into strategies, which are not necessarily ﬁxed income. And you are working
on the margin here. But that's something that we are doing. And the other one is also
within the ﬁxed income, you can have diﬀerent strategy. So I will deﬁnitely say there is
more resilience compared to what we had before. But at the end of the day, there is still
see the exposure to volatility in the bond markets. And other consideration also as you
are thinking about diversiﬁcation, you might diversify even more. But this comes at a cost
of scalability and eﬃciency. So it's all about ﬁnding, if you want, also the right balance
between how much you want to diversify. But on the other side, you know that there is
also a beneﬁt in driving scalability and eﬃciency. But the bottom line is yes, there is more
resilience today compared to the resilience we had a few years ago.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
Now Oliver said and told me you had questions on demotivating people because of
capital upstreaming. I would like to sort of take that a little bit because it's very important.
Remember, initially, when we said that we have in the past this target based on budget.
And people would come and say, the market is soft. Life is tough. Last I gave you x, this
year, I'm giving you x minus 5 and then we negotiate it. And sometimes, we came back
and said, we actually accepted that. No more. This is super important to understand. We
are all incentivized to deliver a certain RoE and to grow the earnings. And that is true, not
just for the portfolio and everybody. If you do not produce the earnings growth, we then
obviously are going to ask, well, then, we want the money back, right? By the way, we

Page 51 of 59



FINAL

Company Name: Allianz SE

Date: 2018-11-30

have yet to receive a convincing case of earnings growth and investment startup that we
haven't supported really fully. So it's not that we don't want to give the money. We have a
lot of it. But if we need to really focus that, it's not just about protecting earnings but
growing the business, that's the CEOs and all of our jobs. So I don't believe that's the
case. It's just making sure that we beat the benchmark. And that is not easy. And you grow
the earnings. And everything, again, that we don't need, we bring not just to the center
because we don't want to sit it, we give it back to you. So we have the commitment to
bring the capital there where it's productive. And if we cannot use it, we give it back to
the shareholders.

A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Okay. Peter. And then we move afterwards to the next row. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Three questions, please. The ﬁrst one is for Klaus-Peter. It seems that quite a big part of
the German turnaround story has been the garage steering, which, I think unlike the rest
of the German market had already been doing a little bit ahead of you. And it's fairly
common practice elsewhere as well. I'm just wondering what the reason was for being a
little bit behind the curve there. And are there other things that maybe you can improve
that you're not quite -- there's still areas to improve elsewhere? And the second one is for
Line. On the -- when you mentioned taking prices from other countries, I guess diﬀerent
countries can always have diﬀerent characteristics. And there's naturally sort of alarm bells
ringing a little bit. But I'm sure you've got controls in place. I'm just wondering if you
could talk a little bit about what those controls were. And the third one, for Oliver, on the - I'm not sure if I fully got the message. But my understanding was that you seem to be
talking about sort of in-sourcing Insurtech operations a little bit, I guess. Peers will
highlight that the entrepreneurial nature of Insurtech needs them to be apart from the
industry and the ownership doesn't really work. I just want to understand whether you
have a diﬀerent view there or perhaps you could just explain what you're thinking of
there.

A - Klaus-Peter RÃ¶hler
Yes. I think the reason why garage steering was not activated the way it should have been,
it was underestimated. How much potential it bears in there, not only expense ratio-wise
but also from a customer satisfaction point of view. And that's what we really see. And we
will continue this journey. But if you look at the motor product, it has many new features in
there. Also, service features I was talking about the premium road-side assistance that has
a very, very high penetration now. And we get a lot of satisfaction. So the whole product
had been redesigned. We reduced it from 13 modules to 9 modules. We did not only kick
out modules. But we renovated them. And behind everything that is really the core is our
real-time pricing engine. And I think that makes the diﬀerence currently in the German
market.

A - Line M. Hestvik

{BIO 15367880 <GO>}

So to the question of taking risks around the pricing, on the SME side then. So when you
start something, you -- of course, you need to start and you do take risk. And that's where

Page 52 of 59



FINAL

Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2018-11-30

I think being a part of Allianz Group at the scale of Allianz Group helps. So what we're
speciﬁcally doing in Austria is we're using the data from the rest of the countries that
would have data. And of course, we're also checking how the Austrian market functions
and all those modern things that we do. But I think the third thing that's helping us a lot
here is the new technology stack for pricing, which has partly been mentioned by KlausPeter several times, which is we're rolling it out globally now. So we -- from we write
business one day, the day after, we would then have an overview of what happened. And
if we see things happening which we didn't expect, we can actually change the price the
day after. So we have a very agile pricing technology in place, which gives us opportunity
to correct. And we will probably do quite a few of those things because when you start
new, that's normal. So that creates this agility in how we can build new businesses going
forward.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te

Bloomberg Transcript

So the question was left on the Insurtech. What we wanted to say is the following:
Because of what we have done with creating Allianz X, which, in of its nature, is the largest
investment fund in these startups, we have been investing in various startups like others
that we try to focus on those that are successful. What we are learning is the following. We
are learning, yes, we need the entrepreneurship and the change. But what they all lack is
scalability because what you need to make money in insurance is not a smart front end.
But you need an integrated business model that actually delivers. So you need both. You
need to -- so we will continue to have both. But the idea again is how can we scale the
innovation into our businesses rather than keeping them separate. And this is what I
wanted to say.

A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

We will stay in the second row. One last question from the second row. Dhruv, please.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

Dhruv Gahlaut, HSBC. Three questions. Firstly, if I look at AGS -- AGCS, that's been
running at a combined above 100%. Just wondering what do you have for AGCS in the
current plan? Secondly, just following on your comments this morning on the P&C capital
charges that's between 35% and 40% of premiums. What would that number be of -- if I
was to look at new business last year on the Life side? And lastly, you have aspirations on
CEE to grow revenues by more than 20%, same you're expecting growth in the German
book as well, could you say a bit more about pricing as in how do you see the cycle at this
point on both these markets?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

First oﬀ from AGCS. Yes. The combined ratio actually right now is above -- it's about 100%.
And the plan is to bring down this -- the combined ratio to 96%. Most of the improvement
will come from the United States. The other question was the capital intensity for Life.
Assuming we do EUR 1 billion of premium, you can assume a solvency requirement of
about 2% on the EUR 1 billion of premium. So that's the number for the capital intensity in
the Life business.

FINAL

A - Klaus-Peter RÃ¶hler
(inaudible) I mean, our plan really foresees the growth focused on retail and SME. And
these are 2 large segments that are not as cycle related as we would see this -- with the
midcorp business. In the midcorp business, we will stay stable. So our growth is really
focused on this part where we ﬁnd interesting loss ratios and where we ﬁnd also the
possibility to get our expense ratio down. So this covers us also more from a cycle. What
we have to say compared to last year, yes, also this year in the motor market, we see
already a more intense competition compared to last year. But we will have to wait until
the end. Then we can tell you more how the cycle in motor will continue.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Petros Papanikolaou

{BIO 4690304 <GO>}

And in our case, I would say that our 3 markets of focus where our scale today is below
what we should have been running as a total book of business, one is Poland where our
market share is at 5%. And we clearly need to have a higher ambition. We are working on
that. Czech Republic, we're also -- we believe that the P&C book of business, a range of
12% today. It should go above 15%. Then Romania, where we have a leading position but
primarily driven by our activities in property business and not in motor that much, we
intend to be much more selective and proper in motor. In the overall performance of the
book, I would clearly say that the combined ratio we aspire for the horizon 2021, which is
below 88%, gives already clearer indication on the proﬁtability buckets that we have in the
region that were quite signiﬁcant. This is primarily driven by the lack of maturity of the
markets and the techniques we apply in terms of technical expertise that would allow us
to be much more properly selective than the competition. I always say to my colleagues
when I visit the countries that when a loss-making business is leaving Allianz is a good
sign because this puts more pressure to the competitors and it allows us to be more
competitive in the right segments. So we are doing this very simply and very
professionally, I would say.

A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

All right. Now ﬁnally, we're moving to the third row. Okay, let's start on left side. Yes,
Johnny, the gentleman there. Thank you.

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

It's Johnny Vo from Goldman Sachs. Just 2 strategic questions and one sort of ﬁnancial.
Just on the strategic side, just coming back to simplicity. I guess there's obvious beneﬁts
for you from a cost perspective. But I guess it does come back to the question of
commodiﬁcation of the products. And so ultimately, is this just a race to the bottom? And
eﬀectively, what is Allianz' ultimate competitive advantage on the long term? Is it pricing?
Is it distribution and whatnot? Because usually, the tech is usually to support a competitive
advantage. In terms of the direct platform as well, just to make clear, there is no
diﬀerential pricing between the legacy and the platform. Is that correct? Then ultimately
then, is this an oﬀensive move, a defensive move or is it ultimately you stick to drive out
eﬃciency from the existing business? Then ﬁnally, in terms of the EPS target of 4%
organic, that implies about a EUR 1.5 billion buyback per year as a base case. 4% -- but
with the 1%.

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

4% is just assuming -- is the growth in operating proﬁt.

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

FINAL

I know. But if we get to the 5%. So it's 4% organic and then the 5%. So the 1% is about EUR
0.5 billion?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yes. So if the...

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

If the organic is higher, do we get a lower buyback and so forth? Can you just talk about
the dynamic there?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Now we look at the accretion coming from capital management. As I stated right away, if
you go for a pure buyback strategy, you can take the EUR 2.5 billion of cash ﬂow. You just
said this is going to go full in buybacks. I tell you, you can run the math, it's going to be
more than 6% growth in EPS, right? It's mathematical. Now if you go into more M&A, then
clearly, the number is going to round closer to the 5%. That's pure mathematic. And the
reason is M&A in the short term will never really beat the buyback because you are
restructuring, you have all these kind of things. So from that point of view, M&A reaches
strategy compared to a buyback strategy, it's going to dilute initially the EPS accretion. If
you anyway make sure that in reality, you are beating -- the M&A is beating overall the
buyback, over time, you're going to get the accretion back. But it's not going to happen
in the ﬁrst 2, three years.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
So the number is, as you asked, north of 6%, depending on how you do that. But again, as
you said, it's just mathematics. And again, assuming that we have a certain return target,
the money will not sit in the bank for 15 basis points. Now the second question you had
was. And I alluded very quickly so we have some time, on the commoditization, what is
the ultimate competitive advantage? It will come out of 2 things. First, being much closer
to consumers in terms of what their value perceptions are. So even in so-called
commodity perspective, you ﬁnd for the strong brands and the strong service 5% to 8%
combined ratio advantage, which is massive in terms of capital consumption. And they
may operate over time. And then there's scale coming from that. We have 2 leader from
branding power. So in a world where we will move from push, i.e. paying commissions, to
pull, that is investing in branding and bringing clients onto our platform, scale will truly
matter. So being able to build a strong brand and then reduce merger and acquisition
costs, for example, by bringing warm leads to our distributor, will make all the diﬀerence.
And EPP pricing, maybe Ivan?

Yes. It will certainly apply in the European platform the idea of decommissioning of the
old products so that the portfolios will move increasingly to the new product and most of
the -- and there will be a convergence of the pricing. But this will come when we launch
the new platform. And have all the products and -- on the same platform, we can deal
with it. This will be in one year time.

A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

All right. This gentleman over there. Farooq?

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Farooq Hanif from CrÃ©dit Suisse. Just 3 questions. On the ACM, I can see why, from a
cost point of view and a customer point of view, it's really eﬀective and radical. But from
an underwriting point of view, doesn't it create local risk? So take whiplash in the U.K. or
diﬀerent bonus systems and fraud patterns. I mean, how do you ensure that it doesn't
look good from the outside but from the inside, it's proﬁtable? And second question,
going back to the FinTech threat and why you're better. I mean, isn't scalability available
because balance sheets are available? So if you get this entrepreneurial culture, take the
hairdressing salon example, if you can create the right app with the right relationship with
your customer, you can borrow the balance sheet and underwriting expertise. So I was
wondering why you believe that you are going to be better at this than new entrants.

A - Ivan de la Sota

{BIO 19492628 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On the ACM, sorry, I don't know whether I understood you correctly.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
What he said was by driving the ACM, we might lose some sort of the discipline...

A - Ivan de la Sota

{BIO 19492628 <GO>}

Yes, yes. I don't think so. I would rather put it the other way. First of all, the idea of making
packages is, from a pricing perspective, a price eﬃcient way. We homogenize risk and we
reduce anti-selection. So the starting point is good. Then I do think that at the current
point in time, pricing, we still can build up a competitive advantage because we have the
new pricing tools, we are investing in technical excellence and the pricing that we do
have -- we can have a competitive advantage in pricing as well in risk selection. We -- not
all the companies have the possibilities to count on the customer that we have. And data
analytics are a new ﬁeld of exploiting and improving the risks, particularly the risk
selection and the underwriting that may lead at the beginning for a competitive
advantage. So I think that it is both -- it can be combined, the package perspective in
products with the right pricing.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
And so simplicity wins mean -- doesn't mean stupid simplicity. It means smart simplicity
because you hide that. You would -- for an iPhone, you would not say this is stupid. A lot
of intelligence is just built into the product. Now let's talk about the startups. We will see
how that goes. I think the scale players are more relevant. And why? Now I'll give you an

analogy, just from the German motor market. Admiral came, the best U.K. sort of direct
insurance company. And after a few years, they need to fold in and move home with their
tail between their legs. Direct Line came, set up shop, Italy, Germany that didn't move
any. Why? It's not because of lack of capital that you can access. It's not lack for
distribution access because you can pay commission and you can advertise. What you
really need to do is to have the customer franchise. But more importantly, you need to
have the infrastructure, the claims settlement network, the ability to negotiate with
distributors in order to execute. It is not about regulation. It's building a system. Think
about the competitive advantage in credit insurance. Is it about the credit risk algorithm?
No. It's about the ability to collect and deal with debt collection and building a global
network that can do that. That is what we call platform eﬀect. So do not underestimate the
power of having an integrated system that controls the most important value levers. And
that is not so easy to replicate.

Okay. And we have Thomas over there, please.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Thomas Seidl from Bernstein. Three questions on the Slide C15 on M&A. On the left-hand
side, strategic ﬁt. Last time, I think we spoke -- in '16, you talked about upscaling in P&C in
countries where you are already strong and buying in asset management for skill. And I
look at it now, it seems like a broadening. Is this right? Are you broadening the scale
here? First question. Secondly, on valuation, you talked about the hurdle being cost of
equity. At the same time, you maintain the RoE target, which is a couple of percentage
points higher. Does that imply that you cannot do a large M&A, which is RoE dilutive? And
thirdly, can you remind us on the LTIP? What is the lower boundary on the RoE for your
LTIP and what is the weight in the LTIP of the RoE?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

I'm -- coming from the scope, no, I don't think we are changing necessarily the scope.
That's not what we are saying with the slides about the strategic ﬁt. So we are pretty clear
that Property/Casualty is where we have most of the focus. Then Life, depends what kind
of Life you're talking about. But clearly, we're not looking to capital-intensive Life
businesses. For sure, in asset management, we are deﬁnitely looking whether there are
bolt-on acquisitions possibility, which is what we said also in the press. So there is no
change in this philosophy. With respect to the RoE, yes, you are right. If the RoE target is
13% plus, that's a little bit of a constraint on some large acquisition because there is a
diﬀerence in reality. Economically, at the end of the day, you need to be the cost of equity
over buyback. And then the EPS is going to reﬂect that. In order to keep the RoE is a
diﬀerent story because you need to be -- you cannot dilute too much the RoE of the
group. So that's sort of constraint. And I would also add that I would always anywhere
remove restructuring expenses, all these kind of things from the initial calculations. So I
would always look anyway at the full earnings as opposed to take into consideration also
for when we only adjust one-oﬀ in the ﬁrst years. And the last question, I don't understand
what is the LTIP or whatever. So I don't understand.

Your long-term incentive plan?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay. And what is included in the -- yes.

FINAL

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

A lower hurdle on the RoE and what is the weight in the LTIP because it's not clear from
your annual report.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

I don't know.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
I'll make it simple, then we take it oﬀ-line with Oliver. We have the same incentives
internally that we have externally.

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

We can follow up on this, Thomas. I can give you all the details, no problem.

And by the way, we will, over the next year, change top management compensation and
move in much more to shareholder-oriented compensation than it is today. Today, it's
only 25%. That is actually the relevant observation. The relevant observation is 25% and
it's going to go up in importance signiﬁcantly. We can't talk about it now because it goes
through increasing -- internal agreement. But that's a relevant one. I think it's not the
hurdle that is important. I would like to talk one thing again about -- that you have
mentioned before, the large dilutive deal. That is the question sort of on top of the
question of Michael. Large dilutive deals, we do not do. Is that a better answer, Michael?

A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Thank you. Okay. We are almost -- time is almost up. We do have time for a couple of
more questions. But please keep in mind that there will be the opportunity for informal
talks over lunch as well. But yes, Michael, in the back.

Q - Michael Hermann Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Michael Haid, Commerzbank. Just one question. When I look at your operational targets,
then the combined ratio of 93%, I think it's an ambitious, it's a very brave target. It shows
probably the power of the organization. When I look at your Life and Health target and
your business margin, above 3%, you are already at 3.5% or close to 3.5%. Why are you so
cautious here? Do you expect a change in the business mix? Or is the 3.5% as good as it
gets? Why are you so -- compared to the other targets, asset management, P&C, it seems
a rather cautious target.

FINAL

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yes. We're not expecting any signiﬁcant change in business mix. So it's not just an
indication that we expect some pressure. We just say, once the new business margin is
above 3%, at that point in time, we are looking more for growth as opposed to necessarily
try to lift new business margin even higher toward 4%. So if you ask me what we are going
to see, we are going to see a new business margin under this condition, which is going to
be more or less the new business margin of 3.5% that we are seeing now. And then the
idea is to pick up growth instead of try to get a new business margin to be higher. So just
look at this higher than 3% is almost a threshold we don't want to fall below. But the
expectation is to see new business margin at the current level also for the planning
period.

A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Is that good enough? Okay. We have time for 1 or 2 last questions, if there are any. If not,
we say thank you very much for being here, for your attention. And let's continue our
discussion over lunch. Thank you.

A - Oliver BÃ¤te
