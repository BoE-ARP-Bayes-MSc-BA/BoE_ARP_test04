Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2013 earnings call of Everest Re
Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks
and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice
President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.

Beth Farrell

{BIO 19732216 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to Everest Re Group's Fourth Quarter and full-year
2013 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the
company's President and Chief Executive Officer, John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting
Officer, and Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer.
Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include
extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note
that statements made during today's call which are forward-looking in nature, such as
statements about projections, estimates, expectations, and the like, are subject to various
risks.
As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations.
Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection
with such statements.

FINAL

Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Thanks, Beth. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. We are
very pleased to report record earnings for the Fourth Quarter and the year. There were
many elements of our portfolio that performed very well, and others less so. However,
with over $1.3 billion in earnings and a 20% ROE, it is a great result overall.
Certainly a factor was the absence of any major catastrophe, but it is worth noting that
the year was not without losses. In fact, there were $195 million, or ($178 million)
(corrected by company after the call) net, of cat losses during the year.
Growth by diversification, with a 21% or $900 million growth in premium during 2013,
enabled the company to absorb a reasonable level of loss events while still expanding
margins. New products and growth in many of our traditional lines have all contributed to
the margin expansion.

Bloomberg Transcript

Growth in our core businesses was noted in treaty casualty, treaty property, facultative,
and specialty insurance lines. In particular, our property strategy continues to be fluid,
meaning that we allocate our capacity to those products offering the best return profile.
This translates into more primary insurance and some additional pro rata in the US
reinsurance segment.
As cat XOL rates were trending down, we have been shifting to a different product mix.
We are moving capacity to the better price layers. The ability to adapt and react quickly to
changing market conditions remains a core competency of the Everest team.
The continued management of our portfolio mix resulted in a 4 point improvement in the
combined ratio to 81%. All of this improvement came in the reinsurance portfolio.
On the other hand, our insurance business underperformed relative to our expectations.
Crop losses and prior-period development overshadowed many underlying
improvements in this business.
Excluding crop, the underlying accident year combined ratio improved to 94.6% in 2013.
John and Craig will go into further details, but in summary, the crop losses were primarily
due to a significant decline in the price of corn. Our estimate at the end of the Third
Quarter did not sufficiently take into account yield factors, which were unknown at that
time, in our largest states.
The loss development we continued to see was in lines of business that are some of the
most difficult to assess, as can be observed generally in the industry. In fact, much of the
development we saw emerged on business we had terminated several years ago.

FINAL

The good news was that our overall reserve position was redundant and, therefore, this
specific development had no impact on overall earnings. We continue to feel confident
about our overall reserve position, but recognize that any one of our numerous reserve
buckets could prove inadequate while at the same time many others will result in savings.
That is the nature of the estimation process within our portfolio of reserves. Key is the
overall adequacy.
Let me finish up with some commentary on the overall market. As many observers point
out, there are many challenges that we face, nothing new, of course, to those of us who
have been around a while. Today's headline topics are declining rates and capital markets
invasion. Throw on top of that a low investment yield environment, and you have a recipe
for lower overall returns to the industry. The key is, of course, not to get your company
stuck in the averages. Our performance has been anything but.
Yes, US cat XOL rates were down in 2013 and at 1/1, they were down in the 10% to 15%
range. However, this view of the market and how it applies to us is too binary or onedimensional. These factors are just a slice of the market.

Bloomberg Transcript

In other parts of the world, particularly in loss affected areas, rates were up, and in many
other regions, rates were flat. In addition, primary pricing is still holding, and we access
this business through our direct insurance platform, facultative operations, and through
pro rata deals in the reinsurance portfolio. Other examples include new products.
As I mentioned previously, we have and will continue to deploy capacity to those areas
and others, including new products, that provide the best risk-adjusted returns. Yes, the
capital markets is a factor but, frankly, we see it as a tool, not a threat. John will speak to
that when he discusses our facility which, for us, is another form of capital that can be
used to deliver well-underwritten products.
Nevertheless, capital markets is not a perfect fit for all risks, and this is where company
capital can be deployed to new products and risks not well-suited to a capital market
structure. The world is changing, as it always has. It is how one adapts that determines if
you can beat the averages. Our business plan and strategy anticipates that we can
continue to replicate similar returns to what you have seen over the last two years.
Thank you, and now Craig will cover the financial results followed by John Doucette, our
Chief Underwriting Officer, for the operations review. Craig?

Thank you, Dom. Good morning, everyone.
We are pleased to report that Everest had a record quarter of earnings with net income
of $365 million, or $7.54 per diluted common share. This compares to net income of $59
million or $1.13 per share for the Fourth Quarter of 2012. Net income includes realized
capital gains and losses.

FINAL

For the year, Everest had record net income of $1.3 billion, or $25.44 per share, compared
to $829 million, or $15.79 per share, in 2012. The 2013 result represents a return on equity
of 19.5%.
Operating income for the year was $1.1 billion, or $21.47 per share. This represents a 58%
increase over operating income of $13.62 per share last year. These results were driven
by a $480 million increase in underwriting income, representing a 185% increase yearover-year.
As you will hear from John Doucette, there are a number of strategic initiatives that are
driving these improved results. This increase in underwriting income was partially offset by
higher income taxes and lower net investment income compared to 2012.
The results continue to reflect the improvement in the overall current-year attritional
combined ratio, which has declined a full 4 points from 85.0% to 81.0% for the year. This
measure excludes the impact of catastrophes, reinstatement premiums, and prior-period
loss development.

Bloomberg Transcript

The total reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 75.5% for the year compared to
80.9% in the prior year. The insurance segment attritional combined ratio was 101.4% for
the year compared to 100.9% in the prior year. However, removing the crop results, which
show a 94.6% attritional combined ratio for the insurance segment, compared to 97.2% in
2012.
All segments reported increases in premium volume for the year and all reinsurance
segments reported underwriting gains for the year. Total reinsurance reported an
underwriting gain of $390 million for the quarter compared to a $48 million underwriting
loss last year. For the year, total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $877 million
compared to a $327 million gain last year.
The insurance segment reported an underwriting loss of $156 million for the quarter
compared to a loss of $46 million last year. For the year, the insurance segment reported
an underwriting loss of $147 million compared to a loss of $68 million in 2012. The 2013
results reflected prior-period reserve development and a crop loss for the year. John will
discuss the crop insurance results in more detail.
Mt. Logan Re's financial position and operating results were consolidated into Everest
beginning July 1, 2013. These results were included in a separate segment and reflected a
$9 million underwriting gain for 2013. Everest retained $3 million of income and $6 million
was attributable to the noncontrolling interests of this entity.
The overall underwriting gain for the group was $238 million for the quarter compared to
an underwriting loss of $94 million in the same period last year. For 2013, the underwriting
gain was $739 million compared to a gain of $259 million in 2012. These results reflect $30
million of current-year catastrophe losses in the Fourth Quarter of 2013 related to
Typhoon Fitow, compared to $325 million of cats in the Fourth Quarter of 2012 related to

Page 4 of 20

Sandy. For the year, catastrophe losses were $195 million in 2013 compared to $410 million
in 2012.

FINAL

Our reported combined ratio was 84.5% for the year 2013 compared to 93.8% in 2012.
On reserves, we completed our annual loss reserve studies. The results of the studies
indicated that overall reserves remained adequate.
In the Fourth Quarter, we booked prior-year development in the insurance segment,
which was more than offset by favorable development in the reinsurance segment. The
$125 million of prior-year reserve development in the insurance segment is largely related
to workers compensation, construction liability, and umbrella business. The construction
liability and umbrella were programs the company discontinued several years ago.

Bloomberg Transcript

The $142 million of favorable prior-year development in the reinsurance segments mostly
related to treaty casualty and treaty property business both in the United States and
internationally. These redundancies have developed over time, but we don't react until
the position becomes more mature. We continue to hold our estimates for the more
recent years.
For investments, pretax investment income was $126 million for the quarter and $549
million for the year on our $16.6 billion investment portfolio. Both the quarter and the year
investment income amounts were below last year, as anticipated. This result was primarily
driven by the low interest rate environment, a decline in Limited Partnership income, and
the amount of cash flow used for share buybacks and the redemption of debt.
However, our investment strategy to diversify into high-yield bonds and dividend paying
stocks enabled us to exceed our planned investment income for the year. The increased
allocation to equities was also a benefit to net income as the year reflected $197 million of
net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $114 million last year. These gains are
mainly attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio.
On income taxes, the effective tax rate is primarily driven by low lower than planned
catastrophe losses in the year, resulting in higher than expected tax able income for the
year. The 2013 operating income effective tax rate was 14.9%. This 14.9% effective tax rate
for the year is in line with our expectations and year with much lower than planned cat
losses, as mentioned last quarter.
Strong cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $1.1 billion for the year compared
to $695 million in 2012. This is primarily due to our premium growth and lower catastrophe
loss payment.
As you previously heard, Mt. Logan Re successfully completed its initial capital raise and
now has over $360 million of assets under management. This serves to validate Mt.
Logan's business model as investors recognize the value proposition of partnering up
with a leading global brand insurer.

FINAL

Shareholders equity for the group was $7 billion at the end of 2013, up 3.5% compared to
the $6.7 billion balance at year-end 2012. This is after taking into account capital return
from $622 million of share buybacks and $107 million of dividends paid in 2013. The
company announced a 56% increase in its regular quarterly dividend and paid $0.75 per
share in the Fourth Quarter.
Additionally, we repurchased another $28 million of stock after the year-end close. These
purchases will be reflected in the First Quarter 2014 financial statements.
Book value per share increased 12% to $146.57 from $130.96 at year-end 2012. Our strong
capital position leaves us with capacity to maximize our potential business opportunities
as well as continued share repurchases.
Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide the operations review.

Thank you, Craig. Good morning.

Bloomberg Transcript

As Dom highlighted, we had a solid Q4, finishing a successful year. Our group 2013 gross
written premium was $5.2 billion, up $908 million from 2012, with growth coming from all
segments of reinsurance and insurance.
For our reinsurance segments, total reinsurance gross written premium was up 21% in
2013 with new opportunities globally, and all reinsurance segments had increasing gross
written premium led by our US reinsurance segment, up 38%.
We benefited both from a continued flight to quality and Everest being one of the leading
US domestic property reinsurers. With over 50% of the global property cat premium
emanating from the US, this is an important sustainable competitive advantage for
Everest. We write US cat business from the US with the ability to seamlessly provide
capacity in any form, excessive loss, pro rata, pro risk, all underwritten by the same
underwriting team.
We grew topline on several attractively priced treaties with clients seeking capacity
exclusively from domestic traditional reinsurers. In particular, we wrote several large multiline treaties with US regional companies, a targeted market for us.
Total reinsurance bottom line had a $549 million improvement in underwriting profits for
the year to $877 million, benefiting from the successful rollout of new product initiatives
such as PURPLE, Everest's pillared product, increased capacity to property pro rata deals
where we saw improving original pricing, terms, and conditions, and new credit related
opportunities in multiple places.
Globally, we saw the benefit of Mt. Logan Re in 2013 as we chose to deploy larger lines on
deals we like and increase our cat capacity for key clients. Logan allowed us to manage

FINAL

our net PMLs while growing our topline. And having additional flexible capital management
dials such as Logan gives us more flexibility to manage our PMLs before wind season. As
Dom said, we view capital markets more as a tool than a true competitor.
In several cases, providing clients with more property capacity resulted in securing better
signings on deals we wanted in other classes. As a leading global multi-class reinsurer, we
have the ability and expertise to underwrite all lines of P&C business. This is important to
note, as less than 25% of our overall business is property catastrophe related.
We wrote several new crop reinsurance and weather deals globally and in these
performed well in 2013. We continue to develop capabilities here and if view weather and
agriculture as long-term, strategic core competencies.
In 2013, we also wrote some large quota shares, both internationally and in the US, across
various lines. These were strategic transactions with some large global clients. The
premium on these deals has not yet been fully reflected in earnings.

Bloomberg Transcript

We continue to execute on several large one-off transactions from new and existing
clients, which require significant reinsurance structuring and capabilities; the ability to
combine underwriting skill sets across multiple lines of business; manuscript policy
wording expertise; and global capabilities with multiple jurisdictional expertise and paper.
We can bring all of this to bear and our ability to execute nimbly and in size with a highly
rated balance sheet has been a key differentiator in this competitive market.
Globally, we deployed more fac capacity, increasing shares on well rated program and
enhancing our product offering to our fac and treaty clients.
To summarize, we are a leading, global, multi-line reinsurer, and we have the culture and
organizational structure to react quickly to changing market dynamics and identify
strategic opportunities that can enhance the long-term franchise of the Group.
Now, turning to insurance operation, our premium grew by $195 million in 2013, primarily
driven by crop, workers' comp, nonstandard auto, property E&S, and casualty. However,
insurance calendar year results underperformed, as Craig indicated, driven by prior-year
loss development and a difficult US crop season. The result was an underwriting loss of
$147 million.
Our crop insurance had an underwriting loss of $57 million in Q4, resulting in an
underwriting loss of $68 million in 2013. This was driven by falling commodity prices,
particularly corn, as well as final crop yields that were lower than we originally expected
and even what we expected a quarter ago.
We saw crop yields all below average in some areas where we have a large footprint,
such as southern Minnesota due to excess moisture, and in Texas, due to abnormally dry
conditions in the areas we write in.

FINAL

We anticipate improved underwriting results in our crop book in 2014 as we continue to
build out a more diversified geographic footprint, increase operating efficiencies, and roll
out new systems. As I stated earlier, ag and weather are long-term strategic focuses for
us and the crop business we write through this platform complements that well.
We have a great team at Heartland. We believe that, under more normalized
circumstances, our crop insurance book will achieve profitable growth along with our ag
and weather reinsurance products.
Our California Workers' Comp book saw 13% rate increases in 2013, continuing the
double-digit rate increases for the last several years, providing a compound rate change
of over 60% since 2009. Workers' comp writings increased $50 million, mostly from rate
increases. Our current accident year workers' comp combined ratio was in the mid-90s%.
Our nonstandard auto book grew nicely, giving broader geographic mix and economies of
scale. And our property E&S book continued to see rate increases, growing over $30
million in 2013 with additional geographic diversification.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our financial institutions book remains talk book profitable, but growth was flat, as we
remain cautious in light of increased competition. Our casualty and environmental facilities
achieved rate increases throughout 2013, and we grew these books.
Other recent insurance initiatives, including our primary A&H, Canadian insurance, and
contingency business, all continued to enhance their capabilities with new hires, new
products, and new distribution channels, and are poised for profitable growth in 2014 and
beyond.
Finally, some color on January 1 reinsurance renewals, which represents approximately
45% of our annual reinsurance premiums.
Some key themes we saw at 1/1. First, it has become a stratified reinsurance market of
haves and have-nots. Everest is solidly in the haves, and we have bound new business
opportunities, had strong signings on existing treaties, and, in some cases, differential
pricing.
Second, there has been a globalization in consolidation of treaties by several global
insurers seeking to both narrow their reinsurance panel to improve security, but also
diversify their credit exposure with a broader panel of high quality reinsurers. This has
generally been positive for companies such as Everest with strong ratings and high quality
balance sheet.
Third, we are successfully competing with and winning against nontraditional capacity
everywhere. In many instances, Everest won placements despite offering higher prices,
due to our ratings and diversified 40-year-plus franchise, the breadth of our trading
relationships with clients globally, and our ability to tailor solutions to meet the clients'

Page 8 of 20



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2014-02-06

needs and to design products that benefit from structural advantages we have over
competitors, which have all proven to be significant competitive advantages.

FINAL

Furthermore, unlike the nontraditional markets, Everest's promise to pay does not expire,
nor do we force a collateral release mechanism into products earlier than the natural
expiry of the liabilities being reinsured.
Specifically, on 1/1 renewals, casualty was challenging, especially pro rata, due to demands
for expanded terms and conditions. As a result, we did withdraw from some contracts and
deployed capacity at higher layers on others.
On the other hand, despite headlines on property conditions, we had a successful
renewal of our property portfolio globally. Net written premium for property grew by $150
million this January 1. Over all territories and all products, our property book combined
ratio increased by a couple of points at 1/1, but we still saw margin expansion across the
whole book at this renewal as we continue to grow at what we consider to be -- to still be
attractive returns.

Bloomberg Transcript

Across all classes, we grew gross reinsurance premium by $300 million, or 18% on our 1/1
reinsurance renewal book. And, our net reinsurance premium grew by 6%. We
accomplished this growth by expanding shares with existing clients on desirable treaties
or layers, writing new quotas shares at attractive terms and conditions, and increasing our
marketing of new products and deploying capacity to them.
For example, our PURPLE premium was up significantly at 1/1/2014 as our long-term clients
clearly prefer to buy this product from Everest's highly rated traditional balance sheet. The
ability to flexibly move between products has been critical to our 1/1 success. We trade
with our clients in many different products in every P&C line of business around the world.
We are not beholden to excess of loss or pro rata, nor to reinsurance, retro, or insurance.
And we will dynamically reallocate capacity to where the best risk-adjusted returns exist.
We are not restricted to any product, class, premium size, or minimum rate online. And,
we continue to roll out many new insurance and reinsurance products in 2014.
Thank you, and now back to Beth for Q&A.

In the insurance segment, I am just wondering if we could talk about what book
specifically, what year is that related to, and can you tell us, in the case of the affected
books, what is total case in IB&R that you are currently holding? Thanks.

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

FINAL

Michael, the first part of your question kind of cut out. Could you just again restate it?

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. So I was just saying the reserve development in your insurance
segment, I was just wondering. You mentioned work comp, construction, umbrella, so
could you give us some color on what accident year is that related to and, just from a
magnitude perspective, what is the total case in IB&R that you are currently holding after
development for those books?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, in the insurance segment, we have about -- we have approximately $45 million of
development in work comp, a little over $40 million in construction liability, and $17 million
in umbrella.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the construction liability and the umbrella, those are programs that we discontinued
several years ago, so that should not be something that we see in our future results.
In the workers' comp, part of the development related back to some earlier years -- the
early part of the 2000 time period when we first got into the program. And it is just a
matter of some severity and a handful of claims that we saw from the early part of the
decade.
We also, though, did see some increase in frequency of some smaller claims in the later
years, primarily in 2009, 2010, and 2011, I believe. And, in that particular case, what we
have seen in that increased frequency has been contemplated in the more recent
accident years, so our more recent accident years do reflect that increased frequency.
And, might I point out those recent most accident years are profitable. Just a second.

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

I just wanted to add that the majority of the workers' compensation adverse development
came from years before our rate increases started to kick in four years ago, and we have
been getting double-digit rate increases since then as well.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. So has that been related to case reserves, or do you still hold IBNR for those older
years?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Page 10 of 20



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2014-02-06

We still hold IBNR for those years, yes. I don't know that we have our disposal right this
minute, but it is split between case and IBNR, so you have to (multiple speakers).

FINAL

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then have you had any adverse development -- you mentioned, Dom,
recent years. Was that comp or -- I'm just curious if you have heard some commentary
about recent professional liability years. Have you seen any adverse development, either
in recent comp or recent professional liability, just to be clear?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

No, we have not seen any development in the recent years for professional liability. In
particular and as I mentioned, the comp where we saw the development on the insurance
side was really in the more recent years. It was 2009, 2010, and 2011.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Great. Thanks. And then just on the renewal comment -- this is for John. You seem pretty
optimistic about opportunities in property cat. I'm just curious. How are you thinking about
opportunities heading into midyear renewals? And, I mean, do you think that your
structure or your market position or some other differentiator is allowing you to achieve
terms and pricing that are materially better than the market? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

You are welcome. Michael, as we talked about, I think each of us talked about in a
different way in our drafted response, we do believe that we have, given our balance
sheet, given our market position, given how we access US catastrophe business, and the
ability to dynamically move between different structures around the globe, that we do
have an opportunity to get better-than-market results.
We wrote, as you may recall, we increased our quota share writings in June and July, and
we also increased quota share writings at 1/1, as well as moving -- repositioning the book
to better lines that we like at more attractive prices.

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Michael, let me add to that. In many cases, we are not necessarily going to get different
terms and conditions in market pricing, but there are unique circumstances where, with
certain clients, where we have had long-standing relationships. The terms that we do get
may be different than the market. So I wouldn't say that it is universally in every particular
offering that we get terms different than the market.
But, as John is pointing out, were those terms -- if those terms come to us and it doesn't
hit our pricing targets, then we begin to allocate our capacity into other places, whether
that be pro rata, facultative, or into the primary space. So even if terms and conditions are
at the market, we still have the ability to not take those terms and conditions and we can
move our capacity into different lines or segments.

FINAL

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning. I guess two quick follow-ups to the previous question. You had
mentioned that some of the piece was from the runoff -- some of the runoff lines. Can
you expand on that piece, or is that also related to the comp piece?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

It is not related to the comp piece. These are separate programs. As I mentioned, part of
it was construction liability, in particular one program where it was a landscapers program.
And because of the additional insured endorsement that we have on many of those
policies, what we are seeing is an increase in expense, even though you wouldn't normally
expect landscapers to be brought into a construction liability claim. But because of the
additional insured endorsement, they are being drug into those matters and it is mostly
an expense or a defense issue.
The umbrella program, again, is one that we canceled a while ago and, again, the
umbrella, as you probably know, is a very volatile class of business. And we got hit this
year with several large claims which caused us to increase our estimates in some of the
older years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

That's helpful. I guess what should give us comfort that this might be -- hopefully, this is
the last time that this noise sort of resurfaces. What would you say to that?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, I guess I would say that it is not really noise at all. We have $10 billion of reserves. We
actually reported an overall reserve redundancy coming through the numbers. And, as I
have mentioned on previous calls, we manage some 200 different reserve buckets, and
there are pluses and minuses in all of those buckets each and every year. These
estimates on these particular lines are well within the actuarial ranges. It is not anything
unusual to those of us that have been around the reserving process for a long, long time,
as I have been. But I think we are proud to point out that our overall reserve position as a
group is positive.
And our accident year development, if you go back in time for the entity, has been a
pretty stellar record relative to how each accident year is ultimately developed at the
group level. But here again, you're managing a portfolio and you have individual buckets
or lines of business that sometimes develop poorly. And, on the other hand, offsetting
that, would be lines of business that develop redundantly. That is the nature of the beast.

That's helpful. I guess the one other question, and I will reach you after this, is the
discussion on the increase in cat premiums, I guess growth on 18% and net 6%. Do you
have corresponding PML numbers which might have been updated post renewals?

FINAL

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, we can get into that detail later, but just generally, our net PMLs are up about
consistently with those premium increases we cited. It is in different regions. It doesn't
mean that is where we will end the year. As John pointed out in his comments, opening
comments, we have the ability to go into the market before wind season and change that
if we so desire.
But, right now, given our capital position, we are quite comfortable with where our PMLs
are at. And, as you probably have noted, through the years that what we carry as our net
PML for 1 in 100 and 1 in 250 are pretty conservative relative to the industry.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yes, going back a little bit on the reserving issue, I just want to understand the process
that you go through. Is there an annual reserve review that comes in the Fourth Quarter
and this is sort of how it came to be? What is the process right now at Everest Re?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

We review reserves throughout the year. Starting at the beginning of the year, though, the
reserve buckets that we review tend to be the less material buckets. And then, as we get
into the Fourth Quarter, we are evaluating our largest lines of business or largest classes
of business, beginning with the most recent data, meaning as of September timeframe. In
other words, all the claims data up through September is accumulated in order to do our
year-end reserve review. And that is the process that we have been under, at least since I
have been here in 2009.
And, if there is anything, for example, during the year that comes up with some of those
smaller classes of business, we would certainly book that into our numbers, but generally,
given the size of it, it is generally not an issue. And then, of course, the larger, more
material lines, as I mentioned, we wait until the Fourth Quarter to accumulate all those
studies. Is that what you were asking about?

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yes. And is the charges that you took, are they more prone to changing views on the
frequency or severity?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

As I mentioned, we saw both in [multiple speakers].

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

FINAL

Both. I'm sorry.

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

We saw both, but not out of the same accident periods. The more recent years, 2009,
2010, 2011, was predominantly due to frequency of smaller claims. It is hard to tell, maybe
due to economic conditions, but nevertheless, what we have done is we factored in that
increased frequency into our most accident year PIQ. So that influence is the entire
booking of all of our results. The severity that we encountered was due to business that
has since been discontinued, so there really wasn't any need to make any dramatic
adjustment for severity relative to our current book.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And, finally, in thinking about the pricing on reinsurance, going forward, do you see an
opportunity for Everest to buy more XOL coverage in midyear or even thinking about a
long-term reinsurance protection plan for the company?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

There is always that opportunity. And, as I mentioned, I think, in answer to a previous
question, and John even made some reference to it, now that 1/1 is over, we have the
opportunity between now and wind season to look at various structures. And we did put a
structure in place last year.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

That's right.

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, actually, it was a renewal last year.

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Josh, this is John. We also -- part of the reason that we decided to start Mt. Logan Re and
are very excited about that is it gives us a lot more flexibility in terms of how we position
our footprint and how we manage our capital and our cat PMLs. And with Mt. Logan Re
and other capital market initiatives, whether it is traditional reinsurance or otherwise, we
think we can flow the overall book very profitably and keep the PMLs to a level that we are
comfortable with. And it will be accretive to Everest shareholders.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Well, congratulations on a very strong quarter. Thank you.

Vinay Misquith, Evercore.

FINAL

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

The first question is on the adverse development on the construction liability and
umbrella. Curious as to what the deal on those liabilities are. So when will those programs
discontinue and so when can we see the end of these claims?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, on the construction liability area, I believe it is a seven-year period after which the
policy was issued. I don't recollect the exact date, but it was 2008 was the last policy that
was issued. I think the claims can be made in a period of seven years after that date.
We feel obviously our reserve addition was sufficient, to answer your question about
seeing the end of it, but, as you know, again, reserves can always move around, but,
again, in the context of our overall reserve posture, we don't believe it is going to be a
problem.

Bloomberg Transcript

Umbrella, on the other hand, doesn't have a fixed discovery period, if you will, so umbrella
claims can come in for a long time. Again, a volatile class, but we feel as if what we
booked is reasonably conservative. And, again, in the context of our overall reserve
position, we don't feel that either one of these classes or lines of business will present a
problem for our future financial performance.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. And when was the umbrella program discontinued?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Three or four years ago. I don't remember the exact date.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. And then, moving to crop, you said $68 million of losses. I believe
crop premiums, were they about $300 million-ish last year?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Gross. Yes.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. So, just looking at the combined ratio, that seems to be about a 122 combined ratio.
Just curious why it would be that high on crop.

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}
Page 15 of 20



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td

FINAL

Well, technical ratio was about 112 and then the rest was just expenses. But, and we are a
little higher than the industry, at least what has been reported to date, just because of
some of the concentration we have, in particular, as John mentioned, in Minnesota and
Texas being some of our largest states, which, in fact, relative to the industry, held us in
better stead last year. But, Minnesota, for example, has a long history of being a very, very
profitable state.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. And for 2014, what is the targeted combined ratio for the primary
insurance operations in total? Because I believe that, under workers comp, you said you
were reserving to the mid-90s%. The rest of the book, ex-crop, representing 94.6%. So,
looking at 2014, what is your targeted combined ratio for the primary business?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

We believe that the numbers in the low to mid 90s% would still be achievable and maybe
perhaps better, but for now, I will leave it at that.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. And one last, if I may, on the reinsurance business. I think it is changing your business
just a tad, moving to write more pro rata versus excess of loss business. Should we see
an uptick in the accident year loss ratio ex-cats because of that business mix shift?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Not necessarily. There might be an uptick in certain lines of business due to rate
movements, but also as we move the portfolio into other lines of business, particularly
new products, that is actually having the impact of lowering our attritional combined ratio.
So I am not going to give you a number at this point because we don't really give
guidance but, to be honest with you, it depends on what the final mix at the end of the
year comes in at, but we are not anticipating an increase in that number. I will leave it at
that.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Congrats on a great year and a strong quarter. I wanted to understand. I am just looking at
the profitability of the insurance segment, and it hasn't been profitable on the
underwriting side for many years. I certainly understand the reasons why this particular
year. But how do we think about net investment income allocation to this segment? Is it

Page 16 of 20



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2014-02-06

just kind of pro rata with premiums, or is there more investment income being earned out
of this book of business?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

FINAL

We don't really do a specific allocation that we could talk about in this call, but I would
think about it more in the context of a premium allocation.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Okay. So for those of us that are looking and saying, oh, they're not making any money in
underwriting, the reality is you are making, call it, $100 million-plus, probably, in investment
income as well, if you were to actually break it --

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

But our focus, quite frankly, Greg, is on the underwriting account. That is where our
attention is. And we don't rely on the investment income because, at today's yields, that
is not really giving you the appropriate return and, as I mentioned, our current year
attritionals are in very good position. And, given the way we increase it, we are continuing
to get in California comp. What we are doing in the property E&S space, our other
strategic initiatives in the insurance platform, we are quite bullish on it. So, the profitability
issues that you are seeing are things that relate to, frankly, a lot of which was discontinued
four or five years ago.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

And crop as well. Yes.

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, the crop -- and the crop in particular is -- remember, it is not -- we look at that not
unlike we look at our reinsurance catastrophe business, right. And also, even though it is
reported within the insurance segment, we have capabilities now globally. As John
somewhat mentioned in his comments, we look at weather and crop in other jurisdictions
kind of jointly. We have capabilities that we can look across the organization and how we
are doing in crop and that is part of [technical difficulty] as well, even though they are
reported in two different segments.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then turning to capital management, on the one hand, you bought back
9% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year, so it was a robust buyback in a
strong year. On the other hand, it was only 68% of capital return via buybacks and
dividends on the year. So you actually, in a way, you held back. It looks like you haven't
done much the month of January. You have done a little bit, but I'm sort of wondering.
What is -- you know, stock is below book value. What is keeping you from doing more on
the buyback front?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}
Page 17 of 20



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2014-02-06

Well, we were in January as long as we could be in the month of January. Of course, as
you know, at some point during the month, we begin to know the numbers and we are
basically restricted from being in the market. So, that is really the only thing that held us
back in the month of January.

FINAL

In the Fourth Quarter, we were buying stock even at above book value, but we couldn't
get all of the stock that we wanted at the prices that we wanted it that.
So we will continue to work. We continue to be bullish on share repurchase, balance that
up against what the market opportunities are. As has been pointed out, we had a strong
1/1. We will consider that in the upcoming 4/1 as we evaluate and price of the stock, as we
evaluate what our share repurchases will be in this quarter and the upcoming quarters.
But, I think it is fair to say that we are still very interested in share repurchases.

Q - Greg Locraf t

{BIO 4221265 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And congrats again on the year. Excellent job.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. Two quick questions, if I can. One, is there any way of ball parking,
given the growth you had at 1/1, how much more capital you think you need this year
compared to last year?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

How much more capital we need? Well, I guess if you wanted to ballpark it, you could
relate to PMLs and to premium growth.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Yes. I just wanted to know if there is any offset to that. And, second, was there any
adjustment to the accident year 2013 loss PIQ for workers' compensation in the quarter,
given the adverse development on recent years?

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

No. There was not.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Are you confident with the level of pricing that you have been implementing, let's
say, over the last six months?

FINAL

Well, our reserve numbers are -- that we pick in the most recent accident year is what I call
bridged off of the previous accident year. So, it is taking into account the experience of
those years. Plus layer on top of that rate increases that we have had. And as John
pointed out, over 60% rate increase, cumulative rate increase, since 2009. And then
subtraction from that would be assumed loss cost trends. So our most recent accident
years are a reflection of the development we have seen plus pricing.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Right. But I guess the question is that you have known the pricing for a while, but the base
on which (inaudible) seems like it would be higher.

A - Dom Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

I'm not sure I understand that question.

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

I think what has happened here as well -- this is Craig -- is that you are essentially picking a
conservative number to begin with, and we have not let that number come down just
because of the pricing that Dom was talking about. Does that help?

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}
