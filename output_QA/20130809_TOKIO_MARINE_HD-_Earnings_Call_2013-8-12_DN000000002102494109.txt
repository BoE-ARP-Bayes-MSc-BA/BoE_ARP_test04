{BIO 19269575 <GO>}

Thank you very much for the introduction. I am from Corporate Communications and
Investor Relations Group in Corporate Planning Department of Tokio Marine Holdings. I
would like to explain to you the overview of FY 2013 first quarter results of Tokio Marine
Holdings that we announced today.
We have prepared four materials to explain our financial results. First, (inaudible) report;
second, PowerPoint slides titled overview of first quarter FY 2013 results; third,
supplemental material for first quarter FY 2013 conference call and data sheets. To
download the materials, please access our website from the topics section on our home
page, I believe you can find a page where we have uploaded all the materials for this call.
For this conference call, I will give you the overview of our FY'13, first quarter results for
about 25 minutes by mainly referring to the PowerPoint slides and supplemental material
for this conference call.
Let me start with the overview of our consolidated results on page one of the PowerPoint
slide. The consolidated ordinary income of the first quarter was JPY1,009.4 billion, up by
10.1% or JPY92.3 billion year-on-year. The main reasons behind the growth are as follows:
First, net premiums written from non-life business from both inside and outside of Japan
were JPY704.7 billion, up by 12.3% or JPY77 billion year-on-year. Top line of domestic nonlife business primarily in the auto line of business increased and overseas subsidiaries
expanded their underwriting steadily, and weaker Japanese yen, a new contribution of
Delphi in the U.S. helped us grow the top line.

FINAL

Second, premium income from life business, both home and abroad, was JPY48.3 billion,
down by 42.8% or JPY36.2 billion year-on-year. Tokio Marine & Nichido Life grew their
policies in more steadily and sales of new products in Asia went well. Delphi's new
consolidation also contributed to the top line positively. However, surrender benefits and
other refunds of Tokio Marine & Nichido Financial Life increased significantly, associated
with the recovery of the domestic stock market.
As a result, consolidated premium income declined versus a year ago. Investment income
was JPY191.9 billion, up by 151.6% from JPY115.6 billion year-on-year. This is mainly because
sales gains of securities increased at Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire and Financial Life
recorded investment gains of separate accounts, thanks to the recovery of the domestic
stock market. But please note that the impact of this investment gains on security
accounts to our profit is neutral since the same amount was provided to the policy
reserves.
Next, I will discuss the consolidated ordinary profit on page two. Ordinary profit was
JPY84.5 billion, up by 65.3% or JPY33.3 billion year-on-year. Let me explain the major
changes that we observed from a year ago by business domain.

Bloomberg Transcript

Ordinary profit of domestic non-life business increased by JPY38.1 billion, mainly due to
the increase of investment income in our core operation, Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire.
Underwriting profit of Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire declined over the year, but they
received dividends from overseas subsidiaries in first quarter. And as they sold business
related equities, sales gains of securities increased. As a result, ordinary profit increased
by JPY36.3 billion to JPY75.9 billion.
Please note that most of the dividend income that they received from overseas
subsidiaries is to be eliminated on a consolidated basis. As for domestic life business, the
profit of Tokio Marine & Nichido Life declined mainly because agency commissions
increased, associated with the revenue growth, and provision for underwriting reserves
increased due to the reduction of the standard discount rate, meanwhile at Financial Life,
insurance fee income increased owning to the recovery of the domestic stock market,
owing on the ordinary profit of domestic life business increased by JPY300 million yearon-year.
Ordinary profit from international insurance business increased by JPY34.7 billion year-onyear. Overseas subsidiaries expanded their underwriting or enhancing underwriting
discipline, losses from natural catastrophes decreased from a year ago, and Delphi's
consolidation also contributed to the increase in profit.
As for consolidation adjustment, negative adjustment increased by JPY40.5 billion yearon-year. This is because dividends that Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire received from
overseas subsidiaries increased due to timing difference in quarterly recognition. And
overseas subsidiaries also posted dividend income as we established the interim holding
company in the U.S. As a result, dividends on a consolidated basis increased.

FINAL

Next, please turn to page three to talk about the consolidated net income. In line with the
growth in ordinary profit, net income of the first quarter also increased by 67.8% or
JPY22.8 billion to JPY56.5 billion. In addition to the factors that contributed to the growth
of the ordinary profit that I mentioned earlier, there was another positive factor here, that
is, unlike last year, we don't have extraordinary losses related to extra retirement benefit.
Next, I would like to give you the highlight of the performance by business. Please refer to
page four. First, here is the overview of FY'13 first quarter results of Tokio Marine and
Nichido Fire. I believe you can see arrow marks on the slide, the upward arrow indicates
positive factors to the profit and downward arrow marks negative factors. I will start with
the underwriting profit.
From this point onward, I will primarily explain the performance of the private insurance on
the left chart, please refer to the line which says private insurance. With that, I will walk you
through the major points. Net premiums written of all the private insurance went up by
4.9% or JPY20.2 billion year-on-year. The topline grew across all different lines of
business, but more importantly in the auto line. Earned premiums also increased by
JPY14.2 billion after taking into account policy reverse and contributed positively to the
topline growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

As for more details by line of business, please refer to page six later. Net incurred losses
of all private insurance increased by JPY8.4 billion. If I may amplify on this point a bit more.
First, losses incurred by natural disasters which happened during the course of this fiscal
year declined by JPY20.2 billion since we had severe storms as well as typhoon for last
year.
On the other hand, losses incurred by events other than natural disasters increased by
JPY14.3 billion due to large losses in the marine business, and increase in losses reflective
of the top line growth, also 0due to the depreciation of the Japanese yen, provision to
reserve for foreign currency denominated outstanding claims increased by JPY14.4 billion.
Next, provision for catastrophe loss reserves increased by JPy18.1 billion. Since we had
major metro cat events such severe storms last year. We had a major reversal last year.
But during the first quarter claims paid decreased and provisions for cat loss reserves
increased versus a year ago. As a result, underwriting profit in the first quarter decreased
by JPY14.5 billion to JPY3.1 billion.
Next, investment income. Interest and dividends income increased due to the timing
difference associated with the recipience of the dividends from overseas subsidiaries.
And sales gains of securities increased as we sold our business related equities. As a
result, investment income increased by JPY54.6 billion versus a year ago to JPY79.1 billion.
During the first quarter, we sold business related equities by approximately JPY28 billion
worth.
To summarize, investment income increased more than the decline in underwriting profit.
As a result, net income of the first quarter increased by JPY30.3 billion to JPY58.4 billion.

FINAL

Next, let me explain to you the combined ratio on page five. First, let me talk about the
loss ratio under written and paid basis. Mainly driven by the product in rate revision for the
auto policies, net premiums written for private insurance has grown by 4.9%. At the same
time, claims paid relating to natural catastrophes decreased, resulting in lower total claims
paid for the quarter by JPY4.9 billion compared to last year.
In sum, written and paid basis, loss ratio for the private insurance improved by 4.1% to
58.8%. Let me also discuss about the loss ratio on earned incurred basis, which for this
quarter improved by 0.1% to 61.7%. This is mainly attributable to the weaker yen, more
provisioning in the reserves where outstanding claims caused by large losses and the
lower net incurred loss related to natural disasters. The earned incurred basis loss ratio
for the auto insurance improved by 1.5% to 64.2%. To a certain extent, the number of
claims filed is on a declining trend, particularly for the policies covering for vehicle damage
liabilities. The frequency of accidents has come down, but the unit claims cost continues
to rise mainly for the policies covering the equal and property damage liabilities.
Now, let me go back to the written and paid basis combined ratio and touch upon the
expense ratio. The expense ratio improved by 0.4% to 32.1%. Thanks to the companywide efforts to return the non-personnel expenses and the growth in net premiums
written. As a result, the combined ratio improved by 4.5% year-on-year to 19.9%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Page six illustrates the net premiums written and loss ratio by respective lines and page
seven gives us the details of the asset management side of the business. Please take a
look at your convenient time.
Next on page eight, let me talk about the outlook of Nisshin Fire. The underwriting profit
Nisshin Fire improved by 1.20 billion.
The smaller net incurred loss mainly for natural catastrophies and lower expenses help to
grow the profit but the provisioning cost for cat loss reserves increased. Net investment
profit grew by 700 million to JPY600 million mainly due to the reversal effect of the
impairment loss booked last fiscal year. Net income for the quarter increased by 1 billion
to a 0 mainly due to the reversal effect of gains from the drawdown of price fluctuation
reserves on the extraordinary lines.
Now let's move on to Tokio Marine & Nichido Life on page nine. Let me explain the
annualized premium or ANP to show you the business trend for the life business. The
graph shows the trend of the ANP. This quarter we continued to enjoy high growth for the
new policies at the first sector insurance and individual annuities marks topline growth.
The sales momentum is brisk for Medical Kit R, a new product launched in January 2013.
Overall, the new policies ANP grew by 36.5% year-on-year, in-force policies ANP also
grew by 2.6% year-on-year, thanks to the steady build of new policies.
Next, let me go through the financial accounting figures. The ordinary income was up by
23 billion to JPY167.7 billion driven by higher premium income, thanks to the steady
increase of policies in-force. The insurance premiums and other income grew by 18 billion

Page 4 of 14



Company N ame: Tokio M arine H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8766 JP Equity
Date: 2013-08-09

to JPY141.1 billion, thanks to the zero expansion of the policies in-forced as already
explained.

FINAL

Although the insurance premium and other income grew, the agency commissions also
increased associated with the topline growth and so did the provision for underwriting
reserves due to the revision on standard interest rate. As a result, the net income for the
quarter was down by 1.7 billion year-on-year to JPY1.1 billion.
Lastly, let me talk about the overseas business. Please turn to page 10. The explanation of
the overseas business will be comprehensive, including the figures for Tokio Marine &
Nichido Fire services branches equity affiliated companies, non-consolidated overseas
entities following our disclosure criteria with the IR presentation materials to date. Net
premiums written for the quarter was up by 61% year-on-year to JPY258.3 billion, thanks
to the organic growth as well as the contributions stemming from consolidating Delphi
and weakening of the yen.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, let me go through the figures by each business domain. The net premiums written
for Philadelphia was up by 29%, thanks to increasing new policies in raising the rate at the
time of policy renewal. Delphi was consolidated from the third quarter of fiscal 2012. And
for the quarter under review, the new revenue contribution from the Delphi consolidation
was JPY48 billion.
Kiln enjoyed a 13% growth, thanks mainly to expanding the underwriting of Marine and
specialty policies. In Latin America, the top line increased by 42%, mainly boosted by the
robust sales of the core auto policies in Brazil. In Asia, revenue grew by 49% driven by the
growth of personal auto business in major countries and the acquisition of additional
shares of the subsidiary in Thailand.
Top line for the reinsurance business was up by 40% due to the increase in underwriting
the non-natural catastrophe business.
Next, let me talk about the adjusted earnings on page 11. The adjusted earnings for the
insurance business was up by JPY27.4 billion year-on-year to 39.4 billion, mainly due to the
decrease in natural catastrophe losses, the progress of the various growth measures and
the profit contribution of Delphi.
Let me break it down to each business domain. The adjusted earnings for Philadelphia
grew by JPY3.3 billion due to the brisk top line growth and lower natural catastrophe
losses. For Delphi, as was the case with the net premiums written and the contributions
through new consolidation was JPY7.9 billion . In North America, the adjusted earnings was
down by JPY2.7 billion due to the Tornado in January. Kiln's adjusted earnings grew by
JPY4.6 billion due to the lower natural catastrophe losses and foreign exchange gains on
the dollar denominated assets, thanks to the weaker sterling pound.
In Asia, the profit was up by JPY12.1 billion, thanks to the earnings growth for the property
in auto business in Malaysia, Thailand and others as well as a change in reserves related
to the Thai flood. Profit for the reinsurance business grew by JPY600 million due to the
Page 5 of 14

expansion of a non-natural catastrophe business and foreign exchange gains stemming
from the weaker pound.
This will conclude my presentation. And now I'd be happy to take your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you very much, Mr. Sasaki. And we would now like to start the Q&A session. And for
overseas participants, please bear with us for a while as operator is announcing to the
participants from Japan as to how to place their questions. We thank you for your
patience. The first question is from Ms. Tsujino from J. P. Morgan.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. With regards to overseas subsidiaries dividend, part of which has been paid to
the interim holdings company and what is the amount of that dividend? Last year it didn't - there wasn't any holdings companies in the US. So how much was paid to the interim
holding company in the US? That is my first question.
And also with regards to the reinsurance, I believe that you talked about increasing the
underwriting business from May or so in the US. Cat loss rate has decreased by 10% to
15%. However, when it comes to commercial business in the US, I think that has been up
45%. So on a net basis, I would assume, I wonder whether there has been any negative
impact to your company's business. I have a little concern about that. So what is the case
and how do you intend to address this issue?

A - Unidentified Speaker
My name is Nivata [ph] from Corporate Accounting department. With regards to your first
question on the amount of dividend that has been paid by our overseas subsidies to our
internal holding in the first quarter of FY 2012 about JPY4 billion and in the first quarter -in the first quarter of this fiscal year 2013 it's about JPY20 billion. And so it's an increase of
about JPY16 billion.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

Okay. So JPY58.2 billion is the ordinary profit of the overseas subsidiaries in total. And in
this -- according to the supplementary material for this conference call and you're saying
that it is an increase of JPY30.7 billion. So JPY16.7 billion is essentially the increased
contributed by the overseas subsidiaries?

A - Unidentified Speaker
That's correct. Yeah.

Yes. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Unidentified Speaker
My name is Moriyama [ph] from Overseas Business development. With regards to your
second question around the reinsurance, let me answer the question. As you correctly
pointed out, globally, reinsurance cat risk market is seeing an oversupply of capacity at the
moment and so as you correctly pointed out in June, July period when the renewals were
made, the renewal rates were clearly fastening.
And as far as our company is concerned, particularly its impact to our Overseas
Reinsurance business where we are assuming risks, while we believe that there will be a
certain negative impact to our company's business going forward at this point in time
though, we are still securing certain level of profit and therefore, we will continue to
monitor the situations around our competitors and then we will cautiously and carefully
expand our underwriting business.
And in particular, the diversification of risk as well as the diversification of our portfolio
have been a major focus for us so that we also expand our underwriting (inaudible) I hope
that I answered your question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

So, how much impact are you assuming to your business. I guess that it is difficult for you
to quantify at this point in time and I'm sure that you're trying to minimize the impact to
your business. So maybe in and after the second quarter of this fiscal year, do you think
that you have clear visibility as to how big the impact will be?

A - Shiro Sasaki

{BIO 19269575 <GO>}

Yes, exactly. For the time being, we have been working to assume more risks other than
natural cat risks in order to diversify our portfolio furthermore. So we would continue to do
so going forward. So as you completed June and July period, we understand that you
have been able to acquire certain level of business we have been able to secure a certain
profit. Yes, well we are checking the actual risks that are associated with the new business.
We are not trying to stretch ourselves too much at the top line growth. Thank you.

The next question is from Wataru Otsuka from Nomura.

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

Hello, my name is Nomura from -- my name is Otsuka first Nomura. My first question is
about the Domestic P&C business for Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire on page four and five,
for this part of the business, it's in Q1, so I guess there will be some deviations, but in the
underwriting profit you have JPY3.1 billion and combined ratio underwritten paid basis is
Page 7 of 14



Company N ame: Tokio M arine H oldings I nc

Date: 2013-08-09

90.9%, you're seeing some improvement. And for your full year target at this level, how
do you assess the progress? That's my first question.

FINAL

And the second question is on page seven. This is on Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire again,
for the investment profit, you have a footnote about the, our exposure to the City Detroit
and a further portion in Q1 result, what kind of impact overseas served [ph] from your
exposure to Detroit?

A - Unidentified Speaker
I am the Corporate Accounting Department. My name is (inaudible) from Tokio Marine &
Nichido Fire. Let me answer you first question. About the underwriting profit this quarter
was JPY3.1 billion. And if you look at combined ratio it's 90.9%. And for the main auto
business, the loss ratio has been improving and our topline compared to our expectations
has been progressing very steadily.
And this is still in Q1 and we will be entering the peak season for typhoon and now we
cannot have a good visibility of the losses related to natural catastrophies. And also the
currency impact is something that we cannot forecast accurately. So if you take out the
special factors, we believe that the business is progressing in par -- on par with our
expectations.

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you.

A - Unidentified Speaker
My name is (inaudible) from Financial Planning Department. Let me answer your question
about Detroit exposure. Regarding Detroit, as far -- our exposure we have roughly JPY10
billion and 20% of that is general obligation bond. See, going forward if there is a default
then our number should be impacted, but the impact will not be material to our P&L.

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

And if that's the case, in Q1 you did not book anything from the Detroit exposure?

A - Unidentified Speaker
That is correct.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

FINAL

On page 11 on international subsidiaries, let me ask a question. This time around the Asia,
in Europe, there are some changes related to the Thai floods and also the foreign
currency conversion impact to the Q. How much were they respectively? And also on a full
year basis JPY30 billion to JPY35 billion natural cat losses relating to (inaudible) Japan
before tax, about how much was it in the first quarter?
And my next question is related to Tokio Marine & Nichido Life. Compared to our peers, I
believe that the profit in your life business actually look somewhat weaker at Tokio Marine
& Nichido Life, I think the new policy acquisition has been better than others, and
therefore, I think that business expense has increased by about JPY3 billion or so.
However, when it comes to capital gains, I think that actually deteriorated quite
significantly. So what is the background behind it? And when it comes to the policy reserve
related to -- policy reserves denominated in foreign currencies that also seems to be
deteriorating. So what's the factor behind it?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Unidentified Speaker
My name is (inaudible) from International Business Development Division. With regards to
your first question on international business, I believe that your question with regard to
the special factors related to specifically the reserve in conjunction with the Thai floods in
Asia. During the first quarter the impact was JPY5 billion . And with regards to the
conversion gains and losses occurred, in yen term, the impact to our profit was about
JPY2.5 billion. And with regards to the losses incurred by natural cat events, as Mr. Sasaki
mentioned earlier, in the US, in Georgia, there was tornado and in the first quarter there
was JPY3.6 billion impact coming from natural cat events. I hope it answered your
questions.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

With regards to 5 billion -- 2.5 billion and JPY3.6 billion are they all after tax?

A - Unidentified Speaker
They are all before tax, before tax.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

Okay, understood. Thank you.

A - Unidentified Speaker
My name is Yamada [ph] from Corporate Accounting Investment from Tokio Marine &
Nichido Life. Let me address your second question with regards to the deterioration of
capital gains and losses of derivatives. As the interest rates went up for ALM purpose, we
have fixed rate derivatives and the valuation losses of those derivatives were posted,
that's the reason behind the deterioration.

Page 9 of 14



Company N ame: Tokio M arine H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8766 JP Equity
Date: 2013-08-09

FINAL

And with regards to policy reserve denominated in foreign currencies, because we are
doing ALM, we have policy reserves denominated in foreign currencies, and of course,
with the weaker Japanese yen, of course, that we do actually have to provide more to the
account. And that essentially offsets the benefit that the weaker Japanese yen brings to
us and therefore its impact to our profit is essentially neutral.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

So in a nutshell, in terms of the profit of Tokio Marine & Nichido Life, if the interest rate
goes up, then that actually decreases your profit, is that right?

A - Unidentified Speaker
Right. However, we are implementing ALM appropriately while monitoring the interest
rate move. And therefore, on a full year basis, there shouldn't be any major negative
impact to our profit.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

So on a full year basis you will be -- you believe that you will be able to enjoy some gains,
sales gains to bonds and do you think that would offset the negative impact?

A - Unidentified Speaker

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, rather than that we would closely monitor the interest rate movement as we do ALM
and I don't think that we will actually see much fluctuation on the profit because we have
solid underlying performance in terms of underwriting business.
My name is (inaudible) once again from international business development. I earlier
mentioned that -- the numbers that I mentioned earlier were all before tax. But let me
make a re-statement, I said JPY5 billion is the impact of the Thai flood event, that is after
tax. So that is the impact to our adjusted earnings.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

And when it comes to the numbers for Q1 in natural cat, are these numbers before tax?

A - Unidentified Speaker
That's correct.

Q - Masao Muraki

Okay, understood. Thank you very much.

Company N ame: Tokio M arine H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8766 JP Equity
Date: 2013-08-09

I have two questions. The first one is for the domestic P&C business on the loss ratio. In
the data book, you have the net earned incurred basis loss ratio, excluding natural
catastrophes for the full year line. The loss ratio is increasing. This is because of the
impact from the currency for the reserves, as well as foreign denominated outstanding
balances, outstanding claims. Can you tell me the impact of that? And for the auto
product sales, loss ratio is coming down, and I think in October last year, we revised the
credit rating system. I think operationally, there is an impact from that change. So can you
give me details on that as well?
Earlier you mentioned that the claims -- unit claims cost is increasing, still increasing. And
can you tell me the impact of the annual credit rating system on the unit claims cost as
well?
And the second question is on the equity holdings. The sales I think is progressing
relatively faster than we are expecting, if you have a full year target of how much you like
to sell this year. Please give us some numbers.

A - Unidentified Speaker

Bloomberg Transcript

I am (inaudible) from the Accounting Department of Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire. The
earned incurred basis loss ratio on the full year is deteriorating and the main factor is
because of the reserves for foreign currency denominated outstanding claims as you
mentioned. The impact of that is approximately JPY4 billion. And apart from that, for the
losses from the factories, last year, it was relatively small. So the increase this year is
about 1 billion to 2 billion. So those two factors are the main reason behind the
deterioration on the loss ratio for fire on earned incurred basis.
My name is Yivayoma [ph] from our Personal business. The auto business improved by
1.5%. In October, we had the credit rating system revised and that had an impact on the
growth of our top line. And as Mr. Sasaki mentioned earlier, with the credit rating system,
the number of claims found is on a declining trend. The claims frequency is stabilizing and
that new credit rating system is showing some positive impact. And the question about
the inner claims cost, as you mentioned, the credit claims have been coming down. So
that means in terms of the claims mix, the -- claims cost (inaudible) but we are
incorporating such trend in our plan. So we can say that the situation is on par with our
expectations.

Q - Jun Shiota

{BIO 4127431 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Next, regarding the business related equities. Let me -- my name is (inaudible) from
financial planning department. In our medium-term plan, we're saying that we would like
to sell about JPY100 billion per year and this is the second year on the other plan and we
plan to sell about JPY100 billion from our equity holdings.

Page 11 of 14



Company N ame: Tokio M arine H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8766 JP Equity
Date: 2013-08-09

So if you divide it by the four quarters, that would be 25 billion per quarter, but we saw 28
billion, so it's a little bit higher than the quarterly numbers, but our full year target is
roughly JPY100 billion, so that's the target that we are trying to achieve.

FINAL

Q - Jun Shiota

{BIO 4127431 <GO>}

So in that sense, in the capital gains and losses, for the first quarter it's in line with your
plan, is that the correct understanding?

A - Unidentified Speaker
Well, the equity market is improving, so we're enjoying some incremental gains.

Q - Jun Shiota

{BIO 4127431 <GO>}

Thank you.

Operator
There seems to be no question at this point. The next question is from Mr. Sasaki from
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

My name is Sasaki. Thank you very much for this opportunity. On page 10 and also 11 in the
handout material, I would like to ask you two questions. On page 10, you have your Asian
contribution here and you talked about the impact of the increase in shares in Thai
subsidiary, and how much did it impact your topline in Asian business? That is my first
question.
And secondly, with regards to the insurance business, topline grew by JPY10.6 billion;
however, the profit increased by only JPY600 million. So I'm getting the impression that
maybe underwriting profitability is deteriorating against the topline growth? Why the profit
growth is the small? Is there any particular reasons shall I should be mindful of ? These are
my two questions. Thank you.

A - Unidentified Speaker
My name is (inaudible) from International Business Development Division. With regards to
your first question on the topline growth in Thailand, we, yes, increased our shares in Thai
subsidiary and that provided about JPY3 billion positive impact to our topline.
And with regards to your question on reinsurance, on particularly adjusted earnings, in the
UK, we have a subsidiary company and at that subsidiary, because of the weaker Sterling,
the currency conversion losses were incurred and so the topline and also the combined
ratios are actually performing differently from what we are actually seeing on the profit
level. So number-wise, it looks somewhat distorted. But when you look at the underlying
performance, please note that the underwriting results or loss ratios are actually
deteriorating.

the reserves for the reinsurance?

And if I may ask you just one follow-up question, particularly in Brazil, it seems that
economic outlook is being changing according to what I hear. In the first quarter it seems
that your business performed quite well. What about the second quarter onward? What is
your expectation of your business in Latin American countries?

A - Unidentified Speaker

business, sales went very well and we believe that this trend is going to stay -- is here to
stay going forward.

Okay, thank you very much. Thank you.

Operator
Okay. The next question is from (inaudible).

Q - Unidentified Participant
In your supplementary order book, for the other income, you have consolidated
elimination, it's a negative 36.8 billion. And you mentioned about the dividend paid to the
interim company of 16 billion. Of the remaining JPY20 billion, is that the increase in
dividend which is received by Tokio Marine Holdings or are there any other factors behind
this elimination?
And my second question is that earlier you talked about the impact of the Thai flood. The
claims payment I believe was about JPY4 billion. And I think you are reversing other
reserves to offset that. And if the amount is around that level. You probably do not need
to draw down on your cat loss reserve. If that is the case, it's the increase because of the
provisioning measures have been adjusted?

A - Unidentified Speaker
My name is (inaudible) from the Corporate Accounting Department. Regarding your first
question, the JPY36.8 billion minus JPY16 billion, roughly JPY20 billion, as you mentioned.
This is the dividend reserved by Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire from the overseas subs. So
that's benefited us this year.

FINAL

And the second point about the cat loss reserve. As you indicated, on the claims
payment, there is roughly JPY4 billion and the remaining outstanding balance of the
reserve is about JPY18 billion. The claims payment will not change dramatically. But that's
the answer to your question.
So the impact of JPY5 billion, because you have the first year reserve, it does not impact
your profit and you're not joined on your cat loss reserve. And if it's offset and the impact
is zero, then the Thai flood impact through the full year, but that's not amount zero.
I'm (inaudible) from International Business Development. This is a little bit technical. But on
the adjusted earnings, it relates to when we recognize these losses, in the financial
accounting, our fiscal year is from April to March. Also we look at the net incurred losses
during this period, but for the adjusted earnings, the period is from January to December.
What I'm trying to say is, for Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire, the change in the reserves from
January to March quarter by Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire. It's recognized as the profit and
losses for Q1. So that's the impact on the adjusted earnings.

Q - Unidentified Participant
That's right. So on the financial accounting base, the impact is zero. That is correct. Thank
you very much.
