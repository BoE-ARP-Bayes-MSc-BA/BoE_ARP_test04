Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this Ageas Conference Call. I am pleased to present
Mr. Hans De Cuyper, Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Christophe Boizard, Chief Financial
Officer. For the first part of this call, let me remind you that all participants will remain on
the listen-only mode and afterwards there will be a question-and-answer session. Please
also note that this conference is being recorded. I would like to hand the call over to Mr.
Hans De Cuyper and Mr. Christophe Boizard. Gentlemen, please go ahead.

Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all for dialing into this conference call
and for being with us for the presentation of the six-month results of Ageas. I'm joined in
the room by my colleagues of the Executive Committee, Christophe Boizard, our CFO,
and Emmanuel Van Grimbergen, CRO; Antonio Cano, Managing Director for Europe; and
Filip Coremans, Managing Director for Asia.
This quarter, our businesses continued to enjoy a strong commercial and operational
performance in both Europe and Asia. In Europe, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is
gradually fading. We are still recording lower revenues on real estate, mostly from our
parking business and experiencing lower claims frequency in motor, but to a much lesser
extent than in previous quarters. Moreover, the pandemic had a neutral impact on our
results in Q2 with the lower frequency in Non-Life positive, compensated for the
remaining negative impact on investments in Life. Overall, the sound operating

performance of the consolidated entities in the first half of the year is reflected in the Life
operating margins and the Non-Life combined ratio all standing within target range.

FINAL

In Asia, the net result was driven by a solid underlying performance, mitigated by the
impact of the unfavorable evolution of the discount rate curve in China and by negative
net realized capital gains recorded on the quarter.
On the commercial front, we enjoyed a solid sales momentum in Europe and Asia with
inflows up 11%, driven by both Life and Non-Life. Life inflows benefited from the strong
start of the year campaign in China and from excellent Unit-Linked sales in Europe.
Whereas Non-Life inflows were up, thanks to a strong performance in Belgium and
Continental Europe and to the new contribution of Taiping Re in Asia.

Bloomberg Transcript

On a sadder note, I would like to mention an event, which took place after the closing of
the second quarter. As you know, heavy rainfall during the first weeks of July caused
floods in a large part of Belgium with devastating consequences. Our teams have been
fully mobilized to provide help and support to the victims. Given the size of the damages
suffered and in order to indemnify the victims as quickly as possible, we have joined the
sector to propose an additional effort above our legal requirements.
Our current assessment, taking into account this proposal, leads us to expect a negative
impact on our third quarter -- on our net third quarter result of around EUR55 million, and
this is after tax and after reinsurance. Despite these exceptional weather events and
despite the impact of the further decrease in Chinese yields, we are confident in our
ability to deliver a full year net results, excluding the impact of RPN(i), in line with our initial
guidance of between EUR850 million and EUR950 million.
Moving now to our cash and solvency positions. Our cash positions remained at EUR1.2
billion, which gives us a great financial flexibility. Since the beginning of the year, we have
already received EUR670 million dividends from our operating companies, which is a
record amount for us, and we confirm expecting above EUR700 million for the full year.
These dividends more than covered the holding cost and the EUR485 million dividend
paid to Ageas shareholders in June. Additionally, as announced, we have finalized the
acquisition of the Turkish Life company, AvivaSa, which has since been rebranded AgeSa. I
would like to take this opportunity to mention that AgeSa, which has been consolidated
into our accounts since May 5, recorded solid results in Q2, and already contributed EUR4
million to our results.
Still on the M&A front, the sale of Tesco Underwriting in the UK is now completed. We
received the first payment of EUR45 million in the second quarter, and we expect a
second payment of around EUR95 million in Q3.
Lastly, our solvency amounts to 196%, up with 1%, significantly above our target of 175%.
And given our strong cash and solvency positions, we have announced this morning a new
share buyback of EUR150 million.

And now ladies and gentlemen, I will hand over to Christophe for details on the results.

FINAL

Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Thank you, Hans, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. As you can see on Slide 5,
our six months group results amounted to EUR407 million, including EUR115 million
negative result from the general account, driven by EUR57 million negative revaluation of
the RPN(i). As mentioned by Hans, our operational performance has been solid in both
Life and Non-Life. And as usual, I will now give you more details by segment.
So let's start with Belgium on Slide 6. In Non-Life, the combined ratio year-to-date, which
amounted to 93.8%, was still supported by lower claims frequency in Motor, which
compensated for some adverse weather, not related to the floods of July. The remaining
COVID impact in Non-Life was fully offset in Q2 by the continued lower revenues from real
estate in Life. It is, however, worth noting that these revenues are gradually recovering as
restrictions related to COVID are being eased.

Bloomberg Transcript

The guaranteed operating margin amounted to 81 bps in the first half of the year, so
slightly below the target range. In Q2, this margin was impacted by some scattered
impairment on the equity portfolio, even if at the end of the quarter, the amount of
unrealized capital gain on the equity book reached a record amount of EUR1.2 billion
compared to EUR0.8 billion at the end of last year and EUR1 billion at the end of Q1. So
there is a progressive trend -- positive trend on the unrealized capital gain on the equity
book.
The guaranteed operating margin should recover later in the year with the realization of
real estate capital gains expected in the second half of the year. The Unit-Linked
operating margin reached 37 bps, so in the upper end of the target range. Moreover, the
commercial performance has resumed robust progression after the weaker level of last
year induced by the COVID-19. This year, Life inflows are strongly up driven by high UnitLinked sales. And on Non-life, an exceptional growth of 7% was recorded, we progressed
in all business lines.
In the UK, Slide 7. Motor claims frequency were back to pre-COVID levels in the second
quarter. There, lower frequency no longer compensated for the continued increase in
claim inflation. Prudent reserving, along with increased levy costs, weighted on the
combined ratio of the quarter. Meanwhile, the strong net result benefited from a higher
corporate tax rate, which induced positive revaluation of the deferred tax assets.
On the commercial front, inflows have proven resilient in the COVID context and remain
stable scope-on-scope when excluding the past contribution from Tesco Underwriting.
In Continental Europe, Slide 8, the performance was satisfactory in both Life and Non-Life.
In Non-Life, the combined ratio year-to-date stood at an excellent 87.0% in Portugal with
motor claims frequency normalizing to pre-COVID level in Q2. The contribution from
Aksigorta in Turkey to the result, while still positive, suffered from adverse claim
experience.

FINAL

In Life, the guaranteed operating margin year-to-date amounted to a high 113 bps, thanks
to a sound underwriting performance, while the Unit-Linked margin pursued its steady
improvement and stood at 32 bps within the group target range. As previously mentioned
by Hans, the newly acquired Turkish company now renamed AgeSa contribute for two
months to the Life results.
The commercial performance delivered by the segment was excellent in both Life and
Non-Life. In Life, inflows showed a strong recovery driven by Unit-Linked sales. And the
Non-Life, inflow increased by 17% at constant exchange rate over six months with growth
in all the product lines.
In Asia, I am on Slide 9 now, the Life segment continued to deliver a solid operational
performance. In Q2, the underlying performance was broadly in line with the excellent
performance of last year. However, after a very strong Q1, the net results suffered from
the adverse evolution of the discount rate in China and from negative net realized capital
gains due to our own IFRS restatements. It is worth remembering that the dividends we
received from Asia are based on local accounts, so before our own restatements.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Non-Life, the result increased, thanks to the contribution from Taiping Reinsurance. The
continued growth in inflow at 100% in both Life and Non-Life also benefited from the
contribution from Taiping Re for EUR618 million in Life and EUR727 million in Non-Life. You
can see Slide 15 where you have all the details segment by segment, entities by entities
on the inflows.
The Reinsurance segment, now on Slide 10, benefited in the first quarter from the lower
claim frequency recorded at the level of a ceding entities, whereas the second quarter
reflected normalizing claim frequency and adverse weather in Belgium, already
mentioned.
As already announced by Hans, our group Solvency II ratio, Slide 12, increased to 196%,
driven by a strong operational performance, which more than covered the accrual of the
expected dividend.
Our operational free capital generation, so Slide 13 now, amounted to EUR375 million,
including EUR163 million in dividends from our non-controlled participation. On the
negative side influencing the free capital generation we had in Belgium, the progressive
migration to assets, bringing increased SCR, that's what we call the "derisking" of the
balance sheet to support the margins.
In the UK, we had a somewhat weaker on fund generation in Q2 due to the prudent
reserving and the change of scope following the sale of Tesco. And additionally, we
incurred the increased interest costs generated by the new debt instrument issued at the
holding level over the past year. All this weighed on the operational free capital
generation. But nevertheless, on the other hand, at Group level, the operational free
capital generation is satisfactory given the increasing amounts of dividend received from
Asia.

Questions And Answers

FINAL

Operator
Thank you. We will now go through the question-and-answer session. Ladies and
gentlemen, this concludes the introduction. We now open the question-and-answer
session. (Operator Instructions) We have a first question from David Barma from Exane
BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.

Q - David Barma

{BIO 19957338 <GO>}

Thank you, and good morning. My first question is on the Non-Life business in Europe in
your -- the statements you make on the debts? [ph] Can you remind us how the excess of
loss program works at the Group level and then Belgium particularly? And how the
government support mechanisms work in Belgium? And how that fits with the EUR55
million impact that you mentioned this morning?

Bloomberg Transcript

And secondly, on Non-Life as well, could you give us an update on your key markets for
motor insurance on competitive dynamics? And maybe if I can add a small last one on the
Life investment income. So you mentioned still a drag from your real estate investment
rental income in the second quarter, what was the impact this quarter versus your, say, run
rate's budget for that? Thank you.

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, David. Let me take the first question on the impact of the floods. Well, I
cannot in detail zoom in how do the insurance program works for Ageas. That's, of
course, Company confidential information, but traditionally, you reinsure yourself for one
single event, and we also reinsure ourselves on an annual basis for this type of incidents.
Now how does the mechanism work? Before 2005, actually, all CatNat claims came
automatically on the CatNat fund, which was run by the government. There was no
intervention by the insurance industry. And in 2005, the CatNat law came into force,
where the insurance industry would take a first layer of claims and that layer is
automatically adjusted for the size of the market. And today that stands for the industry
around EUR350 million. Above that, we do, as traditional, go back to that CatNat fund
owned by the government.
From 2005 till this year, actually, all CatNat events have been taken by the insurance
industry within that first layer. So it's now the first time and, of course, quite excessively
that we will go above that first layer, and therefore, there are some discussions going on
at this moment with the government how part of this cost could additionally be shared
between the government as well as the insurance industry.
I cannot -- due to the confidentiality of those negotiations, I cannot go into the details of
the current proposal made by the industry. I think we are more or less in the final days to
Page 5 of 18

FINAL

come to a formal agreement. What we have done is we have, in the EUR55 million, taken
into account already the current proposal, which is on the table coming from the insurance
industry.
And so that brings us to EUR55 million. The overall claims cost for AG looking forward
today is expected to be around EUR400 million. That makes the total event definitely an
event above EUR1 billion claims cost for the market. The EUR55 million is net after tax
after reinsurance and for the 75% owned by Ageas in AG. So that's what I can tell you
about the flows.
On the motor dynamics in the European market -- sorry, yeah.

Q - David Barma

{BIO 19957338 <GO>}

No. Thank you for that. Sorry, just one thing. My understanding was you had an excess of
loss treaty for cumulative events. Is that still in force? Because I would have thought that
the July floods plus the H1 weather events would have triggered that.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Well, we have that stoploss, yes, in place. And of course, this type of incidents will go way
above the retention of that stoploss. That being said, of course, it is also not automatic
that any additional intervention you would do that, that is automatically fall into your
reinsurance cover so that you should also take into account and you assess that EUR55
million impact. But I cannot give you, at this moment, more details how the impact is split
between the basic regulation and the excess. At this moment, I cannot give you more
light on this due to the confidentiality of the discussions.

Q - David Barma

{BIO 19957338 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

For Motor, I pass it to Antonio for the European markets.

A - Antonio Cano

{BIO 16483724 <GO>}

Yes, hello, good morning. So on Motor, let's -- I guess you were referring to the main
markets, so Belgium, UK, Portugal. Belgium on motor, you see, as was said by Hans' and
Christophe's introduction, we see frequency creeping up to pre-COVID levels. I would say
in Belgium, we're not there entirely but very close.
Just anecdotal evidence recently, there was a report from the Flemish Road Safety
Institute, and they indicated that claims frequency on the Flemish roads was actually to
levels of 2016. So that it's picking up as the lockdown measures are relaxed. For us, not
really a lot more to mention on the competitive dynamics of the Belgium market. It
remains competitive, but not more competitive than in the past. So it's a stable market.

Page 6 of 18

FINAL

UK, also there, we see claims frequency creeping up, slightly different nature, less claims
frequency related to, say, the daily commuting as many companies are still in semilockdown, but you see a higher frequency in the weekends, et cetera. So overall,
frequency is creeping up.
On the pricing dynamics, you've seen in the first part of the year, a drop of average
premiums. I think for Q2 compared to Q1, we were minus 1.5% in the market. We see that
stabilizing. But just for completeness, in Q1, the drop was more significant. I think it was
more in the order of minus 6%. And in Portugal, a bit the same story, frequency creeping
up again, but a fairly stable market in terms of pricing dynamics.

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Okay. Life investment income, Christophe, you will take that.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. So two things on the investment income. First on new money and then on the
existing book. So on the new money yield, we achieved a very remarkable performance
because in Q2, new money yield reached 205%. So this is done through, obviously, not
with govies [ph]. So we have more -- so we have a riskier asset, but we reached the
205%. By the way, the reason why if you look at the evolution of the SCR coming from AG,
it is going slightly up. And it is a consequence of what I mentioned in my speech, the
derisking of the balance sheet. But all in all, all remaining obviously, within our risk
appetite, of course. But we reached 205% on new money.
Then on the existing book, we have a drag on real estate. On real estate, two things.
First, the retail and then e-pickup [ph]. So broadly, we have on e-pickup, loss around
EUR10 million, but we are -- we observe a good trend in the occupancy of the car parks.
And hence, we are close to 70%, 75% now. So what is left -- what is really behind is the
airports, but on the rest we are recovering rather quickly. And then on the retail, what
weighed on the result is the fact that we have reduced some rents. We have and this is
for another EUR9 million. So EUR10 million on e-pickup and then EUR9 million for the retail,
EUR19 million in total, they're covering on e-pickup.

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

If I can make a comparison, year-to-date on the inter parking, we see still compared to
pre-COVID levels compared to 2019, a drop around 30% to 35%. But we do see, for
instance, in July that, that is already reduced to minus 10%. So we do expect for the
second half of the year a recovery. We have actually some countries already where the
parking revenues are above the pre-COVID levels. And as Christophe said, the main
Page 7 of 18

Date: 2021-08-11

FINAL

impact that remains are the airports and the airports is the biggest impact on the Belgian
parking business. But we are actually quite confident that we can go back to pre-COVID
levels and even thought that because the parking -- park is still also growing gradually. So
that we can go back to pre-COVID levels very, very soon. And so it was in second quarter
last year, all real estate and equity impact was minus EUR44 million. And this year second
quarter, with this minus EUR19 million. So we are actually less than half on what it was the
year before.

Operator
Thank you. Next question from Ashik Musaddi from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, Hans. Good morning, Christophe. Just a couple of
questions, if I may. First of all, if I think about your earnings guidance, I mean, you had
increased it from EUR850 million to EUR950 million and then EUR900 million to EUR950
million and now again, going back to EUR850 million to EUR950 million. I mean, how do
we think about that change in the guidance again? I mean, are we more or less thinking
that the earnings would be between EUR850 million to EUR900 million? Or what are the
moving parts here? Because on one hand, I agree that this losses from the Belgium
floods are high, EUR55 million, no doubt about it. But at the same time, I mean, European
equity markets have been strong. So there could easily be some offset from capital gains
that you can book in Europe. So how you are thinking about this guidance is the first
question?
Second thing is, I mean, clearly, macro in Asia, especially China has been volatile with
equity markets as well as interest rates coming down. So any fresh thoughts on how do
we see the underlying earnings of Asia, I mean, in past, you have done a great job in
giving us the building blocks of the earnings. So any thoughts on those updated numbers
would be very helpful.

Page 8 of 18



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2021-08-11

And lastly is, you have announced a share buyback of EUR150 million. I mean, how do we
think about the capital position here? And is there any relevant M&A in the pipeline that
you would flag or not at this point? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Okay. Ashik, let me take the first one on the guidance. You know very well and you're
right, we have said in the beginning of the year the guidance, EUR850 million to EUR950
million with a very strong performance in the first quarter mainly also coming from the
capital gains and some continued positive impact of COVID. We have raised it to EUR900
million to EUR950 million. Since I think we have now for the second quarter to take into
account two important elements going forward. First of all, in the EUR51 million coming
from the floods. And the second one, as you remember, in previous guidance, we have
assumed a negative impact from the variable interest rate in China for the first two
quarters and that, that would more or less stabilize in the second half of the year.
We see now that interest rates are still going down or have been going down in China,
stabilizing a bit now. So -- but we do expect some additional negative impact and Filip, in
your second question can zoom in into this, for China. So those are the two main attention
points.

Bloomberg Transcript

You're also right that we have a very solid unrealized capital gain position, both on the
equity book as well as on the property book. And so that's why we are also not lowering
the upper limit. So we take into account the potential on the lower side, but we do not
lower the upper limit because that will depend on financial markets, equity markets and
the potential of capital gains.
Also, let's not forget that this year, the capital gains season on the real estate transaction
is almost fully in the second half of the year, where this is still to come. I cannot give you
detailed numbers on this. That is also something we should take into account. So that's
the motivation to go for EUR850 million to EUR950 million.
Where will we end in the range? Honestly, it's hard to say. I keep it open for the full range
for the time being with the arguments I just gave you. And on the Asia earnings, I will pass
to Filip for some details.

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Hans. Let me start with saying that underlying, there is absolutely no
change in the outlook and indicators that we see on Asia. And I know, of course, that many
of you were surprised by the relatively low results on the surface for Q2, certainly after a
strong Q1, happy to comment on that.
But if we look at the underlying first and foremost year-to-date, we had an overall result
of EUR203 million. And in fact, the underlying result is not all that different because the
net-net, the capital gains realized to date was EUR65 million. And the valuation interest
rate up to half year was EUR74 million. So underlying that leads to a EUR212 million. And if
we do the same exercise specifically for Q3, we had a valuation interest rate impact in Q3
Page 9 of 18



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2021-08-11

FINAL

of EUR34 million and a negative capital gain impact of EUR36 million. So underlying, we
had even a very strong EUR125 million for Q2 on its own.
To put that further into perspective, and Christophe and Hans commented on it, this
negative capital gains, very important to note what they are not. They are not realized
losses, and they are not impairments. They are IFRS derecognitions of local capital gains.
The result in China in their accounting rule, they put their property in fair value to P&L and
they have an outstanding trading book, of which also the gains run through the P&L.
Under IFRS, we derecognized both. However, what we do not do and that is quite
conservative, if you ask me, is take the profit sharing, compensating effect into account.
So we do still carry the full charge of the profit-sharing dotations that I think Group -- I think
Life makes in these funds. And I'm more inclined to look at the underlying trend, which is
more in line with what you can expect in the local results, which, in the end, drive dividend
expectations forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

So what is then our outlook, as you asked, Ashik, by end of year? The interest rate in
China undeniably came down further and took a dip in July, even touching 2.8%, now
rebounded a bit to close to 2.9%. But based on that, our best estimate, and of course,
with the caveats of high volatility in this indicator. They range between EUR170 million and
EUR180 million impact of valuation interest rate by end of the year.
Then on the result outlook related to that, we stick to our EUR350 million to EUR400
million range, but I am inclined to say given the fact that in the local accounts, they
realized already quite a bit more capital gains than we did that we may not end under
IFRS close to the 400, but rather to the 350.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

That's very clear. Okay. Okay. I will find. Thank you. Thanks a lot. That's very clear.

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Filip. Ashik, your last question on the share buyback. Well, three comments I
want to give there. First of all is, of course, I cannot disclose anything on M&A, but what
we call our test position to look at potential M&A is actually not impacted really by this
share buyback because you have heard me saying during the introduction that we expect
more than EUR700 million of upstreaming this year, taking into account the EUR485 million
coming from the dividend. We still have ample room to do this share buyback.
Secondly, I think we have always said that our guidance this year is the Connect21
program, and we want to honor our commitment there and where we have set if no
significant M&A announced that we would do a share buyback of EUR150 million. So that's
also, I think, the second reason why we do the share buyback. And last, but not least, also
our solvency position has been very resilient throughout the whole COVID crisis into this
year, into the second quarter. So we're also very, very confident from a solvency point of
view.

FINAL

One final comment I'm going to give because that question might come later on anyhow.
Within the European directive, we had a limitation of EUR130 million, but once again, same
as the dividend last year. We have announced a share buyback in a very open and
constructive dialog within the National Bank. You know that the European directive will end
30 of September. So there was no objection to go EUR20 million above that maximum
limitation that we have. So we have been able to honor our Connect21 commitments.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

That's very clear. Thanks a lot for the detailed answers. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Next question from Benoit Petrarque from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go
ahead.

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, good morning, all. A couple of questions on my side. And I would like to come back
on the July event in Belgium, which is all extremely severe and shocking as well. I was
wondering what have been the lessons learned from your side from these events?
I mean, we're talking a lot about climate change. I was wondering if you are currently
happy with your reinsurance program, the way you structure it? Or you are potentially
thinking about a small reset or adjustment of this program? So that will be the first
question, just kind of the long term -- more long-term -- or medium-term, long-term
impact of this July event from a strategic point of view.
Then the second one, just to come back on the normalizing frequency in Non-Life in
Belgium. It was still a small positive in Q2. What do you see so far in the third quarter? Do
you expect more normalization? We've been talking about also frequency potentially
shooting up a bit during the normalization phase. And I was wondering if you still think
that, that will be the case?
And then just finally, on re-risking, you've been doing re-risking in the second quarter? And
where are you now? How much further rerisking are you expecting? Thank you.

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Okay. Let me take the very your first part of the first question, lessons learned. Well, I think
it's too early. We are still dealing with the recent events. Of course, we can all read that
frequency and impact of this events is on the rise. So I can imagine that after the
agreement with the government, there will be a follow-up how the CatNat regulation
might be further improved, which I think is also very important for the insurers because
that way, they are able to align their reinsurance programs with the regulation and that we
can operate within a very clear legal framework and that insurers can protect and organize
themselves for this. But what about our current reinsurance program, I'll pass it to Antonio.

Thank you, Hans. So the reinsurance programs get adapted every year, but the principal
philosophy remains the same. Basically, we insure slightly above the one in 200 events.
And each of these models continue to be adapted and referring specific to climate
change, it is nothing new for the reinsurance world. So the models have been gradually
adapting, maybe there will be more adaptations. But don't expect because of this specific
event like a drastic change in the reinsurance cover. But as Hans was saying, should the
legal framework be adapted then that obviously will be reflected in the reinsurance rates.

(Technical Difficulty) there's no additional lockdown coming up. I don't see any reason why
that should stop. So we are gradually normalizing, definitely in Belgium, definitely in the
Flemish part of Belgium.

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. On your first question (Technical Difficulty) segments. We're subject to this rerisking
thing. It is mainly Belgium and then -- but to a lesser extent, Continental Europe. So I will
take Belgium has a very good illustrative example. So first, let me give you the asset
allocation in Belgium and you will understand where we are heading to. So real estate, we
are slightly above 10%. Loans, close to 20%; equity, close to 4%; and then the bonds as
the rest.
So the re-risking, it is on real estate. And on real estate, it is safe to assume that we are
close to a maximum in -- when you compare with the SAA, the strategic asset allocation,
which is the reference, we are close to a maximum. So I don't expect a lot of additional
SCR coming from the real estate.
On equities, the trend will continue. Why? Because we will take advantage of this famous
long-term equity. But as you know, they have a more favorable solvency treatment. But on
equity, the goal is to increase by roughly 1 point.
And then on all the fixed income bonds and loans, we still have migrations from sovereign
debt to more advanced instruments like loans, infrastructure, direct lending or things like
this. So -- and there, the movement will continue.
So conclusion, on equity, we can expect more, more SCR, more allocation on equity and
then the reshuffling of the fixed income portfolio with more note and instrument bearing
additional SCR. So conclusion, and I don't -- I cannot give you precise figures, but the
trend will continue for a while.

Thank you. Next question from Michael Huttner from Berenberg. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

And so the -- my main question is really to understand the operating capital generation. I
know you don't kind of focus so much on that, but you did (inaudible) EUR212 million the
guidance for the year was EUR500 million to EUR540 million, which is well below. And it
looks from what you're saying on the SCR that the second half will not be higher. So here,
my question is how does that impact the cash generation that you would expect core
operations of consolidated unit?
And the second thing is on -- are there -- I feel a disconnect and I'm really sorry, but I feel
it really strongly. You're investing more in these real assets, but you're not actually giving
us more gain to reduce the guidance. I'm kind of thinking, well, if I -- I'm not a shareholder,
I'm just an analyst, (inaudible) I'd be a little bit disappointed.
And then finally, if I may. So China's cash is delivering a bigger payout that you kind of
assume, so 35% versus 30%. How sustainable is that? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

So I will -- I take the question. So on the free capital generation, you are right. Indeed, we
are below the guidance, the guidance of EUR130 million a quarter. And in my speech, I
gave you some explanation. So let me remind you the main one. First, some rerisking in
AG and "the cost" of this derisking is quite sizable. The increase in SCR for AG is EUR29
million. EUR29 million additional SCR time the 1.75 of the objective, you have a very sizable
effect on the operational free capital generation.
If you only restated by this amount, you would be back within the guidance, but there are
additional things like the fact that you left the scope, it accounts for EUR5 million. We have
more financing costs. The financing costs now reached EUR30 million, which is, again, a
sizable amount, decreasing the own fund generation of the general account.
So a lot of -- some adverse things. But then, as I said, and compensated by a nice
increase in the dividend coming from China. I know that this has to be deducted when we
compare with the guidance. But in the near future, we will upgrade the presentation of
the free capital generation, and we will be able to rely more on the free capital
generation coming from Asia, but is the future, but you will see that the free capital
generation coming from Asia is really strong.
Then your second point was, how come we're investing more in real estate. We don't
generate more return. We do. We do. And when we invest more in equity and more in
real estate, we have more own fund generation. So I cannot give you the exact
breakdown, but indeed, there is more over time. So when we invest into these riskier
assets, you have a kind of one-off upfront cost with the increase of SCR. But for the
future, you have on a recurrent basis more generation of own funds. So this is included.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

And on the Asia -- yes.

FINAL

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

You asked an additional question, which you asked on the sustainability of the payout ratio
in China, which is indeed very important. And we saw indeed that our payout ratio on a
local result basis moved from 30 now to 35. We -- given the also excellent result last year
in China led to record high dividend submission out of the region.
We are now at 152, I believe, more or less, and that is going up with the dividend still
coming in from Malaysia, I believe. So we will be close to EUR170 million net dividend
contribution. So your question on the sustainability of the 35% is indeed very relevant.
First and foremost that all depends on the capital consumption for the growth and the
capital generation, as Christophe said, operational free capital generation is of the
essence. Now remember that last time, we said that last year -- over last year, and it was
also in the footnote of the free capital generation in the previous presentation, that Asia
region overall had an operational free capital generation of around EUR400 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

So having -- if you look at the dividend outflow, it's still just 35, seems very much
sustainable. It also depends on the solvency evolution of the operating entities. And as
you can see there, they're fairly stable.
Of course, Taiping -- China Taiping still has to release this results. So I cannot say too
much, but I don't expect too many surprises there. Of course, they paid its dividend,
which in the first half, always a little downward pressure. But overall solvency ratio seems
to be stable with this payout ratio.
And the only other thing that remains to be noted is the upcoming C-ROSS and then
probably you read in the press, there was an article appearing in Asia Insurance Review, I
believe, a few days ago saying that they expect that the impact for the sector to be
around 10%.
Now giving the fact that the solvency ratio of Taiping is over 200 that is not worrying. And
at the same time, China Taiping also announced or at least Taiping Life announced
issuance of subordinated debt, which we -- in execution, which will add another 14% to
their solvency ratio. So all in all, we expect stable solvency conditions and sustainability of
payout ratios 30 to 35 (Technical Difficulty)

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

And Filip, what we can add on the sustainability of the dividend of China is that at the
CTIH level at the Taiping group level, there is a need to collect dividends. So because it's
a key component of the group, that's the largest entity -- so Taiping Life, it's a little bit like
AG for Ageas for them.

Thank you. (Operator instructions) We have a new question once again from Ashik
Musaddi from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

Yeah. Thank you. And sorry, Filip, sorry to come back again on Asia. I mean, you kindly
gave what the whole moving part of Asia for this year. I'm just wondering like how do we
think about the interest rate impact for next year? This year, you mentioned it's EUR170
million, EUR180 million. I mean, should we expect any improvement in that number for
next year on a marginal differential basis, not like what would be the actual number. But
like differential wise, would this number go down next year or would this number, would
you say, go up next year based on what we know about the interest rates as of now?
Thank you.

A - Filip Coremans

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Ashik, I particularly appreciate the last part of your sentence as what we know right now
because this is obviously moving every time, and it's quite volatile. But yes, of course, you
can actually project it, if you look at the ones -- the 75 rate averaging forward. It will taper
off in the end towards the current rates and that gap is diminishing because the current
rate is around 3.08 and the new rates are account of 2.9. So they are -- the band is
narrowing down. So this effect will taper off. Initially, we even know that in 2022, we would
have almost no impact. But given this recent dip in rates, some impact will be there.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Let me put another caveat to it and that is for everybody. The volatility does not only
come from the rate, there are two other components, and you keep that in mind that it is
not science. It depends on the curve. It's not a single point. So also the movement in the
curve may have an impact from month-to-month from quarter-to-quarter on the effect.
And the other thing is the size of the balance sheet because we still continue to grow
quite strongly. If you saw the assets under management decreased 11%. So also on new
business that impact is there from quarter-to-quarter movements. So keep that in mind
that the volatility of these figures are high.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Next question from Fulin Liang from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Fulin Liang

{BIO 21126177 <GO>}

Hi. Hi, good morning. I've got just two questions. The first one is, so I saw that the inflow
of Asia is growing, which is good. But if I look at the APE in the second quarter of this year.
By my calculation, the APE has actually down about 18%. Is there anything we should be
concerned? Or is there any special reason that the APE in the second quarter is down I
mean, compared to the second quarter of last year? And that's the first question.
And the second one is, I'm sorry, I don't actually fully understand that capital loss
explanation in Asia, maybe can I ask a question from a different angle? Is actually the
property market value and the equity investment market value actually going up in second
quarter or is actually going down? Thank you.

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

First on -- let me first talk a little bit indeed about the new business. Indeed, you rightfully
noticed that APE in the second quarter -- so first, let me start with year-to-date APEs are
up, I think, around 13% -- 12%, 13% year-on-year. So there is a nice growth for the first six
months. But indeed, it was more in the first quarter and quite a bit less in the second
quarter.
Now there are two caveats to that. First and foremost, last year, in the first quarter, of
course, we had more COVID impact and there was a catch-up clearly there in the second
quarter into (inaudible) volumes, whereas this year, the first quarter started extremely
strongly.
And secondly, there has been more focused on higher VenB [ph] products. So less focus
maybe on top line and specifically in China, less focus on higher tickets in the banca
channel, but more on value-adding tickets in banca channel, which held back APE. But we
will -- and we will publish these tables later, as you know, with some delay still. VenB in the
region for an APE up 12% will be up more than 40%. The exact figure, I leave it mostly to
our colleagues of Taiping to disclose. So the value of the new business written is
significantly better than the APE growth even. So it's also a shift of focus on more valueadding products, maybe less on the top line in the second quarter.
Then the second question was about the capital loss. So clearly, there is no losses. It's the
recognition, as I said. So market value recognized on property went up in the local account
and the mark-to-market on that trading book went up in their local accounts. To make your
life, let's say, easier, it will be interesting for you to follow the result announcement of
China Taiping, which, unfortunately, as you know, comes in one or two weeks from now,
and that will give you a better insight and difference between the local result and the IFRS
results that we recognize, and hence also in the magnitude of the adjustment we had to
make.

FINAL

Actually in summary, it is capital gains that runs over the P&L in CTIH, but not in the IFRS
accounting of Ageas. (inaudible) from a valuation point of view, it's actually good news
because value is improving. In one sentence, so the revaluation of real estate, it is fair
value to P&L. This increased results is eligible for increasing the profit sharing at a rate of
70%.
And then what we do is since our own IFRS option is to do amortized costs on real estate,
we restate and we cancel this revaluation of real estate, but we don't restate the profit
sharing increase. That's the reason why we say it is very, very prudent, as Filip said.

the speakers.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your questions. And to end this call, let me
summarize the main conclusions. First of all, we delivered a very solid operational
performance in Europe and in Asia. I want to note that the inflows were strongly up, both
in Life and in Non-life. And despite the expected impact of the recent floods in Belgium
and the interest rate evolution in China, we are confident in our ability to deliver a full year
result in line with our initial guidance of EUR850 million to EUR950 million. And given our
strong cash and solvency position, we have announced a new share buyback of EUR150
million.
With this, I would like to bring this call to an end. Do not hesitate to contact our IR team
should you have any outstanding questions. Thank you for your time. And I would like to
wish you a very nice day.
