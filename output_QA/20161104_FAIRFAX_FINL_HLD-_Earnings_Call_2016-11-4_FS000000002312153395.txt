{BIO 15966871 <GO>}

Good morning and welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's 2016 third quarter results. This
call may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ perhaps materially
from those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of
uncertainties and risk factors, the most foreseeable of which are set out under Risk
Factors in our Base Shelf Prospectus, which has been filed with Canadian Securities
regulators and is available on SEDAR.
I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa.

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Hey. Thank you very much, Kleven, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to
Fairfax's third quarter conference call. I'll try to give you some of the highlights and then,
as always, pass it on to Dave Bonham, our CFO, for additional financial details.

FINAL

In the first nine months of 2016, book value per share increased 3.3% adjusted for the $10
per share common dividend paid in the first quarter of 2016. Our insurance companies
had an excellent nine months with a combined ratio of 93.4% with excellent reserving and
significant underwriting profits of $379 million.
In the third quarter, all our operating segments had combined ratios below 100% with an
overall combined ratio of 91.3%. Zenith had an excellent combined ratio of 75.6%, Fairfax
Asia 82.9%, OdysseyRe 89.5%, and Northbridge 89.8%, all below 90% combined ratio. As
shown on page 35 of our quarterly report, we realized gains on our investment portfolio
of $248 million before equity hedges.

Bloomberg Transcript

Excluding all hedging losses and before mark-to-market fluctuations in our investment
portfolio, we earned $450 million in pre-tax income in the third quarter. Including all
hedging losses and mark-to-market fluctuations in our investment portfolio, we've
reported after-tax earnings of $33 million in the third quarter or $1.3 million excluding noncontrolling interest. Our insurance and reinsurance business premium volume was up in
the third quarter by approximately 4.4%, while the combined ratio for our insurance and
reinsurance operations was 91.3%.
At the subsidiary level, the change in net premiums written in the third quarter and the
combined ratios were as follows. OdysseyRe, a 2% drop in the third quarter in terms of
premiums, net premiums, 89.5% combined ratio; Crum & Forster, up 13%, 98.5%
combined ratio; Northbridge in Canadian dollars, premiums up 12%, 89.8% combined
ratio; Zenith, 7% increase in premium, 75.6% combined ratio; Fairfax Asia, 21% increase in
premium and that excludes the LPT, large portfolio transfer for last year, it's higher if you
include it, but if you exclude it, it's up 21% with an 82.9% combined ratio; and for Brit, the
premiums were down approximately 2% with a 96.7% combined ratio. So, you can see our
insurance companies have done very well for the three months and for the nine months.
As we have said below, very â€“ as we have said many times before, very low interest rates
and reduced reserve redundancies means for our industry there's no place to hide.
Combined ratios have to drop well below 100% for the industry to make a single-digit
return on equity with these low interest rates. While the short term is always tough to
predict, I remind you that fundamentals will eventually play out.
Net investment losses of $200 million in the third quarter for us consisted of the following.
Please refer to page two of our press release. Net losses on equity and equity-related
investments were $247 million, resulting from net gains of $285 million on our equity
investments and a $532 million net loss on our equity hedge, mainly because of a 9%
increase in the Russell 2000 Index in the third quarter. So, the Russell increased very
significantly in the third quarter.
We realized gains of $38 million on our equities, primarily related to the redemption of
the BlackBerry convertible in the quarter, and realized $57 million of gains on individual
equity hedges. As we have mentioned in our annual meetings, annual reports, quarterly
calls, and I emphasize on these calls always, with IFRS accounting, where stocks and
bonds are recorded at market and subject to mark-to-market gains or losses, quarterly

FINAL

and annual income will fluctuate widely and investment results will only make sense over
the long term.
Our CPI-linked derivatives with a notional value of approximately $114 billion produced
unrealized losses of $77 million in the third quarter. The majority of these contracts are
based on the U.S. CPI index about 32%, or the European Union CPI index about 41%.
Further information is available on page three of our press release where we have
included a table on our deflation swaps.
On average, they have approximately 5.9 or 6 years to run. These contracts are very
volatile. But as I have said many times to you before, our CDS experience comes to mind.
When you review our statements, please remember that when we own more than 20% of
a company, we equity account; and when we own above 50%, we consolidate, so that
mark-to-market gains in these companies are not reflected in our results. As you can see
on page 12 of our quarterly report, the fair values of our investments is $3.1 billion versus a
carrying value of $2.6 billion and unrealized gain of about $0.5 billion not on our balance
sheet.
Investment gains have been an important component of our returns over time. Since we
began, we've had $11.3 billion in realized and unrealized gains. As previously announced,
last December, Fairfax agreed to acquire a 40% interest in Eurolife, the third largest
insurer in Greece. This transaction closed in the third quarter. On June 27, 2016, we
agreed to acquire an 80% interest in AMAG, an Indonesian insurer. AMAG has an excellent
long-term track record in the Indonesian general insurance sector, a well-diversified sales
channel with the Panin Bank. And this is, we think, a great opportunity for us to continue to
expand our operations in this region. This transaction closed in early October.
As previously announced on July 6, 2016, the company agreed to acquire a 100% interest
in Zurich Insurance South Africa, a South Africa and Botswana insurer. Africa is a continent
that represents a long-term growth opportunity for Fairfax, but where we have
traditionally done little primary commercial insurance business. The transaction is subject
to closing conditions, including various regulatory approvals, and is expected to close by
the end of the fourth quarter of 2016.
In October of this year, we agreed to acquire AIG's insurance operations in our Argentina,
Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, Venezuela and Turkey, and certain assets and renewable rights
with respect to the portfolio of local business written by AIG Europe in Bulgaria, Czech
Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.
Through an ongoing partnership, Fairfax will support and service AIG's multinational
businesses in the countries in which we have acquired their business. Total consideration
is approximately $240 million. Each transaction is subject to customary closing conditions,
including regulatory approvals, and each transaction is expected to close next year. We
are honored to be AIG's preferred network partner all over the world to provide
outstanding service to their multinational clients. The Latin American companies are well
established in their respective markets with experienced management teams and a

FINAL

disciplined approach to underwriting and they will significantly expand Fairfax's footprint in
Latin America.
The acquisition of the Eastern European operations, follows on our recent expansion in
Eastern Europe through our previously announced QBE transaction and will accelerate our
plans for long-term growth in the region. We welcome all of the AIG employees in the 13
countries to the Fairfax family. Fairfax India has now almost fully invested its $1.1 billion that
it raised about a year ago in six investments. We like all of them and are excited about the
potential in India under Prime Minister Modi's leadership.
We continue to be very concerned about the prospects for the financial markets and the
economies of North America and Western Europe, accentuated, as we have said many
times before, by potential weakness in China and emerging markets. As we have said
now for some time, we believe there continues to be a big disconnect between the
financial markets and the underlying economic fundamentals.

Bloomberg Transcript

You never know when these markets will reverse, but we caution caveat emptor of buyer
beware. As of September 30, 2016, we had $5.5 billion in cash and short-term
investments in our portfolios, which is 19.3% of our total investment portfolios, to take
advantage of opportunities that may come our way.
Given the uncertainties of the U.S. election and the fact that we live in a mark-to-market
world, in the fourth quarter, we have sold approximately 90% of our U.S. long-term
treasuries in our investment portfolio. And as a result, we will have cash and short-term
investments in excess of $10 billion or 35% of the portfolio. Since we began buying
treasuries in 2010, we have realized a cumulative gain â€“ now this is a cumulative gain of
over $1 billion.
As we have done in the past, it is important to remind our shareholders of the significant
value we have created in our investments in numerous companies that are not valued at
market value in our financial statements. We receive offers to purchase some of these
holdings from time to time. And for the right price, these holdings may be sold
opportunistically in order to maximize value for our shareholders. Such holdings include
insurance associates, where we have no reasonable potential for majority control or
significant influence. All of our insurance associates, at the end of last year, are listed on
page 57 in our 2015 annual report.
Now, I would like to turn it over to Dave Bonham, our CFO, so he can give you some more
information on the underlying fundamentals. Dave?

David James Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Thank you, Prem. So, in the third quarter of 2016, Fairfax has reported net earnings of $1
million and that resulted in the net loss of $0.42 per diluted share and that's after
considering payment of our preferred share dividends. So, that compares to the third
quarter of 2015 when we reported net earnings of $425 million or net earnings of $18.16
per diluted share. Year-to-date in 2016, Fairfax has produced net earnings of $189 million
Page 4 of 14



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2016-11-04

or $6.62 per diluted share and that was lower than in 2015 when we reported net earnings
of $464 million or about a $19 per diluted share.

FINAL

Underwriting profit at our insurance and reinsurance operations in the third quarter and
the first nine months of 2016 was $175 million and $379 million with combined ratios of 91%
and 93% that was somewhat lower than the underwriting profits of $177 million and $440
million and combined ratios of 91% in each of those respective periods in 2015.
Quarter-to-date underwriting profit decreased by $3 million due to lower net favorable
prior-year reserve development and higher current period catastrophe losses, partially
offset by an improvement in the current accident year loss experience, excluding cats.
Year-to-date underwriting profit decreased by $62 million due to higher current period
catastrophe losses, partially offset by increased net favorable prior-year reserve
development.
Current period catastrophe losses in the third quarter of 2016 totaled $59 million or 3
combined ratio points and totaled $248 million or 4 combined ratio points in the first nine
months of 2016. Cat losses in the third quarter were mostly attritional, while the Fort
McMurray wildfires accounted for $66 million of the year-to-date total cat losses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our combined ratios benefited from net favorable prior-year reserve development in the
third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 of a $137 million and $397 million and that
translated into about 7 combined ratio points in each of those respective periods. That
compared to a net favorable reserve development of $151 million and $303 million in the
third quarter and first nine months of 2015.
Net premiums written by our insurance and reinsurance operations increased by 4% in the
third quarter and by 14% in the first nine months of 2016, reflecting growth at Crum &
Forster, Northbridge and Zenith National. The increase in the first nine months of 2015
also reflected the incremental impact to the consolidation of Brit's net premiums written
of about $600 million.
So, turning to our operating company results, starting with Northbridge. Northbridge's
underwriting profit was $24 million in the third quarter and $27 million for the first nine
months of 2016. That produced combined ratio of 90% and 96% in each of those
respective periods. The underwriting results in the third quarter and first nine months of
2016 included $5 million and $26 million of current period catastrophe losses. And as we
said, the first nine month catastrophe losses were principally comprised of the impact of
Fort McMurray, and that was with the net incurred loss of $23 million at Northbridge or
about 3 combined ratio points.
Northbridge's underwriting results in the third quarter and first nine months included the
benefit of net favorable prior-year reserve development of $42 million and $79 million,
representing about 17 combined ratio points and 12 combined ratio points on their
combined ratio. This compared to net favorable development of $40 million and $59
million, representing about 18 combined ratio points and 9 combined ratio points in the
same periods last year.

FINAL

In Canadian dollar terms, net premiums written by Northbridge in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2016 increased by 12% and 10% that reflected increased new business
writings and modest price increases across the group, partially offset by the impact of
reduced reinsurance costs.
Looking at OdysseyRe. Odyssey reported underwriting profits of $59 million and $133
million at combined ratios of 90% and 91% in the third quarter in the first nine months of
2016. Compared to underwriting profits of $62 million and $191 million last year. Cat losses
in the third quarter and first nine months totaled $33 million and $135 million, translating
into about 6 combined ratio points and 9 combined ratio points in each of those
respective periods. That was an increase from cat losses of $29 million and $85 million
that we experienced in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015.

Bloomberg Transcript

Odyssey's combined ratios in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 included the
benefit of $45 million and $148 million of net favorable prior-year reserve development
and that's principally related to catastrophe and other property loss reserves. That
compared to the benefit of $66 million and $106 million of net favorable development last
year in the third quarter and first nine months.
Odyssey wrote $499 million and just over $1.6 billion of net premiums in the third quarter
and first nine months of 2016. And excluding the impact of the non-renewal of the Florida
property quota share reinsurance contract on June 1, 2015 that we've mentioned on prior
conference calls, net premiums written decreased by 1.9% in the third quarter and by
about 1.8% in the first nine months. And that principally reflects the impact of additional
purchases of property catastrophe, excess of loss reinsurance at very favorable pricing,
and that will significantly mitigate the impact of small- to medium-sized catastrophe
events on Odyssey's U.S. and its international operations.
Moving on to Crum & Forster, Crum & Forster produced underwriting profits of $7 million
and $23 million in the third quarter and first nine months at combined ratios of 99% and
98%, respectively. And there's no net prior-year reserve development in either 2016 or
2015 in Crum & Forster. Current period catastrophe losses were $1 million and $17 million in
the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 compared to $5 million and $12 million in
the comparable periods last year.
Crum & Forster's net premium written increased by 13% in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2016, primarily reflecting growth in its accident and health line of business,
combined with the incremental impact of the 2015 acquisitions of Redwoods, Travel
Insured International and Brownyard.
Zenith National reported underwriting profits in the third quarter and first nine months of
$52 million and $115 million and combined ratios of 76% and 81%. That compared to
underwriting profits of $36 million and $97 million and combined ratios of 82% and 83% in
those respective periods in 2015. Those combined ratios in 2016 included 15 combined
ratio points and 13 combined ratio points of net favorable prior-year reserve development
in the third quarter and the first nine months.

FINAL

Net premiums written by Zenith increased to $180 million and $700 million â€“ or rather $671
million in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 from $168 million and $642
million in those respective periods last year. This increase of 7% and 5% in the third
quarter and first nine months principally reflects an increase in exposure, partially offset by
modest price decreases.
And now looking at Brit. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, Brit contributed
$405 million and just over $1.1 billion to the consolidated net premiums written and
produced underwriting profits of $12 million and $26 million, representing combined ratios
of 97% and 98% respectively. As a reminder, Brit was acquired in June of 2015, so
comparative figures for 2015 are only for the period in which Brit was owned by Fairfax.
The underwriting results in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 included current
period catastrophe losses of $13 million and $48 million, translating into 4 combined ratio
points and 5 combined ratio points. Cat losses in the first nine months of 2016 were again
principally comprised of the impact of the Fort McMurray wildfires where Brit incurred net
losses of $22 million and that increased its combined ratio by about 2 points.

Bloomberg Transcript

Fairfax Asia's underwriting profit of $12 million and $37 million and combined ratios of 83%
and 81% in each of the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 improved when
compared to underwriting profits of $5 million and $20 million and combined ratios of
about 90% in those comparable periods in 2015. The combined ratios in 2016 included
about $5 million and $35 million, respectively, of net favorable prior-year reserve
development that compared to about $7 million and $18 million of favorable development
in the third quarter and first nine months last year.
Under the insurance and reinsurance, other segment, it produced underwriting profits of
$9 million and $18 million, combined ratios of 92% and 95% in each of the third quarter
and first nine months of 2016. And runoff reported operating losses that decreased to $12
million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to an operating loss of $19 million in the third
quarter of 2015. The year-over-year decrease principally reflects lower operating
expenses in our runoff operation.
Looking at some of our consolidated figures, our consolidated interest and dividend
income decreased modestly quarter-over-quarter from $106 million to $105 million, but
increased from $367 million in the first nine months to $419 million in 2016. And that
reflected increased holdings of higher yielding government bonds and corporate bonds,
partially offset by the sales of U.S. state and municipal bonds.
Fairfax recorded an income tax recovery of $30 million in the third quarter of 2016 on pretax earnings of $2.5 million. So, really the small base of pre-tax earnings that's the principal
factor resulting in the unusual effective tax rate. However, the items reconciling our
statutory tax rate to our effective tax rate remain fairly consistent with prior periods. And
for further details on that, I draw your attention to note 13 of our third quarter report,
where we show our detailed income tax reconciliation, and we also show a tabular
breakdown of our pre-tax results by jurisdiction and the related tax provisions.

We ended the third quarter with an investment portfolio, inclusive of holding company
cash of $29.5 billion compared to $29 billion at the end of 2015. And looking at our
financial position, our total debt to total capital ratio increased to 24.8% at September 30
from 21.8% at December 31, 2015. That primarily resulted from the issuance of CAD 400
principal amount of a 4.5% unsecured senior notes that we issued in the first quarter of
2016 and also increase in subsidiary debt in the third quarter, which included Fairfax India's
term loan of $225 million and Cara's borrowings of about $208 million to finance its
acquisition of St-Hubert.
Increased long-term debt was somewhat offset by the increase in our common
shareholders' equity through the issuance of 1 million subordinate voting shares in the first
quarter, and higher non-controlling interest in the third quarter.
So, with that, I'll pass it back over to you, Prem.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from
Paul Holden of CIBC. Your line is open.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. So...

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Good morning, Paul.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

My one question for you, Prem, would be with respect to the change in holdings on the
U.S. treasuries. So you said, you reduced that position, reduced that significantly because
Page 8 of 14



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2016-11-04

of uncertainty of the U.S. election. I won't ask you predict the outcome of the election, but
I will ask you what you might do with that position pending the outcome of the election,
i.e. if it goes one way or the other, might you re-enter that position?

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Well, Paul, thank you for that question. Yeah. We've, as we said, sold 90%-plus of our
treasury bonds and we have made the point that the uncertainties in the U.S. election is
the reason. We don't know who is going to win the elections, but you could have
significant infrastructure spending, you could have the drop in corporate tax rates. And
while we think that might work in the short term, in the long term we still have questions
about that. But we do live in a mark-to-market world and we wanted to take that risk out
and so we've done that. And so, with $10 billion of cash, Paul, and the investment
portfolios $1 billion in cash and marketable securities in the holding company, we've got $1
billion of undrawn lines, bank lines. Our stocks are hedged. We've got no corporate bonds
to speak of. We've got some deflation swaps. We like the position we're at.
We've got tremendous flexibility that's built into our company and we can take advantage
of any opportunities that come with this U.S. elections or otherwise. But we like that
flexibility. We really don't know what will happen and we have to see. And as it happens,
we'll react. But we have an investment team here that's been managing money in one
form or the other for 40 years. And we've got three partners for who work â€“ who happen
(28:33) to be one, who work together for most of that time period. And as this comes
along, we'll react. But this is a very uncertain world that we live in. There's a lot of
unintended consequences, I've said that for a few years. And if any of these unintended
consequences that we've talked about, U.S. elections is one, you've got Brexit, you've got
China, which we keep emphasizing in our annual reports.
We recognized and we've said to you there's too much debt in the United States and in
the rest of the world. All of this monetary policy QE1, 2, 3, all haven't worked in any
significant way. So, when you see all of that, we like the fact that we have $10 billion-plus
of cash in our investment portfolios, with the idea that we can take advantage of
opportunity as and when it comes our way.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Understand. So, if I get the impression right, your view towards a deflationary world
has not changed, which then may suggest that long-dated bond at some point in time
may not be a bad place to be I gather (29:52).

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you very much, Paul. Yeah. No, our deflationary stance hasn't changed, but
our investments and deflation swaps have a cap on it. There are limited, but the
possibilities, of course, are there that they can do very well. So Gabby, next question
please.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

I've couple of (30:39) questions. You guys recently announced a deal to acquire a mix of
units and assets from AIG. I was hoping you could just kind of go into that in a little bit
more detail. It obviously plants a number of flags around the globe and fills in some spots
on the Fairfax map. I was also interested if you had an idea of just kind of what the
ballpark number of dollars of premiums that might be involved there.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, Mark, we're very excited, first of all, to become AIG's preferred network
provider, as I mentioned to you. So, what that means is, AIG has many global companies
that have been showing needs all over the world. So, we would, of course, look after
those requirements and provide outstanding service for them. Same people will be
servicing them that have serviced them in the past in all these countries. There's 13
countries involved. Seven of them, six in Latin America and Turkey, will have â€“ they're
independent companies. So, they have their own capital in Latin America and their
premiums. And so many of them are very well established â€“ all of them are well
established, but some of them â€“ in Argentina, I think it's about 80 years; Colombia, it's
about 40 years.
So, they're existing operations, very disciplined underwriting. AIG has been known in the
past for disciplined underwriting. And we'll manage them on a decentralized basis, with â€“
in case of Latin America, each of the country heads will run it separately. They will report
into Miami. We'll have a very small office in Miami and that will come through Bejean
(32:43), who has been in AIG for the better part of 20-plus years, and through Andy

FINAL

Bernard. And in the case of Eastern Europe, we have (32:56), who is looking at Eastern
Europe operations, reporting into Bejean (33:01) and Andy. So, this would fit directly. In the
case of Eastern Europe, it's branches, established in these countries with all the people,
with all the systems. But we will capitalize them through Colonnade, our Luxembourg
company and write the business through there.
So, so for us, we are very excited about this opportunity And we think in our structure, all
of these companies will be underwriting â€“ well, make an underwriting profit very soon,
likely in 2017. And then, of course, the investment income gives us diversification â€“ brand
diversification.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of premiums, if you add all of it and gross premiums, it will add up to, Mark, in the
$700 million, $800 million every year. That's gross premiums. And then, we'd be looking
at retaining â€“ we'd have to reinsure, of course, in terms of protecting us from exposures.
But the gross premium is at that level and we bought these operations at book value. And
so, we think over time this will be a good return for our shareholders. And of course, we
will provide outstanding service to AIG who will â€“ Fairfax will be their preferred network
partners. And in the future if they decide to divest any more countries, because it makes
sense for them, it's small, we'd be the obvious choice because they've worked with us
and we have AIG people with us, like Bejean (34:54), and we're really happy. And I said
this, but I want to say it again, we welcome the employees from AIG's operations to
Fairfax.
We're very excited. We met many of the leaders, but we're looking forward to meeting
the individual people, the individual employees. In total, that might be somewhere in the
1,500 area in terms of all of the countries.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Thank you for that. That's very comprehensive and certainly a relatively larger deal that
might have been suggested by the actual purchase price. The second question I have
related to Hurricane Matthew. Do you have any preliminary sense of what losses related
to that might be and, if nothing else, maybe just a sense of which operating units might
have exposure to that event?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah. And I'll pass that on Dave. Dave, your sense of that?

A - David James Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Yeah. So, Hurricane Matthew should not be a significant event for us. There will be a little
bit of exposure at Crum & Forster and some at Odyssey and perhaps a bit at Brit. But I
wouldn't expect anything significant in terms of Hurricane Matthew in the fourth quarter
from Fairfax.

Of course, as you know, Mark, that Hurricane Matthew went along the coast and could
have been a much bigger event. But the industry and all of us were very fortunate,
including the residents in Florida that it didn't come in earlier or sooner. And so, yeah, we
don't think it's going to be a very significant event, Mark.

FINAL

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Very good. That's all my questions. Thanks.

Operator
Thank you.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Mark. Next question, please? Yeah.

Operator
Yes. Thank you. Our next question is from Howard Flinker of Flinker & Company. Sir, your
line is open.

Q - Howard Flinker

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks. Hi, Prem.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Hey. Good morning, Howard.

Q - Howard Flinker
Hi. Just two or three technical questions. In the inflationary hedge, is bps basis points?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yes.

A - David James Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Yes. It is.

Q - Howard Flinker
And second, if you choose and deflation emerges, can you refund or cash in those
hedges before maturity, or do you have to wait till maturity?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

No. They're tradable instruments, Howard. And so, they have a maturity of, say, six years
on average.

Q - Howard Flinker
Right.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

FINAL

But you can trade them before. Same sort of structure as credit default swaps that we
acquired some years back.

Q - Howard Flinker
Good.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

And they had five years â€“ seven years to maturity, but you can trade in the market, that
you can trade them on. And so, yeah, we would of course â€“ we never waited for maturity
in credit default swaps investments there and unlikely we'll wait for maturity in this case
too.

Q - Howard Flinker
And finally, the phone was breaking up as you were saying what I thought were premiums
written for the AIG subsidiaries acquired. Did you say about $800 million in premiums
written?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah, I said $700 million to $800 million. So, $700 million to $800 million, yeah. So, it's
relatively significant for us in terms of premium.

Q - Howard Flinker
Good to see you the other day. Thanks.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Thanks. Yeah. Thank you very much, Howard.

Q - Howard Flinker
You're welcome.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}
