FINAL

Thank you, Paul. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Fairfax's First Quarter
conference call. I plan to give you some of the highlights, and then pass it on to Dave
Bonham, our CFO, for additional financial details.
First quarter of 2013 book value per share increased by 1.3%, adjusted for the $10 per
share common dividend paid in the First Quarter of 2013. We had a strong underwriting
result in the First Quarter of 2013 on increased premiums, while maintaining disciplined
underwriting. We are maintaining our defensive equity hedges, as we remain concerned
about the financial markets and the economic outlook. We continue to be soundly
financed, with quarter-end cash and marketable securities at the Holding Company in
excess of $1.2 billion. Net premiums written by the Company's insurance and reinsurance
operations in the First Quarter of 2013 increased by 5.5% to $1.606 billion, due primarily to
increased property business at Odyssey Re, continued year-over-year rate increases at
Zenith, modest growth and increased premium retention at Northbridge, and modest
growth at Fairfax Asia.
At the subsidiary levels, net premiums written in quarter-one 2013 and combined ratios
were as follows. Odyssey Re, up 13.6%, with a combined ratio of 82.9%; Crum & Forster,
premiums were down 5.6%, with a combined ratio a little below 100%, 99.7%;
Northbridge, premiums were up 6.5%, with a combined ratio of 100.5%; Zenith, premiums
were up 11.9%, with a combined ratio of 110.2%; and Fairfax Asia, premiums were up 4.5%,
with a combined ratio of 91%.
Just a quick comment on Zenith -- its combined ratio is still 110.2%. Over 30 years before
our purchase -- so prior to our purchase, 30 years of history, Zenith had a combined ratio,
on average, of 95%. And its loss ratio over that 30 years was 15 to 20 points better than
the industry. And so it's a terrific track record since our purchase, because the business
has been shrunk -- has come down significantly. The combined ratios have been running
at 125% to 130%, come down to 110%, and we think Zenith is well on its way.
So in the First Quarter, we continued to grow. Very low interest rates and the reduced
reserve redundancies means there is no place to hide for the industry, as I've said before.
Combined ratios have to drop well below 100% for the industry to make a single-digit
return on equity with these low interest rates. While the short term is always tough to
predict, fundamentals will eventually play out.
Net investment gains of $9.4 million in the First Quarter of 2013 consisted of the following.
Please note the table on page two of our press release. You'll see in that table, net gains
on equity and equity-related investments of $698 million were predominately unrealized,
and were neutralized by net unrealized losses of $593 million on our equity hedges. After
unrealized bond losses of $119 million, and $32 million in unrealized CPI-linked derivative
losses, resulting in a net gain of $9.4 million -- all unrealized. Realized gains from stocks
and bonds during the quarter were $165.3 million. The Company held in excess of $1.2

FINAL

billion of cash, short-term investments and marketable securities at the Holding-Company
level at March 31, 2013. Finally, we continue to be approximately 100% hedged in relation
to our equity and equity-related securities, which includes convertible bonds and
convertible preferred stock.
We continue to be very concerned about the prospects for the financial markets and the
economies of North America and Western Europe, accentuated by potential weakness in
China. There continues to be a big disconnect between the financial markets and the
underlying economic fundamentals. As at March 31, 2013, we have over 27%, or $7 billion,
in cash and short-term investments in our portfolios to take advantage of opportunities
that come our way. In the short term, our investment income will be reduced.
Now I would like to turn it over to Dave, so he can give you some more information on the
underlying financials. Dave?

Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Thank you, Prem. First, I'll focus on Fairfax's consolidated results for the First Quarter of
2013. Then I'll move on to the operating company results; and finally, I'll finish up with the
consolidated financial position.

Bloomberg Transcript

For the First Quarter of 2013, Fairfax reported net earnings of $162 million, or $7.12 per
share on a fully diluted basis. That compares to the First Quarter of 2012, when we
reported a net loss of $3 million, or a loss of $0.76 per share on a fully diluted basis.
Turning to the underwriting results of our insurance and reinsurance operations, in the
First Quarter of 2013, Fairfax reported a consolidated combined ratio of 94%, and an
underwriting profit of $86 million. That compares to the consolidated combined ratio of
98.8%, and the underwriting profit of $16 million that we had in Q1 last year. Currentperiod catastrophe losses were comparable year over year; and in the First Quarter of
2013, we had just over $32 million of current-period catastrophe losses, adding about 2.3
points to our combined ratio. That compares to the First Quarter of 2012, where we had
$26 million of catastrophe losses, adding about 2 points to our combined ratio.
In terms of our reserve development, we experienced $36 million of net favorable
development to prior years' reserves, and that benefited our combined ratio in the First
Quarter of 2013 by 2.5 points, compared to just $2 million of net favorable reserve
development in the First Quarter of 2012, which had a nominal effect on our combined
ratio. Our accident-year combined ratio in the First Quarter of 2013 was 96.5%, and that
compares to 98.9% in the First Quarter of 2012. That improvement is primarily reflective of
lower year-over-year non-catastrophe-related large losses, and a decrease in the
accident-year loss ratio at Zenith National.
Now turning to our operating company results, starting with Odyssey Re. In the First
Quarter of 2013, Odyssey Re reported an underwriting profit of $95 million and a
combined ratio of 82.9%, and that compares to an underwriting profit of $64 million and a
combined ratio of 87% in the First Quarter of 2012. Catastrophe losses were relatively

FINAL

light, at $32 million, representing 5.8 combined ratio points, but slightly higher than the
First Quarter of 2012, where we saw catastrophe losses of $24 million, representing 4.8
combined ratio points.
In the First Quarter of 2013, Odyssey Re's combined ratio included the benefit of 3.2
points, or $18 million, of net favorable reserve development, and that principally related to
favorable emergence on prior years' catastrophe losses. Odyssey wrote $604 million of
net premiums in the First Quarter of 2013, and that was up from $526 million in the First
Quarter of 2012. That increase reflected the impact of a Florida property quota share
reinsurance contract that incepted on June 1, 2012, and also reflected increased
retentions of US crop insurance business.
Moving on to Crum & Forster. Crum & Forster reported an underwriting profit of $1 million,
and a combined ratio of 99.7% in the First Quarter of 2013. That compared to an
underwriting loss of $14 million, and a combined ratio of 105.1% in the First Quarter of
2012. The improvement in Crum & Forster's underwriting results was due to changes in
the mix of business to focus on more profitable lines, and the absence of net adverse
development of prior years' reserves, which added $5 million to the underwriting loss in
the First Quarter of 2012.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net premiums written by Crum & Forster decreased from $308 million in the First Quarter
of 2012 to $291 million in the First Quarter of 2013. The net premiums written at Crum &
Forster were impacted by decisions to exit less profitable lines of business, and that was
partially offset by the continuation of the growth in specialty lines of business, which
present greater opportunities for profitability.
Zenith National reported a combined ratio of 110.2% in the First Quarter of 2013, and that
compared to 117.7% in the same period last year. The year-over-year improvement
primarily reflected earned premium price increases in the First Quarter of 2013 that
exceeded Zenith's estimates of loss trends, and that also combined with a lower expense
ratio, as a result of an 11.1% year-over-year increase in net premiums earned. Net
premiums written by Zenith of $286 million during the First Quarter of 2013 increased year
over year by 11.9%, and that primarily reflecting premium rate increases.
Northbridge's combined ratio in the First Quarter of 2013 decreased from 104.3% in the
First Quarter of 2012 to 100.5% in the First Quarter of 2013. The improvement in the First
Quarter of 2013 reflected increased net favorable development of prior years' reserves,
and fewer non-catastrophe-related large losses and the absence of any current-period
catastrophe losses.
Net premiums written by Northbridge of $248 million in the First Quarter of 2013, and
$202 million in the First Quarter of 2012, require two adjustments to make them
comparable. First, Group Re, an affiliated reinsurer, returned $39 million of premium to
Northbridge, effective January 1, 2013, following the cancellation of a 10% intercompany
quota share reinsurance contract. Second, Northbridge's net premiums written in the First
Quarter of 2012 included $5 million related to its US property business, which was
renewed by an insurance subsidiary of Odyssey Re, effective May 1, 2012. So excluding

FINAL

the $39 million of net premiums written from the First Quarter of 2013, and adjusting for
the impact of the non-renewal of the US property business, Northbridge's net premiums
written increased by 6.5% in US dollar terms in the First Quarter of 2013. Page 39 of our
First Quarter interim report describes these adjustments I just mentioned in more detail.
Fairfax Asia's combined ratio improved modestly from 92% in the First Quarter of 2012 to
91% in the First Quarter of 2013. Net premiums written by Fairfax Asia increased by 4.5%,
to $76 million in 2013 from $73 million in 2012, and this was principally as a result of
increased writings of property, commercial automobile, and engineering lines of business.
The combined ratio of the insurance and reinsurance Other division improved from 101.7%
in the First Quarter of 2012 to 98.4% in 2013, primarily reflecting increased net favorable
development of prior years' reserves in the First Quarter of 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

Run-off reported a pretax loss of $14 million in the First Quarter, compared to a pretax
profit of $54 million in the First Quarter of 2012, and this was principally as a result of net
investment losses of $13 million in 2013, which compared to net investment gains of $51
million in the First Quarter of 2012. Included in the Run-off result was a $33 million gain
recognized on the commutation of a reinsurance recoverable, and this was partially offset
by reserve strengthening at US Run-off of about $31 million. The commutation allowed
Run-off to receive cash of approximately $119 million in satisfaction of a reinsurance
recoverable, which they carried on their balance sheet at $86 million.
Our First Quarter consolidated interest and dividend income decreased from $130 million
in the First Quarter of 2012 to $100 million in the First Quarter of 2013. This decrease
primarily reflected lower investment income earned as a result of sales during 2012 of
higher-yielding (government) bonds, those principally being Canadian government bonds
and US Treasuries.
Rounding out our review of the income statement, the Company recorded a recovery of
income taxes of $51 million, despite $112 million of earnings before income taxes. The
following are the principal reasons why our effective tax rate differed from our statutory
tax rate. First, there was our regularly recurring adjustment, which was a benefit to our
statutory tax rate, related to non-taxable investment income, principally comprised of
non-taxable interest income on municipal bonds, non-taxable dividend income that is
received in the US and Canada, and certain capital gains which are only 50% taxable in
Canada.
Second, we had what we referred to in our press release as tax rate differences. This is
also a regularly recurring adjustment, and this quarter it benefited our statutory tax rate,
and it arises when we earn income or incur losses in jurisdictions where the tax rate is
different from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 26.5%.
And finally, as has occurred in prior years, we earned income in jurisdictions where
previously we had incurred operating losses, and we were able to use those operating
losses in the current quarter, but those operating losses from prior years had never been
set up as part of our deferred tax asset. For further details of what I just mentioned,

website.

FINAL

We ended the quarter with an investment portfolio which included Holding Company cash
and investments of $25.6 billion, compared to $26.1 billion at the end of 2012. A significant
portion of the decrease related to the effect of foreign currency translation and net cash
paid in connection with the reset provisions of the Company's total return swaps.
Moving to our financial position, our debt-to-total-capital ratio increased to 26.8% from
25.5% at December 31, 2012, due primarily to the additional debt we issued in the First
Quarter of the year. We retired $48 million of debt in the First Quarter, and we have $183
million of Odyssey Re debt maturing in the Fall of 2013. After repayment of the Odyssey
Re debt in November, on a pro forma basis, our debt-to-capital ratio is expected to return
to approximately 25.7%, more or less consistent with December 31, 2012.
And now I'll pass it back over to you, Prem.

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

Prem, you've mentioned that the insurance industry may have no place to hide going
forward here. We're starting to see some data that commercial lines pricing is improving
south of the border. And I'm just wondering, on a near-term basis here, what do you
believe is the outlook for this year and then into next year for a more definitive hardening
in the commercial market, south of the border?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes. So just to explain that comment. Interest rates today, five-year Treasury rates are
0.65%, like less than 70 basis points, Jeff, versus about 5%, five or six years ago. The hard
Page 6 of 12

market reserves, depending on how you define it, 2003 to 2006, or 2003 to 2008, is
between 10% and 20% of total reserves that exist on property-casualty insurance
companies' balance sheet today. So there's the ability to have the redundancies is
reduced significantly. And so when you take those two into account and you look at the
interplay of those two factors, even at a 95% combined ratio, you get a single digit return
on equity. And so it just means that prices have to continue to go up. They're going,
depending on the line, 5%, maybe a little higher. And workers compensation is higher,
10% plus. California's a little higher than that.
But we think the underlying fundamentals are attractive. But when you have a hard market,
you have prices going up much more than that. We're not in that type of hard market. But
we're certainly in a market that prices appear to be going up. Now, some prices may
come down. Property cat prices have gone up significantly after 2011. The Japanese
tsunami and the other catastrophes, the second largest cat year in 2011, well, they're
tending to flatten out and come down. So you have these fluctuations. But broadly
speaking the property-casualty industry that we operate in, the pricing is improving and
our business is improving. We've been growing now for a couple of years. In the First
Quarter, we grew about 5%, in total, for all our companies.

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. And maybe, Prem, you just contrast that with Canada. It seems like Canada's taking
longer to start to get any momentum behind it, and you've been doing a lot of work at
Northbridge. How do you feel in the process of that effort in Northbridge, where it stands
today, and how the Company there is positioned to move forward?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Northbridge for us -- we've been in Canada. We started in Canada. We've had 27 years.
Our Company is in very good shape. All our companies, by the way, have really good
reserving, which is very important. Because if you didn't, you're going to see companies
show reserve development. So Northbridge came out with a combined ratio a little above
100%, and we're comfortable with where the Company is, focused on getting it, of
course, below 100, under Silvy Wright's leadership. But Canada's always lagged, Jeff, the
US. The US goes down a lot more than us and then comes back up, also significantly. We
don't go down as much and we lag the United States.
I must also say -- and we said this at the annual meeting -- that our new structure, with
Andy Barnard responsible for our insurance companies, property-casualty insurance
companies worldwide, is also a big plus in terms of the focus on underwriting profitability.
We've also always had a focus on underwriting profitability. It's accentuated by the fact
that Andy's responsible for these companies all over the world. So yes, Jeff, we're very
positive about what's happening at Northbridge.

Paul Holden, JIBC.

Q - Paul Holden

Just one question for you, Prem. You've talked about reserve releases for the industry,
and it looks like probably that they're running out on redundancies. And we've seen a
pretty high favorable reserve development out of Fairfax for the last four consecutive
quarters now. Is there much more room for Fairfax to be able to release reserves, or is
that pretty much played out, as well?

A - Prem Watsa

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Well this is a good question, Jeff. What we try to do is we always keep our accident loss
ratios, accident combined ratios, which we've shown you by our company, at a high level,
and with the idea that over time, we might have some redundancies. But it's fair to say
that for the industry and ourselves, that the surpluses of the hard market are much
reduced. So it's fair to say. We just have a very strong reserving policy at Fairfax that, over
time, as I've showed you in our annual report, we need to see redundancies as opposed
to efficiencies, in hard markets and soft markets. So that's just the policy we've got. But
your point's well taken. Those will be more difficult for us to show, as time goes by. But
our policy's very much in place.

Operator
Mark Dwelle, RBC Capital Markets.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

I think I have two questions. One is related to the reinsurance commutation in the Run-off
segment and the reserve addition for asbestos. Were those two things linked, which is to
say the reason you got the higher amount of commutation was because you recorded the
additional amount, or were those two separate things that just happened to have a similar
dollar amount?

Page 8 of 12



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td

Date: 2013-05-03

FINAL

No. That's a good question, Mark. No. They're separate items. And I've said to you in the
past, we always look at commuting our reinsurance recoverables, because when you
commute those recoverables, you get cash in your hand. But you have to do it at
appropriate prices. So we did what we think is a very good commutation. But at the same
time, we increased reserves separately on asbestos and pollution, environmental
reserves. But they were separate. They were not linked.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks for that. And the second question I had, I wanted to spend a little bit more
time on the tax rate. You itemize the three things that were largely in the footnote. The
question I'm ultimately trying to get at is, we obviously had gains that were in areas where
we hadn't usually had gains and were able to utilize some deferred tax benefit. What
would be the better way to think about the full-year tax run rate for the year, or an
effective rate that would be kind of normalized? Obviously, there's always timing
differences with where gains and things occur, but trying to really get at the operating run
rate of the business and what the appropriate tax rate on that should be.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, Mark, that's a very good question. Let me pass it on to Dave. Let me say that, while
Dave answers, let's focus on the First Quarter. Then remember that we have worldwide
operations, Mark. So we have it in the United States, which has a higher tax rate than in
Canada; and then you have operations in different parts of the world, and so the tax rates
can be different. But Dave, in the First Quarter, you've got a nice breakdown on why we
had recovery in the First Quarter. Then perhaps just a comment for the whole year?

A - Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Sure. Mark, in addition to what I mentioned, what I might add is what you're seeing are
adjustments that we have every quarter. They're regularly recurring. And this quarter they
just happened to be magnified a little bit by the fact that we have lower pretax earnings,
and that's combined with just the mix of where our earnings were earned in the current
quarter. And that mix, if you looked at it, is in low tax jurisdictions, we had earnings; and
that was offset by some losses in higher tax jurisdictions. So what I would say there is it's
just what you're seeing in the quarter is just a difference in the mix of where we had
earnings and losses. And for your full-year outlook, I think if you looked at our earnings
and it was more of a normalized level of earnings, then you'd probably start to see an
effective tax rate return to where it's been in the past seven or eight quarters. And I think
that's in the neighborhood of about 25% to 30%. But that's going to vary, once again,
depending on where we have earnings and losses around the world.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

So Dave, if you look at BRIC. We made a very significant gain in BRIC. And so as far as our
taxes on BRIC were concerned, you mentioned there the 50% -- only 50% get into capital
gains, and also where the BRIC position might have been held in our worldwide
operations.

A - Dave Bonham

Page 9 of 12



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2013-05-03

Yes. The BRIC gain was about 80% taxable under Canadian tax rules, so it was taxed at
50%. And if you looked at what the effective rate on that gain alone was, it was about 17%.
So that would be a typical example of an item that would be a benefit, or would reduce
our effective tax rate.

This is a question of clarification. If we guess that workers comp rates rose 12% or 14%, is
that pure rate or is that 90% rate and 10% is higher payrolls?

No. That would be pure rate, right? I'm just looking at our -- yes, that would be pure rate,

Can you provide some commentary on your cash position? I believe this quarter it was
about 27% of your full investment portfolio. And you mentioned on the call that you'd
probably hold onto the cash until some opportunities arose. And what would those
opportunities look like for you to deploy that cash?

FINAL

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Well you never can say, these opportunities develop. You never can say when they will
develop and what they will be. But this I can tell you, you won't be able to take advantage
of them unless you have cash or cash-like investments. So if I go back to 2008, 2009, the
stock markets dropped significantly, you had spreads widen dramatically. Well because we
had cash, we could take advantage of that opportunity. For example, in the last two
months of, in the last quarter of 2008, we bought approximately $4 billion of muni bonds
at about 5.75% after-tax yield, in two months. $300 million a day, $500 million a day.
Where today, you can't buy $10 million of those bonds.
So it's that ability to take advantage of the opportunity. But on the other hand, the cost is
you don't make any investment income today on the 27% cash, the $7 billion-plus of cash
that we have. That's why we've always focused on the long-term, and we've always said
that our earnings are going to be lumpy and we're focused on increasing our book value
over time. Our earnings and our book value on a quarter-by-quarter, perhaps even on a
yearly basis, are very tough to predict. But as you know, over 27 years, our record is quite
good.

Thanks. And I have one follow-up. Can you remind us of how much capacity you have to
write in a hardening market. I think a couple of quarters ago, you used to say you could
probably bump up your premiums by 50%, or around there, in a hardening market. Is that
--

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

In a hardening market, we've got -- we write about $6 billion in premium. We have about
$8 billion in equity capital, $2 billion, say, of net debt. So that's $10 billion. So if you look at
our premium, this is our worldwide premium, $6 billion on $10 billion, that's 0.6 times. And
that ratio can be 1.5 times. The last hard market, we took it to 1.5 times. So what that
means is that each of our companies separately would be able to double our premium,
approximately, which would result in the $6 billion going to $12 billion. We don't know when
that will take place, or even if that will take place. But if the conditions are right, rest
assured, we'll take advantage of the opportunity.
