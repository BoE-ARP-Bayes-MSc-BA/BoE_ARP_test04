Thanks, Rick, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today. Last night,
AXIS reported third quarter operating income of $133 million or $1.27 per diluted share and annualized
operating ROE of 10.1%. We ended the quarter with diluted book value per share of $49.88, an
increase of 12% over the last year. Adjusted for dividends, diluted book value grew 14% over the past
12 months.
We achieved the strong result notwithstanding weak equity markets, which held back our investment
income in the quarter. In addition, we returned $179 million in capital to our shareholders through
share purchases and common share dividends in the quarter and $556 million year-to-date, thus
returning to shareholders 126% of year-to-date operating income in the form of dividends and share
repurchases.
AXIS delivered solid underwriting results, reflecting low cat activity, ongoing favorable reserve
development, a broadly diversified portfolio of risks, and a more holistic approach to risk
management. We're also starting to observe favorable outcomes from some of our targeted
portfolio enhancement activities.
Overall, we report a consolidated combined ratio of 92.2%, including 2.2 points of cats and 6.7 points
of favorable prior-year reserve development. Like most other participants in the crop business, we
did accrue additional reserves in response to the dramatic drop in agricultural commodity prices over
the summer, and this is reflected in our combined ratio.
However, we also purchased some hedges and ceded some of the rest of third-party capital
providers such that our ultimate net loss was meaningfully reduced from the gross result. While the
benefit of these transactions is included in our consolidated earnings, they are not reflected in our
reported combined ratio. Adjusting our results to reflect the positive impact of these actions on our
net retained underwriting results, the adjusted combined ratio for our company for the retained risk
would improve to 90.5% and the adjusted combined ratio for our reinsurance business improves to
an attractive 78.3%.

FINAL

We continue to make progress on a number of initiatives during the quarter, including our Lloyd's
Syndicate, our new medical malpractice unit, the re-entry into U.S. primary casualty, our weather and
commodities business, and AXIS Re Ventures. And the contribution of our A&H business remains
around break even for the second quarter in a row.
Our accident and health team is working diligently to optimize the balance between insurance and
reinsurance and between U.S. and international, and to expand product and distribution across
geographies. We also continue to make progress in analytics and expense control initiatives that will
drive underlying improvements in our results, independent of the vagaries of the P&C cycle.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Joe to discuss our financial results for the quarter. Joe?

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we generated good results
with an annualized operating ROE of 10.1%. Our quarterly diluted book value per common share, a
key metric in measuring the value we generate for our shareholders, increased by 0.4% to $49.88
per share.
The growth in our diluted book value per share over the past 12 months was 12%. When our dividends
declared of $0.27 per quarter are added to the growth and book value, the total value created for
our shareholders over the last 12 months was almost 14%. Third-quarter results benefited from a
reduction in the level of natural catastrophe and weather-related losses compared to the same
period of last year and the continued favorable prior year development in our loss reserves. These
positive factors were offset by an increase in our current accident year loss ratio for reasons I will
explain shortly and a decrease in net investment income, which was impacted by a decrease in
returns from our alternative investment portfolio.
Other notable items in our quarterly results include a large increase in foreign exchange gains, driven
by the impact of the significant appreciation of the U.S. dollar on our foreign denominated liabilities
and a sizeable increase in realized gains on our investments, which reflects sales of common stocks,
which have seen significant appreciation during 2013 and 2014.
Moving into the details of the income statement, our third-quarter gross premiums written decreased
modestly by 1% to $897 million, with decreases in our insurance segment being largely offset by
growth from our reinsurance segment.
In our insurance segment, our top line was down $19 million or 3% and reflected decreases in
accident and health due primarily to timing differences and professional lines where the decreases
reflect the continued reshaping of our U.S. D&O portfolio. These decreases were partially offset by
our aviation lines, which were positively impacted by the timing of renewals of certain policies and
new business.
In our reinsurance segment, our top line was up $12 million or 3%. The increase was driven by our
liability lines of business and was primarily due to a multi-year quota share treaty with an existing
client, which generated $35 million of premium related to future years. This increase was partially
offset by decreases in the agriculture, professional and property lines, which reflected non-renewals,
treaty decreases and changes to premium estimates.
For the first nine months of the year, our gross premiums written were $3.9 billion, a growth rate of
2% compared to the first nine months of 2013. This increase was driven by growth in the reinsurance

FINAL

segment of 6% and was significantly impacted by the level of contracts written on a multi-year basis
in the liability, property, catastrophe, and motor lines, with premiums written of $131 million relating to
future underwriting years.
Growth in the reinsurance segment premiums was partially offset by a decrease of 2% in the
premiums written in the insurance segment. Our consolidated net premiums written were down 4%
for the current quarter. The reduction was driven by an overall decrease in written premium as well as
increased ceded premiums due to the increased reinsurance protection purchased primarily in our
insurance professional lines of business and the impact of changes in the business mix.
Our net premiums earned increased by 2% to $966 million in the third quarter of 2014. Increases
were noted in both segments, which insurance increasing by 3%, reflecting the continued growth of
our accident and health book, business written in recent periods in the liability and professional lines,
and the positive impact of the reductions in our ceded reinsurance programs implemented during
2013. Reinsurance increased by 1% with the growth in liability, motor and professional lines being the
most noteworthy.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our year-to-date growth in net earned premiums of 5% to $2.9 billion was primarily impacted by the
same lines of business as a quarterly increase, with a continued expansion of our agriculture business
also adding to the year-to-date growth in the reinsurance segment. Our third quarter consolidated
current accident year loss ratio increased 2.3 points to 63.8% compared to the same period of last
year. Our year-to-date loss ratio was comparable at 63.7%.
In our insurance segment, the third quarter 2014 current accident year loss ratio increased 8.8 points
to 64.7%. Q3 2013 was a very quiet quarter with regard to losses incurred. The current quarter was
impacted by natural catastrophe and weather-related losses of $19 million, attributable primarily to
weather losses in North America. In addition, the loss ratio was impacted by higher underwriting loss
ratios for the property classes of business, reflecting recent loss experience and the change in the
business mix with a shift towards less volatile lines of business that carry our higher loss ratio.
It should also be highlighted the actions we have taken in reshaping of our U.S. D&O portfolio during
the current year have resulted in a positive quarterly loss share variance on this line of business
compared to the prior quarter and Q3 2013. For the year-to-date, the current accident year loss ratio
for insurance is 66.7%, up from 63.8% for the comparable period of 2013, generally driven by the
same factors I just discussed.
For our reinsurance business, the third quarter 2014 current accident year loss ratio was down 3.6
points to 63%. Current quarter's results included an insignificant amount of losses related to natural
catastrophe and weather compared to $51 million net of reinstatements incurred in Q3 2013. Net of
cat and weather-related losses, the current accident year loss ratio increased primarily due to an
increase in the agricultural loss provisions following a significant drop in commodity prices, in
particular, corn, during the quarter.
Now, as you are aware, we hedged some of our exposures to agricultural price variations. During the
quarter, the variations in the prices of agriculture commodities produced positive mark-to-market
returns on our derivative hedge positions of $8 million. The increase in the value of our agricultural
hedges is reported as part of other insurance-related income in line with the applicable U.S. GAAP
rules. In addition, we ceded a portion of our agriculture book to our third-party vehicle, AXIS Ventures
Reinsurance Limited. AXIS Ventures is a variable interest entity and is consolidated in our financial
statements.

FINAL

As such the impact of the session, which is positive to AXIS during the quarter, is included in amounts
attributable to non-controlling interests. After the benefits incurred from the hedge and sessions to
AXIS Ventures, the net pre-tax impact of these agricultural losses on the quarterly net income
attributable to AXIS Capital was $22 million.
We realized that the accounting rules may make the full understanding of the movements in our
reinsurance segment difficult. As such, in order to aid you in evaluating the performance of this
segment, we have added an additional page in our financial supplement, which provides more
information on the impact of the session to AXIS Ventures and the agricultural hedges on our
reinsurance segment and group results.
As Albert indicated earlier, adjusting for these offsets, the adjusted reinsurance loss ratio would be
47.5% and the adjusted reinsurance combined ratio would be 78.3%, a 3.8% reduction from the
reported combined ratio of 82.1%.
Other notable items that contributed to the variance in the reinsurance current accident year loss
ratio included changes in the business mix, which was primarily offset by a reduction in attritional
losses, most notably in the credit and surety lines of business.

Bloomberg Transcript

For the first nine months of the year, the current accident year loss ratio for reinsurance decreased by
2.5 points to 61% on a reported basis, primarily driven by the reduced level of natural catastrophe
and weather-related losses.
Turning to loss reserves established in prior years, our results continue to benefit from net favorable
loss reserve development, which aggregated to $65 million during the third quarter. Short-tail classes
in both segments contributed $61 million of this balance, primarily reflecting better than expected
loss emergence.
In addition, we continue to give way to actuarial methods that reflect our favorable experience for our
reinsurance professional lines, which contributed $10 million reflecting lower ultimate loss estimates
primarily for accident years 2010 and prior. Our year-to-date favorable loss reserve development was
$193 million compared to $177 million recognized during the first nine months of 2013.
During the third quarter and the first nine months of 2014, our acquisition cost ratio increased by 0.8
points and 1.2 points respectively compared to the same periods in 2013. Increases were noted in
both segments. However, they were more pronounced in insurance due to the changes in the mix of
business and reduced commissions received, given the changes in our ceded reinsurance programs.
The increases in reinsurance were primarily driven by higher acquisition cost paid on certain lines of
business as well as variances in accruals for loss-sensitive features in underlying contracts.
Our total general and administrative expenses increased, driven by personnel costs, professional
fees and other related expenses associated with the continued build-out of the company's global
platforms. As we mentioned last year, we are incurring incremental cost now, which will benefit our
expense structure in future years.
Overall, the company reported an underwriting income of $113 million and a combined ratio of 92.2%
for the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our underwriting income is $349 million with a
combined ratio of 91.6%. Adjusted underwriting income for the quarter would be $6 million higher and
the combined ratio is lower after adjusting for price hedges and the sessions to AXIS ventures.

FINAL

Net investment income was $67 million for the quarter, down from $115 million in the previous quarter
and down from $103 million in the third quarter of last year. The most significant driver of the
decrease was the contribution to net investment income from our other investments portfolio. Other
investments produced a $3 million loss during the quarter versus a gain of $32 million last quarter and
a gain of $32 million in the third quarter of the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in income from
hedge funds, which was impacted by the weaker performance of equity markets during the quarter.
In aggregate, the total return on our cash and investment portfolio for the quarter was a negative
0.7%. The negative total return for the quarter was due mainly to a decline in prices on our fixed
maturity portfolio as a result of strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the widening of credit spreads on
both investment grade and high-yield corporate debt.
We continue to hold a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio with cash and invested assets totaling
$15.5 billion at September 30, down approximately 1.1% – $0.1 billion, excuse me, from June 30 and up
$0.7 billion from a year ago. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to proceeds from our
senior notes issuance, which was completed during the first quarter of 2014. The duration of our fixed
maturity portfolio was 2.9 years at September 30, no change from June 30 and down moderately
from 3.2 years at the end of September 2013. Our fixed maturities weighted average credit rating
remains unchanged at AA-minus.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our total capital at September 30, 2014 was $7.3 billion, including $1.5 billion of senior notes and $628
million of preferred equity, a decrease of $0.1 billion from $7.4 billion at June 30, 2014. During the
quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million common shares at an average price of $47.48 per share for a
total cost of $150 million. As of today, we have $300 million remaining authorization under our board
authorized share repurchase program for common share repurchases through December 31, 2015.
As discussed with you previously, provided that market and financial conditions remain the same, we
aim to return around 100% of our annual operating earnings to our shareholders through regular
dividends and share repurchases.
Our strategic expansion opportunities continue to progress well. We continue to be on target with
our growth plans up for our accident and health unit. Our Lloyd's vehicle is making good progress in
the London markets, and we've also expanded the capabilities of AXIS Ventures, our third-party
capital initiative during the quarter.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Albert.

Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Joe. Let's cover market conditions. In insurance, we continue to see a leveling-off in
pricing overall, with more pressure on some of the international property and specialty lines.
However, despite a slowdown in pricing, there is rationality in most price action and as much as it is
generally the lines that are performed reasonably well that are seeing the most pressure. There
remained good fundamentals and opportunities for profitable growth in many insurance lines of
business.
Within our insurance segment, the overall AXIS insurance rate change for the third quarter of 2014
was down 3%, a change from minus 2% last quarter and down from the plus 2% experienced in the
same quarter last year. Pricing declines and property-related lines drove this result. Casualty pricing
remains strong, although rate increases are moderated.

FINAL

Across property, casualty and professional lines, the U.S. is the strongest of the geographies in which
we operate with respect to pricing environment. This favorable U.S. market works in our favor, as
close to 60% of our global insurance business is generated locally out of our 12 offices spread across
the country.
In our U.S. division, overall rate change was minus 1% from flat last quarter after 12 consecutive
quarters of positive rate change, and we also maintained strong renewal retention across all lines.
Price weakened in most of the property lines while casualty lines continued in a positive direction.
Casualty rate increases have begun to slow after steady increases since 2010.
Our own underwriting activity has reflected these trends with new business in our U.S. P&C
operations primarily comprised of casualty lines, with the greatest contributions from U.S. excess
casualty where prices benefited from more than three years of rate improvement.

Bloomberg Transcript

In our professional lines division, overall, rate was flat, in line with the second quarter and broadly
stable since 2012. 84% of the portfolio experienced flat to higher rates. As in previous quarters, rate
changes are generally positive on primary accounts, while excess layers, which have seen good
performance in the past few years, remain under pressure.
Classes which require additional rate, such as primary public D&O and film in the U.S. or surveyors in
the UK PI book are showing the strongest positive rate changes. After international specialty markets,
after strong pricing conditions and generally good industry results for close to three years, prices
began to come down at the end of last year. They were down 8% on average for us this quarter. As
usual, there were wide variations in rate, depending on the line of business or geography. Energy
lines drove most of the change. And while aviation and tourism have historically shown weak price
action, we now expect recent aviation losses to provide some impetus for better aviation pricing.
Our international division had delivered very strong underwriting profitability over the years, and even
with the recent price cuts, we believe that many lines remain reasonably priced. We continue to look
for profitable growth and are expanding our opportunity set through our Lloyd's presence and other
distribution initiatives.
So, overall, the insurance business still has plenty of opportunities to write attractive business. Access
to the business and risk selections are increasingly an important differentiator in the markets, and
from our perspective, AXIS is very well positioned in that regard.
Moving on to reinsurance, momentum in the last 18 months has resulted in a shift to what we believe
is a buyer's market in most classes of business and regions. Abundant capacity, strong balance
sheets and consolidation of reinsurance buying continue to pressure reinsurance pricing across most
territories and lines of business. This has been coupled with some movement in terms and
conditions. Multi-year commitments are in great demand, broadly impacting all lines of business. And
non-concurrency of terms is more prevalent in the marketplace.
As you've heard from Joe, we participated selectively at a number of multi-year facilities where it
made sense for us to do so. The declining number of attractive opportunities in property catastrophe
has encouraged traditional reinsurers to move aggressively into casualty lines, leading to softer terms
most visibly evidenced by increases in ceding commissions. However, in many cases, some of these
higher ceding commissions are offset by improvements in primary pricing, such as margins are not
down as much as would be indicated by the changes in cedes.

Page 7 of 18

FINAL

While reinsurance terms are not ideal, underlying businesses are performing well across most of our
major product lines, as indicated by our current year results. Many areas under pressure are still
generating adequate margins, although in some cases there isn't much room left. As the growing
number of cedents look to reduce the number of reinsurers on their panels, we are benefiting as a
highly rated global multi-line insurer with excellent service and strong relationships. This coupled with
our innovation and technical strength is allowing us to better defend our positions and mitigate the
worst effects of a highly competitive market.
Looking back on the most recent renewals, we reduced or non-renewed a number of treaties. We
weren't the only ones. And we are beginning to see evidence of pushback on pricing, terms and
conditions that reach too far. While we continue to anticipate further pressure, we interpret these
developments as indications that we're approaching a slower rate of decline in pricing.
In conclusion, there is no favorable tide to lift all boats in a transitioning market. Quality of
relationships, brand reputation, service and claims management, financial strength and ratings all
influence access to business opportunities. Risk selection, risk management and portfolio
construction are paramount in extracting the best performance out of a declining market. In these
attributes, AXIS has a strong track record, and we are convinced that our investments in data,
analytics and employee training will all serve to make us even better. I'm confident of our ability to
navigate in these markets and continue to deliver superior value creation for our shareholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are not dependent on any one line or market and can afford to remain disciplined and pursue
only that business which we consider to be profitable and additive to our portfolio. And while we do
see some pressure on reinsurance business, we also get the benefit of better terms on the
reinsurance and retro that we purchase. So we have good balance.
Against a backdrop of more challenging market conditions, we believe our market reputation for
superior service, strong capital and superior ratings will allow AXIS to enhance its relative position and
access profitable business. We will continue to balance prudent growth and active capital
management to deliver the best outcomes for our shareholders.
At this point, I'd like to open the line for questions. Operator?

Q&A
Operator
Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes
from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you, and good morning.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

So my first question regarding to – you've been through sort of the business mix shift change
towards low volatility and potentially higher return business. In regard to that transition, you have seen
partly contributed to the significant rise in the core underwriting margin for the fourth quarter – for,
Page 8 of 18



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2014-10-30

like, four quarter in a row. I just wonder: are we sort of pretty much done in that process that we
would not see such a significant increase in core margin going forward?

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think it's a very good point and your observation is correct. And the best example that I would give
you is that we have seen the bulk of it. And as we're moving into our current unearned premium and
moving forward, you'll see less of an impact coming in from the mix. And let me give you a statistic to
help you look at that.
On a year-to-date basis, we estimate that the change of mix added 1.9 loss ratio points to our results.
However, in the third quarter this year, the change in mix was only contributing 1.3 point to the
change. So, as you can see, we're leveling off, if you would, the growth rate that comes from mix,
and that should stabilize as we get into 2015.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. That's great. And then second question is just really shifting to your professional line, there – in
the U.S., there're some reserve issues last year, you took action on that. And so far, if I heard you
right, you actually have some reserve releases in that line, but why now you decided to purchase
more reinsurance?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

The purchase of the reinsurance was done earlier this year, and two things I would like to say. The
issues with the U.S., the primary D&O book, was less about reserve issues. It was more about the fact
that we'd recognized that the profitability of that book of business was not as good as we expected.
So we did make an adjustment in the fourth quarter of last year, but that was mostly for the within
(31:28) the period. And then, of course, we carried it forward into 2014 with a higher loss ratio.
I think that what we're trying to do, of course, is find the right balance with the improved terms that
we could get on the reinsurance that we purchased. We felt it was a good transaction to modestly
increase our sessions in the professional lines book. And as you know, over the last three years, four
years, we've actually increased and decreased our retentions annually based on what we believed
the reinsurance terms were. So there's nothing unusual, if you would, in trying to optimize the net
position. It was down the prior year. It was up the current year. And again, when we sit down for our
renewals next year, we'll determine what is the best way to purchase reinsurance to optimize the
book.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's great. If I can ask last sort of – like a quick question, do you have an exposure on the recent –
the rocket launch failure?
{BIO 1498813 <GO>}
Yeah, thank you. Obviously, this year, you had made some investments in a business you've been
taking about that and then put some upward pressure on your overhead. As we head into, I guess,
arguably, a less robust market -- I hate to use the word softer -- but they're certainly more
competitive. Could you see yourselves pulling back from those investments? Should we expect the
investments to continue or should they slow in 2015?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I presume you're referring to investments in new businesses or you're referring to what investment -?

New businesses. Again, the money you are spending, that's driving up your overhead ratio at this
point.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right. Well, the investment in new businesses can be found in a couple of areas, but you're absolutely
right with regards to the fact that in a number of our businesses, the G&A ratio is still too high given
the low level of volume in some of those businesses. I'm pleased to say that the businesses that we
chose to invest in, we believe, actually make very good sense for a company going forward. So,
obviously, with regard to A&H, which has been a big initiative going forward, we now feel pretty good
because, as we've mentioned now, the results year-to-date are essentially approaching very close to
breakeven. They've done very good performance for the last two quarters. And we think A&H is – our
decision to enter A&H is not a cyclical decision. Frankly, it's more of a secular decision about the
balance of our book of business.
Our growth efforts in casualty are – make a lot of sense. It's still a very strong market. There are some
opportunities, and I think it makes sense to grow that casualty business. We entered Lloyd's earlier
this year. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks and as you know from the analysis of the
business, our international specialty book has been an extremely profitable book over the years. And
although there are some pricing pressure there, it continues to be a very attractive book.
Now, the growth rate in certain lines of business might obviously move up and down based on the
opportunities, but the access that Lloyd's gives us to more international markets and more
opportunities to write in multiple jurisdictions, I think, is a clear winner. So all of these things make
sense. Ag, weather and commodities, that's going to be an area where there's going to be more risk
in the world going forward, and clearly there's going to be more demand for those products. So all of
these initiatives, I think, make sense to me.
If you look at med mal, which was our most recent one, clearly we believe med mal has seen some
pressure. And I don't expect that we'll see huge growth in the next couple of years, but again,
longer-term, we think it's a very good addition to our overall portfolio – diversified portfolio of
professional lines. So, whereas the pace of growth will of course respond to the opportunities as we
see them, we feel very good about the strategic rationale behind those expansion opportunities and
we will continue to invest in them. That said, if it means that we have to slow down the growth
because it's the right thing to do, we will not hesitate to do so.

Thank you. And the next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi, good morning. First is in the primary insurance operations, your accident year loss ratio ex-cats
really improved from the first half. I was curious what's driving that. Was it lower D&O or also was it
lower large losses?
{BIO 2023727 <GO>}
Yeah.
{BIO 6989856 <GO>}
Yes.
{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. In fact, one of the things that we indicated to you was that there would be a heavy influence of
the corrective actions in the runoff of the U.S. D&O book in the first half. And just to give you a sense
of it, the professional lines added 1.5 points to the first-half loss ratio for insurance, and they didn't in
the third quarter. So we had told you that it was our expectation that the runoff of professional lines
would start to have a visible impact on the loss ratio going forward and that's happening as we
speak.
As you know, we still have a little bit of UPR to earn into the fourth and then de minimis amounts
amount will carry on into early 2015. But more importantly than the runoff of the UPR is our team is
doing incredibly good work at repositioning the portfolio and in making sure that we've got the right
balance and the right attachment points and that really is going well on plan.
I can't help but speak a little bit about the facts that there is a lot of talk in the market today about
healthcare, D&O and some of those issues creating problems for a number of companies. And I feel
compelled to remind you that that's exactly what we were discussing with you when we discussed
the fourth quarter results and anticipating some of these trends and taking early action to try and
reposition our portfolio, as we were seeing these trends happening. So I think that where we are in
U.S. D&O is where we want to be, given where we started.
{BIO 6989856 <GO>}
Great. That's helpful. The second question, I just wanted to follow up on the 100 basis point to 200
basis point margin improvement. I mean, I think last quarter you said that you could improve the
accident year combined ex-cats by about 100 basis points to 200 basis points. So I just wanted a
clarification. Number one is – so, is that in 2015? And second is, we've seen the expenses actually go
up slightly third quarter, just wondering if you're still on track to deliver that by 2015 or is that more of
a 2016 target?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think the 100 basis points to 200 basis points makes sense. And in fact, you've already started to
see the implications of that in the discussions that we've just given you on the loss ratio. And again, I
think that there are some things that we will – on the expense side, that we will absolutely see next
year, but they were also be continuing investments. I believe Joe was very disciplined and always
saying that we actually expected an increase in our expense ratio in 2015 as we were investing
through these items.

FINAL

But as we're consolidating facilities, for example, you're seeing charges in our financials this year, but
these are facilities expenses that we will not have next year. So there will be a number of initiatives
that we will see immediate impact in 2015. Others and certainly most visibly the investments that
we're making in IT are likely going to be costing us more money in 2015 and we will start to see those
benefits in 2016 and 2017 in future years. But in the aggregate, I expect the expense ratio will actually
go up in 2015, but that within individual initiatives, we do expect that some of the initiatives that were
executed in 2014 will actually show us clear savings in 2015.

Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah, good morning. A couple questions here for you. First up, I wonder if you could talk a little bit
about some of these – the multi-year deals that you've done a couple this year. And I guess the
question is, why are we seeing the big increase in multi-year deals? Is that a function of the need to
do that in order to secure renewals? Is it a function of you think that pricing is going to continue to get
more competitive here going forward? I wonder if you could elaborate that a little bit.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, let's first start with the basis that there has always been some amount of multi-year deals
in the industry. Number of clients, for example, who take their cat program and they buy a third – they
renew a third each year for three years, and the intent from the client of course is to have more
stability, both in supply and price going forward. So we've always had those. We have a number of
policies that have been two-year policies. So it's not something which is absolutely new, but it's
certainly something where we see significantly more demand. In our case, I would say that the vast
bulk of what we call multi-year deals are actually two-year deals. I don't have the number at the tip of
my tongue, but I would say that the number of three years deals is de minimis. So, what we're talking
about here is accommodating a client's desire to lock in what they believe are good terms.
Obviously, everybody knows that prices do respond to events, and to the extent that they have an
opportunity here to lock in good terms, they're happy to do so.
In our case, it really depends on the kind of client and the line of business and the profitability that
we're looking at. We tend to differentiate clients as opportunistic, transactional clients and
relationship clients. And certainly, for relationship clients, where it's our expectation that absent
anything really unusual, we would expect to renew those clients in any case. And to the extent that
we have appropriate protections in our contracts with regard to change in mix of business or change
in the teams or things that would cause us to revisit our appetite for that book-of-business, if it's
appropriately structured, reasonably priced with good relationship accounts, we will do so.
On the other hand, for a book-of-business, which we think is, quote, marginal or for terms that we
consider to be too aggressive or where we do not have adequate protections around the shift in the
book-of-business, we will not do so. So it's really being responsive, and in many cases, in the
reinsurance business, you do expect that you're going to renew it. So if we have adequate
protections, we will do so.

FINAL

Thanks. That was helpful. And then, I guess the second question, so last quarter, you gave us kind of
a baseline to think of with respect to a combined ratio or accident year combined ratio ex-cats and
kind of the improvement there. I'm wondering if you could give us something similar from an ROE
perspective. Is the baseline ROE here that you think you can improve upon, the kind of 11-ish% that
we're seeing right now this year, is it something lower in essence, it's been a pretty light cat this
year?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yeah. I would be loath to provide projections, but fundamentally, if you're looking at anywhere
between 2 points, 3 points, 4 points of combined ratio improvements to where we are, you're
essentially looking at with prudent capital management and a little bit better leverage, at somewhere
into 200 basis point to 300 basis point improvement in the ROEs.
Now again, I hasten to say that we talk about these things independent of pricing. There are a
number of other factors that will significantly impact our reported profitability; one being, of course,
events; the second is whatever pricing environment we are at the time; and third being the availability
of interest rates in the portfolio. So those are the factors. But what we believe is that the actions that
we are taking to optimize the portfolio, to increase operating leverage and to control expenses
should deliver somewhere between three points and four points of improvements in combined ratio
by the end of 2017. And at current capital levels, that should be somewhere in the 200 basis points to
300 basis points improvements in ROE, ceteris paribus.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

And of that, just curious since it's going to be lower volatility business, how much of that 300 basis
points or 400 basis points, if any, is actually lower cat losses?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That's a very good point, because on the one hand, we expect that this mix of businesses we've said
is going to cost us – it's a higher combined ratio book-of-business. So it's another extra point. We
would hope to offset that extra point with lower overall cat losses. So, for the moment, we're
assuming that's neutral. So the increase in the mix is offset by lower average cat losses.

Thank you. And the next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Hey, thank you very much. Good morning. I have a few question about AXIS Ventures. When you guys
founded it back in November 2013, it was described as a collateralized vehicle, which generally to me
means it's cat. You said that you expanded the operation this year. Is it no longer a cat vehicle or was
it always more than cat?
{BIO 2023727 <GO>}
I believe the amount of capital we have in that is a little higher than $50 million, but the $6 million is
the right number on the financials.

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}
The transactions that led to the loss, though, I assume, is one large transaction?

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, the loss by definition is tied to the agricultural business, which is what we referred to. So the
AXIS Ventures has – again, that piece of business has multiple transactions, most of which were in fact
profitable. The crop one obviously was not this year.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And could AXIS have written the crop business that it wrote without ceding that risk to AXIS Ventures
or were the two – was the transaction that AXIS did to expand the crop part-and-parcel to having the
reinsurance protection from AXIS Ventures?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Josh, I'm not sure that I would address it in that way. What I would say to you is that the crop business
is business that we were writing in any case and then we shared it. This was not a transaction that we
did to satisfy a specific demand from a capital provider. So somebody did not come to us and said,
here's X dollars, go find me that business. The crop business that we wrote was part of a diversified
crop portfolio that we intended to write at the beginning of the year. One of the things that we
absolutely believe is that over time companies like AXIS will have a steady supply and a diversified
supply of third-party capital.
And so, as we think about it, it's really critical for us to have a very, very strong, very powerful frontend with great people, great service, great brand, recruiting a great number of opportunities. That
would be the gross book that we're talking about. At that point, it's really up to us as a company to
determine how much of that gross risk that we've taken on board do we want to reinsure with
traditional underwriters, do we want to hedge in the capital markets, how much do we want to share
with third-party capital or other forms of capital, and how much do we want to keep for our own
account. All of those decisions are critical decisions in terms of optimizing the risk-adjusted returns for
our shareholders.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And in terms of the performance year-to-date for AXIS Ventures, do you think this in any way hurts
your ability to find third-party investors who want to invest with you in the future?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

It's an interesting question. One of the reasons that we've been reasonably slow in growing AXIS
Ventures and third-party capital is specifically because we want to make sure that we choose partners
who have a very good understanding of the risk that they are taking in a long-term commitment; two
is taking those risks and to partnering with us going forward. Nobody should be in the insurance
business if they don't expect occasional losses. And so, certainly, the conversation that we have with
our third-party capital providers demonstrates a very good understanding of the risks and an
appetite to accept occasional losses.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay. That's perfectly satisfying. Thank you.

Thank you. And the next question comes from Dan Farrell with Sterne, Agee.

Q - Dan Farrell

{BIO 4935961 <GO>}

Hi, and good morning.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Morning, Dan.

Q - Dan Farrell

{BIO 4935961 <GO>}

Just a capital management question. Your buyback is outpacing income currently. I think in your
prepared remarks, correct me if I'm wrong, you said you still think about capital returns sort of around
earnings power. So I'm wondering what that means for the near-term. But then also when we think
about your capital position, you're buying more reinsurance, you've lowered cat aggregates pretty
meaningfully and you've diversified the book. Wouldn't that be having a benefit to your overall capital
requirements allowing you to do capital return in excess of earnings? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Absolutely. And Dan, at the end of the day, you have to use as many levers as you can to optimize
your risk-adjusted returns. And so we will absolutely change the amount of risk we take in, whether
it's increasing or decreasing it, and you've seen the changes both in the mix of business and in the
geographic changes in the PMLs. We will increase or decrease the amount of reinsurance and now
retro that we buy. And in some cases, we will share some of that with third-party capital, all of which
are tools that we need to use to make the best of the business in a transitioning market.
You are absolutely correct that to the extent that we can cede business elsewhere or change the
input of the risk that we take, we may need less capital. All of those actions are things that we are
doing today, which is what has made us comfortable to increase our stock repurchases in excess of
our operating income. And to do so even in the wind season, because we felt so comfortable that
our risk management was such that we could afford to reduce our capital and still be in very strong
shape. So, again, difficult to make any directional predictions, but very much expect us to be active in
using all of those levers to optimize our risk-adjusted returns.

Q - Dan Farrell

{BIO 4935961 <GO>}

Great. Thanks. And then just a quick question on acquisition ratio. With the increased reinsurance
purchase, would you think in the insurance segment you'd see some downward trend in that and how
long does that sort of take to flow through?
{BIO 4281064 <GO>}
Thanks. Good morning. I don't know if it's fair to talk about a run rate for reserved releases, but we
did see a slowdown in the insurance segment on a year-over-year basis, and I was hoping you could
talk to that.

FINAL

Meyer, you're absolutely correct. It's totally inappropriate to talk about a run rate for reserve releases.
We stand by our position that the reserves that we have today are the reserves that we consider
prudent and adequate. And to the extent that our reserves next quarter would identify specific areas
where we believe we have more than we need, we would release it at that point in time.
That said, our philosophy has always been and will continue to be to reserve the current year
prudently, to take the bad news early, and to wait until further development of favorable news to
release it. That philosophy generally does tend to promote consistent reserve releases. And if you
look at our reserve releases certainly to-date, large amount of it really still relates to 2006, 2007 and
prior. Obviously, there is some for more recent years, but that would relate specifically to short-tail
property lines where, within two years, you know what there is. So we continue to apply the policy of
waiting for more maturity before reserve releases and that gives us comfort with regards to our total
reserve position.
{BIO 4281064 <GO>}
Okay. No, that's actually very helpful. And sort of bigger picture, I think, Albert, you mentioned in
response to Brian's question that the higher sort of core combined ratios of the less volatile business
will offset some of the cat provisions. Does that imply that you have to grow more dramatically than
we've seen in 2014 to produce the ROE improvement?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think that it's a – certainly in some parts of our business, there is a growth requirement. So we
mentioned when we talked about our plan over the summer, there were four key points. Right? And
one was improving the quality of the loss ratio, the second was profitable growth, and the third was
expense ratio reduction, and the fourth was capital efficiency. I think with regard to our new initiatives,
there is no doubt that our new initiatives currently are not all – have not all achieved their target
volume.
And as Joe pointed out, we've got an excess of $0.5 billion of new initiatives and they've grown
somewhere 17% plus year-to-date. So they are continuing to grow and we continue to be confident in
their ability to grow into the required scale to achieve their target numbers. And again, I hasten to
add that for those, we're generally quite satisfied with the technical ratios. It's really the ability of
those businesses to grow into their fixed expenses.
With regards to the rest of the portfolio, I'm not sure that we need to grow because we can always
balance it through further managements of the cat book. I do expect that we should grow some
more because I think it will be the right thing to do, but the pace of growth, of course, will depend on
the market.

Good morning, Charles.

FINAL

Q - Charles J. Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Good morning. First question, I guess, Joe, on your commentary on the professional lines loss ratio
improvement throughout this year, I think it's roughly about 230 basis points from the first quarter,
you mentioned, to the third quarter. I'm wondering what's – what were the levers that help achieve
that? It seems like a big move in a long tail liability line in a short period.
{BIO 2023727 <GO>}
And Charles, one more thing on this one. You remember that when we identified the issues in the
fourth quarter of last year, we immediately made some changes. And so what you're dealing with is
the fact that the new business that we're writing this year we feel very confident is being written at a
lower loss ratio. The issue was, running off the UPR. And so the amount of UPR that is running off at a
higher loss ratio has declined in each of the last three quarters. And as that UPR, which has been a
very heavy drag, on the loss ratio disappears, you see more of the quality of the rest of the business
and more of the quality of the business that we're putting on in the current year. So it's not so much
about a significant change in the view of the book. It's the fact that we had an isolated pocket of
business, which we are running off, and you are seeing the impact of the run-off.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Charles J. Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Can I ask about – the reinsurance business, if I look at the new slide disclosure you have, pulling out
the AXIS Ventures and look at the net premium in the reinsurance business, it's $290 million. And I
think, Joe, you said there's $35 million of multi-year net premium that hit this quarter.
{BIO 2023727 <GO>}
There's no question that the multi-year premiums are causing an increase, and absent the multi-year
premiums, there would be some pressure on the reinsurance growth. And that makes perfect sense,
given current market conditions, which you are all familiar with. We are writing less on certain lines of
business, and we are not renewing certain contracts, and that's putting some pressure. I think growth
in the reinsurance area this year and certainly, I would expect, into next year really needs to take
second place to profitability and balance of the book of business. And you have my commitment. We
are not going to write bad business just to show a pretty headline. So, reinsurance may have
opportunities to decline next year if we don't find the kind of business that we want.
Moving on what we do with that premium then becomes very interesting, because we could choose
to keep it net or we could choose to share some of that with third-party capital partners. And we
believe that it makes sense to start to establish as we have in a reasonable and modest way longterm partnerships with high-quality capital providers. And so we will share some of that so that on a
net basis, the impact of the market on our top-line revenue generation, top-line premium generation,
the third-party capital may in fact further accentuate the decline as we share some of that with the
third-party capital providers. But again, we believe it makes perfect sense to do so, both as a risk
mitigation opportunity, but more importantly, to grow what we believe will be an attractive business
model of writing business and then managing that risk, as I said earlier, through both internal
retentions, reinsurance, hedging, and third-party capital partners.

At the end of the day, what you had in the third quarter this year was some catch-up over some of
the modest profits – very modest profits that we had booked in the first half of this year, in addition
to recognizing what we believe will be the ultimate impact. Now, as I caution you, we are all using the
data that we have to make projections. We don't know what – we have a pretty good idea now that
it's October 30, as the price that will be utilized with MPCI, but we don't yet now have the details on
yield. So we're making some estimates, but at the end of the day, we believe that the 2014 harvest
