{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Linda, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining our
call. We're pleased to report growth in diluted book value per share adjusted for
dividends of 4% for the quarter and 10% for the last 12 months.
In the quarter, we were able to generate operating income of $101 million notwithstanding
negative performance of our hedge fund portfolio. Importantly, our underwriting
operations generated strong combined ratio of 91.9%. The strategic and tactical actions
we have implemented are positively impacting our overall results, notwithstanding a
competitive marketplace.
We continue to improve our overall portfolio, pursuing more attractive and lower volatility
business while, at the same time, shutting business where we do not feel we're getting
adequately compensated for risk or volatility. This was particularly evident in our
reinsurance segment where we are reaping the benefits of our increased investments in
customer-centric business initiatives.

FINAL

Our brand continues to improve, and we are seeing more opportunities than we have in a
long time. Not all business presented to us meets our requirements, but there are still
reasonable deals to be had even in this market. Our growth primarily emanated from our
accident and health and our reinsurance lines.
Multiyear premiums and timing differences in our reinsurance segment contributed
significantly to increase in gross premiums. Excluding these, we still grew our reinsurance
segment with discrete new business opportunities accretive to our portfolio which more
than offset business we not renewed.
I'll discuss market conditions in more detail following Joe's remarks. Joe?

Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we generated good
results which included operating income of $101 million and an annualized operating ROE
of 7.7%. Our net income for the quarter was $38 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

We also reported strong growth in diluted book value per common share which grew to
$56.04, an increase of 4% compared to last quarter and an 8% increase over the last 12
months. Adjusting for common dividends declared, the increase in book value per share
was 10% over the last 12 months.
Our results this quarter benefited from an increase in favorable prior year reserve
development, a low level of catastrophe and weather-related losses, a decrease in our
ex-cat and weather, current accident year loss ratio and lower general and administrative
expenses. These positive factors were partially offset by a decrease in our net investment
income which was impacted by significant volatility in the equity markets during the
quarter which resulted in the poor performance of certain of our hedge fund investments
in our other investments portfolio.
In addition, we also recorded a reduction in other insurance-related income which
primarily reflects the results of our weather and commodities derivative business. The
strong growth in our book value per share was driven by an increase in unrealized gains
on our available for sale investment portfolio which reflected the downward shift in
sovereign yield curves, the tightening of credit spreads, and the strengthening of certain
foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar.
Moving into the details of our income statement. Our total first quarter gross premiums
written increased 17% or 20% after adjusting for foreign exchange movements, with
growth reported by both of our reporting segments. For the first quarter of 2016, our
reinsurance segment top line was up $230 million or 21% compared to the same period in
2015. Treaties written on a multi-year basis had a significant impact on our written
premiums with close to $90 million of the increase related to the quarter-over-quarter
variance in premiums related to future underwriting years.

FINAL

We reported a net increase in new business of approximately $80 million which was
primarily driven by certain large quota share treaties and reflects our focus on building
long-term relationships with our customers. The new business primarily impacted our
marine liability and motor lines of business. This customer-centric approach also resulted
in growth in renewal premiums of approximately $65 million which included taking larger
shares of certain treaties that we believe will provide more attractive returns primarily in
our motor line business.
Timing differences of approximately $45 million also had a favorable impact on our
premium growth this quarter primarily in the liability and professional lines.
These increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements of
approximately $50 million as the strength of the U.S. dollar drove comparative premium
decreases in treaties denominated in foreign currencies.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our insurance segment reported an increase in gross premiums written of $51 million or
8% in Q1 2016 compared to the same period of – in 2015. Increased premiums written
were reported in our accident and health and property lines, which reported strong new
business growth, and aviation lines, which were primarily impacted by timing differences.
1/1 is the predominant renewal period for A&H reinsurance quota share business.
These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the marine lines driven by lower
rates and timing differences. In addition, certain strategic actions we took during the third
quarter of 2015, which were aimed at exiting certain lines of business, resulted in a
comparative reduction in premiums written primarily relating to our Australian professional
lines business.
Our group net premiums written were up 16%, 20% adjusted for FX, in the quarter
compared to Q1 2015 and primarily reflect the growth in the level of gross premiums
written, which was slightly offset by an increase in our ceded premium ratio driven by the
reinsurance segments, increased sessions in the property and catastrophe lines.
Our net premiums earned were flat in Q1 2015 or up 3% on a constant currency basis
compared to the same period last year. An increase in the reinsurance segment driven by
increased business in the marine and other liability lines in recent periods were partially
offset by increased reinsurance retrocessions in the property and catastrophe lines.
Our insurance segment reported a decrease in net earned premiums, primarily driven by
a reduction in the professional lines due to an increase in ceded premiums and the
marine lines which were largely offset by an increase in business written in the accident
health lines in recent periods.
Our first quarter consolidated current accident year loss ratio increased slightly by twotenths of a point to 63.1% compared to the same period of last year. During the quarter,
we reported $14 million in losses related to weather events which compared to $8 million
of such losses reported in the same period of last year. Our ex-cat and weather current

Page 4 of 25



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2016-04-27

year loss ratio decreased by 0.5 points to 61.5% with a decrease in the Insurance
segment partially offset by an increase in the reinsurance segment.

FINAL

The insurance segment current accident year loss ratio ex-cat and weather was lower by
2.8 points at 60.7% compared to the same period in 2015 due to a decrease in midsized
loss experienced in the marine and property lines, which was partially offset by the impact
of rate decreases and loss trends.
Our reinsurance segment current accident year loss ratio ex-cat and weather increased by
1.7 points to 62.1% compared to Q1 2015 primarily due to changes in the business mix,
reflecting a shift in our book towards longer tail lines and the impact of rate and loss
trends.
Turning to loss reserves established in prior years, our results continue to benefit from net
favorable loss development which aggregated $70 million during the first quarter. Short
tail lines in both segments contributed $48 million of this balance, primarily reflecting
better-than-expected loss emergence.

Bloomberg Transcript

Favorable prior year loss development of $16 million was also reported in our motor
reinsurance lines where we continue to see lower-than-expected loss development
across most prior years. In addition, we continue to give weight to actuarial methods that
reflect our favorable experience for liability and professional reinsurance business which
contributed a further $8 million to favorable loss development during quarter.
During the first quarter of 2016, our acquisition cost ratio increased by 1% compared to
the same period of 2015, driven by increases in the reinsurance segment. Our reinsurance
segment acquisition cost ratio was 25.7%. However, after adjusting for the impact of
commissions paid due to favorable prior-year loss development reported in the quarter,
the ratio would be 23%.
It is important to understand trends in our results when it comes to the treatment of prioryear business that includes adjustable sliding scale commissions based upon loss
experience. In the periods that this loss experience is favorable, our results will show an
increase in favorable prior-year development, and this will also have an impact on
increasing the current-year acquisition cost ratio. This primarily relates to our European
credit and bond and motor business.
The insurance segment acquisition ratio decreased this quarter by 0.4% compared to
prior year's first quarter, driven by higher ceding commissions received following the
expansion of our reinsurance protection programs which was partially offset by the higher
commission costs in certain lines of business.
Our expense ratio in Q1 2016 was 16.6% versus 18% a year ago. The key drivers of the
decrease included lower personnel expenses due to a reduced head count, as well as
certain non-recurring cost we incurred in Q1 2015, including PartnerRe merger-related
expenses, as well as certain lease cancellation costs.

FINAL

Overall, the company reported underwriting income of $99 million and a combined ratio
of 91.9% for the first quarter. Net investment income was $49 million for the quarter, a
decrease of $30 million from the previous quarter and a decrease of $43 million from the
first quarter of 2015. The variances were probably due – were primarily due to the lower
contribution to net investment income from our hedge funds with the poor performance
of two hedge funds in particular accounting for the majority of the decrease.
In aggregate, the total return on our cash and investment portfolio for the quarter was
1.3% including and excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The total return in the
current quarter was favorably impacted by the improvement in pricing of our fixed
maturities primarily as a result of the decline in sovereign yields.
As previously discussed with you, during August 2015 we entered into an Accelerated
Share Repurchase agreement, an ASR, to repurchase an aggregate of $300 million of
ordinary shares. We initially repurchased $4.1 million of our shares under this agreement.
This ASR agreement was formally terminated on January 15, 2016, with $1.4 million of
additional common shares delivered to the company, which are now fully reflected in our
earnings per share calculation.

Bloomberg Transcript

Following the expiry of the ASR agreement, we have reinitiated our share repurchase
program and repurchased an additional $136 million worth of common shares comprised
of $125 million purchased pursuant to our board authorized share repurchase program
and $11 million related to shares purchased in connection with the vesting of restricted
stock awards.
We expect to maintain our goal of returning at least 100% of our annual operating
earnings to our shareholders in the form of common dividends and share repurchases,
provided the market and financial conditions remain the same and we do not identify any
attractive investment or growth opportunities. At April 26, 2016, the remaining board
authorization under the repurchase program approved by our board of directors was
$625 million.
We continue to make strong progress on the strategic goals and expansion opportunities
we have discussed with you in prior quarters. The strategic actions initiated during the
third quarter of 2015 which included the runoff of our Australian branch are already making
a contribution to our results. However, as a reminder, we do not expect the full benefits of
these initiatives to be reflected in our results until later in 2016 and into 2017.
Our Lloyd's unit continues to make good progress in the London market. And during the
quarter, we started the operations of our underwriting division in China which will focus on
treaty reinsurance business on the Lloyd's China platform. During the quarter, we have
also continued the expansion of the capabilities of AXIS Ventures, our third-party capital
vehicle.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Albert.

Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Joe. Before opening up the call to questions, I'll provide an update on market
pricing and reinsurance renewals. As with the rest of the market, we experienced
continued pricing pressures in most markets. The overall rate change for our insurance
book was minus 3%, which was unchanged from both the fourth quarter last year and the
first quarter of the prior year. Consistent with prior quarters, the greatest pressure is in
the catastrophe exposed property and London-based global specialty lines. Large
accounts remain more competitive than smaller risks.
In our U.S. division, the overall average rate of decline was 2%, continuing the moderation
of rate declines experienced in the fourth quarter of last year. And certainly much better
than the minus 4% experienced in the first three quarters of 2015. The improvement
continues to be driven by rate increases in U.S. casualty which averaged 3%. Within that,
excess casualty was up 5% in the quarter as corrective actions with respect to lowattaching policies are driving sometimes meaningful rate increases.

Bloomberg Transcript

U.S. property was down 7% overall due to an abundance of capacity and a lack of
catastrophe events. In response to these challenging market conditions, we continue to
shift our property business mix towards smaller accounts in order to achieve a better,
more stable attritional experience with lower severity.
In our international insurance division, overall rate change was minus 5% for the quarter,
better than the minus 7% last quarter and generally in line with the same quarter last year.
The most challenging conditions remain in global property and onshore energy with
double-digit reductions.
Offshore renewable energy and marine liability lines are coming under more pressure.
International professional lines are a bit of a mixed bag with primary financial institution
business under the greatest pressure and UK professional indemnity, on the other hand,
experiencing rate increases following industry loss experience.
We took a number of actions in 2015 in an effort to address challenges in the international
marketplace including winding down our retail insurance operations in Australia, reducing
our business volume and increasing our writings of smaller, less-volatile risks. Our Lloyd's
platform is serving as a key enabler to access new business opportunities in this market,
and we continue to focus on expanding strategic distribution partnerships.
In our professional lines division, overall rate was flat in the quarter, consistent with the
first quarter of last year and up from the minus 1% last quarter.
There was a fairly widespread of conditions. Aggregate E&O rate change was positive 2%
for the quarter with higher rate increases, again, driven largely by cyber coverages. D&O
lines were down 2.5% with primary layers down 1% while excess and Side A experienced
greater declines.

FINAL

We continue to focus on further diversifying our book into ancillary professional lines and
the middle market and small account spaces and also introducing new coverages and
products including cyber, as well as our newly announced healthcare pandemic product.
Importantly, we believe we are diligently managing our insurance underwriting portfolio to
preserve and enhance profitability. We continue to voluntarily reduce business where our
profitability requirements are no longer met, and we are actively pursuing more attractive
business.
Moving on to reinsurance, we are in the process of completing April 1 renewals. Premiums
renewing on or around April 1 represent approximately 9% of annual total renewable
premiums with the main renewing market being the U.S. and the Asia markets, mostly
Japan. There, the market remains competitive but there was resistance to irrational rate
reductions. Reinsurance demand has increased with a number of cedents buying more
cover.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our strategy of strong relationship management and a coordinated product offering
resulted in increases in existing and new sidelines across various products. At the end of
the day, Japanese XOL rates came off 5% to 10% and commissions on proportional
treaties increased by 2% to 3%. Despite this, technical margin for earthquake business
remained healthy.
Elsewhere, pricing pressure moderated a bit as the reinsurance market pushed back on
demands for more generous commissions, terms and conditions. The greatest pressure
was experienced on excessive loss business outside the U.S., typically catastropheexposed business. We saw opportunities and new business coming to the market. We
estimate our reinsurance premiums written at April 1 will grow between 25% and 30%
over a small base of about $150 million.
There remains a significant amount of premiums renewal during the quarter. And our
volume there will depend on the attractiveness of the terms available to us. We grew our
portfolio with quarter shares and liability professional and motor lines at terms we
consider reasonable for the risk and volatility we are assuming.
While we're always happy in the right volatile lines and excess of loss treaties, it appears
to us that, for the moment at least, this is a market which is under pricing volatility in most
lines. And we did not expand our book meaningfully in business introducing volatility to our
portfolio. There was, however, good opportunity to work closely with cedents to bring
frequency exposed liability and professional lines business to the market and to write
business which enhances our existing portfolio.
We also grew in the motor line where Solvency II constraints increased the opportunity
set. We are already recognized as a leader in European motor serving cedents seeking
knowledgeable technical partners. There were a number of occasions where we declined
offer terms and proposed instead what we consider to be more reasonable alternatives.

FINAL

Encouragingly, a number of programs could not be completed and deals could then be
concluded at better terms to us. Our position as a long-term stable, credible and relevant
market in our lines of business served us well.
Looking forward to the June 1 Florida renewals, activity is a few weeks ahead of schedule
as cedents attempt to avoid the minor capacity shortage observed last June 1. Early
indications are positive and there are signs the market is bottoming out in Florida, as
reinsurers draw line in the sand following four straight renewals of price cuts.
So, while overall it is still a challenging market, given what we see both in insurance and
reinsurance markets, we are optimistic that in 2016 we may approach a floor in pricing for
many lines of markets with some disruptions creating opportunities for better position
carriers. We will be ready to respond and make the most of the opportunities ahead of us.
And with that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator?

Q&A
Operator
Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first
question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thanks so much. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the A&H business? I mean,
obviously that grew a lot. What sort of combined ratio, what sort of profitability or ROE
however it is that you feel comfortable discussing that? How was that running right now?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

So, our A&H business has done very well this quarter, 38% growth. A lot of that is driven
by the reinsurance business, which obviously tends to be focused in the first quarter. We
continue to have very attractive technical ratios in the mid-80s, in our A&H book which is
always what we intended to have. The issue with our A&H business is that we've been
investing in a platform to generate that business.
And so, for the moment, while we are very satisfied with our technical ratio, our operating
expense ratio is still more than we want it to be. Ideally, we would like a G&A ratio that's
10% low double-digits and we're not there yet. And so, right now, it's essentially
breakeven business for us as we continue to grow and enhance the returns. But, I see this
is a business that will provide mid-90s combined ratio with very little volatilities, very little
capital requirements as it continues to grow currently from a base of close to $400 million
to a level that's closer to $500 million.

And Mike it's Joe, I'll just add to that, that you know we opened an office in the Middle
East, in Dubai and we've had very good reception to that. We've written five new treaties
right off the bat. So, it's been a good start.

FINAL

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. And so, maybe focusing on insurance again, a little bit. I mean, clearly,
reinsurance conditions are challenging. The insurance business, just relative to my own
estimates, has continued to sort of run below expectations. Just I would expect that over
time that, that business is going to have to gather the lion's share of your profitability for
you to feel comfortable that you're generating sustainable margins. Where – when did
should that start to really come in or is that right or do you expect to continue to rely on
reinsurance for disproportionally to generate results?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Actually, Michael, the data that I have would indicate that for many companies in our peer
group, the insurance operations are performing in the mid to high-90s. So, when I look at
the performance of our insurance operation, given what we've done in terms of shifting
the book of business towards more long-tail lines, looking at what we've done in terms of
improving the composition of the individual portfolios, seeing the reductions in the loss
ratios
ratios. I'm actually quite pleased with the progress that we are achieving. If you look at a
number of companies in our peer group, I believe that what you will find is that for the
moment at least, the majority of their profits are actually coming from the reinsurance
operation, and our insurance operations are performing very well compared to that peer
group.
That doesn't mean that we're stopping where we are. We continue to be committed to
the improvements that we started to put in place in our insurance operation. And I think
the result that we've seen this quarter to be able to demonstrate reductions in loss ratios
even as we naturally embed automatic increases to the loss ratios coming from rate and
trend speak very well to the progress and really want to shout out to our insurance
people, I'm really pleased with the work they're doing.
With regard to the reinsurance area, there is no doubt that the reinsurance margins are
declining. I mean, we've been in the last three or four years seeing significant price
declines. And there, the issue for us is making sure that we continue to serve our core
clients all the while making sure that our risk-adjusted returns remain as strong as they can
be in the market. And that's why you've seen a change in the shift of business for us to
make sure that increasingly we are taking on business that has less volatility so that while
we are admittedly writing business at a higher technical ratio given both the shift in the
mix of business, as well as the market conditions, the return on risk is holding up much
better.
Overall, we believe that we will continue to make progress in terms of the client service,
in terms of the client-centric approach to marketing our product and services to our

Page 10 of 25



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2016-04-27

clients, in terms of improving the portfolio construction subject and that I think will
continue in both insurance and reinsurance to provide improvements, subject, of course,
to the fact that we are facing pricing headwinds in the reinsurance market.

FINAL

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. I guess I would thank you for that. I mean, I guess, well, my – just sort of looking, just
the underwriting income looks like in the first quarter. And this is just on a GAAP basis.
80% of your underwriting income coming from reinsurance in the first quarter. And your
improvements noted as far as the underlying in insurance. But, you're still tilted particularly
heavily towards development in reinsurance and reinsurance specifically.
So, I guess my question is, at some point, do you expect that balance to tilt back towards
insurance? Because you're going to earn more insurance? Or because you're going to
earn less in reinsurance? Or do you just not look at it that way?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No. No. No. I – we obviously look at that. And I think, Michael, the short answer is, we are
continuing to invest in improving our underwriting results and insurance. That's the short
answer and as we continue to grow in insurance, the marginal return on growth and
insurance is very high. And so, we will continue to improve the quality of our portfolio. We
will continue to grow the insurance business and we expect our underwriting profits from
insurance to increase subject, of course, to reasonable both market conditions and
reasonable loss experience.
Over time, given what's happening in terms of the trend on insurance and the pricing
pressures that we faced in reinsurance, I expect that the percentage of profits coming
from insurance will increase. But we're not giving up under any markets our ability or our
intents to improve the profitability of both insurance and reinsurance.

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

And Mike, it's Joe. Just going to add one more data point for you.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Sure.

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

So we talked about new initiatives in the past in terms of the fact that they dragged, if you
will, on our results.
I'm very happy to say that in this quarter, we have grown premium in new initiatives 30%
from a year ago, and we've had a 1.1% drag on our result. That's actually a profit from
those new initiatives this quarter of $2.3 million. So, when I say a drag, it's not a drag being
a loss. It's just that the combined ratio for that business is slightly higher than the
combined ratio for our insurance and reinsurance operation. So the point I'm trying to get

Page 11 of 25



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2016-04-27

across is that we're seeing gradual improvement from a number of the new initiatives we
put in place several years ago.

FINAL

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. And then just if I could, maybe, Joe, you mentioned the buyback and buying
back in excess of earnings. So, if earnings is not the governor for your buyback, what is,
and is there something that we can look at as far as a bank of capital that you feel like you
can kind of burn down in tandem with earnings over the next period of time, a year or two
years, whatever? Just to give some idea order of magnitude that we're talking about in
terms of your capacity. And thanks for all the answers.

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yes. Mike, we're not going to predict what we're going to buy back in shares. We're
sticking with the guidelines that we've given you before. We've said at least operating
earnings. You can see this quarter, we bought back stock and dividends significantly in
excess of operating earnings.
So, we take this a quarter at a time. We look at the opportunities ahead of us. You've
seen some growth coming out of both of our operations this quarter. I really do still want
to get into a run rate expectation because I'd rather not disappoint people.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Yes. Just to be clear, I wasn't asking for that. I was saying just what other aspects of your
capitalization are relevant when thinking about the buyback. I certainly wasn't asking for
guidance on what you're going to buy back each quarter. But that's okay. Thank you.

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Good morning, and thank you. First question, do you have any early read into the second
quarter events from the earthquake as well access (33:44) events?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Kai, it's very early days really on all three: Japan, Ecuador and the Texas hail and floods.
We – at this point, we don't expect it to have a material impact on us. But we do think at
this point is contained within our normal cat load for the second quarter.

Okay. That's great. And then the second question is on the reinsurance growth. This
growth is very strong despite the pricing pressure in the overall market. I guess, you find
optimistic opportunities there. I just wonder, does this growth in the reinsurance in specific
lines – are they accretive to your overall portfolio loss ratio or combined ratio, I should
say?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

The answer is that it's highly accretive to our risk-adjusted returns. So, obviously, the terms
of market pricing as we indicated to you in January 1 renewals is that we believe that the
technical pricing that we're getting in 2016 and certainly held through the first quarter is
about a point – is a little over a point of technical ratio deterioration versus the business
that we had last year. So, clearly, the portfolio in the market today is being written in
(35:06) the technical ratio that's a little bit higher than the prior year. Obviously, the price
declines and trends are higher than that, but we try and offset that with portfolio
construction.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, we're not seeing anything different in the book of business including the new business
that we wrote in the first quarter which is inconsistent with that. However, what we are
seeing is that the additional business that we've put on is highly accretive to the stability
and diversification of the portfolio such that the risk adjusted return on the portfolio has
been advanced materially through the addition of those.
So, what we are saying is that for a technical ratio, which is equivalent to what we had
before writing this new business, we are getting, a) positive dollar contribution to the
bottom line; and b) lower volatility to the overall results. So, we think that this new
business is accretive to our overall risk adjusted returns.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

But the internal report sort of core loss ratio accident year, loss ratio ex-cat – will that still
shifting higher given the mix?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

But it's consistent with the overall book that we wrote. So, as I mentioned to you, in
January 1, we told you that the January 1 renewals were a little bit more than a point
worse, and when – than the expiring business -- and when we compare that, at the end of
the quarter to the entire portfolio written at the end of the quarter, we continue to have
exactly the same trend.
So, we were not writing additional business at terms that were worse than we indicated to
you in January 1. We wrote the business on terms that are consistent with what we told
you in January 1, but with better stability and the diversification in our portfolio.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. That's great. Then my last question, shifting to the – on the investment side, the
hedge fund return for the quarter, like a loss of $27 million. If there's no loss there, I think
Page 13 of 25

FINAL

you already probably approaching the double digits. So, I just wonder, from your
perspective, looking at this portfolio which is less than 6% overall investment portfolio, but
it has introduced sort of high level of volatilities. It's more like three points cats (37:29) for
the quarter. So, I just wonder, how do you think about that? And you have managed on
volatility on the underwriting side. I'm wondering if you thinking about applying the same
sort of approach on the investment side as well.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Kai, for raising that and you're absolutely correct. And let me put this in
perspective, if I may.
When we came on board, Joe and I, substantially all of the risk assets of this company
were in hedge funds. And the rationale at the time were that they had behaved well
during the financial crisis and provided returns that were acceptable for risk assets. We
took a different view. And frankly, we had determined that we wanted more diversification
in our risk assets including more illiquid assets, private debt, mortgages, private equity
and so on. And in fact, since 2013, we have been diligently reducing our exposures to
hedge funds. In fact, Joe, what were the numbers?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. So, Kai, in 2013, our hedge funds were $895 million; at the end of 2014, $781 million;
2015, $600 million; end of Q1, $470 million and we expect it to be about $430 million at
the end of Q2. So, we basically have halved the hedge fund portfolio in the last three
years.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

And so, we are continuing to – thank you, Joe. And so, we're continuing to shift the
portfolio away from hedge funds. But as you know, Kai, a lot of these new developments
– new investments classes that we're in, require a fair amount of time to ramp up. And so,
we've been ramping up these new risk assets and funding those risk assets through
liquidations of our hedge funds.
So, we agree with your observation around hedge funds which is why we've been
reducing our exposure to hedge funds. Obviously, it would have been better to have less
in this quarter, but we are continuing to reposition our portfolio to one which I believe is
better suited for our liability mix and for the conditions that we expect in capital markets
going forward.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. To be clear, you are not reducing overall allocation to other investment? Just
shifting allocation within the bucket from hedge fund to sort of like longer-term
investments?

Welcome.

Thank you. And the next question comes from Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you. Like to just go back for a second, and I know you've been
speaking a lot, Albert, on the reinsurance change in the portfolio mix. I guess, I'm just
trying to understand something. You said in your comments that pricing for volatility is not
adequate, but I see that the PMLs for you guys have gone up in the quarter. I guess, how
do we square the growth and the increase in PMLs relative to the idea the volatility is not
getting priced appropriately?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That's a fair question. I think what we are doing here is we are responding to our clients'
needs. As you know, a number of people do to either Solvency II or changes in business
models are buying more at the top end. And, in fact, I believe that if you look at it, there's
a reduction in the one in 50-year losses, so we continue to be reducing there and trying
to help our clients with more of the – with the upper end. But where we are right now is
also very consistent with what we told you in the first quarter, which is that we are in the
midst of renewing and reworking our Cat program. There was one cover that expired at
12/31, which is what caused the increase in the first quarter versus the one-one level
versus the prior level. And as we indicated to you then, it is our intention to renew and
modify our Cat program to realign the protection that we've had before.
So, where are right now, if you would, is in between the expiry of one reinsurance treaty
and the replacement of that treaty. As we replace and restructure our Cat program in the
second quarter, I believe that you'll find that the PMLs will come back in line with where
they were during 2015.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Okay. I guess on an overall basis, on the reinsurance book, if I look back a year ago, 1Q
2015, there was a substantial contraction in the book and fourth quarter 2014, first quarter
2015 and now that we get to the end of last year in this quarter, we have seen a reversal
and then pretty significant one. I guess, it's hard to know, I'm from the outside and all of
the things that go into the portfolio mix beside the lines of business.

Page 15 of 25

FINAL

But, I mean, is there a general difference for you guys viewpoint on how you're operating
in 1Q 2016 than what you were doing in 1Q 2015? I guess, like, the expectation from the
market side is that the pricing dynamic is the same, that a year ago, we would've been
looking at the same, kind of, headwinds, challenges in the market. And as you said, the
pricing is down this quarter, maybe a one point deterioration. I guess, if you are a year
ago versus this year, what's the difference and what you guys are thinking on how you're
running that book?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That's a very good question, and thank you for asking it. I think that there are two issues.
One is the first point that I made earlier which is we look at the availabilities in front of us.
We compare it to our portfolio. We do marginal analyses of risk and return. And the
question is does this new piece of business, at the current price, improve the overall
portfolio or not. And I think that those opportunities are in fact coming.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second issue, I think, is that the first quarter of 2016, we saw a number of new
programs come to market from core clients, people who we've been doing business with
for a very long time and very profitably. And I have to say, I look at this growth that we've
had in the first quarter as an affirmation of the works that we've been doing in terms of
relationship management and our customer-centric approach and let me take a step
back, if I could.
We've been telling you for quite some time that we are observing in the market that
clients are, in fact, reducing the size of their panels. They're concentrating their business
with a small number of very highly rated core reinsurers who can provide support across a
number of lines and across the globe. And what I can tell you is that not every new treaty
that came to market was offered to us. And not every treaty that was offered to us was
acceptable to us. But we feel very pleased that for some of our core clients, as they are
exploring new treaties to the market, they are offering it to a limited number of reinsurers.
And I think the fact that we were on those treaties – and by the way, we have very
reasonable market shares of those treaties. So, this is not something that AXIS alone is
writing. It is something that a small number of quality reinsurers are participating in. And
so, what it shows to us is that our customer-centric approach is working with our clients
that as our clients are concentrating their books of business with a smaller number of core
reinsurers, they are including AXIS reinsurance in that panel.
So, I feel good about what this means with regard to the position of AXIS Re, in terms of
where the reinsurance industry is going. And certainly based on the analysis of the
underwriting and of the marginal impact on the portfolio, I am absolutely confident of the
business we're putting on is accretive to the risk-adjusted returns of our portfolio.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Okay. And just one follow-up. I know it's a small business for you, guys, aviation and the
primary insurance sector. But a doubling of that book, all the things I understand is that's a
fairly challenged from pricing perspective line of business. Any color on that? I appreciate
it. Thanks.

Charles, it's, Joe. Basically, it's some changes and some line slip percentages from prior

substantial.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

Thank you. And the next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Sterne Agee CRT.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. So, I just wanted to follow up on the growth in the reinsurance
segment. AXIS' reis growth seems to be higher than some peers and wondering what
opportunities that you're seeing or what specifically are your underwriters doing that is
helping you to gain those opportunities. And what risk do you think are attached to
growing right now?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I'll go back and expand on the question – on the answer that I just gave. I think that our
customer-centric approach is working very well. One of the side products of our activities
last year is we spent a lot of time with our customers. Understanding what they want,
what they need, demonstrating to them what it is that we can do for them, continuing to
hone our service to work with them, we spent a huge amount of time on the road
understanding our clients and engaging them on things that they could do to improve
their books of business. We're sharing with them increasingly data and analytics that we're
providing on our own books that can be – that can provide them with insights.
Page 17 of 25



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity

FINAL

All of those things are increasing the number of opportunities that we see. Not every
reinsurer sees every deal that comes to market. That's a simple fact. And as I mentioned
earlier, not every deal that we've seen did we write. And, I will also add that whereas –
with regard to reported premiums, it's certainly higher growth than we've seen in some of
the reported amounts for this quarter. I can assure you that we are not alone on these
treaties and that our share on these treaties is an absolutely reasonable share in line with
our capital, our market share of the overall business and so on.
So, I view this as – again, I view this as an affirmation that the work that we are doing with
our clients is bearing fruit. I view this as an affirmation that clients are reducing the size of
their panels and showing business to a small number of select reinsurers and I take this as
a complement that AXIS Re is included in that smaller group.
Is there a risk to that? There is risk in every business that we write. But the analyses that
we have on those portfolios indicates to us that these are low volatility portfolios that they
add diversification to our overall portfolio and on a risk-adjusted basis. We are significantly
enhancing the risk-adjusted returns or the returns on volatility of the lines that we are
writing and the overall reinsurance portfolio that we are writing.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And on the reported profitability within reinsurance, the accident year
loss ratio ex-cat was about 63.1% on that segment. Looking at the full year number for last
year that was 63.3%, so it seems to be flat this quarter versus full year last year, and my
sense was that price profitability had actually gone down – it was up a point. So, just
wondering why reported numbers are flat this quarter versus full year and whether we
should use this quarter's number for the rest of this year?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Again, I think that one of the things that we do Vinay, again, is we all try to reposition in our
portfolio in every year to try and optimize the portfolio based on the opportunities
available to us and market conditions available to us. I think with regard to the portfolio of
this quarter, frankly we had very low cat losses, so certainly that was helpful. There will
always be some volatility in the reinsurance results since that's what we do, we provide
capital and absorb volatility on behalf of our clients. But I don't see anything unusual in this
quarterly result that would say is a one-off that you need to adjust up or down. However, I
will say that as we earn more of the business that we wrote in January 1, which we
indicated to you, had a technical ratio that was a little bit more than a point higher than the
expiring business, I would expect that as that premium comes to the income statement,
absence any other impact, you would expect a modest increase in the technical ratio of
the Reinsurance business.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. That's fair. And then one last one, if I may. Just wanted to follow-up on the capital
management. I mean, I wanted to follow up on Mike's question. If AXIS is sitting on an
excess capital position, given that not all of the breakup fee was used to repurchase stock

Page 18 of 25



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2016-04-27

for last year and can we sort of look at that pot of cash as a potential for share
repurchases for the future?

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Again, I think, the profits that we have and the breakup fee, all contribute, if you would, to
the capital of the organization. Now, we are growing some and we are looking for
opportunities. So, we would of course want to use some of that capital to fund growth
that is accretive to our returns and that is accretive to our portfolio. If we do not need that
capital, then we are happy to give it back to you. And again, I think that our performance
to date would indicate that we've done that.
So, just to give you a sense. Over the last five years, even including the breakup fee, we
have returned to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchase in excess of 110% of
the operating income plus the break-up fee.
So, whereas while we may not have given back the breakup fee between to August of
last year and March of this year, certainly, over any extended period of time, we have
demonstrated a strong willingness to return to the shareholders capital that we don't use.
And again, in the first quarter, as Joe mentioned earlier, we have returned to our
shareholders well in excess of the operating income.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we continue to return as much capital as we think is reasonable and prudent to our
shareholders, but we are not prepared to say that we have X dollars of excess capital that
we will run through over the next 12 months.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Hey. Good morning. I have a couple of questions here for you, Albert. Just quickly on the
reinsurance, is any of the growth associated with maybe getting some lines back that may
have gone away with the PartnerRe situation?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Not really. As I mentioned, most of the growth that we had actually came from new
treaties that came to market where we were invited to participate. The good news, of
course, is that we actually did not lose a lot. We lost a very small amount of business
during the period when we were exploring a merger with PartnerRe. The amount of
business lost was de minimis then. So, that really was not a factor.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

FINAL

Great. And my next question, Albert. I've asked this before and just kind of ask it again:
increasing kind of multi-year reinsurance deals. What is the risk here that you're actually
entering to these deals with, call them, middling returns that could potentially be better a
couple years from now? Do the agreements have clauses where you can actually get out
of them if pricing terms and conditions actually improve?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That's a very fair question. So, let me give you a couple of examples. We're very focused
on making sure that we provide multi-year deals to clients who've got the right
motivations for those multi-year deals, and who have historically been strong relationship
account of ours and that we believe will continue to be strong relationship accounts. One
of the interesting things that has come about to prove that, if you would, is that a number
of the multi-year deals that we did in 2014 and 2015 actually were helpful to us because
the renewals that came out in 2015 were lower price than the renewals in 2014. The
renewals that came in 2016 were lower priced than the renewals of 2015, and yet we
actually had the benefit of those better terms, coming out of the multi-year treaties.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I know that people focus on the opportunity lost with regards to a multi-year treaties.
But in our case, we can actually demonstrate that the multi-year treaties that we wrote in
2014 and 2015 were an opportunity gained.
Now, with regards to some of the deals that we are doing, we look to do these multi-year
deals mostly – when we talk multi-year, we talk two years, right? So, it's not like we're
giving up optionality. And number two, we do these in many cases where we have
opportunities for greater stability. So a very large deal that we did in the first quarter has a
sliding scale to it.
And therefore, the stability of the result in that treaty is very strong because if the loss
ratio happens to increase the commission we would pay would decline. So, there are
embedded protections in many of these treaties such that they increase the
attractiveness of those multiyear treaties to us. And, again, we will only do a multiyear
treaty if we believe that it is helpful to both our clients and to ourselves.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. And then, last question, more on the primary side, Albert. Give me your
commentary on pricing and what's going on. It doesn't appear that some of the
dislocation we're seeing with a couple large carriers having much an impact in the market,
but is it creating any opportunities for you either on the primary or the reinsurance side?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think that dislocations – without getting too specific -- I think dislocations in the market
are a very good thing for AXIS because it continues to highlight to our clients and to our
distribution partners the stability of our balance sheet, the stability of our marketing
approach and of our client-centric approach, and that's working well. We are, in fact,
seeing opportunities. Now, not all opportunities that are coming to market are attractive
Page 20 of 25



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td

out of those opportunities.

Yes. Thank you. Question on the timing differences in the reinsurance premiums. Will that
make for a more difficult comparison a year from now?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yes. Jay, it will. We did about 10 more deals on a multiyear basis this year than we did last
year. And if those are multiyear, you'll have a drop in premium next year, so it does make
the comparison a little bit more difficult. But if you look back over the last couple of years,
it hasn't had a huge impact, if you will, on the trajectory of the growth in the reinsurance
segment.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

In addition to the multiyear deals, I thought you mentioned some timing issues, which
made a difference?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yes. I'm sorry, Jay. Yes. So, a couple of these deals – without getting into specifics, a few
of them the way that we are recording them, we're recording them a quarter at a time.
So, from that perspective, it won't have an impact, if you will, on comparability going
forward. But there are certain other transactions that fall into this quarter, which would
have gone into, say, the next quarter in 2016. So, there is a little bit of lumpiness because
of some of those timing differences, yes.

Q - Jay Cohen

in the 21st century are going to need multiple sources of capital and also the ability to
align risk with the capital that is best suited for it.
And so, we continue to work with our partners at Blackstone to explore ways to create
more capacity for our clients and to create multiple sources of capital for us. That has
been a goal of ours that we've communicated to you for a long time. And until anything is
done, I think it's best that we don't say much on that.

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yes. We really had an unusual thing going on there, Ryan. It's related to a favorable tax
ruling that we got from the Swiss government. It actually benefited us by about $4 million.
In addition to that, we actually had some losses, if you will, in high tax jurisdictions. So, that
was really the second reason why we had an unusual, if you will, tax benefit.

Thanks. Good morning. Albert, you mentioned, when you're discussing 6/1 (1:02:31)
renewals, client concern about a shortage of capacity, I haven't heard in a while, so hoping
you could elaborate on that a little?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, it's really talking to last year. So, last year, there was a bit of a last minute rush and
there were a couple of deals that weren't completed. That's why I think everybody is
reading the same thing that we are which is that reinsurers are kind of pushing back. And
they just want to make sure that they have the capacity that they need to avoid the
experience from last year.

Okay. No, that helps. So, you're anticipating, I guess, a bottoming. You're not actually not
thought about rates going up for 6/1 (1:03:03) exposed accounts?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

No. No. I think I want to be very careful to give you my best view, but not excess of
optimism. I think we're hitting a floor. I think we're seeing resistance. And certainly, I can
tell you that in the first quarter, not just on the cat, we've seen a lot of deals where
brokers and clients try to push the market and the reinsurers just said no, but no thanks.
And so, we're certainly think a greater percentage of deals that don't get done on offer
terms, we're saying that number of short-placed covers. Those are all indications that
there's an increasing level of discipline coming through the market. And so, I would expect
that what we will see in Florida, certainly, what we've seen to-date a couple actually have
some risk-adjusted increases, but very small. Some have a couple of reductions. By and
large, it's looking flattish to me. And so, what I'm saying is, I'm hoping that we start to see
a leveling off of pricing, not so much that we will see increases, but that we will see a
slowing of reductions. That's really what we're looking at right now.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful, I mean would have been great, but not realistic. Another really small
question – nitpicky question, I guess, for Joe. One, should we will get $4 million in weather
related losses in the reinsurance segment?

It wasn't $4 million. It was actually – get breakeven, so a slight loss. That was compared to
about an $8 million gain last year.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Because I think somebody mentioned $14 million for the consolidated company. We
saw $10 million in insurance.

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

No.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Hang on. Weather-related losses you're talking. I think the issue here is tax and weatherrelated which is $14 million for the underwriting.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

When we think about weather, we also think about our weather and commodities
derivative units, which is separate. So, the weather and commodities unit is a unit within
our reinsurance group that had a breakeven this quarter versus $7 million of gains last first
quarter. The $14 million that we're speaking with too is basically losses relating to PCS
events, weather events, of which $10 million were in the insurance division and $4 million
were in the reinsurance division. That could be the differences in the numbers.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. So, that's not in the derivatives number. That's in the underwriting?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

No. No. The derivative number is actually a very, very minor profit.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect. I appreciate the clarification. And last, we saw investment expenses up
about 9% year-over-year. Is there anything unusual in that? Or is this is a good run rate?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

No. This is a pretty good run rate. We did have some compensation-related inflation in
that, Meyer. So, that's a little bit higher than normal.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much.
