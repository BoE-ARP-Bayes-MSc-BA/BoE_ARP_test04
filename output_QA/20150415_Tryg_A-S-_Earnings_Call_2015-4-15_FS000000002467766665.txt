Bloomberg Transcript

Lars Møller
Good morning, everyone. This is Lars Møller from Tryg. I'm the Head of Investor Relations.
We're here to present our Q1 Results. With me today, I have our CEO, Morten Hübbe; our
CFO, Tor Lønnum with me.
And with this short introduction, I hand over to you, Morten.

Morten Hübbe
Thank you, Lars. And we kick oﬀ on slide 3 where we show a somewhat mixed bag of
results in Q1. If we start on the positive side, we have an increase in the pre-tax results of a
bit more than 10% year-on-year. We've reduced the cost ratio to 0.3% year-on-year. We
have a return on equity of just above 20% for the quarter, and we have improved the
trends on the top line with a positive top line in Private and Corporate lines.
On the negative side, we see a reduction in the insurance technical result of DKK 94
million, impacted largely by DKK 120 million higher weather claims, mainly due to the
storms that have hit across the Nordics and a larger number of house ﬁres as a
consequence of winter in the Norwegian market.
Also we see a negative impact of some DKK 56 million from interest rate level that is due
to of course both discounting and technical interest having a negative impact when
interest rates are lower. And I guess it's fair to say that weather usually hits Q4 and Q1

more than the other quarters, whereas the lower interest-rate level will continue to have a
negative impact on the future quarters as well.
If we move to slide 4, it's the ﬁrst time we report on our three customer targets that we
announced on the Capital Markets Day. Bear in mind, very importantly that none of these
three customer targets have the focus of chasing new customers. Rather, they have to
focus on increasing loyalty and further coverage amongst existing customers. As we know
that it's a signiﬁcant driver of stability and bottom line.
We see that the NPS, the customer satisfaction, where the ambition is to double within
three years. We've already increased from 11% to 16%, which is a bit more rapid than we'd
expected, mainly driven by private lines and also claims in Denmark. We see the more
than three product coverage has increased by 0.2% where Denmark is the main driver,
and we see the retention rate has also increased 0.2% where Commercial is the main
driver, but also somewhat positive impact from Danish private.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we move on to slide number 5, we list the most important news in the ﬁrst quarter. First
of all, we've introduced a new car product. There's no doubt that car is the area where
competition is the highest and where we've seen lower price in the recent years. We have
now come with a more structural solution with completely new product in the Danish
market with signiﬁcantly higher price diﬀerentiation and stronger risk selection and a
structure where the product is less of an all-inclusive and more of a basic coverage with
the opportunity to select add-on coverages. We've just been well received in the market
within the last three weeks.
And we've announced Viking as the ﬁrst Nordic procurement agreement where we can
see that clearly elevating from national procurement agreements to Nordic procurement
agreements has taken down the cost signiﬁcantly and also will increase customer
experience. And then we saw on the AGM the decision on the DKK 29 dividend which has
been carried out. The stock split will be carried out. And the semi-annual dividend was
started this summer.
And then we have taken new beginning of a new eﬃciency program of DKK 750 million
with this ﬁrst quarter. And then probably all of you've seen that our 60% shareholder has
decided that they will introduce a membership bonus where they will pass on most of
their dividend and buyback proceeds to the Danish customers.
On slide 6, we elaborate on the combined ratio development in the various business
areas. We see a signiﬁcant improvement in Corporate from 98.7% last year to 92.9% this
year, clearly driven by lower large claims but also a signiﬁcant improvement in the cost
ratio. In Private lines, we see a higher combined ratio, increased by 3.8%, negatively
impacted by some 4 percentage points from weather and some 0.4 percentage points
from interest rate, on the other hand, positively impacted by a lower cost ratio and an
improvement in the underlying claims ratio of 0.7%.
In Commercial, we see an increase in combined ratio of 2.7% with a negative impact of
some 2.4% from weather and some 10.8% from large claims, one particularly large claim,

FINAL

but also on the positive side, some 9.3% on run-oﬀ gains, 0.3% lower on the cost ratio and
an underlying improvement in the claims of 1.8%.
If we move on to slide 7, we show the beginning of the new eﬃciency program of DKK
750 million, which we run until 2017. On the Capital Markets Day in the autumn, we
showed that the ramp-up of this program. As you saw in the previous program, there was
also a ramp-up with a lower beginning and a higher ending. That is also the case with the
new program with DKK 150 million impact this year, DKK 225 million next year, and DKK
375 million in 2017.
While this should come as no surprise and this will be a main positive driver for the next
three years, clearly it means that the run rate is lower in 2015 compared to the ending of
the 2014 impact in the old program. One of the current focus areas is clearly on
outsourcing where we've made the most progress currently in IT and ﬁnance.

Bloomberg Transcript

When we move on to slide 8, we show the development in cost and head counts. As I
already mentioned, cost ratio has improved 0.3% year-on-year. Bear in mind that Q1 is
usually the highest cost ratio quarter of the year due to commissions and therefore the
year-on-year comparison is the most relevant. We've reduced head counts by a bit more
than 50 people. As you can see from this graph, we have reduced nominal expenses in all
four business areas.
And then, we should remind you that on the Capital Markets Day, we announced that we
expected to see some one-oﬀ costs during 2015 in order to achieve the 2017 program.
We've previously expected to announce that in Q2. But now, the expectation is to
announce that in the third quarter results.
And then over to you, Tor.

Tor Magne Lønnum
Thank you, Morten. I guess ﬁrst and foremost, if you look at slide number – it should be
slide number 10, the top line and the technical result, you can see that there is a slightly
improved trend in terms of the top line. There is a negative development of 0.4% in local
currency, which is a signiﬁcant improvement compared to last year. You see that there is
actually a small positive trend in the private line, which of course is a strong improvement
compared to the same quarter last year. And then there is a bit more mix picture on the
other areas. I guess I'd also highlight the fact that if you look on the Swedish business,
there is a signiﬁcant improvement in terms of top line development. In terms of the
technical result, I won't go further into that since Morten has talked a bit about it earlier.
If you move on to the next slide and look at the development in terms of average
premiums, you can see that there is a negative development in average prices for motor
and house in Denmark. Then in particular, this is reﬂecting a low index and also motor
competition in the Danish market. As Morten mentioned earlier, the new car product that
(09:33) has been launched in March should mitigate some of the eﬀects going forward.

Page 3 of 14

FINAL

And we think in particular sort of introducing a better structure in the motor products
should thus have mitigated some of the eﬀect.
If you look at the Norwegian average premium, you can see that there's a positive
development on average prices in Norway both for motor and house. But we also can see
some increased competition due to the economic downturn. There's a relatively low eﬀect
of price measures in motor, which is particularly due to increased emphasis on the
eﬃciency program and an increased competitive position. There is a slightly higher level
of price measures in 2015, and thus average premium will continue to stay low in 2015,
but should grow in 2016.
If we move on to the next slide and look at the customer retention, there's a positive
development in retention levels in Denmark. Private is actually up to a level of 89.7%,
which is relatively good. There's a stable development in retention level in Norway,
Commercial at 88% but slightly lower level in Private. We do think primarily due to some
seasonal pattern.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we move on to the combined ratio and claims side, you can see that there is an
underlying improvement in claims ratio, 0.1%, which is relatively low and reﬂecting a
mixed underlying development in the business areas. You can see that Private underlying
continues to improve, and it's 0.7% for the quarter, Commercial at 1.8% for the quarter,
whereas there is some negative development in Corporate and Sweden.
I think ﬁrst and foremost, it's important to note that when you look at the relatively low
underlying improvement in the quarter, it reﬂects that some of the measures related to
the eﬃciency program that – or the procurements program that Morten mentioned will
have a lower eﬀect here in Q1, but it also reﬂects that there are some underlying inﬂation
in terms of the claim side both in Denmark and Norway.
If we move on to the next slide and look into the large claims and weather claims, you can
see that there is a reduced impact of large claims, which is at 3.5% and more or less in line
with the annual expectation. Weather claims is slightly up at 5.4%, which is up 2.6% from
last year. It's also more or less in line with expectations and I'll give you – I'll elaborate a bit
more on the weather claims.
Run-oﬀ at 7.8% continue to be at a relatively high level. It reﬂects still a strong reserve
position, but also of course that there is the relatively high impact of low frequency claims
in this quarter both due to weather and large claims.
If we elaborate a bit more on the weather claims, you can see here we have tried to show
that there is weather claims, as I said, more or less in line with expectations. And patterns
for the last six years show that there are signiﬁcant variations for Q1. And you can say that
this year we had a combination of storm Nina and Egon, which hit both Denmark – or
Denmark, Sweden and Norway in January and that gives a total eﬀect of slightly more
than DKK 90 million after reinsurance.

FINAL

And in addition, as Morten mentioned, there has been a frequency of medium-size ﬁres
(13:53) in Norway which is in the area of DKK 60 million, above last year's level. As I'm
sure you've all observed, particularly here in Denmark, it has been, besides the eﬀects I've
mentioned, a relatively benign weather in Q1.
If we move on to the investment side, there is a relatively strong return on the free
portfolio overall of 2.2%, primarily driven by high return on equities of 7.7%. The key
drivers to that performance is particularly that we have a tilt towards stable equities and
also that there has been an overweight of European equities in the period. You can see
that there is some return on the match portfolio in the quarter, and the main driver is the
falling interest rate levels. We have no material changes in the portfolio and of course the
low interest rate level will reﬂect on the expectations in terms of performance for the free
portfolio going forward.
If we move on to the slide related to the capital structure, the capital buﬀer increased in
the period to 55%, driven by returns in the period but also additional inclusion of DKK
300 million on the subordinated debt. We've said at the Capital Markets Day that the
timeframe for giving information about new subordinated debt would be in the Q3
announcement, but it's most likely to be postponed until later in Q4 due to pending
approval of the internal model.

Bloomberg Transcript

And ﬁnally, on this slide, I'd highlight the fact that the equity level is signiﬁcantly reduced
to last year, but it's due to how the dividend distribution was actually pre-quarter in 2015,
whereas it was after the quarter in 2014.
And with that, I leave it back to you, Morten.

Morten Hübbe
Thank you, Tor. And we'll end our presentation on slide 20, where we reiterate our 2017
targets, which is to have a return on equity post-tax at or above 21%, to have a combined
ratio at or below 87%. Bear in mind that it's a full-year target and not necessarily a target
for winter quarters. And then also 2017 target is to have a cost ratio at or below 14%.
And then, we've mentioned of course the three customer targets on NPS, retention and
number of products. And no doubt, the new DKK 750 million program will be a main
driver of the value creation from the coming three years with a ramp-up, which is as less of
an impact in 2015, more in 2016, and the peak of the program in 2017.
I think with that, we are ready to take your questions.

Lars Møller
Operator, please?

Q&A

Our ﬁrst question comes from Mr. Jakob Brink from ABG. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Yeah. It's Jakob from ABG. I have two questions, please. The ﬁrst one is regarding
premium growth and competition. I think, Tor, you mentioned that you are expecting
average premiums to come up in 2015 or into 2016 and also you are expecting premiums
to grow in line with GDP in 2016. How do you see this when also we've seen your smaller
competitors like Alka and Lærerstandens talking about sort of very high growth ambitions
the next four years to ﬁve years. I think Lærerstandens was also talking about a 13% cut in
house premiums. Is this not going to impact you and the larger competitors at all? That's
the ﬁrst question.
And then secondly, you mentioned in the report that you have potential to issue
subordinated debt of DKK 1.2 billion to DKK 2.2 billion. As far as I can see, that must be
including 10% CoCos and also assuming that the natural perils pool will still be treated as
equity. Could you conﬁrm that, please? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yes, Jakob. First and foremost, in terms of the last question, you're quite right. There is no
doubt that sort of the variation in terms of the subordinated debt. When we say between
DKK 1.2 billion and DKK 2.2 billion, the DKK 1 billion in diﬀerence is related to the natural
perils fund as you indicated. In terms of sort of the full potential, you're right that there is a
possibility to utilize up to 10% of the core capital for subordinated purposes or CoCos as
we indicated.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

But if the Perils Pool is treated as Tier 2, then you're down to DKK 1.2 billion or around that
level. But then it would basically mean that you would have to issue CoCos in order to
increase the level of subordinated debt. Are you willing do that and then basically utilize
the full potential or how aggressive will you be on that?

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
I'm not prepared to say how aggressive we will be in terms of the subordinated debt.
That's really why I said that we will sort of come back to that announcement in Q4. And as
I've said in the presentation, it's really important to understand that whereas we said Q3
on the Capital Markets Day and I'm now saying Q4, it's really because there is a timeframe
related to the approval process of the – related to the FSA that creates some disturbances
for us in terms of timeframe. And that's why I'm saying sometime in Q4 because it will, as I
said, be dependent upon that decision on that approval.

A - Morten Hübbe
I guess we just approved yesterday our application for the internal model to the FSA,
which is a nice 3,000 pages long package. And I guess the FSA will now have to evaluate
Page 6 of 14



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2015-04-15

that across the companies applying for the internal model. And we need to have ﬁnal
approval in order for us to make our ﬁnal decision on the capital competition.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

FINAL

What about the – sorry.

A - Morten Hübbe
No.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
No. Go ahead, Jakob.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

What about the approval or the treatment of the natural perils pool in Norway? I thought
they said by March 2015, they should have a conclusion, but they haven't done that yet.
Anything new on that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
No. Unfortunately, there's not and we've actually been trying to set up a meeting with the
Ministry of Justice in Norway as well and haven't been able to do that so far. So I think I've
been relatively cautious on that before as well. Trying to put pressure on the authorities is
never a good idea, so I think I'll just say that we are in a positive dialogue, and that we'll
just have to wait and see.
And then I guess, if we move on to the competition question that you raised, there's no
doubt that you see some announcement related to the pricing as we indicate Jakob, but I
guess ﬁrst and foremost, what I try to indicate was that there will be price eﬀects across
the portfolio later in 2015, which primarily will have some eﬀect on the ﬁxed-in numbers.
And I think keep in mind that when we said the next level of price diﬀerentiation as one of
the eﬀects going forward, of course that we need to be more selective and more granular
in terms of the pricing. And that includes price eﬀects beyond the index in Denmark.
On the other hand, there's no doubt as I tried to indicate in the presentation as well that
we do see slightly more competitive pressure. And I think there's been (22:59) for some
time in particular sort of in motor. And that's why – and this is something that I would
highlight again and you've heard me say this before. There is an extremely important
position to have as market leader to make sure that we are not driving the development.
And thus, it will always be a balancing act where we need to sort of try to maintain a
position where we're not a price leader and we're not going to be a price leader, but this
should be sort of in the range, in the middle of the pack, perhaps in terms of prices.

A - Morten Hübbe
You mentioned – Jakob, you mentioned Alka and Lærerstandens. To be honest, I don't
think Lærerstandens is large enough to make any signiﬁcant distance in the market. But
Page 7 of 14

Date: 2015-04-15

FINAL

clearly, Alka is a bigger player. We've seen Alka being – it's not new that Alka's fairly
aggressive on growth and pricing, but it's in that sort of past three years, four years. They
have also had a signiﬁcantly larger branding spend than the three other large companies
almost put together. And I think to be honest that their growth has been limited on the
back of that.
Also we see that our competitive disadvantage there has been on our price
diﬀerentiations in two week, not on the average price. And the best indicator of how it
impacts us currently is on the retention rate and on the current sales. And we can see that
our group retention rates are actually increasing at 0.2% in this period. And also, we see
that our sales are slightly higher than they were in the same period last year. So of course,
we do concern ourselves with the question, but we don't see any signiﬁcant impact to the
markets as of now.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot for the answers.

Operator
Our next question comes from Mr. In-Young Chung from Goldman Sachs. Please go
ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - In-Young Chung
Hi. Good morning. Two questions from me. So the ﬁrst one is on the customer dividend
model, which has obviously now been improved. So is there any plans on how these will
be distributed? So for example, you could, I guess, have a system where customers get to
have more than three products like you have in the customer target to help with that
further things. And do you have kind of projections in how it will impact your premiums
going forward? And the second question is on the interest rates, the impact of the lower
interest rates in Denmark. Do you set aside any kind of provisions for further cuts in rates,
which could potentially happen with the Central Bank's commitment to defend the peg?
Thank you.

A - Morten Hübbe
Yeah. I guess the last question is relatively simple. The answer is no and I don't know
(26:04).

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
And I think that's mutual (26:05).

A - Morten Hübbe
So of course, that has an impact. And keep in mind, we also mentioned the interest rates
in terms of comparison to Q1 last year. Keep in mind that when we have announced both
the previous targets and these targets, we have not taken the interest rate level into
consideration, i.e. we are saying that these are long-term targets and they should stand
Page 8 of 14



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2015-04-15

despite the fact that the interest rate level has been coming down. So we stay committed
to sort of the long-term targets despite what has been happening on the interest rate. So
the mentioning of the interest rate this quarter is, I guess, for comparison purposes to Q1
last year.

FINAL

Q - In-Young Chung
Okay.

A - Morten Hübbe
I think on your ﬁrst question, on the bonus model, I think it's important to bear in mind
that the entity that has decided and we'll be paying the bonus. It's our 60% (27:13)
shareholder. It is not us. So to that end, it will not be sort of an integrated part of our
customer loyalty program, and we are not the designers of the bonus model.
But having said that, of course, we have a dialogue with the 60% (27:31) shareholder on
how the practicalities will be handled. And they said that they expect to be paying out
somewhere between 5% and 8% of annual insurance premiums as a bonus to the Danish
customers. And undoubtedly, we see that as a positive loyalty argument. We also see it as
somewhat of a sale document, but at the same time, we do not expect that to be a sort of
major game changer of the market, but clearly something that will contribute to our eﬀort
to keep customers staying with us longer and buy more products.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Just to elaborate a bit on what Morten is saying, one of the things that we're looking into
is whether or not we can utilize the dividend model to actually encourage customers to
sign up for electronic distribution and also to get their bank account numbers, which of
course would streamline other processes internally even further. So that is about as far as
we go in terms of trying to hook up to the new process for internal purposes so to speak.

A - Morten Hübbe
Right.

Q - In-Young Chung
True. Great. Thank you very much.

Operator
Our next question comes from Mr. Gianandrea Roberti from Carnegie. Please go ahead.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning from me as well. I actually have three questions and I apologize, the
ﬁrst one I'm going to throw you quite a bit of numbers in there. I was trying to look a little
bit at the underlying developments in Q1 2015 versus last year, right? And I can see that
the sum of large and weather claims is around DKK 50 million approximately worse this
Page 9 of 14



FINAL

Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2015-04-15

year versus last year. And then you have run-oﬀs which are roughly DKK 15 million higher
this year. So the underlying seems to be DKK 35 million worse. And then, interest rates
have an impact of around 90 bps on the combined negatively which is around DKK 40
million. So in total, I'm calculating a negative development of DKK 75 million, which is
approximately 170 bps. But then I'm wondering what has happened to the around DKK
350 million savings run rate which Q1 2015 should show versus Q1 2014? I think it's a little
bit surprising the number that you are producing today (30:07) or at least I'm failing to
grasp what are we missing here if we are missing something. I don't know if it's easy for
you to reply, but it will be quite interesting.
The other two question – one, it's actually what you just commented upon, Morten. You're
mentioning that the volume rate year-to-date doesn't aﬀect the targets going forward.
Should we take this that if rates are moved, then you need to increase prices or what?
Because, I mean 90 bps, it's not a signiﬁcant amount on the combined. And then lastly, on
the retention rates, I can see it's up 20 bps already. And you have a target of increasing
100 bps. I don't know if it's up 20 bps for any speciﬁc seasonal situation, but it just seems
quite a bit of a jump compared to your overall target? Thanks a lot.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hübbe
I think I can start oﬀ with the second question, Gianandrea. Of course, you're right that the
falling interest rates needs to be ﬁnanced somewhere. And of course, that's a bit of a
juggling act because we're trying to ﬁgure out what will happen to the interest rates from
now on and until 2017. I think the optionality we have of course is to push harder on the
eﬃciency side, to push harder on prices, and to push harder on the diﬀerentiation and
selection. But I think that the strongest commitment you need to hear is that we're not
using lower interest rate as an excuse to change our ﬁnancial targets. So we'll just make
sure that we push the other three areas hard enough to make sure that we compensate
for lower rates. And then I guess, your guess is as good as ours on model rates look like
from now on until 2017. So I guess, the jury is still out on that.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
In terms of the retention rate, Gianandrea, I guess, it's at least fair to say that if you look at
the mix, the customer mix, particularly sort of in the Private lines, we see that number of
one-product customers have been reduced, whereas the three-plus customers has
increased and of course that will give some eﬀect on the retention levels. Will it be a
stable eﬀect going forward? I think it's really diﬃcult for us to say. I mean, keep in mind
that a quarter is a relatively short time span to evaluate that eﬀect.
And then, I guess not getting into the pluses and minuses that you made in your
calculation and in principle, what you're asking about is the eﬀects of the savings program
if you look at sort of the development in terms of the underlying. And I guess it's fair to
say and that goes back to the comment that I made earlier. If you look at sort of, there is
some competitive pressure in terms of pricing. The overall price eﬀects on the portfolio
was less than what you have seen in the previous years and there is some claims inﬂation
in terms of the various products. And of course that means that signiﬁcant parts of the
eﬀect is not shown in the underlying.

Our next question comes from Mr. Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi there. Thanks. I've only got one question left and that is just to hear a bit more about
the dynamics between these pricing movements and also the movement in claims
inﬂation. Obviously, the trajectory of pricing increases is slowing in Norway and the
deterioration is sort of picking up in Denmark. So could you just give us a bit more into
how claims inﬂation has developed over the same period and what the sort of underlying
movement in the margin is as a result? That'd be great. Thanks.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Just to give you a ﬂavor, you can say that if you look into the building index for
Denmark, for instance last 12 months, it was 1.7% and the price measures in the product is
0.2%. And if you look at sort of the development in the average premium that I
commented earlier, you can see that it's actually a negative development due to portfolio
mix, due to pricing pressure in the market. So I guess that's the two main components
that gives us that picture. Naturally, if you can look into the inﬂationary development in
the Norwegian market, it will be higher. And I think if you look into the Norwegian house
product, it was for 3.5% on the building index for the last 12 (35:31) months.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

That's great. Thank you.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Just to give you a ﬂavor on that.

A - Morten Hübbe
There's no doubt though that the sort of exceptions and market ability to handle slightly
higher price increases, as you see here in Norway than it is in the Danish market. So
clearly, in Denmark, we have to work harder on the claims procurement and on the risk
selection and price diﬀerentiation. And I think the new motor product in Denmark is a
good example of that because in reality, we have to solve market competition and pricing
of motor with higher discount short term. And now, we're substituting that with a
completely new product where we see that if we're successful enough in selling add-on
coverages, then actually we should be able to enhance or improve our managing of the
slightly lower pricing in Danish motor. So still somewhat of a diﬀerence between Denmark
and Norway.

Our next question comes from Mr. Christian Hede from Nordea. Please go ahead.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. This is Christian Hede from Nordea in Copenhagen. Most of my
questions have been answered. So I just have one, which is more of a follow-up as well. I
guess, on the one-oﬀ costs, could you give us kind of some indication of what we are
talking about? What is your best estimate at the moment? I understand that you haven't
ﬁnalized anything? And also with the announcement in the Q3, as far as I understand it, is
that all going to be in the Q4 numbers than for 2015. Is that correctly understood? Thank
you.

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yes. To the latter, yes. In terms of the one-oﬀ, I think it's fair to say that both Morten and
myself have been given some [p] pathway (37:28) so to speak from the organization about
announcing numbers about FTEs and one-oﬀs to the market before it's announced to the
rest of the organization. So I guess that's one of the reasons why I would be a bit reluctant
to actually sort of state something. But keep in mind that when we talk about DKK 250
million in additional cost savings, of course that is primarily related to FTEs and that
means that we're talking about a relatively signiﬁcant amount of FTEs, and that will be the
main driver in terms of one-oﬀs. So I do appreciate, Christian, that I'm now answering with
a potato in my mouth, but I'm trying to be a bit subtle about it.

Q - Christian Hede

{BIO 18642300 <GO>}

That's fair. Thank you very much.

We have a question from Mr. Per Grønborg from Danske Market. Please go ahead.

Q - Per Grønborg
Yes. Good morning. It's Per from Danske. Your large claims, your weather-related claims,
can you put some geographies on it, how much of that is Denmark, how much of it is in
Norway?

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah. In terms of the weather-related claims, it's fair to say that on the gross side, related
to the storms, et cetera, it's slightly more than DKK 100 million. And then I think I
mentioned something about, call it, the frequency of medium-sized claims in Norway. In
terms of large claims, there is one particular driver related to large claims which is the
hotdog factory here in Denmark, as I'm sure you've read about in the papers, i.e., a large
portion at least of the large claims is related to the Danish portfolio.

Q - Per Grønborg

FINAL

Back to the weather related, you said DKK 100 million was related to Norway. Was that
correctly understood?

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yes. Slightly more on a gross level.

Q - Per Grønborg
On the gross level?

A - Tor Magne Lønnum
Yeah.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay. Thank you.
