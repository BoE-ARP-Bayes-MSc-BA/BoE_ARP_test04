call is listed. Today, I will primarily refer to the PowerPoint slides entitled Overview of the
First Quarter of FY 2015 Results to give you an overview for the first 20 minutes or so.
So, let's start from page two of the PowerPoint material. This is the overview of our
consolidated results. Net premiums written were ¥841.2 billion, up by 8.8% or ¥68.3 billion
year-on-year. This growth is attributable to the topline growth mainly in the automotive
business in the domestic non-life business, steady expansion of underwriting business by
our international subsidiaries as well as positive benefits of weaker Japanese yen.
In the Life Insurance business, combining Japanese and international business, insurance
premiums overall were ¥8.4 billion, down by 92.6% or ¥105.6 billion year-on-year. This
decline is mainly because as the investment environment improved, surrender of variable
annuities of former Financial Life increased. However, new business and total in-force
amount of TMNL steadily increased. And excluding the impact of the surrender of the
variable annuities, although it is not listed on this material, the topline rather grew by ¥15.9
billion year-on-year. Consolidated ordinary profit increased by 8.4% or ¥9.6 billion to
¥125.9 billion. Net income attributable to owners of parent company increased by 1.1% or
¥1 billion over the year to ¥89.4 billion. Meanwhile, our group-wide profit KPI adjusted net
income grew by 33.3% or ¥30.5 billion year-on-year to ¥122.2 billion.
Next, let us analyze how the consolidated ordinary profit changed from a year ago. Please
turn to page three. Within the domestic non-life business, at TMNF first, while the earned
premiums increased mainly in the automotive business, net provisions for cat loss
reserves increased, and dividend income from overseas subsidiaries decreased. As a
result, ordinary profit declined by ¥34.2 billion. As a result, ordinary profit of the domestic
non-life segment in total declined by ¥35.1 billion year-on-year. Let me come back on
more details later.
Within the domestic life business, while the in-force policy increased due to the steady
acquisition of new business, expenses related to the new business increased. As a result,
ordinary profit declined by ¥100 million year-on-year. In the international insurance
business, due to the steady progress of various growth initiatives and positive benefits of
the depreciation of the Japanese yen, ordinary profit grew by ¥15.4 billion year-on-year.
As for consolidation adjustments, negative adjustments decreased by ¥29.6 billion from a
year ago. This is because dividend that TMNF received from their consolidated
subsidiaries decreased. And accordingly, elimination of intra-group dividends decreased.
So, this is the overview of our consolidated financial results.
Next I would like to give you the highlight of business results of our major subsidiaries.
Please go to page four. This is the overview of FY 2015 first quarter results of TMNF.
Upper arrows on the slide show positive factors and downward arrows show negative
factors to the financial results. First, let us look at major factors behind the changes in
underwriting results.
Net premiums written increased particularly in the automotive business but across all the
lines of business. Net premiums written of private insurance increased by 5.2% or ¥22.8

billion year-on-year. As a result, net premiums earned grew by ¥23.8 billion and made a
positive contribution to the profit growth. For more details by line of business, please
refer to page six later.
Net incurred losses of private insurance increased by ¥14.2 billion year-on-year, mainly due
to the following reasons. Losses incurred by natural disasters which happened during the
course of the first quarter increased by ¥5.2 billion, mainly due to an increase in natural cat
events outside Japan. And while during the first quarter last year Japanese yen
appreciated, during the first quarter this year Japanese yen depreciated. As a result,
provision for reserves for outstanding claims in foreign currencies increased by ¥3 billion.
In addition to these factors, since the number of policies in-force increased, losses
incurred went up by ¥5.8 billion from a year ago. Business expenses of private insurance
increased by ¥8.3 billion year-on-year, mainly due to an increase in agency commission in
accordance with topline growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

Next, let us review cat loss reserves. During the first quarter of this year, in the fire line of
business, we did not take down the cat loss reserves different from last year when we did
take down the reserves as we paid claims related to the heavy snow in February last year
and net provision for the reserve increased this year. Also in the auto business, due to the
improvement of loss ratio, there was no withdrawal of the reserve and net provision for
the reserve increased by ¥27.5 billion year-on-year. As a result, underwriting profit
decreased by ¥21.7 billion over the year to ¥20 billion and when we exclude the impact of
cat loss reserves, underwriting profit increased by ¥5.7 billion year-on-year to ¥52 billion.
Next, let us review net investment income and other, as dividend income from overseas
subsidiaries decreased, interest in dividend income dropped. As a result, net investment
income and other decreased by ¥13.7 billion year-on-year to ¥70.9 billion. I would also note
that we sold approximately ¥34 billion worth of business-related equities during the first
quarter. Please also be advised that most of the dividends received from our overseas
subsidiaries is eliminated on a consolidated basis. Based on all of these factors, net
income decreased by ¥36 billion to ¥69 billion.
Next, let us discuss our combined ratio. Please turn to page five. First, loss ratio of private
insurance on an earned/incurred basis. Compared to a year ago, losses incurred by
natural cat increased mainly overseas and provision for reserves for outstanding claims in
foreign currencies increased due to falling Japanese yen. As a result, net losses incurred,
including loss adjustment expenses increased by ¥14.2 billion. And loss ratio of private
insurance on an earned/incurred basis went up by 0.3 points to 54.6%.
Next, business expense ratio. While there were some positive factors such as topline
growth, performance-linked bonus increased and we made some new investment to
solidify our management platform and to achieve future growth. As a result, business
expense ratio increased by 0.2 points year-on-year to 32.6%. All in all, combined ratio of
private insurance on an earned/incurred basis increased by 0.5 points year-on-year to
87.2%.

For more details, net premiums written and loss ratio by line of business is shown on page
six, and details of net investment income and other is included on page seven for your
later reference.
Next, I will explain Nisshin Fire. Please turn to page eight. Despite the growth on the net
premium written for the auto policies, underwriting profit for Nisshin Fire & Marine was
down by ¥600 million, to ¥4.2 billion, mainly due to the absence of a drawdown of the cat
loss reserve which was implemented in February last year, associated with the claims
payment of the snowstorms. Investment income was down by ¥100 million, to ¥400
million, largely due to the lower derivative gains and losses, stemming from the weaker
yen. In sum, the first quarter net income was down by ¥400 million to ¥3.1 billion due to
the reasons that I just explained.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, let me explain the result of TMN Life on page nine. I will start with the annualized
premiums or ANP. New policies ANP continued to enjoy high growth, increasing by 17.2%
year-on-year. Thanks to the great performance of first and third-sector insurance
products, as well as sales growth achieved with the individual annuities. Under a favorable
market condition, we saw an increase in the surrender of variable annuities and payout
after achieving our targeted level, which resulted in the annuities year-on-year growth of
in-force policies ANP at 0.8%. Stripping out the impact of variable annuities, the ANP grew
strongly by 14.4% year-on-year.
And next, let me walk you through the key figures in financial accounting. Despite the
higher insurance premiums, thanks to the growth of new business, cost associated with
the new policies also went up, and as a result, first quarter net income was almost flat
from last year at ¥3.1 billion. Core operating profit was down by ¥800 million to ¥6 billion
mainly due to an increase in expenses associated with new policies and other cost items.
Now, let me move on to the performance of our overseas insurance business on page 10.
The figures on this slide include everything associated with the overseas business. For
example, anything that is underwritten by the overseas branches of Tokio Marine &
Nichido Fire, equity affiliates, non-consolidated companies to be aligned with the other IR
disclosures. Net premiums improved by 13% year-on-year to ¥348.7 billion, thanks to the
progress made by respective businesses on the growth initiatives and also by weaker
yen.
Now, let me give you divisional breakdown. Net premiums written in North America grew
by 21%, thanks mainly to the premium hike on renewals and new policy growth both at
PHLY and Delphi. Although, Europe was impacted by the softening market, Tokio Marine
Kiln's business expansion led to a growth of 3%. And America was down by 2% due to the
currency impact despite the revenue growth in local currency led by the robust auto policy
sales in Brazil.
While Asia was impacted by the weak new vehicle sales in Thailand, the region enjoyed
13% growth, thanks to the sales growth of auto policies in India and China. Reinsurance
market was somewhat hit by the softening trend. But by expanding the underwriting

Page 4 of 15



Company N ame: Tokio M arine H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8766 JP Equity
Date: 2015-08-07

capacity for risk other than the natural disasters, reinsurance business grew by 18%. Life
business was down by 12% mainly due to the suspension of some products in Singapore.

FINAL

Now, let me also talk about the profit for the respective (15:49). Business unit profits for
the overseas insurance business grew by ¥8.9 billion year-on-year to ¥37.5 billion driven by
the progress made on the growth initiatives, less natural catastrophes than last year and
the depreciation of the yen.
Let me also talk about the respective regions. In North America, the profit grew by ¥10.3
billion. Profit for PHLY was up, thanks to the expansion of the underwriting capacity and
decrease in natural catastrophes. Delphi also enjoyed higher investment income. Profit in
Europe was down by ¥2.6 billion after going through a temporary large tax burden period
last year, as well as having several large losses this fiscal year.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Latin America, profit was up in local currency, and thanks mainly to the growth in
investment income which was driven by the interest rate hike. However, due to the
currency translation, profit was almost flat from last year. Profit in Asia grew by ¥1 billion
due to weaker yen and other reasons. Profit for the reinsurance business was down by
30% due to the absence of the reserves drawdown which was done last year and foreign
exchange losses with stronger U.S. dollar and weaker Aussie dollar. Profit for the life
business was up by ¥800 million, mainly due to the growth in unrealized gains, thanks to
the equity market appreciation such as in Singapore and others.
Please refer to page 12 for further details on the results of PHLY and Delphi. Now, let me
cover the first quarter adjusted net income for the whole Group on page 13. And this
page covers the adjusted net income for the whole Group. Adjusted net income is a clear
representation of the profit base that is generated from the underlying business by
making some adjustments to the quarterly net income from the consolidated financial
statements. The way in which this is done, if we take out the impact of loss (18:29)
reserve, such as the cat loss reserves that is very unique to the P&C business, and adjust
for any disposal gains or losses on asset divestiture and valuation losses.
Adjusted net income for the first quarter grew by ¥30.5 billion or 33.3% year-on-year to
¥122.2 billion. The main factors behind the increase was the growth of the underwriting
profit to the domestic P&C business after stripping out the impact of the cat loss
reserves, stronger investment income at Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire, excluding the
dividend income from the overseas subsidiaries, and profit growth for the overseas
business.
Let me also clarify the major changes in the reconciliation from the accounting quarterly
net income to adjusted net income comparing this year versus last year. The provisioning
of cat loss reserves increased this year compared to last year, and this had a positive
impact of ¥21.4 billion on the adjusted net income this year. Last year, there was a
negative ¥6.3 billion contribution on the other extraordinary gains and losses valuation
allowance line associated with the expensing of the taxable impairment losses on Tokio
Marine & Nichido Fire's equities. The absence of this is giving us an increase of ¥6.3 billion
to the adjusted net income this year.

Thank you very much, Mr. Sasaki. We would now like to begin the Q&A session. For
participants from overseas, the operator is now explaining how to place questions; from
Japan, please be patient for a while. Once again, for participants from overseas, the
operator is explaining how to place questions. For domestic participants, we thank you for
your patience.

Q&A
Operator
The first question is from Mr. Otsuka from Nomura Securities.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

Thank you for this opportunity. With regards to domestic P&C business and international
business, I would like to ask you questions. This is actually a common question to you
both, but against the full-year budget, how do you appreciate your progress during the
first quarter? On page four, for domestic P&C business first, excluding the cat loss
reserve, underwriting profit full-year target is ¥131.7 billion, I believe. However, you have
already achieved ¥52 billion already and therefore I believe that you made a very good
progress during the first three months already. But how do you see the balance of the
year? That is my first question.
And similarly on page 11, for international insurance business, the profit that you made was
¥37.5 billion against the full-year target of ¥127 billion excluding forex impact. I believe that
you were rather expecting a negative growth for this full-year, this fiscal year, and yet
even excluding the currency impact during the first quarter, you did achieve positive
growth on year-on-year basis. So, you seem to be also achieving a good progress here.
But how do you appreciate the current conditions for the international business at the
moment?

A - Operator
My name is Nakai (22:50) from accounting department. Let me first of all explain to you
the domestic P&C business at TMNF. Profit that we achieved in the first quarter vis-à-vis
the full-year target, we seem to have made a good progress, so how do we assess
where we stand at the moment. I think it's a good question. Normally, for our P&C
business, we have some seasonality. For example, we have fewer cases in the first
quarter and we don't have much snow damage typically in the first quarter. And therefore,
the profit in the first quarter seems to be better than the other quarters. And on the other
hand, down the road, as we close the second quarter and third quarter, respectively, on
the quarterly basis, the profit is expected to come down somewhat, and therefore, we
are doing well. And of course, we have achieved good results in achieving the full year
budget.

My name is Iwata (23:58) from International Business Development Department. As you
have correctly pointed out, we have achieved 30% of the full year budget. During the first
quarter, some of the extraordinary factors include natural cats. We budgeted for ¥46
billion on the full-year basis, and the actual losses by natural cat events was smaller, and
therefore that had a positive impact of ¥24 billion (24:35) to the bottom line. And also
there were some take down of the reserves by a little bit more than ¥1 billion or so. So
excluding those factors, looking at the underlying trend of the business, all in all, we have
achieved 25% to 26% of the full year budget which is almost a quarter of the full-year
budget. So we're pretty much on track. I hope it answered your questions.

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

So, just for the clarification purpose, if I may ask, for those domestically and also
internationally, your company's view is that you are on track, you are in line with the
original projection. Is that a fair understanding? And secondly, typhoon 11 and 12, the ones
that hit Japan – in Japan, do you have a rough estimation of the losses incurred by these
two typhoons?

A - Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

For domestic and also international business, yes we do understand that we are
performing in line with the original plan. And as for typhoons 11 and 12, we have not
calculated the losses incurred by the typhoons accurately. However, we believe that some
billion yen worth of losses have been incurred by these two typhoons in our current
estimation.

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

Thank you.

Operator
The next question is from Deutsche Securities, Mr. Muraki.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

My first question is about the annualized business in Japan. The loss ratio for the auto
policies, on incurred basis, compared to first quarter last year is improving. For the full
year plan, I think you're projecting just a slight increase versus the plan. Is the loss ratio
better than expected? And for the overseas event or the natural catastrophes versus
what is recognized for Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire, what are the events that are
recognized by TMNF? And for the HCC acquisition, the pricing range for that, at this point
how are you planning to fund the acquisition money?

A - Operator
My name is (27:20) Personal Lines Underwriting Department. On the first point regarding
the loss ratio of the auto policy, first quarter was good. But for the full year plan, it's
almost flat, but was increased from last year And so how we see this today as a structure
in the first half, we proved that there was a bigger contribution of direct auto policy. And
Page 7 of 15



Company N ame: Tokio M arine H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8766 JP Equity
Date: 2015-08-07

FINAL

so, that's why we saw an improvement in the loss ratio for the auto policies. But if you
look closely, in the first quarter, the (27:52) action is also improving. So, compared to our
plan, it is slightly better than expected. At the same time, we have not fully calculated
everything (28:05) the application for the claims for the month of July, it looks like it's
slightly deteriorating from the first quarter.
So, at this point, we cannot say that the loss ratio will continue to fare better than
expected. So, we will need to closely monitor the situation. But on the second point
regarding the natural disasters, we said it is recognized by TMNF. So, there was hail
damage in Australia and this was risk underwritten by TMNF. So, the natural disaster in
Australia for this hail damage is covered by TMNF. And on the third point regarding the
acquisition funding for HCC, most of the unnecessary money will be funded internally. And
as for the detail, we're looking at the medium to longer-term funding mix and we will
finalize the plan.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

In that sense the level of borrowing will not increase due to the acquisition, is that correct?

A - Operator
It could go up.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

So, the acquisition money is mostly going to be funded internally or you will monetize
some of the liquid assets and small portions may be funded through borrowings, is that
right?

A - Operator
Yes.
The next question is from Mr. Noda from Goldman Sachs.

Q - Taichi Noda

{BIO 16478436 <GO>}

I would like to ask you two questions. First – well, actually, this is separate from the two
questions that I wanted to ask you. But following up on the question that Mr. Muraki asked
earlier, you talked about hail risk. Is this the one that happened in January through March
period? Is that something that you recognized during the first quarter of this fiscal year?
So, when did it happen and when did you recognize that? So that is one additional
question.
And coming back to my questions, my first question is related to sales of business-related
equities. You sold ¥34 billion worth, as indicated on page seven. This, I believe, is a much
bigger sale compared to last year. Was there any particular factor in addition to the fact
that the equity prices increased?

Page 8 of 15

FINAL

And my second question is related to TMNL. After it merged with TM Financial Life, I
believe that more of the variable annuities have matured already or being surrendered
already. So do you think that the situation around variable annuities could be turned
around to make a positive contribution to profit? And is it possible that the TMNL
recognized some profit by taking down the cat loss reserve as well? And I believe that
there was decrease by about ¥200 billion or so in the first half. So is there any potential of
you taking down the cat loss reserves.

A - Operator
My name is Nakai (31:41) from Corporate Accounting Department. The one which
happened in April was better than the loss this time around. Thank you.
My name is Kinoshita (31:57) from Financial Planning Department of Holdings. With regards
to the equity sales, we did ended up in selling more than we initially expected. However,
again, our full-year target is to sell more than ¥100 billion worth. So we would like to
continue to follow through this plan to ensure that we can exceed ¥100 billion milestone
on a full-year basis. So in that sense I believe that we are pretty much in line with the plan.
My name is Okada (32:27) from Corporate Planning of TMNL. You pointed out that more
annuities are being surrendered, and essentially risks are being hedged by reinsurance.
And therefore, we believe that the impact to our financial results is rather limited down
the road.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Taichi Noda

{BIO 16478436 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Our next question is from Ms. Tsujino of JPMorgan.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

First on the overseas natural disasters, the ones that you book at overseas subsidiaries.
Based on the explanation, pre-tax the first quarter natural disaster, I think, is ¥4 billion to
¥5 billion of loss. Can you give me the number for the natural disaster and also for cat
overseas?
And the second question is for TMNF from the underwriting profit, if you take out the
(33:40) nat cat loss and the currency impact and the net provision of the nat cat loss
reserve, it will be about ¥60 billion.

A - Operator
Our net income assumption is under ¥70 billion for the full year. I think the underwriting
reserve may have come down as a burden and the rate hike had a bigger impact. I think it
has given us those reasons, but excluding the cat loss reserve and excluding other
extraordinary items, the adjusted net income looks quite positive.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

But is it in line with your expectation, or is it better than expected?

A - Operator

FINAL

On the first point regarding the nat cat loss reserve, it's ¥5.8 billion.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

I was asking for the overseas subsidiaries' cat loss was ¥46 billion, but it was less. So I
think on the adjusted net income, it looks better by ¥2 billion to ¥3 billion. The pre-tax loss
expected for ¥46 billion for overseas, what was the actual number?

A - Operator
So, for the full year, we are planning ¥46 billion. In the first quarter, the actual was ¥6.1
billion cat loss incurred. It's slightly bigger. It was due to the cold snow in (35:36) North
America in February. That had an impact of ¥3 billion.
And on the second point on the profit level of TMNF. TMNF looks higher than expected.
But as we explained earlier, it has some seasonality that had a bigger impact and also
level of natural disasters. And those are the reasons why the first quarter profit looks
slightly better than expected.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

The burden on the underwriting reserves I think was down by ¥4.6 billion year-on-year. Is
there a particular reason for this?

A - Operator
And for the auto policies, the provisioning on the ordinary underwriting reserves came
down. But for the full year for the auto policies we expect the additional provisioning to be
lighter. So, we're quite comfortable with the progress we're showing today.
The next question is from Mr. Sasaki of Merrill Lynch Japan.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

My name is Sasaki from Merrill Lynch. I just wanted to ask you one question, different from
financial results actually, with regards to governance report. When do you intend to
disclose that? Do you have any schedule in your mind? As of today, I believe you're the
only one that is yet to disclose that based on new code. So when do you think the new
updated code-based governance report is scheduled to come out?

A - Operator
Well, actually at 2:30 PM today we issued our report. If you go to our website, therefore, I
believe that you can find our Corporate Governance Report. So I hope that you would
take a look.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. With regards to business-related equities, what kind of statements did you include
in the report? I don't think that the report was actually uploaded to the website of TMG,
so if you could perhaps give me some brief overview as to what kind of statements you
have included?

A - Operator
My name is Kinoshita (38:07) from Financial Planning Department. With regards to the
proxy right exercise, we have made some disclosures. And also with regards to its return
of economy of us holding equities, we do have to check on that every year with our board
of directors. That is another statement that we included in the report.
And with regards to standards of us exercising proxy rights, we already disclosed our
policy as part of the stewardship code last year. And so we made similar statement
included in the report this time around.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

With regards to the assessment of the functions of the BOD, have you incorporated any
different or new or additional statements in the report this time around?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Shiro Sasaki

{BIO 19269575 <GO>}

I am Sasaki from IR. With regards to business-related equities, let me read the statement
out for you. With regards to business-related equities, every year at our board of
directors for major holdings, we assess the risks and returns in order to check the
economy of us holding those equities. That is a statement that we have included in the
report.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
Next question is from Majima, Tokai Tokyo Research Center.

Q - Tatsuo Majima

{BIO 15338044 <GO>}

This is a follow-up question to the previous ones. It's not related to the results. Regarding
the acquisition funding for HCC, you mentioned that you will be using internal cash, but
within the group, I think TMNF is only entity with robust cash. I guess it will be subject to if
you will be using the deposits. But I think you need to keep that for the potential clients in
the future. So, in that sense when you say internal cash, how much internal cash is
available? So do you have enough cash? Looking at the balance sheet, can you identify
which are the internal cash that's been available?

So, we made the announcement in the early part of June. We also made this explanation,
but for the acquisition price, we were looking at ¥140 (40:50) billion using the currency
exchange rate of ¥125 against $1. And regarding the financing of this money, we have no
intention to issue new equity. And we have two options. One is that we use the internal
cash within the group and then, third will be external funding. I think those were the
explanations that we gave.
And in terms of the proportion and the details, at this point we cannot offer you anymore
specific details. But when we as a group, TMNF will be the major entity, but overseas we
have some dollar-denominated cash that will be available. So, we are considering to make
use of that. So, there are various items on the balance sheet, but it's difficult for us to just
point out which are the items that are readily available as cash. But things that are not
liabilities is something that will be available for us to use.

There seems to be no question at the moment, so the operator is repeating how to
place questions for the Japanese participants once again. We thank you for your patience.

The next question is from Mr. Yabumoto of Mizuho Securities.

Q - Yusuke Yabumoto

{BIO 16424475 <GO>}

Thank you. I would like to ask you two questions quickly. First, domestic P&C. And another
one related to International. First, in the domestic P&C business, the commission ratio
seems to have increased, and I think it's related to personnel cost, but what are the
particular cost items that increased, and what is your future outlook going forward? And
second question is related to International business. Major loss in Europe. What kind of
loss was it? And what was the magnitude of the loss?

A - Operator
On your first question related to business expense ratio which has increased. First of all,
the personnel cost and non-personnel cost both increased. And commissions also
increased by 0.1 point in percentage terms. And with regards to personnel cost,
essentially the performance-linked payment increased. And with regards to nonpersonnel cost, on the other hand, we have been making some investment in order to
solidify our management platform and to achieve further growth. And we have a full-year
investment plan and we have made some investment during the first quarter as well.
My name is Iwata (44:02) from International Business Development Department. To your
second question, other risks and natural cat risks, so normal property and fire-related
accidents caused some losses in terms of number of events; several accidents. And in
terms of magnitude, around ¥1 billion.

The next question is from Mr. Muraki from Deutsche Securities.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

I have additional question. Maybe difficult to answer because I'm asking (44:46). For TMNF,
auto policy sales of non-fleet in units. You are the only one (44:59) the other peers are
just flat – they were actually decreasing the number of fleet. It's not just happening this
quarter, but it's been a trend for some time. How are you interpreting this trend?
And also for TMN Life, the in-force ANP growth – your growth is outperforming the peers.
How are you assessing this trend and how sustainable is this?

A - Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

So, my name is 45:42) from Personal Lines Underwriting Department. For the non-fleet,
we are the only one that's doing well in the industry. We have been enhancing the South
American strategy to capture the opportunities. And as a result of that, I believe we were
able to increase the units. And also, with the rate revision, last year, the rate hike was
notably moderate compared to the others. So, that may have a positive impact on our
business.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

Now for the auto non-fleet, in reality there may not be a big difference, but based on the
media, the others have listed some rate reduction. But do you believe there would be an
impact in the share from auto?

A - Operator
Some of the competitors have indicated a small rate reduction. But looking at the
difference and the current premium level, I don't think this will have a big impact.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

A - Operator
My name is (47:06) from Corporate Planning Department from TMN Life. Regarding the
growth of the ANP in the first quarter for the individual annuities, we have lowered the
exchange rate effective July 2, so we were expecting (47:21) in that, but we actually
enjoyed some upside. And for the growth excluding the long-standing (47:35) products,
we were expecting to grow by 10% year-on-year, right now because it's 6.7%, it's
underperforming that plan. But recently, we have launched the new cancer product. So it's

coming back to our projected plan. So, for the full year, we expect to achieve the 10%
growth and it's excluding the NPR for the long-dated savings type product.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you very much for that answer.

A - Operator
There seems to be no question at the moment, so the operator is repeating how to
place questions once again to domestic participants.
My name is (48:33) from Corporate Planning Department of TMNL. I seem to have
mentioned surrender of annuities. However, in line with the deduction of the – because
we decreased assumed rate of interest, there was last-minute demand for the individual
annuities. Sorry about that.
The next question is from Ms. Tsujino from JPMorgan.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

If I may ask you another question on TMNL, ANP of new policies, and if you just single out
individual policies, I think it increased by 3.4% year-on-year. The rate of growth seems to
be now decelerating somewhat. And if you look at the amount of new policies acquired
just looking at the individual policies, it increased by 8.1%. In terms of the amount of new
business acquired, I believe that it's used to achieve double-digit rate of growth, for
example in the case of last year. So, the rate of growth seems to be decelerating, just
singling out the individual policies. However, if you look at the total in-force amount, I
believe that the surrender rate is rather low, and therefore, you seem to be keeping a
relatively good rate of growth. So looking at the sales of individual policies, have you
noticed any changes in the market?

A - Operator
Yes. My name is (50:01) from Corporate Planning Department of TMNL. Just singling out
individual policies, we only achieved 3.4% growth. We seemed to be weaker than what we
used to achieve. As I mentioned earlier, there are two types of long-term savings
products. One is individual annuities and the other is the long-term discount whole life
policies.
However, these types of policies are now excluded in our full year assumption of
achieving CAGR 10%. And the long-term discount of products is not focused in our sales
and therefore, the actual sales is about 70% of what it was last year. And this is pretty
much in line with our initial expectation, but we have less focus actually on the sales
cautiously of this type of particular sales. And therefore, excluding this type of products on
individual polices, the rate of growth was – so, overall the ANP of new policies grew only
by 3.4%. However, excluding the long-term policy in particular, it did actually grow by 6.7%.
And so, just looking at the first quarter, actually we felt this seems to be somewhat weak.
However, on the July 2, we launched two new cancer products. And at the moment, as of
Page 14 of 15

FINAL

the end of July, according to our preliminary number – that is only data that we have at the
moment. And according to that data point, excluding the two types of long-term
products, we have already recovered the rate of growth to more than 10%. So, we
believe that we are now in a good position to achieve the full-year growth rate target.
Thank you.
There seems to be no further questions. And so the operator is explaining how to place
another question. So, for the registered participants, please be patient.
It seems like there are no further questions. I will turn over to Mr. Sasaki.
