{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thanks Dennis. Good morning everyone. Earlier today, we announced the Third Quarter
net operating income per share of CAD0.41 despite reporting our ﬁrst underwriting loss
in the last 10 years, driven by extreme weather events. As we announced in September,
cat losses from the early part of the quarter amounted to CAD1.52 per share.
From a topline perspective, premium growth of 6% reﬂects the continued successful
integration of Jevco. September marked the ﬁrst month of purely organic growth that
we've reported in two years. Although growth slowed somewhat in the quarter, we
believe our action plan can generate low to mid-single-digit growth in 2014.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our earnings over the past year have generated an operating ROE of 12.7% and a 5%
increase in book value per share. From a capital perspective, we are comfortable with our
MCT of 199%. And expect it to remain relatively constant through year-end.
As we outlined on our last earnings call, the extreme weather events from the summer
have made it clear that the sustainability of home insurance in its current form is being
challenged. I indicated then that we must bring meaningful change to that line of
business and established an objective of generating 10 points of combined ratio
improvement over the next 24 months.
As we have shown in the past, we are quick to act when we feel the bottom line is under
pressure. In fact, renewals eﬀective November 1 now reﬂect our new pricing algorithm,
which should lead to average rate increases in the low teens, varying by province.
But we cannot reach our objective with pricing alone. This fall, we began communicating
our action plan with brokers from coast to coast. Our plan focuses on ensuring customers
have a better understanding of the risks they face and what they can do to better adapt to
climate change.
In the coming months, we will implement meaningful product changes, including higher
deductibles as well as the introduction of sub-limits. We will also show separate pricing by
peril to provide customers with a better sense of the cost of various types of coverage. At
the same time, we will oﬀer customers the option to reduce premiums through loss
prevention discounts.

FINAL

As I said, this issue is not one solely aﬀecting the insurance industry. But rather society as
a whole. And as such, we are continuing to work with the University of Waterloo to raise
awareness amongst communities and to provide guidance as to how they can better
protect themselves against the impact of extreme weather.
Moving to automobile insurance, we maintain our positive view on this line of business.
We are operating in an environment where both competitors and regulators behave fairly
rationally and costs have been generally stable in the recent past. Understandably,
Ontario continues to be a source of concern with investors. But our view has not really
changed.
The government has outlined its timetable for expected rate decreases overall. And it's
really what we anticipated as the targeted rate reduction will be phased over a couple of
years. What is important now is for the government to come out with the details for the
cost portion of the cost and rate reduction strategy. I maintain the view that they
understand the importance of meaningful cost reduction measures to ensure availability
of the product, given the industry operates near breakeven at the moment.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are encouraged that the government reaﬃrmed through legislation during the last
quarter that Minor Injury Guidelines are indeed binding. And we continue to work with
the government and the Insurance Bureau of Canada to identify additional cost reduction
measures that would be eﬀective in the coming years. We expect concrete measures to
be announced in the near term.
We are pleased that the mediation backlog in Ontario has been fully assigned and is
expected to be cleared by year-end. This really should help alleviate some of the inherent
uncertainty in the system.
It's important to bear in mind, though, that a ﬁle is not necessarily closed after mediation
as the insured could still choose to dispute the outcome in arbitration. Consequently, we
have seen the number of arbitrations increase 68% at the industry level during the ﬁrst
eight months of 2013. Due to our proactive approach to managing our ﬁles and disputes,
IFC's arbitration had increased only 3%. Beyond that, our view of the Ontario market is
largely unchanged. And we feel strongly about our ability to grow and outperform in that
market.
This morning, we announced the upcoming launch of a telematics-based solution that will
allow drivers in Quebec starting this year to save on their annual insurance premiums
based on their driving behaviors. We expect to introduce a similar program to the Ontario
market in early 2014 and two other provinces throughout next year. We believe this will
allow us to attract and reward safe drivers with discounts based on their driving behaviors.
And will also contribute to the Ontario government's policy objectives in the coming
years.
When it comes to our outlook for the industry, we foresee low single-digit growth in the
near term with upper single-digit growth in personal property. And low single-digit
growth in personal auto and commercial lines. We continue to expect the current hard

FINAL

market conditions in personal property to accelerate meaningfully for the foreseeable
future. We also expect ﬁrming conditions in approximately one-quarter of the commercial
P&C industry in the near term. The low interest rate environment and elevated losses from
catastrophes should support our growth outlook.
Turning to the industry's ROE, we do not expect the industry to reach its long-term
average of 10% in 2013 largely due to the elevated cat activity which has already
materialized.
Looking speciﬁcally at Intact Financial Corporation, we believe we will continue to
outperform the industry's ROE by at least 500 basis points.
The beneﬁts from our two most recent acquisitions are undeniable with growth and
proﬁtability metrics both exceeding initial expectations. Thanks to extraordinary eﬀorts of
our employees from coast to coast, integration eﬀorts have gone very well and are now in
the ﬁnal stages. We remain on track to complete the system decommissioning of AXA in
early 2014, with Jevco following shortly thereafter.

Bloomberg Transcript

In conclusion, I believe the disciplined approach we take towards operating our business
will continue to serve us well. I am conﬁdent that we will confront new challenges with the
same level of transparency and determination that has brought us to where we are today.
Given the quality of our operations and the ﬂexibility provided by our ﬁnancial position,
we believe we will continue to outperform the industry and maintain our superior level of
proﬁtability.
And with that, I will turn the call to our CFO, Mark Tullis.

Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

This morning, we reported Third Quarter results greatly impacted by previously
announced cats. These losses added more than 15 points to our combined ratio, driving it
above 100% for the ﬁrst time since being a publicly traded company. However, despite
the cat losses, we reported net operating income of CAD0.41 per share on the strength of
our underlying performance. In fact, this quarter, we reported one of our strongest
underlying loss ratios, which excludes cats and prior year development.
Personal property was hit especially hard by the cats. However, we reported a 7 point
year-over-year improvement in the underlying results. Although we beneﬁted from
relatively good weather outside of the cats, the actions we have taken in this line of
business over the past 12 to 18 months are also clearly bearing fruit. And we remain
committed to operating our property business at or below a 95% combined ratio.
Part of our plan to improve results is via pricing, where we are taking meaningful rate
actions. We realize that this might translate into some loss of units in the short-term. But
we believe protecting the bottom line is essential. We are also on track to roll out new
product features in the ﬁrst part of next year.

FINAL

Losses from cats also impacted our results in personal auto although to a lesser extent
than in 2012. This quarter experienced CAD27 million of such losses, down from CAD45
million in Q3 of last year when hail, which hits auto harder, was a larger contributor to cat
losses. Our 93% combined ratio was almost 2 points better than a year ago as favorable
prior-year development was also quite healthy at CAD56 million.
On a year-to-date basis, our performance remains quite strong with a combined ratio of
91.4%. From a topline perspective, growth of 8% in the quarter reﬂects the addition of
Jevco.
Growth in our commercial lines businesses was 4% versus Q3 of last year reﬂecting the
addition of Jevco. This quarter, the combined ratio of 102.5% in commercial lines was
signiﬁcantly higher than a year ago, reﬂecting nearly CAD100 million of losses from cats.
We continue to expect ﬁrmer conditions in commercial P&C, driven by industry groups
that represent approximately 25% of the market.
Our expense ratio was higher than last year when we beneﬁted both from a one-time
release as well as from favorable timing of accruals. Also this quarter, the accruals, which
tend to vary from quarter to quarter, went the other way.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our net investment income of CAD104 million was 13% higher than a year ago, as we
continue to beneﬁt from reinvesting the additional assets from Jevco into our higheryielding portfolio. Now that the Jevco assets have been fully integrated, we expect
investment income will remain ﬂat in the coming quarters, given the continuing low yield
environment.
The combination of our underwriting loss and the impact of tax-free dividend income
resulted in a negative eﬀective tax rate this quarter. Our tax rate is always higher in
quarters with more underwriting income and lower or negative in quarters with less
underwriting income.
Our ﬁnancial position remains solid at the end of the quarter with $515 million in excess
capital and book value per share 5% higher than a year ago. Our estimated MCT
improved slightly to 199% within the 195% to 205% range previously outlined. The ratio
was helped by our earnings in the quarter, improved equity in capital markets. And a
slowdown in our share buyback activity. In the absence of unusual events or growth
opportunities, we anticipate in the near term our MCT will remain in the 195% to 205%
range.
Acquisition synergies remain on track as our integration is near completion. Thought we
are not yet done, I want to thank our employees for their hard work over the past two
years. With the expertise they now have, we are even better positioned for future
opportunities that may arise.
I believe that Intact continues to have a sustainable competitive advantage due to our
disciplined approach and quality operations. As this summer has demonstrated, our

Page 5 of 18

employees have shown that they will work hard to provide our customers with world-class
service even in the face of unprecedented levels of weather events.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Dennis.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Tom MacKinnon, BMO Capital.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good morning. Two questions here, Charles. I wonder if you can
elaborate ﬁrst of all on what the tone has been like in terms the dialogue with the
government on the cost reduction measures, kind of what you're looking for for
implementation. And how you're prioritizing these. And I have a follow-up.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think, as I mentioned in my remarks, these guys really understand. I think they're
constructive. And they know that cost reduction measures will be critical to ensure that the
product is available in the market. I think there's been actually concrete measures that
were implemented in August, actually, such as reaﬃrming that Minor Injury Guidelines are
actually binding. And this was done through legislation, which, in my mind, will have a
positive impact on the inﬂation in the system going forward, an important measure to
strengthen the impact of the minor injury. We are working with them to provide concrete
ideas that can have an impact in the short-term and that are compatible from a public
policy objective to be rolled out in the short-term. And just to give you a bit of ﬂavor, I'll
ask Mathieu to share with you a number of the ideas that are currently on the table.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

So I'm working with IBC. We've proposed a few items to the government. We are
expecting antifraud or some of the recommendations by the antifraud task force measure
to be implemented. We are expecting a review of the ADR process, the mediation
process, to help simplify the process and make it more streamlined. Some
recommendations were proposed in terms of the MIG guideline, in terms of pre-existing
medical conditions, how are they are deﬁned. So a series of measures to help on the cost
side, on the Claims side.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thanks Mathieu. So Tom, my sense. And I have a fair bit of interactions with folks there,
these guys want to do the right thing for Ontarians. I think it is a politically charged
Page 6 of 18



FINAL

Date: 2013-11-06

environment. But they are approaching the issue from the perspective of Ontarians and
Ontario drivers. And I think they want to do the right thing. And so in my mind, people's
intentions are well aligned. It is politically charged. I have described to investors that there
is a base case scenario where I think we will see good symmetry between cost and rates.
Then there are more adverse scenarios where there would be a disconnect between cost
and rates. And as I've mentioned before, we have a number of measures that we are
ready to act upon should we move in that scenario. But we are certainly not there at this
stage.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. Then on the telematics, what was the thinking behind the implementation
of this? Presumably, it has some sort of a proﬁt motive, or topline growth motive. I'm
wondering if you could share what you think would be the impact of that as you continue
to roll out this product, not just necessarily in Quebec but in some other provinces in
2014.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I'll let Martin take that one, Tom.

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Using telematics in fact is well aligned with what we are about. And that's leveraging our
scale. And this is a way to segment even further with new information our pricing and our
underwriting. So we are expecting margin expansion through this.
We don't have at the moment an exact impact because it will depend on how the claims
side materializes versus these variables. We don't have a lot of data yet -- we anticipate
the correlation but we don't have the exact data. And we are expecting as well that,
through that segmentation, we will expand our growth in the market. And we are really
aligning ourselves with what the Ontario government is trying to achieve, which is reward
safe driving behaviors.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So Tom, this is a proﬁt growth play that we're trying to achieve here. I think; will it move
the needle in the short-term? Hard to tell. As far as I'm concerned, I think we have a plan
that we are aiming for. I think we will be in a better position to clarify the impact that this
will have in the coming 36 months, probably in six months from now, once we get a good
sense of the take-up in terms of new business. And then what our existing clients actually
choose to do. We will get ﬁrst a picture in Quebec. We'll likely get a picture in Ontario in
the ﬁrst half this year. I think the rest of the country will see deployments for the rest of the
year. It's something that we have been monitoring very closely for many years. I think, as
I've mentioned before, we have made a conscious choice not to be the ﬁrst ones with
that. But we had agreed upon a few years back that as soon as somebody has output that,
that within 6 to nine months we should be out and that's what we are announcing this
morning.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

And are there any costs associated with starting up these eﬀorts?

FINAL

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

The startup costs are minimal. I would not consider this as substantial. There is a cost for
the device. But this is something that those ongoing costs are really manageable within
the way we are going to associate discounts to those behaviors.

A - Charles Brindamour

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Shubha Khan

{BIO 16255963 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. Just on reserve development in personal auto, it's been quite
strong for three quarters in a row now. I assume the most of that is coming from Ontario.
And I also assume that you continue to reserve conservatively there, I guess because the
environment remains uncertain.
My question is at what point would you be comfortable battling back that conservatism?
Because judging by your comments it appears that the environment, at least with respect
to bodily injury, for example, has been fairly stable for a few quarters now. And the impact
of the 2010 reforms appear to be unfolding as expected. Your arbitration backlog is up
only 3%. So I imagine that isn't generating too much uncertainty either. So when would
you be comfortable dialing back that conservatism in personal auto?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I'll let Mathieu explain his perspective on bodily injury, which is an important portion of
our reserves and our IBNR. I think you are seeing healthy favorable development beyond
and above our long-term average there. I think that it is fair to say that Ontario contributes
to that. I think there's favorable development, as you can see, in the stat supplement for
all accident years. So it's not all Ontario. And it's not all accident beneﬁt or post reformdriven. That's the ﬁrst point I will make.
The bulk of the favorable development that we observe in Ontario is driven by actual ﬁles
that we close as opposed to meaningful changes in our thought process as to the degree
of conservatism that is needed. There is still some uncertainty in the system which we take
into account as we reserve. And I think BI in particular is one of those key elements. And I

Page 8 of 18



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2013-11-06

will let Mathieu comment on his perspective of the BI environment and why he thinks we
should be cautious on that front.

FINAL

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

We should be cautious. And we are cautious. We see an increase in the number of claims
higher than pre-reform level. This was expected as some of the AB claims are transferred
on the BI side. Although the increase that we see is less than our reform expectation, you
have 2 to 2.5 years to submit a claim. And that claim may stay on average stay open for
another two years. So we are looking at four or ﬁve years duration here. So that's why
post-reform claims, we are not there yet. So that's why we need to remain cautious.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Exactly. What we are seeing in the ﬁeld, day in day out, are claims adjusters work is pretty
good. I think at a high level we have to take into account what Mathieu has just mentioned
and that's the basis on which we are reserving right now. And I think we're pretty
comfortable with that position. And I think, as ﬁles close, then you see favorable reserve
development at this stage. But no change in stance on our part.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Shubha Khan

{BIO 16255963 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. And if I could just switch gears quickly to commercial P&C, it looks
like cat losses have been elevated through the summer. And you seem to suggest that
this could result in ﬁrmer pricing over time. In the more immediate term, do these
elevated cats provide the necessary impetus to reduce coverage or implement other sort
of product tweaks similar to what you've been doing in personal property? Or in other
words, do you intend -- or do you need to or intend to take actions (inaudible) in
commercial P&C?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So I think there's two elements to your question which are distinct. I think let's ﬁrst go over
what we think we need to do in a relationship with catastrophes on the product. And then
we can maybe give you a broader sense of where we see the market heading and what
we're seeing right now on the market and I'll ask Alain Lessard, SVP Commercial Lines, to
share his perspective on that.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

So if we look at -- the ﬁrst thing when we are talking about commercial property is that we
do provide ﬂood coverage. We provide sewer backup and ﬂood coverage. In general, if
we look at our portfolio, roughly about 40% of our insured are insured for ﬂood and
sewer backup. So like you said, the summer event, either the rain in Ontario or the ﬂood
in Calgary, has led us to really reconsider some of the action there.
The ﬁrst thing we are right now in the process of implementing is minimum deductible.
We had variable minimum deductible between CAD10,000 and CAD25,000 varying by
provinces. We are now in the process of harmonizing that, going to CAD25,000
everywhere.
Page 9 of 18



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2013-11-06

FINAL

We also have a measure where we don't oﬀer ﬂood coverage in ﬂood recurring territory.
And basically those two events right now we are reviewing those territories to see if there
is somewhere we see more ﬂood than we were expecting. So normally this will also have
an impact on availability of coverage. And we are going to be reviewing our rates for
ﬂood and sewer backup in Q1 2014.
On the market, we have been I think pretty consistent since the beginning of the year
saying that we were expecting ﬁrming conditions for about a quarter of the market, the
market that was the worst performing. I think the ﬂood, the event of the summer, is
adding pressure. The renewal of the reinsurance that will be coming for some companies
will also I guess adds some pressure, in addition to low interest rates. So we are now
seeing I would say still a very healthy market in the sense that new business is really still
competitive. But we are seeing more and more companies coming out with a proﬁtability
message on some classes of business and on some like ﬂood and sewer backup where
they are seeing and implementing underwriting rules.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I would say right now, we were expecting ﬁrming conditions on about 25% of the
market. I would say that we are slowly seeing those ﬁrming conditions emerge.
And if I look more on numbers side, we were pushing rate increase throughout the last
few years, a small rate increase in renewal. And now we have been achieving like 1.9% rate
increase on the First Quarter, about 2.3% in Quarter 2. And during the summer, we have
kind of I would say reviewed our renewal strategy, pushing more rate increase on the
underperforming segments. And now we are achieving 3% in Q3 on rate increase at
renewal, going to 3.3% in the month of September. So we are seeing some traction in that
movement. But it still slowly ﬁrming up. It's not like happening on every risk everywhere.
But you know, the 25% we are seeing really ﬁrming condition gradually and we expect
that to continue next year.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

You might comment -- I guess to judge the market, you might comment on what you're
seeing in terms of retention and new business production and so on.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Yes. Like we said, we've increased our rates on new business in Q1. That had about no
impact on our closing ratio. We are pushing a new rate increase in October.
On the renewal side, when we started pushing more rate increases during the summer,
we saw a slight decrease in the renewal retention going from 86% to 85.5%. So we are
applying something like 0.5 point to 1 point reduction in retention. But this is because we
are pushing more rates on the underperforming segment.

Q - Shubha Khan

{BIO 16255963 <GO>}

That's great. Thanks, I'll requeue.

FINAL

Q - Stephen Boland

{BIO 5546446 <GO>}

Good morning. A couple of questions. Just under the Minor Injury Guidelines, you said -or you stated 55% of the industry claims are falling under the MIG. But your number is
actually higher. So what are you doing diﬀerently than the industry to get I guess cost -- I
guess contain costs under the MIG?

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

I'd say the reform expectation was 55%. We don't know for sure what the industry number
is and we know our number and we are still experiencing above 55%. Hard to say what we
are doing diﬀerently than the industry.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Like I don't know what the others are actually doing. But I know that what we are doing
translates in a meaningful loss ratio advantage in the market. And I think there is clearly a
degree of proactivity on our side which is paying oﬀ. I mean the shorter a claim is open,
the better for the client, the better for us. And that's the mindset that we are in here at this
stage.
And when these reforms came out, we really embraced these things, not only with the
reform. But you will recall, Stephen, that two years back, we said we will match the impact
of the reforms with our own actions on top of the reforms. And I think it's our own actions
on top of the reform that are really paying oﬀ for us at this stage.

Q - Stephen Boland

{BIO 5546446 <GO>}

Okay. Second question, on your home insurance and the changes that you're being
proactive on, sub-limits, higher deductible, rewording of policies, again how much more - I presume all the industry is moving to contain costs here. Where would you say you are
in terms of are you being more aggressive than the industry?
And I guess my point is if you are being more aggressive than the industry, is there a
chance here that you end up losing more business as you're increasing rates a lot faster
than the competitors and you lose premium?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. Well we don't look at what happened in the past two or three years as freak
occurrences. And I don't think that many of the players are in that mindset. I think that the
sense I am getting is people are waiting to see what we are doing. Now our colors are
becoming increasingly clear because we are actually taking actions. But there's no doubt
in my mind.

I am in Alberta this morning with the team here. We are sitting here in Calgary, met lots of
brokers in the past couple of days. And it's very clear that we are ahead of everybody else
on these things.
And there is a risk that units will suﬀer. There's no doubt about that. I think the industry
will follow. I don't know when. And at this stage, it's tough to be a leader. But that's what
it's all about. We're doing what we think is right. And we will live with the consequences
there.
So there might be pressure on the unit front. But it's not something we are overly
concerned about.
I think what we are concerned about is making sure that, A, we have a product that is
sustainable, B, that clients understand and have incentives to make sure that the product
remains aﬀordable for them. And C, that the brokers and the employees are well
equipped to explain why changes are taking place and why it's important for these
changes to take place.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think the coming six to nine months will be very demanding on our troops. I think it is
creating additional work for brokers; there's no doubt about it. But you know, it's really
important for us to do this.
I think it's also important to understand, Stephen, that we are not spreading with a broad
brush, I forget what the expression is in English. But we are taking a segmented approach
here in the area -- in the areas where the risk is actually the highest. And so it's not as if
there was risk on all units I think. The segments where we are acting are segments where
we feel that it's not sustainable at this stage.
And so I think if you look at our big ﬁnancial objectives, which is ROE outperformance and
growth in operating income per share, we are very comfortable with the actions that we
are taking so that it will contribute to those two objectives.

Just a couple of quick questions. First, on telematics, do you see any potential that, to the
extent it becomes widespread, Intact's sort of informational advantages could deteriorate
somewhat? Is that something that is possible, or do you maintain those advantages?

I think that's why it's important to be out there quickly, ﬁrst point.

FINAL

Second point, I'll take you back to Ontario which in my view is the province where we
have the most constraints when it comes to pricing and segmentation. And we have one
trillion price points. And we have a team, an R&D team, that is not sitting on their hands at
the moment. They are working on the next two, three ideas to keep segmentation
advantage.
So you know I think we will see what the take-up is, Mario, on telematics to assess that
point. But I would think there's lots beside telematics that contributes to a segmentation
advantage. And our folks are not sitting on their hands.
The other thing is that, with telematics, there is what you do and what you price for. And
then there's the data you collect that you are actually not using. And for me, that adds a
lot of value from a segmentation point of view. And given our size, our ability to match
this data with claims experience and obtain credibility on that I think is much greater than
everybody else in the market. And so I think there is actually an opportunity there on the
segmentation front beyond and above what the program is doing today.

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

And I would say to the contrary of is there a potential that we would lose some of our
advantage, I think it's further advantage for us because our larger database are going to
allow us to slice and dice this new information faster than most and have credible
information to apply this in our segmentation techniques. So I am very upbeat when it
comes to that new way of doing business.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

But it's fair to say we won't have a good answer on this for probably several years.
Like whether it narrowed the gap or not?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. I think the take-up rate and the amount of data we'll be able to collect, we will get a
sense in the coming six months I think. Then based on that, we will assess where we can
take this. It's something we will talk about at the Investors Day as well, give you a bit more
color on that. But it is indeed fair to say that it will take a bit of time before we get full
clarity on that. But certainly an avenue that could provide a segmentation advantage over
time.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Going to personal auto for a moment, the claims ratio, the current-year claims ratio, it is
up now I think it's ﬁve consecutive quarters. There have been very good explanations in
the past. Is there any particular thing you would point to this quarter that would drive the
year-over-year increase in the current-year claims ratio in personal auto?

The current accident year claims ratio is up 1.9 points, basically year-over-year. And I'll let
Martin give his perspective on that.

FINAL

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

Most of that deterioration we are seeing is coming from the seasonal nature of the Jevco
portfolio, which was not present last year at that time in our numbers. And bringing it this
year in our numbers, motorcycle seasonality is during the summer. These are larger claims
that you see coming in. This comes also with an oﬀset with respect to the average
premium going up. But since the seasonality in Q3 of motorcycles is higher, this is what is
most of the explanation for the increased experience.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

I think the thing to keep in mind is we book the premium for that ratably throughout the
year. But we incur the bulk of the claims in the summer because people drive the
motorcycles less in the winter. So this is a new seasonality that's been added that we
didn't have before Jevco.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

And Jevco wasn't around 12 months ago. And that's why seasonality (multiple speakers).

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Exactly Right.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Okay. Then is there any connection, can we draw any inferences from this year-over-year
increase in the current-year claims ratio? And acknowledging that this was maybe perhaps
a special quarter, is there anything we can take from that in relation to the very strong
reserve development? Is there a connection there? For example, if we continue to see
year-over-year deterioration in the core claims ratio or the current-year claims ratio, does
it say anything about the future insofar as development is concerned? Or are these two
really independent in you thinking?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

The stronger reserve development you're seeing is largely driven by ﬁeld activity where
we actually settle claims. So you could argue that if the world didn't change and the ﬁeld
activity continued as is, as we observe it, you could argue that the current accident year
loss ratio might be overstated. I think we look at it. And we are seeing the ﬁeld activity is
great. But there's been a number of changes in Ontario in particular which lead us to
remain cautious. So I would not infer at this point, Mario, that the current accident year
loss ratio might be overstated because we are seeing in previous accident years favorable
or greater favorable development this year. I remain cautious on that front.

I'm not sure which direction to go, whether to call the current year overstated or just
expect that the reserve development will eventually fade, because it feels like one of
those two things is going to happen. It's sort of hard to say.

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

You know, one should not -- if you take a very long-term perspective, you should think
about favorable reserve development in line with sort of guidance we have given in the
past, 3 to 4 points. I think it's no surprise that reserve development has been more
favorable than the long run average in the past few years, because we have taken a
cautious stance.
So should one expect reserve development to move towards 3% to 4% over time? I think
so. Will it be the case in the coming 12 to 24 months? Not clear to me. If the reforms
remain eﬀective, we might see favorable development in that sort of order.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Okay. I'll try to be quick with Mark. The impairment on the callable preferred shares, you
called it one-time in nature. Can you just provide a little color on what's going on there?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. So we bought preferred shares a number of years ago at a premium. And when they
changed the capital rules for the banks, they are now more apt to be called earlier. So our
expectation is now many of these preferred shares that we bought at a premium may be
called in 2014.
So what happens on a market basis is the market values tend to move down toward the
call price. But the way IFRS works is you don't do the write-oﬀ until you pass a bright line
test. So when the market value gets below a certain point, it triggers an impairment. So
it's not a credit driven impairment. It's an impairment driven by the fact that we bought at
a premium. There have to be -- the price we paid for it was based upon being called. So
economically this is not an economic impairment. It's an accounting driven thing caused
by the fact that we bought at a premium. And we've passed the bright line which causes it
to be written oﬀ. The reason it's one-time in nature is we can model this out and we know
there's not going to be signiﬁcant more of these in the future.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

That was the nature of the question, why it was you felt it would only be one-time. I
suppose that was the answer.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

It's because when we bought them, this is the quarter when they pass that bright line.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Got it. And can you give us like how large that was?

Q - Asim Imran

{BIO 18416793 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. With respect to your plan for delivering a 10 point
improvement in the personal property combined ratio, is there any way you can guide us
to whether a majority of it will come from the low teens rate increase or would it be more
from the product improvements?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think there's three angles to think about in the coming 24 months. There's pricing,
there's product. And there's claims. I think that we frontloaded our actions in pricing
because that's the easiest ﬁrst step you can do. And the increase in pricing actions on top
of what was in place already could explain two-thirds of that. We think that the remaining
portion will come from product.
We think there's a fair bit of upside in claims as well. I think putting our ﬁnger on how
much claims is worth is not clear at this stage. And I'll let Mathieu maybe talk about some
of the things we're doing in claims on that front. But out of 10 points, I think there would
be a good two-thirds coming from rates within 24 months.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

On claims, we are focusing on the part of it that is going to come to improve our
execution at Cat time. We've increased our resources that (inaudible) internally so we
think that has -- is a place to improve the expense of managing the claims as a customer
service aspect to it, an improvement on that. And certainly a control on indemnity,
because we have IFC eyes on the scope of the claims. So this is certainly one aspect we
continue to have activity on the supply chain side of things. Like you said, it's diﬃcult to
measure exactly how it's going to bear in terms of exact percentage. But we are certainly
active on that front.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. And I would say that when I think about claims, the one where there's a fair bit of
upside in my mind is the control point you talked about where we are much tighter in the
appraisal process to make sure that we are not being taken advantage of in periods
where lots of claims need to be appraised. So we really boosted our troops and our

eﬀorts on that front, have done a what we call a leakage study after the hailstorm last year
and ﬁgured out that there was upside for us to increase our control. We had prepared to
roll out that plan in may. And we had an opportunity to execute on it with a vengeance to
a certain extent, given the summer we've had. But a fair bit of it left to be deployed in the
coming years. Hopefully, we won't have as many opportunities to use it. But we are
preparing for the worst.

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

On the claims front, we are introducing the notion of settling roof on the basis of the age
of that roof in Alberta. So that's hail-related, that measure. So that's going to take a chunk
out of those settlements.
And in addition to price, product. And claims, I think the one thing that's diﬃcult to
quantify but where our actions are focused is trying to make people in society change
behavior towards climate change. And this is something that needs to happen to put the
equilibrium in the system. And many of our actions are geared towards education and
prevention. But also even when the product is changing, we are giving people
opportunities to change behavior therein and improve the overall scheme.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So we've done a very good job giving you a very long answer to a small question. The
answer is two-thirds from rate for sure.
