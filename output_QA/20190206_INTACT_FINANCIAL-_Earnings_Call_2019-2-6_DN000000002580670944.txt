Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Last night, we
announced strong fourth quarter results with net operating income increasing 19% to
CAD1.93 per share driven by broad based improvements across the business. For the full
year, net operating income per share of CAD5.74 resulted in an operating ROE of 12.1%.
Our balance sheet remains very healthy with over CAD1.3 billion of capital margin despite
the recent market volatility. Top line growth was 4% in the quarter, fueled by strong
growth in commercial and specialty lines across North America, as well as improving
market conditions. Our combined ratio was strong at 91.7% with improvement both in
Canada and the US. The Canadian performance at 90.8% reﬂects signiﬁcant progress in
personal auto and continued excellent performance in personal property.
In the US, our team delivered a combined ratio of 96.7% despite close to 6 points of CAT
losses. After nine months, we increased our outperformance versus the industry ROE to
750 basis points well above our 500 points target. And while we are outperforming by a
wide margin, we're not satisﬁed. Our ongoing action plans and improving market
conditions should soon return us to a mid-teens operating ROE in line with our historical
track record. Let's now look at our results by line of business, starting with Canada. So in
personal auto as anticipated, premiums declined slightly as our rate increases remain
ahead of the market. However, industry rate increases are catching up and we expect
growth to return in the coming quarters.
Our combined ratio improved nearly four points to 97.3% in the quarter driven primarily
by our proﬁtability actions, which have helped to lower both claims frequency and
severity for the third quarter in a row. While we believe our run rate is in the mid 90s,
combined ratio as planned, we remain focused on creating sustainability in that
performance. There is strong momentum still on many fronts, including rates,
underwriting and claims action.
In personal property, premiums grew 2% in the quarter. So while rates are up, our
discipline in auto put some pressure on growth in property. Results in this segment
continued to be very strong with a 78.5% combined ratio in the fourth quarter and 88.3%
for the full year. Our actions over time have been very successful with an average full year
combined ratio below 90% for the past ﬁve years that is in good and in bad times. So,
market conditions in my view in personal property position us very well to maintain that
performance level.

FINAL

In commercial lines here in Canada, rate increases in ﬁrm market conditions and strong
momentum in specialty drove growth to 11% in the quarter. The combined ratio was
higher than expected for the full year 2018 due to elevated catastrophe and large losses.
The quality of the portfolio remains high and this business is positioned for low 90s
performance.
If we turn to the outlook for Canada, we're seeing across all lines ﬁrm market conditions
and we expect mid-single digit industry growth in the year ahead. In personal auto, the
marketplace continues to tighten with capacity constraint and ongoing growth in residual
markets. Industry rate increases accelerated in the fourth quarter, and so we think this
environment supports our proﬁtability plan and our competitive position is improving. As
we anticipated, we are now seeing clear sequential monthly improvement in growth in
this line. In personal property, the outlook remains favorable as our auto growth improves,
we expect property growth to accelerate. In commercial in Canada, our loss ratio out
performance after nine months was north of 10 points. We are surprised by the speed at
which this market is hardening and thrilled with our position to capitalize on this new
dynamic.
In our US commercial segment premiums grew 2% in the quarter on a constant currency
basis. Growth was 7% in segments that we're focusing on for expansion. The fourth
quarter combined ratio of 96.7% was heavily impacted by CATs. The full year performance
was solid at 94.8%. We are ﬁrmly on track to deliver a sustainable low-90s combined ratio
within 18 months to 24 months. Market conditions are evolving favorably with modest
upward pricing trends continuing in the US. We expect low-to-mid single-digit growth for
the US specialty industry over the next 12 months. While short-term performance matters,
long-term strategic positioning is key. And on that front, our people have made giant
steps in 2018. Beyond building one of the best specialty lines business in North America,
we made meaningful advances on our customer-driven transformation, leveraging both
digital as well as artiﬁcial intelligence.
We launched our new mobile self service app, which incorporates our latest telematics
oﬀer. We also continue to roll out our latest rating algorithms, which are grounded in
machine learning, and we see strong evidence that our investments in AI will drive growth
and margin expansion in the years ahead.
Our focus on people and employee engagement was again recognized in '18. For the
fourth year in a row we are named as one of Aon's Best Employer, Glassdoor listed us as
one of the 25 best places to work here in Canada. And we were again named as Top
Employer in Canada for Young People. This reﬂects our commitment to providing an
environment that our people are proud of and where they can make a diﬀerence. This
goes straight to our ability to attract the best people in the markets where we operate. I
think we have a world-class team and I'd like to thank our people across North America
for their dedication to our customers, brokers, as well as our communities.
And talking about long-term positioning, we'll be celebrating in the coming weeks, the
10th anniversary of Intact Financial Corporation. As I look back, I think we've had a decade
of solid performance on many fronts, but in particular against our ﬁnancial objectives.
Since 2009, we've delivered over 630 basis points of ROE outperformance, beating our
Page 3 of 26

FINAL

500 basis points target. We've generated annual net operating income per share growth
in excess of our 10% target over the same period and an operating ROE that averaged in
the mid-teens. These results and these objectives have translated into an annualized total
return for shareholders of about 14% since the Intact Financial journey began, more than
double that of the TSX.
On the back of our solid earnings growth track record and our positive outlook for the
future, we're increasing our quarterly dividend by 9% to CAD0.76 per share. And by the
way, we increased our dividend every year since our IPO and have generated a CAGR of
9% in the last decade. In conclusion, disciplined execution on our action plans and
supportive market conditions provide us with momentum for the year ahead. After 10
years of delivering on our ﬁnancial objectives, I look forward with conﬁdence that our
people and strategies position us to continue to deliver into the future.
With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Marcotte.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Charles, and good morning, everyone. Net operating income was up 19% to
CAD281 million in the fourth quarter, fueled by signiﬁcant improvements in underwriting,
investment and distribution income. Our insurance businesses delivered a solid quarter
with underwriting income of CAD210 million, up 18% from Q4 last year.
In Canada, our combined ratio of 90.8% was the best performance in three years without
any material impact from weather. In the US, OneBeacon delivered a combined ratio of
96.7%, despite nearly 6 points of CAT losses, two of which related to Hurricane Michael.
Our investment team drove fourth quarter net investment income to CAD140 million, up
16% from Q4 last year, thanks to both our portfolio optimization initiatives and
reinvestment at higher yields that took place throughout 2018. We expect full year net
investment income in 2019 to grow by approximately 5%.
And ﬁnally, our distribution businesses contributed CAD36 million to operating income in
the quarter, that's almost 30% better than last year as commission growth and margin
improvements were better than anticipated. On an annual basis, our distribution earnings
have now reached CAD146 million, nearly twice what they were ﬁve years ago. We believe
more consolidation will take place in the distribution arena as evidenced by the four
acquisitions announced by BrokerLink already this year. However, we expect mid-single
digit growth in distribution income in 2019, mainly because of the slower M&A activity last
year.
Now let me provide some additional color on our underwriting results, beginning with
Canada. Progress on personal auto proﬁtability continued in the fourth quarter with 7
points improvement in the current accident year loss ratio. Q4 year-over-year weather was
favorable by 2 points, while the remaining 5 points of improvement is attributable to our
action plans. We estimate the combined ratio run rate in auto at approximately 95% by
adjusting for 1 point of favorable weather compared to long-term trends, removing prior
year development and normalizing for pools, CATs and seasonality. We are focused on

Page 4 of 26

FINAL

sustaining this performance level and our actions continue to carry positive momentum.
For example, written rates were up 9% and earned rates up 6% in the fourth quarter.
Rate momentum will continue in 2019 with mid single-digit earned rate increases secured
through year-end. Results in property continue to be excellent with 78.5% combined ratio
in the fourth quarter, despite higher than average weather losses. In commercial lines, the
Canadian top line growth in the quarter was robust at 11% and the combined ratio was
solid at 91.6%, despite being 4 points above last year due to a higher CAT and non-CAT
large losses. We are monitoring closely, but do not see any unusual trends.
Before moving to US commercial, I should note the slight increase in the Canadian
quarterly expense ratio due to higher variable commissions. On an annual basis, the
expense ratio in Canada remains stable as thoughtful expense management enabled us
to increase our investments in digital and artiﬁcial intelligence in order to accelerate our
customer driven transformation.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to US commercial, we incurred 6 points of CATs in the quarter bringing the
combined ratio to 96.7%. This CAT level is clearly well above expectations for a quarter.
And we view the full year level to be more indicative of future expectations, albeit at the
upper-end. Prior year development was slightly unfavorable, representing mainly our
share losses from 2016 and prior accident years that were ceded to the adverse
development cover. The US expense ratio improved 3.2 points to 33.7% and included a
few points of non-recurring favorable adjustments, including one point of premium taxes.
With expense synergies realized ahead of schedule, we expect the expense ratio in 2019
to be similar to the full year of 2018 expense ratio with some seasonal variations due to
business mix. We are now 15 months into the acquisition of OneBeacon and I am pleased
to see how much progress we've made. We delivered a full-year combined ratio in 2018
of 94.8% after executing on our plan, exiting unproﬁtable lines of business, and realizing
synergies in excess of CAD25 million. NOIPS accretion was roughly 6% in 2018 and the
IRR is north of 15%. But we have more to do and opportunities to capture. Our work on
proﬁtability by line of business continues as well as our claims initiatives leading to a low
90s combined ratio within 18 months to 24 months.
Before going to the balance sheet, I want to comment on our expectations for prior year
development going forward. In light of the recent increases in interest rates, we are
adjusting our favorable prior year development expectations by 100 basis points for IFC
as a whole such that the expected future range is now between 1% and 3%. This change
does not impact the overall combined ratio, as a reduction in prior year development
related to the change is oﬀset by improvement in the current accident year loss ratio.
Now a few words on our balance sheet. We ended the year in a strong capital position
with total capital margin of over CAD1.3 billion, Canadian MCT at 201% and US RBC at
377% and our debt to total capital was largely unchanged at 22%. The volatility of capital
markets in the fourth quarter impacted our book value per share by less than 3%, thanks
to our well diversiﬁed balance sheet, losses on our equity portfolios were partly oﬀset by
gains from interest rate increases and the strengthening of the US dollar. We are pleased

Page 5 of 26



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

Date: 2019-02-06

FINAL

with the resilience of our balance sheet in the face of adverse capital market conditions.
Since year-end, we have seen a signiﬁcant rebound in common equities and the
strengthening of the Canadian dollar. We estimate that the net impact to January 31st is a
gain of CAD0.43 approximately or almost 1% of book value per share.
Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We are deleveraging and remain on
track to reach our 20% goal in 2019. With a strong balance sheet and conﬁdence in our
outlook for growth and proﬁtability we are pleased to raise our quarterly dividend by 9%
to CAD0.76 per share, representing an average NOIPS payout ratio of 40% since the IPO,
which leaves room to deploy capital on growth opportunities. In closing, our action plans
will continue on auto and OneBeacon. We're building on our momentum from last year to
take advantage of growth potential we see across our underwriting investment and
distribution platforms.
With that, I'll return the call back to Ken.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Geoﬀ Kwan of RBC
Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Hi there, good morning. Just had a question with the comments from the Ontario
government looking at auto insurance pricing. It seems like the communications have
generally focused on the price aspect of that. I was just wondering from discussions you
have your understanding of how much they recognize the needs to be eﬀorts done on the
cost side given where combined ratios are in the industry.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Darren, why don't you take this one.

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks, Geoﬀ. I mean I think that discussions that we've had to date, both at the
political level, but also at the staﬀ level have been very encouraging. They are very open
to learning, understanding the issues that the industry is facing, but also the impact that
has on Ontario drivers. So they have a clear willingness to reduce fraud, to reduce red

FINAL

tape and doing what's right for Ontario drivers. They recognize the cost pressures within
the system and looking for a balanced view as far as Ontario drivers.
I think what is also maybe encouraging in those discussions is it's supported by FSRA
which is the new regulator coming in Ontario to replace FSCO. They have recently
published their priorities for 2019-2020 and it's very much in sync around streamlining
right regulation, supporting auto reform strategy, developing fraud reduction strategies.
So, both from a government level and also from a regulator level, we ﬁrmly believe
they're focused on the right areas and we're encouraged by that. So we're very optimistic
in terms of the process.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yeah, I think these guys are trying to get nonsense out of the system and they're focused
on the right thing.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. And just the other question I had was, you talked about the OneBeacon
and the integration seems to be going quite well. From an M&A standpoint in a sense that
Canada's -- when something comes up you guys probably have interest, but wanted to
get a sense as to how you feel about doing something in the US if there is a preference
towards manufacturing over distribution or how you're thinking about that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Overall when we look at priorities for capital deployment today, number one is Canada
and we are equally happy to deploy capital in manufacturing or in distribution in Canada,
and I think that this is actually a good time with the out performance at the level it is and
the industries performance being low, we feel like this is the right environment to deploy
capital and hence priority number one. When it comes to the US, I think we're gaining
conﬁdence in our ability to generate sustainable low 90's performance. We're not there
yet. There is 18 months to 24 months, but we've gained enough conﬁdence to be
opportunistic in that marketplace and strengthen the platform we have.
We have lots to learn. We're doing lot of work to understand the opportunities in
distribution indeed in the US and we'll be open to deploy capital, but in our mind the
priority is very clear. Our teams here and in the US are keeping an eye on the
opportunities in the marketplace, but there is a priority today.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

Okay, thank you.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you and good morning. So on the auto margin, you reached your target mid-90's
and you said you're going to focus on sustaining that total margin. Are you declaring like
mission accomplished. I just wonder because the more you can do that to improve this
further, for example, your region [ph] price up 9%, still above the earned price 6%, so is
there more interim improvements below that 95% even if you don't do anything else?

A - Charles Brindamour

Yes. So, Kai, I think we've found out over the past few years that declaring mission
accomplished is a tricky thing to do. So we're certainly not there. I think that we think
we're in the zone indeed of the mid 90s kind of performance. We'll take advantage of
market conditions as they are ﬁrming up. And look, there is inﬂation in the system, Kai,
this is a longer-term type or longer-tail type product. And so, we remain and keep a
degree of caution in terms of making statement, but we're in the zone and we'll take
advantage of the markets in which we're moving into, which will be quite favorable we
think for the next 24 months. Darren, anything to add?

A - Darren Godfrey

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

No, I think the other thing that I would add there, just in terms of the, not just from a
margin standpoint, but the market deﬁnitely is moving now. So that's helping as far as our
own action plan is concerned. We're seeing some momentum in Q4 in some provinces so
that's encouraging. Industry obviously, given the fact that we've been at this for a good 18
months, 24 months, still has a couple of years ahead of it in our view from an adequacy
achievement standpoint. So, we're well placed, but our focus remains on sustainability. As
Charles alluded to before, we do see a pivot in our growth proﬁle, so that's encouraging
as well too. So, focus remains on sustainability, but expectations around the pivot on the
growth side as well in 2019.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, I think Kai, if we can do better and grow, we will, trust us on that. But at this stage,
we want to make sure that the inﬂation is indeed broken and that we can see that sort of
mid-90s performance on a sustainable basis.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's great. Just follow-up on top line growth and how do you pricing now comparing
with the market pricing? I just wonder how big the delta is there. At what point do you
think there will be a tipping point that the environment will be more favorable to you and
you could a start to regain market share. Do you see that in the next like by the year end
or you think is probably more in 2020?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Kai, you're talking about personal auto, just to be clear?

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Page 8 of 26



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2019-02-06

Yes.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, we'll let Darren give his perspective on that.

FINAL

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

I think in terms of gap relative to the industry as I mentioned, quite a bit of activity in Q4 in
Ontario in particular. Now one of those rate approvals are eﬀective Q1, Q2 so we haven't
seen yet the impact in terms of our competitive position on those rate approvals. If I look
at over the last sort of 36 months, we still have a good one rate increase ahead of the
industry. We've got a six point gap. When I look at Alberta in particular, we've got 11 point
gap between industries. So there still is gap there relative to the competition. However, as
I said, that is beginning to close in particular in Ontario.
So when I look at growth, as you can see in the premium side, we were down two points
for the full year of '18, roughly down a point in Q4. And actually if I look at the month of
December, we were ﬂat. So, we are starting to see a little bit of that pivot, now that is
premium growth. So we're continuing to be remained focused on that. As far as the
growth proﬁle, I would say, it's earlier than year-end. I would say towards the latter part of
2019. We would hope to see us changing that curve from a unit standpoint in the latter
half of '19.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, I think Darren's comment is bang on. In the past three, four months, we have seen a
clear change, not in all markets, but a number of markets where either growth has picked
up, I take Quebec, for instance, which is in the mid-single digit growth range now. We've
seen provinces that have been shrinking. We've seen deceleration in the negative growth,
and I think that as Darren is saying in the second half of '19 we should be in the quite a
diﬀerent place than we were in Q4.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's perfect. Thank you so much and good luck.

Your next question comes from the line of Meny Grauman of Cormark Securities. Please
go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Meny Grauman

{BIO 15238080 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Question on distribution and some bullish comments on distribution
and you noted the recent deals. Just wondering if you could update us on valuations for
Page 9 of 26



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

brokers, what are they transacting and how have multiples changed, are they are still
climbing higher over time?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

You know, there is a lot of talk and anecdotes about multiples in distribution, and we are
doing tens of deals every year. And we have not really in the past 24 months seen inﬂation
in the multiple of smaller transactions, quite frankly. And so, my own view despite some
anecdotes here and there is that, our opportunities to acquire distribution and still
generate mid teens IRR and plus on these transactions is very good because valuations
have not changed dramatically in the past 12 months, 24 months. What has changed in
the past 12 months, 24 months is our margin in distribution, which we've seen go up the
sort of core distribution margin has gone up for proﬁt sharing, which means that the
opportunity for synergies in consolidation in my mind is up.

Q - Meny Grauman

{BIO 15238080 <GO>}

Thanks for that. And just maybe a follow-up from the competitive standpoint, if you could
talk about how much competition there is when you head into these negotiations. It
would seem from evaluation comments maybe there is not that much competition for
these brokers.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think there is competition for these brokers for sure. And I think it varies across the land,
it varies on the business they're in, it varies based on the margins that they're operating
at. Many of these transactions are often relationship driven though. And we're not big on
auctions and processes in general, you know that. And it's certainly true in distribution.
Now the fact that we have an unmatched local presence across the land with Intact
Insurance, the fact that we have with BrokerLink a very deep regional footprint in over 100
communities, and the fact that we're there in good times and in bad times and it's many
of the same people that have been around for the past decade or two, our relationships
for opportunities in my mind is very, very strong and these are the best conditions in
which to transact and that's what we'll keep doing in the next decade.

Good morning.

FINAL

Q - Brenna Phelan

{BIO 20108118 <GO>}

So, I wanted to ask one more on personal auto and related to rates and unit growth. So, is
your view that the industry ultimately has to take more rate than you have or will generally
have to given the other levers your scale aﬀords you to pull.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

That's a good question because we might be shooting for higher performance right, and
so, it's hard to ﬁgure out exactly what the industry needs, but when we look at it high
level, Brenna, it's about 10-ish points we think. Darren?

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, no, I think if you look at year-to-date nine months industry is running coast-to-coast
at around about 75 loss ratio, around 30 points of expenses so we get to roughly 105.
Now obviously we know that there was inﬂation in the system, they've been ﬁghting it for
18, 24 months. We continue to ﬁght it. We've been successful at abating on inﬂation, but
we recognize that it's still there. So, I think when you look at inﬂation in the system, you
look at industries running at 105, now I should point out, that is supported by some strong
favorable prior year development in the industry as well.
So that's sort of how we come up with the rough 10 points, but given the inﬂation
environment, that's going to take a couple of years in our opinion. We have been going at
it for close to two years. We started probably two years ahead of the industry. So it's fair to
assume that the industry is at least two years. Now that timeline could look very diﬀerent
province-to-province, but genuinely on (technical diﬃculty) Canada, I would suggest that
our view today is that we're at a two-year window of the industry still got a fair bit of work
ahead of it.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good.

Q - Brenna Phelan

{BIO 20108118 <GO>}

Okay. So I guess what I'm trying to get at, is it conceivable in your outlook that once your
unit growth kind of bottoms out pivots back to growth that it could accelerate quite
meaningfully because the industry is also moving very quickly.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

It could. Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't make it the central forecast quite frankly, but it very well
could. I think it's one thing to look at auto, you got to look at the whole industry dynamic.
And I think the industry's performance has been sub-mid single digit and we're seeing
now across all markets. And I think there will be meaningful potential for unit growth, but
the speed at which you can turn the dial on in automobile insurance is not the same as in

the other lines of business, we need to keep that in mind. And we've seen a shift in
commercial lines that's pretty abrupt I would say in the past six months, in auto, that is not
the case. So, hard to tell, but what is clear is, we think, it will be a favorable environment
for us in the next 24 months. We're seeing sequential growth picking up and I think we'll
be in growth territory very high likelihood in the second half of '19.

Q - Brenna Phelan

{BIO 20108118 <GO>}

Great. Very helpful. And then just quickly, could you give a breakdown of the premium
growth in Canadian commercial, how much of that is coming from your specialty

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, Alain.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Well, if I look to give you a bit of color on the growth, when we look at the growth
of 12% in the fourth quarter, I would split that 50-50 between regular commercial and
specialty lines. What I mean by that is, if you look at the dollar growth of direct written
premium between 2017 and '18, 50% of the dollar growth is coming from regular line and
50% from specialty lines.
If I go a bit deeper on the regular line, that's all driven by rates. Rates were up by 4% in
P&C in the fourth quarter, 6.7% in regular auto in the quarter. So when you add to that a
bit of inﬂation of insured value and car basically that explains the full growth in regular
commercial lines. There is really no unit growth overall and the segmentation of that
growth when you look at it, we're growing proﬁtable segment and we're shrinking least
proﬁtable segments. So really well segmented.
The specialty line growth, which is the other 50%, considering the size of the portfolio
translate in a growth just north of 20% for our specialty line portfolio in Q4. And I would
say that growth is really driven by our action plan. Basically we have a bed of rates and
property, lots more rate in trucking. But overall, if I go back two years ago, we established
our specialty lines division with the idea of growing and becoming specialty line -- key
specialty line player in Canada. And basically the idea was to expand our product suite,
make it available across the provinces, makes our expertise available across Canada and
become really considered by a broker increasing the awareness.
A year later we acquired OneBeacon, that increased our credibility with the broker. We've
brought new product from OneBeacon through technology and entertainment. And over
that period of time, we've probably increased our staﬀ by close to 80 people in Canada,
and those staﬀ are daily working on improving our product, building relationship with
brokers and everything. And I would say, lot of the growth we see in specialty line is
coming from those people, so I want to thank them for their daily hard work. This is really
achieving our strategy. So overall, the growth is basically coming exactly where we want it
to come.

And you think those, those trends can continue into 2019?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I would say yes, because when you look at the industry, why the market is ﬁrm when we
look at the industry, we mentioned our outperformance of about 11 point in P&C and 6
points in commercial auto at the end of Q3. So when you throw that on the top of our
combined ratio, that puts the industry north of 100% for both line and in fact combined
you're probably close to 110% which is unsustainable. So that will continue and our eﬀort
on specialty line will continue.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

So, I wanted to go back to OneBeacon and the prior year reserve developments were
negative, just wanted to get a sense of, in what areas were they negative? And as well, just
wanted to get a sense of the coverage -- because I know this -- what you're showing is
only your proportional stake of the prior reserve developments. So I think you had $200
million was the max coverage for those adverse developments. Just wanted to know how
much of that has been used. And then I have a follow up.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So on the amount of coverage used, Doug, there is plenty of room left is what I will say
not a concern of mine. In terms of where the adverse development has been coming
from, I'll let Alain give his perspective.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Okay. Well, when you look at the PYD for OneBeacon you have to understand that this
can be very lumpy because of the nature of the business. We're looking at large losses in
prior years, sometimes they take time to develop. So it's relatively lumpy and you can see
that, during the quarter, it was plus 1.5, but it's favorable 0.3 for the year. Overall, when we
look at where it comes in this quarter, it came from a few losses and 80% of that PYD is
coming from line of business which are under a proﬁt improvement plan, okay. And
basically a lot of those are in area on those proﬁt improvement plan where we are no
longer writing that type of business within those business units.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And a big chunk of it, Alain, is not just for proﬁtability improvement plan, it's also the two
lines we've shut down upon closing, which represent probably more than that of the PYD
there, which gives us a very good sense that closing those lines were the right calls.

FINAL

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

I guess just on that, Charles. I thought would the PY, or the prior year reserve
developments for the exited business lines not go through your non-operating results or
does that -- so the exited lines would go through the prior years' reserve developments
you show in the existing business or?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, just to clarify that, you're absolutely right. So the prior year development on exited
lines is aﬀected to non-operating, but it does consume some of the adverse development
cover. So, Alain was raising in the lines that are ongoing, where those have been used for
the continuing lines. But you're right, a portion of them have been used for the exited
lines.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

And that's the two lines that you shut down I guess over...

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, that's right.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Yeah, okay. So you're not going to give me a dollar ﬁgure, but you're not like in terms of
what's left in the coverage. I guess I can try to do the math, but you seem pretty conﬁdent,
Charles, that this isn't going to be an issue?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, there's plenty of room left in that cover.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

And I'm right, it's $200 million. That's correct?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

And then, Charles just, you mentioned some that peak my interest, just on the US -because in Canada, you've been acquiring distribution and I get why and what the
strategy is there, and then if I heard you correctly you're thinking potentially of doing
Page 14 of 26



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2019-02-06

acquisitions in the US distribution, but you're just trying to understand the marketplaces.
Did I get that right?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, I think that when you look at our footprint in the US, we have 14 business lines
spread across the land. And there is a number of ways you can grow our presence. You
can grow it organically that is add products. You can add geographies to those segments
and you can add brokerage relationships to those segments. And that's the sort of work
we're doing at the organic level in the US operation. Then when it comes to scaling it up
through non-organic measures, I mean, you can look at companies or you can look at
distribution. And in distribution in the US, I mean, if you slice it, it is a diﬀerent ecosystem
in specialty lines than it is in the context of Canada.

Bloomberg Transcript

You have what they call independent agents, you have MGAs, who are specialized in
certain segments, you have MGUs, who are involved to an even greater degree. Some of
these players sometimes retain a portion of the underwriting risk, you have wholesalers,
and the opportunities to expand our footprint, fortify our position and build scale in those
14 products or 14 lines of business in my mind could very well go through distribution
tuck-in acquisitions, which is diﬀerent than our distribution strategy in Canada, which
consists in building a massive, largely personal lines distribution operation. So it's two
diﬀerent strategies, but we do have distribution expertise as you can see from the
numbers and from how long we've been active in it.
And therefore, when we look at the US marketplace, this is not in our mind for specialty
lines just a manufacturing play. There might be distribution opportunities and we're open
to those and studying where they are and being proactive at this stage. So I don't know if
it helps, Doug.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

No, that helps with each of them. I'm just wondering what makes you -- what gets you to
the point where you're comfortable that's I guess where I'm just curious like?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Gets me to the point where I'm comfortable meaning?

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

In terms of transacting and purchasing distribution, because it sounded like you're not
there yet, but you're almost there?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, I think we look at opportunities. These are much smaller capital deployment steps
as well and as I'm saying, we're gaining conﬁdence, we're not yet at the low-90s
performance level in the US. We're therefore not at the level of big capital deployments in
the US. Hence our priority for capital deployment is Canada, but we're certainly starting to

Page 15 of 26

Your next question comes from the line of Tom MacKinnon of BMO Capital. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks very much. Good morning. It's question really with respect to your outlook in
the US and in Canada. In the US in commercial lines, you mentioned pricing remained
stable, and this is from a combination of what you viewed as a current favorable economic
environment in the United States. And I guess, so my ﬁrst question here is, what's so
favorable about the economic environment in United States especially in light of talk
about of a perhaps a coming recession. And then as a follow-on, when you compare the
two markets, you talk about US being stable, but Canada is ﬁrm. And am I reading then
that Canada is better than the US in terms of an insurance market right now. Why is that,
maybe you can compare and does Canada generally follow the US market?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So in aggregate, I'll let Alain talk about the US and I'd be cautious about drawing too
many direct relationships with the economy, but when you look at the US market, diﬀerent
parts of the markets are behaving very diﬀerently. If you look at commercial automobile,
for instance in the US, there is meaningful ﬁrming going up, going on. You know there are
segments of property as well. But overall the momentum we're seeing there is nowhere
near what we're seeing in the context of Canada.
I'll let Alain maybe say a thing or two about the US and then we'll get into Canada.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Okay. So thank you, Tom. So, if I give you -- if I give you a bit of perspective on the US
market, when we say stable, it's rate increase are stable and we're seeing modest rate
increase to the tone of 2%, okay. Basically if that we compare our OneBeacon
environment is operating at a slightly diﬀerent market, you know, than the overall market,
there is very less workers' compensation and our rate increase in the fourth quarter for
OneBeacon were 4.4%. So quite -- this situation is one point that makes us positive on the
US market.
The second point is the judicial system, okay, where there is a bit more conservatism that
has happening in our judicial system. There is a few court case as an example that have
increased the burden of proof if you want for people claiming excessive force from law

FINAL

enforcement body. And this is really positive in our government risk business unit. And
overall what we see is a judicial system that is slightly more favorable to business.
And the third one was more economic, you were talking about the downturn, but
basically, when we look at the outlook, we're talking about slightly less GDP growth, but
still within 2% to 3% growth inﬂation below 2%, unemployment rate still going
downwards, and again from business point of view, this is a favorable environment. So
from an organization like OneBeacon that focus on mid-to-small specialty line of business,
the overall judicial system rate environment and economic environment puts us in a nice
position right now.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. So, Canada is far more cost driven at the moment. You've seen inﬂation in auto, the
industry needs to react, you've seen changes in weather patterns, the industry needs to
react, then in commercial lines as Alain was saying, the industry is operating above 100%.
That is a combination of it being soft in the past decade and a bit of inﬂation, including
changes in weather patterns. So what you're seeing because all these lines at the industry
level are not performing very well, the reaction is stronger than what we're seeing in the
US. So Tom, hopefully this is helpful.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

I mean, just as a follow on though, the weather patterns has been an issue both north and
south of the border. Are we just slower to react to them here and presumably inﬂation
driven in terms of auto repairs is, I assume, is a problem both north and south of the
border, are we just slower to react here?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I'm not sure I would draw that conclusion. I think that the industry's performance in
Canada over time as compared with the industry's performance in the US over time, if
anything it's been about a point above. So it's, I wouldn't draw that conclusion Tom. I'd
say, the inﬂation in auto was not just physical damage as you know. And I think it's a
convergence of these factors, which is leading Canada to be ﬁrmer at the moment.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks for the color.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, thanks. A couple of quick questions for you. First, I'm sort of just curious, down in the
US commercial auto continues to be a challenging line, a couple of companies about to
take charges for it. It sounds like it's performing pretty well now in Canada. Is there a
diﬀerence that we should think of as to why it's still performing well over there, is this
something you guys are keeping your eyes on?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well commercial auto in the context of Canada has had pockets of pressure, trucking
being a good example. Half of commercial auto is unregulated in the context of Canada.
So your ability to put in place corrective measures quickly is greater. And I would say this
makes a diﬀerence. Alain, do you want to add anything?

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Yes. And I would say, it's quicker in Canada because a lot of it is unregulated. It's bit
slower in the US, because it's a bit more regulated. And when it comes to commercial
auto, this is a very regulated product. So coverage, accident beneﬁt, liability can vary a lot
by states, can vary a lot by province. So I would be cautious in comparing the state of the
commercial auto in the US and the commercial auto in Canada.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

One of the things we've also talked about is an increase in legal representation on claims.
I'm wondering if that's maybe a diﬀerence between Canada and US?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Not clear to us.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Not there, okay. Another question. I'm just curious, Charles, if I look back on the last kind
of major acquisition you guys did JEVCO, came kind of on the heels of a period where the
industry was having some challenging proﬁtability as well. I'm wondering, one do you
think that we could potentially see some larger transactions here in the next year or two as
the industry continue to struggle from a proﬁt perspective. And then what is your kind of
capacity for an acquisition ex issuing equity at this point?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So I think Brian, I'd go back 20 years here, since I've been involved in the transactions
we've done as a team and the best ones came on the heels of tough low single digit ROE
environment. I can think of the Zurich acquisition, which we've done in '01, '02, the Allianz
acquisition, which we've done in '04, '05. So my view is, this sort of environment is a good
one for consolidation and for assets change hands. I think people changed your view on
their property in those kind of markets and I think that's good for us, especially given our
outperformance, So I'm positive about the environment that we're entering into on that
front.

With regards to capacity to issue before or to ﬁnance before issuing equity, Louis, do you
want to take a perspective on that?

A - Louis Marcotte

Your next question comes from the line of Mario Mendonca of TD Securities. Please go
ahead, your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Good morning. Just a quick question on investment income. So obviously a good job of
increasing the market based yield. Just looking at your MD&A and I see that that's up, the
market based yields up 47 basis points year-over-year. This is Q4 versus Q4 '17. Where I'm
going with this is, could you help us think through that 47 basis point increase, how much
of that would have been just extending duration, how much going out on the risk curve. Is
there any way you can break that out with some precision?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Sure. So I'm careful with using the market based yield because it's also aﬀected by the
denominator, which has varied a bit. But if I look at year-over-year, Mario, where we were
last year, this year it's 97 million of additional income. We allocate about a third of that to
simply the addition of OneBeacon's assets to our portfolio. Then the third to higher yields
and so about 30 million related to higher interest rates. Then we have higher dividend
yields for about 16 million.
The exchange rate has had a positive impact for about six and then tweaking the
OneBeacon portfolio and part of this is interest rates and part of it is the asset mix, but
tweaking their assets, the portfolio towards our asset mix. So we took it over last year and
the investment team took it on January 1st and then they migrated to our asset mix. And
that has contributed to the gap. So I would say, it's not very much a risk play here, very
much just adopting our own asset mix and leveraging the fact that rates were rising this
year. And because we had to move assets between geographies for example, that gave
us an opportunity to trade and capture higher yields on the way. So, favorable market
conditions as the rates were going up and the fact that we transition.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah, and I think to your point, Mario, when we've done the optimization exercise, the risk
envelope itself didn't change. And the optimization exercise is one where all of a sudden
you have two capital regime, two tax regime and you want to make sure that you take that
into account in establishing the asset mix of your sub in the US and your sub in Canada.
And that in itself without playing with the risk envelop has been as Louis saying, an
important contributor to the performance you've seen.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Okay, so, this sort of leads into the follow-up question then. If you're not taking additional
risk and you're essentially just optimizing for the higher yield, I would have expected a
little bit more pressure than in terms of realized losses in the bond portfolio, for example,
because when you are buying higher yielding assets, you're also selling something else
and presumably there'll be a lost there because rates have moved higher. So why is it that
we don't see that on Page 21 of the MD&A?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So I think you would have seen it perhaps earlier in the year when we traded and it was
sort of oﬀset with gains on the equity portfolio. But that happened earlier in the earlier
part of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Okay. So when I look at Page 21 again and I look at 2018, there is about CAD26 million of
losses there in the bond portfolio, is that essentially -- that would be what you would point
me to in terms of losses associated with the optimization and other factors I guess.

We're I don't think seeing it, because we've had you know three quarters of sequential
drop in frequency. So it's hard to break it into what might have been an upward pressure
point. I don't know Patrick or Darren, if you have a perspective on that?

FINAL

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

No, Charles, I agree with you on that in the sense that, from the ﬁle by ﬁle claims handling,
we haven't seen cases where there is clear evidence of that, but it's tough to get that
information, as you see frequency has been going down overall for the year with no
increase in frequency also in three quarters where it was going down. So maybe it's -there is a bit of inﬂuence in there, but was fairly small given the overall frequencies going
down and we have no clear signs.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And I think we -- and we were on high alert in November following the change, I think to
identify signs of that. And there's no clear evidence at this stage. Darren, anything to add?

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

No, the only thing, it's still very early in terms of the process. I think what I'm encouraged
about is the awareness campaigns that have been running from all levels of government
as far as the dangers of driving and cannabis consumption. So I think that's encouraging
from an education standpoint as well too. But it's still pretty early.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, that's very helpful. Very thorough. Second question, I guess, with regard to Louis
guidance on distribution, does that assume that as competitors catch up on rate
increases, again, predominantly personal auto, that there'll be more contingent
commission income or is that upside to the guidance?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

I would say upside at this point. I think right now we're guiding mid single-digit for next
year based on the current portfolio. But I would say if there was better outcome on the
underwriting side, it would be upside.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, for the distribution income per se it's certainly and I think just from the market
dynamic point of view, what is interesting from a distribution point of view, is that, when
you get into a harder market like the one we're in, the issue for brokers, this is tough for
them, because it's not just rates and the reality is that there are capacity issues, where
brokers ability to ﬁnd an insurance company for all their customers is actually constraint.
And from our perspective, this is also a pretty good environment for further consolidation
in distribution and that in my mind is where the true upside lies.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Yeah, perfect. Thank you so much.

Thank you. So question on personal auto given you've hit your margin target now, you
have a hard market across the industry. Do you have enough comfort around where cost
inﬂation is that, you can start turning up the dial on market share or do you continue to
focus at this point on solidifying that proﬁt margin?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So, as I said, we're in the zone. When you look at frequency and severity trends, it looked
good in the past few quarters. We want to make sure though that there is sustainability
there. There is a lot of momentum in terms of action and, Paul, my hope here is that, we
don't need to turn the dial, the markets make it happen naturally for us. Meaning we keep
doing what we're doing and our relative position improves and growth picks up as a
result.
We're not in the zone of saying, should we trade a point of ROE for a point of growth,
that's not how we're thinking. Not in that zone. This business is not generating upper
teens ROE certainly. And that's the zone where you start to ask yourself the question, am I
better oﬀ, staying closer to mid teen for an additional point of growth. You know, how it
kind of make value works. Past that point, it makes sense to have that discussion. I don't
feel that's the space we're in yet in automobile.
I do feel that the market dynamic itself will bring growth to the Intact personal automobile
platform without us having to make any sacriﬁces to get that growth. And that's the sort of
environment where we have done extremely well in the past.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Got it. That's helpful. And then second question is related to US commercial lines. So
you've given an indication of what you expect for industry growth of low to mid single
digits, assuming you're targeting something higher than that, maybe you can give a little
bit more color and context around sort of the range or idea of what type of growth you
are targeting?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

I think we're -- at this point what I would say globally, we're basically focused still on
making sure we achieve our low 90 objective. That is the number one priority of the team,
but we're seeing opportunity in some of the business unit, especially a few one, 75% of
them are doing very, very well. So, I would say right now probably a bit better than the
industry. So that would be, let's say, mid to upper single-digit.

Your next question comes from the line of Jaeme Gloyn of National Bank Financial. Please
go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Yeah, hi. Quick question on the personal auto side, with the return to the 95% combined
ratio level and more normalized proﬁtability levels, let's say, is there any risk that expenses
tick back up to where they were historically as well sort of in that 25% range as a
percentage of earned premiums or is there enough -- or have enough initiatives been put
in place to keep this down in the 22%, 23% range, so that it operated at last two years.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Louis, do you want to give your perspective on that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yeah. So I would say, I think it's a bit deﬂated here in auto because due to proﬁtability
challenges, the variable items were a bit more limited. So I would expect a part of it to
come back to past years, probably lose a point, just slightly north of a point of expense
when proﬁtability comes back. So it's going to be good news because we'll have better
proﬁtability and there is going to be some of that -- some of that will be shared, but it
won't stay at the level it's staying at. If you look in the aggregate expenses, which is really
what we manage, that's been -- there is a -- there was a structural decline and I would say,
half a point, a bit more than half a point of expenses have been completely shaved. But
there is another part that's variable and we'll come back when the proﬁtabilities returns to
where we want to be.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

But that's baked in our view that this business is performing in the mid 90s and should
continue to do so in the coming year. So I think that's the sort of tactical view on
expenses. I think strategically, our business units are focused though on reducing their
cost operating base in particular our direct operation has seen its expense ratio drop by
close to four points over the past ﬁve years. And we'll be shooting for something in that
zone over the next ﬁve years. So...

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Okay. No, that's good. And last one, just quickly, obviously a little bit of a storm activity
and cold weather in January, do you have any comments related to the impacts of
weather in January to start the ﬁrst quarter of '19.

I think that's the business we're in, just to be clear, but I think seasonality obviously is
relevant. I'll ask Patrick, who mans the phone with this team to share his perspective.

FINAL

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yes, winter is always a or mostly a busy time for claims. We expect that, operations are
preparing for it. Q1 2018, as you might recall was a proof point of that and if you look at
the average of the last three years or ﬁve years, all lines combine -- the combine ratio in
Q1 is about four points higher than the yearly average. So this is somewhat expected, I
would say January so far is in line with...

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

This winter.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

This winter. But it's only a small portion of the quarter.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And to be clear, Patrick, the four points you're talking about ballpark is for all lines, but -and in automobile.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

It's similar at four points as well.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Exactly.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

Yeah, just a follow-up with respect to the growth in commercial auto year-over-year DPW
up 18%. I'm wondering if you can share with us what's happened with respect to some of
the products you've been able to oﬀer in terms of sharing economy. And in particular, I
think you have some contract with Uber, so has that helped with respect to that growth
that we're seeing?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, so I'm not going to get into speciﬁc deals that we have, Tom, but I would say, when I
think about commercial automobile, there's sort of three buckets, one is rates per se,
there was a lot of rate momentum in commercial automobile and the business seems to
be sticking. Trucking in particular, a ton of rates in trucking and that market is very, very
ﬁrm, if not very hard. And then the specialty lines operation also, the (inaudible) Alain was
talking about earlier is ﬁltering into commercial auto and clearly our sharing economy
practice in very healthy in the context of Canada, very healthy in the US as well. So we're
building a, in my mind, a beautiful franchise on the sharing front. And it goes beyond one
speciﬁc contract.
Alain, I don't know, if there's anything you want to add?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Well I think we've mentioned that a couple of times over the last few calls, but our sharing
economy approach is to basically base premium on usage. The more kilometers driven,
the more rental there is, the more usage there is of the sharing economy, the more
premium you collect. So clearly there has been a healthy and popularity increase in the
sharing economy context and that is fueling our growth in commercial auto growth.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}
