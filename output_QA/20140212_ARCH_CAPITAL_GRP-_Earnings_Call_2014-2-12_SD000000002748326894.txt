Thinks, Dominique. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today.

Bloomberg Transcript

We had excellent Fourth Quarter which capped off a very good year. And also we were
very pleased that two weeks ago we finally closed on the CMG and PMI transactions. I will
comment further on these acquisitions shortly but first let me share a few observations on
our Fourth Quarter.
Earnings were solid and were driven by excellent reported underwriting results. On a
consolidated basis our premium revenue grew by approximately 17% on a gross written
basis and 22% on a net written basis although there were a few noteworthy items that I
will get to in a few minutes.
On an operating basis we earned $1.12 per share for the quarter, which produced an
annualized return of equity of 11.7% for the Fourth Quarter. For the entire year operating
income was $4.39 per share which also represented an 11.7% return on equity. On a net
income basis Arch earned $5.07 per share which corresponds to a 13.5% return on equity
which is excellent in a year where investment returns on our fixed-income assets were
challenged.
A reported underwriting results in the Fourth Quarter were excellent as reflected by a
combined ratio of 85.3% and were aided by better-than-expected performance on
catastrophe business, favorable loss reserve development and improved accident year
performance in our insurance group operations primarily due to rate increases that we
have seen over the last eight quarters and we are earning now. The underwriter returns
for the entire year were also excellent at 85.9% combined ratio.
Net investment income per share on a sequential basis was flat for the quarter at $0.49
per share. Our operating cash flow for this quarter was $224 million, a $34 million increase
from the same period a year ago.

FINAL

The total return of the investment portfolio was 97 basis points for the quarter and 128
basis points for the full-year 2013 inclusive of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our
book value per common share at December 31, 2013, rose to 39.82% increasing by
3.9%sequentially and 10% relative to December 31, 2013.
In the primary markets which our insurance operations participate we continue to obtain
rate increases above loss trend although I have to say in the Fourth Quarter they
moderated somewhat relative to the Third Quarter. In our US insurance operations we
achieved rate increases in the quarter that provides 80 basis points of expected margin
improvement which was approximately half of what we experienced in 2013 Third Quarter.
Our US insurance operations represent approximately 80% of our premium volume in that
sector. We continue to see our best opportunities in some sectors of the E&S market in
our binding authority and program business which are predominantly small accounts. In
these areas we have seen steady improvement in pricing and a steady gain in exposure
units which contributed to our solid growth in the Fourth Quarter in the insurance group.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the reinsurance side of the business we have seen a continuation of softening in
terms and conditions that we noted in prior quarters. First, the property cat area is under
pressure primarily due to the alternative capacity that has entered the market. For January
1 business we experienced approximately a 15% reduction in rates on a gross basis.
Also as we reported on last quarter's call cedents are aggressively requesting additional
ceding commissions on quota share contracts and reinsurance buyers continue to shift
business to excess of loss treaties in combination with requests for further rate
reductions. These conditions create an environment of increased risk to reinsurance for
potential negative arbitrage.
Cedents were both on insurance and reinsurance enterprise. Should we experience some
pain in our reinsurance segment we stand to benefit from the improvement in terms
offered on our insurance operations there were significant buyer of reinsurance.
From a production point of view net written premiums in the reinsurance segment grew
by 36%. The increase in the reinsurance segment stems primarily from two significant
treaties including a large unearned premium transfer along with premium growth in the
mortgage space which in this quarter is included in the reinsurance segment results.
The insurance segment grew premium by 11.5% on a gross written basis and 14% on a net
written basis. Growth in the US operations offset a strategic reduction in professional and
indemnity contracts in our international operations.
Most of the business we write in national accounts and the construction segment are on a
large deductible loss sensitive basis. They guaranty cost large account capacity market
continues to be unattractive to us.

Group wide on an expected basis we continue to believe the ROE on the business we
underwrote this year will produce an underwriting year ROE in the range of 11% to 13%
with a slight improvement in the insurance group results offset by a slight deterioration in
the reinsurance group due to lower cat rates. As I indicated in my opening remarks we are
very pleased that we have entered the US mortgage insurance market through the
purchase of CMG and PMI. As you may know, CMG has been in the business of providing
mortgage insurance on a continuous basis since 1994 with approximately $100 million of
annual premium volume catering exclusively to the credit union marketplace.
The access to this marketplace is done through CUNA Mutual employees who under a
seven-year service agreement with us will continue to distribute mortgage insurance
products to these clients on our behalf. Our objective is to expand our penetration in this
sector and we believe that this operation will benefit from the financial strength of Arch
which should further enhance our ability to better serve these clients.
As to the lenders channels previously serviced by the PMI operations we have nearly
concluded the buildout of our national sales management infrastructure with 75% of our
national sales managers already on staff and working hard. This team will focus their sales
activity on the top 40 mortgage originators and will complement our regional EAR and
ERISA sales management teams that will cater to regional and smaller banks.

Bloomberg Transcript

This hiring activity took place over the past couple of quarters and was an advanced
investment by us in important personnel. These proactive steps should enable us to
accelerate our sales activity by at least one quarter.
Of course, some of the costs related to these actions were already reflected in our 2013
operating results. Beginning with the 2014 First Quarter we will be reporting the mortgage
segment as a third business segment and for prior-year comparisons we will also give you
the quarterly performance of our mortgage activities going back to 2013.
Before I turn it over to Mark, I would like to also discuss our PMLs. As usual I would like to
point out that our cat PML aggregates reflect business bound through January 1 while the
premium numbers included in our financial statements are through December 31 and that
the PMLs are reflected net of all reinsurance in retro sessions.
As of January 1, 2014, our largest 250 year PML for a single event decreased slightly to
$801 million in the Northeast representing approximately 15% of common equity
shareholders while the Gulf PMLs also decreased to $670 million and our Florida TriCounty PML now stands at $566 million. With that I will turn it over to Mark to comment
further on our financial results and then after Mark we will entertain your questions. Mark?

FINAL

The consolidated combined ratio for this quarter was 85.3% with 2 points of current
accident year cat related events net of reinsurance to reinstatement premiums compared
to the 2012 Fourth Quarter combined ratio of 112.4%, which reflected 25.8 points of cat
related events. Cat losses occurring in the 2013 Fourth Quarter represented $16.8 million
net of reinsurance recoverables or reinstatement premiums mostly due to the Illinois
tornado and other smaller events.
The 2013 Fourth Quarter consolidated combined ratio also reflected 7.9 points of prioryear net favorable development compared to 7 points of prior-period favorable
development in the 2012 Fourth Quarter. Over 90% of this net favorable development in
the quarter was from the reinsurance segment with approximately 60% of that due to net
favorable development, longer tail lines spread relatively evenly over many underwriting
years but particularly in the 2003 to 2007 underwriting years.
The remaining 40% of the reinsurance segments net favorable development was
attributable to shorter tail lines associated with the more recent underwriting years. The
remaining aggregate 10% of favorable development in the quarter was emanated from
the insurance segment and was mainly driven by shorter tail lines predominantly from the
more recent accident years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Similar to prior periods, approximately 69% of our total net reserves or losses and loss
adjustment expense was $7.1 billion our IBNR or additional case reserves, which is a fairly
consistent ratio across both the reinsurance and the insurance segments over time. The
insurance segment accounts for 63% of the total loss and LAE reserves as of yearend
2013.
Therefore reflecting those the current accident year, accident quarter consolidated
combined ratio excluding cats for the Fourth Quarter was 91.2% compared to 93.6% in the
Fourth Quarter of 2012. On a year-to-date consolidated basis the 2013 calendar year
produced an 85.9% combined ratio on a reported basis compared to 95.4% for 2012
resulting in a $309 million improvement in underwriting income and primarily reflecting the
lower level of catastrophic activity compared to 2012.
The 2013 full year expense ratio increased by 50 basis points which was driven by a 60
bps increase in the acquisition expense ratio offset by a 10 point improvement in the
operating expense ratio relative to full calendar year 2012. The 2012 year, as you may
recall, already had its operating expense ratio improved by 50 basis points over the prior
year 2011.
The full accident year 2013 combined ratio excluding cats was 91.3% compared to the
accident year's 2012's full year combined ratio excluding cats at 94% which represented
270 basis point improvement. Overall, on a consolidated basis the full 2013 year saw $327
million of gross written premium growth, or 8.5% and roughly $300 million, or almost 10%
on a net basis.
The insurance segment grew net written premiums by nearly 7% and the reinsurance
segment by 14% for the full year of 2013. Also on a consolidated basis the ratio of net

FINAL

premium to gross premium in the 2013 Fourth Quarter was 78.4% compared to 75.3% a
year ago. In the reinsurance segment the net-to-gross ratio was 96.2% in the quarter
compared to 92.3% a year ago primarily due to changing mix of business on a written
basis.
The insurance segment had a 69.2% net-to-gross ratio compared to 67.7% a year ago
predominantly as a result of that ongoing strategy to grow the lesser volatile, smaller
account businesses and reduce our exposure in the higher severity businesses. In the
reinsurance segment the 2013 accident quarter combined ratio excluding cats was 84.0%
compared to 83.9% in the corresponding quarter a year ago. The reinsurance segment
results this quarter reflect changes in the mix of business on a net written business with a
higher contribution from casualty and other specialty and a lower relative contribution
from property, cat, marine and aviation in the Fourth Quarter of 2012.
The casualty growth primarily reflects one large professional alliance treaty, which Dinos
had mentioned, which included an unearned premium transfer that is reflected as a onetime written premium increase in addition to ongoing subject new and rental business.
The full 12-month accident year combined ratio excluding cats for the reinsurance
segment was 82.2% compared to 83.3% for the full 2012 accident year, which represents
a 110 basis point improvement.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the insurance segment the 2013 accident quarter combined ratio excluding cats was
96.4% compared to 100.4% a year ago. The Fourth Quarter of 2013 showed a 60 bps
reduction in the expense ratio with the acquisition expense ratio increasing by 50 bps
which was more than offset by a 110 basis point reduction in the operating expense ratio.
The full 12-month 2013 accident year combined ratio excluding cats for the insurance
segment was 97.4% compared to or 100.7% combined ratio for the full 2012 accident year,
a 330 basis point improvement. As respects pricing levels, the US insurance operation
achieved a 3.8% weighted average effective rate increase on a gross written basis for the
Fourth Quarter, which produced an additional margin expansion of 80 basis points over
the Fourth Quarter of 2012. These figures represent the excess of written effective rate
increases over estimated loss trends and provide continuing evidence of additional
margin expansion although the degree of expansion is shrinking.
Margin expansion continued in our program, casualty, excess Worker's Compensation and
A&H businesses while contracting marginally in healthcare, surety and some executive
assurance units. It is important to note that these are gross effective rate changes and
with the recent softening in the reinsurance marketplace the net economics have
improved more so than the gross economics in various areas.
As one example, the US Insurance Group's E&S property division, which was able to
secure significant improvements in their cat treaty, had a minus 0.5% effective rate
decrease for the Fourth Quarter on a gross basis. But after reflecting the impacts of the
improved cat treaty, the net estimated rate change was plus 6%, or a 650 basis point
swing to the good.

This one division's net impact was enough to increase the US total aggregate effective
rate change by 30 basis points from 3.8% to 4.1% and provides a better measure of true
underlying margin expansion of roughly 110 basis points. Specialty casualty, Workers Comp
and national account businesses have now experienced 11 consecutive quarters of rate
increases whereas our executive assurance middle-market and alternative asset
protection books along with our retail construction division have each experienced 10
consecutive quarters of increases. Furthermore, the excess work comp unit has now
enjoyed 9 consecutive quarters of rate increases.
Reported net investment income in the 2013 Fourth Quarter was $0.49 per share
substantially unchanged from the 2013 Third Quarter but less than the $0.53 per share in
the corresponding quarter of 2012. The difference from the Fourth Quarter of 2012 is
attributable to a reduction of investment income from fixed-income securities and
increase in investment expenses on a year-over-year basis.
However, this quarter's investment expenses are consistent with the first nine months of
2013. Our embedded pretax book yield before expenses was 2.38% as of December 31,
2013, compared to 2.41% at September 30. The duration of the portfolio shortened
slightly this quarter to 2.62 years from 2.83 years as of September 30.

Bloomberg Transcript

As Dinos mentioned, the total return on the portfolio was 97 bps in the 2013 Fourth
Quarter. We had equities and the high-yield corporate bond augmenting the returns on
our core investment grade fixed-income portfolio.
Excluding foreign-exchange total return was 85 basis points in the quarter. The full-year
2013 total return on the portfolio was 1.28% including the effects of foreign exchange
compared to 5.88% for the full 2012 year. Excluding foreign-exchange the full 2012 year
total return was 1.13% compared to 5.59% for the full 2012 year.
Our effective tax rate on pretax operating income for the Fourth Quarter of 2013 was an
expense of 8.3% and the full year 2013 was an expense of 4.8% versus a benefit of 3.8%
for the full year 2012. As always fluctuation in the effective tax rate can result from
variability in the relative mix of income or loss reported by jurisdiction.
The increase in the Fourth Quarter's tax rate on a pretax operating income was
predominantly driven by a valuation allowance that was established against our Canadian
operations deferred tax asset. This valuation allowance stems from operating losses
coincident with structural change effective 1/1/2013 that altered our Canadian operations
from being a branch of a US entity to a full Canadian domestic company.
Our total capital was $6.55 billion at the end of the 2013 Fourth Quarter compared to
$5.84 billion at the end of the 2013 Third Quarter and $5.57 billion at yearend 2012. This
represents a $704 million increase in capital from the Third Quarter end and a $979 million
increase in capital relative to yearend 2012.
This full-year 2013 increase in capital is primarily driven by $688 million of net income
available to common shareholders partially offset by approximately $209 million of

FINAL

unrealized losses, share repurchases and foreign translation adjustments along with the
$500 million of senior notes we issued this quarter. This new debt has a 30 year tenor
with a fixed rate 5.144% coupon and was issued at par. This coupon represents 130 basis
point spread over the referenced 30 year treasury and effect on the date of execution
which was December 13, 2013.
These notes were issued by Arch Capital Group US Inc. and are unconditionally
guaranteed by the Company. The proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of the
CMG and PMI mortgage insurance operations discussed already by Dinos and are also
available for other general corporate purposes.
As a result our capital structure at yearend 2013 is comprised of 13.7% debt, 5%
preferreds and 81.3% common equity. At the end of 2013 we continue to estimate having
capital in excess of our targeted capital position. As Dinos has also mentioned book value
per share increased nearly 4% in the Fourth Quarter to $39.82 and up 10% from yearend
2012's book value of $36.19.
Again driven by the Company's continued strong underwriting results. So with these
introductory comments we're now pleased to take your questions.

Questions And Answers

(Operator Instructions) Amit Kumar, Macquarie Capital.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Congrats on another strong quarter. Just if you follow up on the MIPS because I guess
that's the most exciting piece right now. First of all, would you help us in terms of framing
out what you believe the market opportunity is in terms of how you are thinking about the
total mortgage originations and what share, what private MIs have of that?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well you have a multiple part question but I will try to frame it in broad terms and then
maybe Mark can get more specific to it, but first and foremost the CMG is no change in
the marketplace. CMG has been operating since 1994 so in essence us acquiring that
entity will transfer that $100 million or so volume over to us while PMI's still underwriting as
of 2011, and therefore all of that production will be new to us. Now to size the market,
there is only 7, 8 competitors in the market and the FHA. The FHA roughly has about half
the market today, is continuing to depopulate that as more and more private capital is
assuming the risks.
So we believe there is quite a bit of room in us expanding in that area. And the third point
I will make, also both Fannie and Freddie through their stacker and Connecticut Avenue
Security transactions, they are putting more of the credit risk to the private markets

Page 8 of 26



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2014-02-12

especially for mortgages that fall below the -- have a higher than 20% down payment that
they are not required by law to purchase direct mortgage insurance.

FINAL

But they are in protecting their books Fannie and Freddie purchased that on a bulk basis.
So I don't know how best to describe the market to you but we believe it's a good
opportunity and a strongly capitalized company like Arch Mortgage will be a welcome
addition to the marketplace with enough room for us to grow.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. I don't know if Mark has anything to add to that?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Not too much. As you know, if you split this thing by channel is how we look at it, the credit
union space we would have now that the acquisition is closed, 45% market share perhaps
that could go a little north. We'd like to protect that, perhaps marginally increase it over
the short term and over the longer term on the lender or bank channel we certainly hope
to get to a double-digit market share three years down the line or so.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. And the lender channel is through PMI, right?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That's correct.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well the old PMI. There is no PMI. It will be --

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Mostly on paper.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. Because I am looking at some statistics and it shows CMG at least having currently
a 3% market share but that's in the traditional private MI business.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Right, that's 3% of the total. I was quoting of the channel itself. 45% of the credit union
channel.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

How much would that equate to in terms of the overall market? Like what would the 3%
look like?

FINAL

Got it. Sorry, go ahead.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

The 45% of the credit union channel is 3%, 3.5% of the aggregate channel.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. I guess the only other question I have, and I will stop, is I know in the past you
talked about sort of a mid-teen return on this. Has that thought process changed and
what would be -- I don't know if a capital charge is the right word, how should we think
about capital versus MI versus capital deployment in other avenues? Thanks.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, our prospect of ROE has not changed. We still believe that these high mid-teen ROEtype of business on -- while you are at risk to capital is about 18 to 1.
Probably over time that will get further down depending what the regulators will do to
probably 15 to 1. But for the time being it is 18 to 1 and we do like that business. Of course
it will take some time for us to get to a steady state, probably three years as Mark said,
and then the real accretion to our ROE will start happening at that point in time.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. In three years accounting, so 2016 is the first year, right?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

No, mid-2014 is kind of the first year because the sales forces just about now. We won't
be writing a lot on the old PMI platform until probably Third Quarter of this year.
It takes time to get the book policies in place and then you start receiving the flow from
the originators. In the small banks and regional business a little faster, on the national
mortgage originators a little longer because they have to go through the vendor
management routines and it takes a bit of time.
We try to accelerate that in anticipation of the close and we had people working on it in
the Fourth Quarter and of course in this First Quarter. But our success is mostly now with
the smaller and regional banks because the process is a little easier and we are
gravitating to the large originators.

Jay Gelb, Barclays.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Just wanted to touch base on the 11% to 13% accident year return on equity target. With
primary commercial rates peaking and reinsurance rates softening what do you feel will
be able to continue to drive that over time?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Jay, depends on what happens going forward. Don't forget if everything remained
steady, let's say we just, we barely -- if we say the rate increases we achieve in the future
are only good enough to cover loss cost trend then your ROE will unless you allow your
capital to build up excessively, it will remain constant in that range, right?

Bloomberg Transcript

So we haven't seen that change. As a matter fact even though rates -- rate increases
have moderated a bit, it is still above loss cost trend not by as much as 150 or 170 basis
points we saw maybe two quarters ago, but 80 basis points as we saw in the Fourth
Quarter, so it will depend on that. But right now we are very confident about the business
we write it will generate that kind of return on equity.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

If market conditions were to deteriorate worse than expected next year can you talk
about Arch's ability to pull back on volume?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Before you go there, this is your question along with some of Dino's answer. Remember,
we're quoting you these margin expansion numbers on a written basis. So a lot of it is
baked into 2014 already because of what was done in the four quarters of 2013.
So even if you had the assumption of 2014 being a 0 margin expansion you can pretty
much figure out, barring unusual capital of cats and things of that nature, you could
arithmetically pretty much get to a strong insurance result.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes, the earned premium comes later on than the written premium. So the 2014 is baked,
if you have a change it will affect 2015 and beyond.
But I can't predict the future if we are going to have a change. The math is pretty easy.
Depends how many -- if you're gaining margin expansion or if you're losing it.

FINAL

Our ability, which is your second question, to navigate through these markets all you got
to do is look at our history. Even in today's market that predominantly we like on the
insurance group we have in our European operations, we have reduced significant
volumes in the professional indemnity space because we just don't like the what's
happening in that particular -- too much competition, too many players and we're not
getting rate increases above trend so in essence that will deteriorate and we don't like to
be playing in spaces that the economics get worse.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Right, okay. Then can you just update us on your thoughts around share buyback given the
growth opportunities in areas like mortgage insurance? You said in the past that we
shouldn't look for much in the way of share buybacks but just wanted to confirm that that
was still your current thinking.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes, our current thinking hasn't changed. We will maintain a bit of access capital as
cushion. That's always been our philosophy.
And we continue to look for opportunities to deploy capital in our business. But absent of
good opportunities we'd probably revert back to share buybacks if we are accumulating
excess capital at a faster pace than we need to have.

Hi. Good morning. This is Crystal in for Mike today.
My first question is can you elaborate on the Watford Re fund? If you can't comment on
the potential size of the fund and the impact to the financials perhaps you can discuss its
strategy which appears to be casualty lines focused where it's most third-party funds in
the marketplace are property focused.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

What we have announced in January is we have agreed in principle to act as a reinsurance
manager, reinsurance underwriter for Watford Re. We are just going to be a new multiline
Bermuda reinsurer fully rated and Highbridge Principal Strategies will act as the investment
manager of the Watford Re.

FINAL

The venture is not yet finalized so we're limited as to what we can say about it. But they
are in the middle of capital raising so we can't comment on that.
On the conceptual thing, think of this as a kind of a semi-virtual company. It will have its
own management, a CEO, a CFO, a Chief Risk officer, underwriters to do underwriting
reviews per se on our activities. Then the bulk of the underwriting activity will be done by
the Arch employees and the Arch underwriting system and the investment operations will
be done by Highbridge Principal Strategy.
Both of us are, Highbridge and Arch, is bound contractually for a long time to provide
those kind of services. So that's the principle concept of the facility.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Maybe, Dinos, have you talked about how much capital right now is at the -- is in the MI?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

In the MI space?

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

No, that you have pushed down into CMG in order to write business.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

CMG is capitalized, we just bought the entity. Our financial strength will, as a matter fact
they are under review by the rating agencies to, they're a triple minus with a positive
outlook, triple-B-minus with a positive outlook based on waiting for the closing of the
transaction.
So we expect a significant balance on the credit rating of that facility. But we are going to
be adding capital to it to maintain adequate capital ratios and depending on their
production we will continue maintaining adequate capital. Mark, do you want to -- ?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

To the extent, if you're real question, Michael, is emanated from consideration at closing,
which is a little different than ongoing capital base --

FINAL

No, my question is as we're thinking about the earnings power here, how should we think
about insurance in force? How should we think about whether or not you feel like you
need to contribute capital related to potential changes to the GFC standards or anything
of the like?
I'm just trying to figure how much is in there? How much business do you think you're
going to write so we can start to think about what sort of ROEs this business is going to
be able to generate and when.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

I understand the underlying premise in your question but we don't know to what extent
we're going to be penetrating that lender market. As Dino says that is not going to get
any traction until midyear and then get the monthly streams behind it.
But it is clear that we are going to be whatever the capital standards are that come out,
as Dino said, it is approximately 18 to 1 now and get stiffened over time, that's what we
are going to need to do. But that will be a function of the actual rate on which we put on
these exposures.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And you've got to understand, Michael, that based on our agreements with Fannie and
Freddie at the beginning we will probably be a bit over capitalized because we have
contributed in our MI operations approximately $350 million, $400 million. That doesn't
limit what we do in the US.
Also this is part of the things that we do overseas. You're going to get a lot more clarity
on this on the First Quarter when we are going to start reporting the segments individually
and then you can build your models after that.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Okay, would it be possible to get insurance in force just as a kind of ballpark at this
point, or do you want to wait until --?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Right now I think the risk to capital ratio is closer to 10 to 1.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

So it's not going to -- this is what it looks like now to us. And that will start going up as we
produce more business but it will take probably a couple of years, maybe three years
before we get to the point that we have enough production and then we need to add
additional capital in order to support the proper capital ratio.

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

FINAL

And one way to think about that in rough terms, in round numbers, because it's closed,
CMG has roughly $5 billion at risk in force. So if you use the 18 to 1 that Dinos just talked
about, that translates to about $280 million, $275 million of implied capital needs, that's
arithmetically as opposed to GFC requirements. That assumes 100% of it is kept on shore
as well, which is likely not the case, but anyway I'm just giving you --

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

That's great. That's what I was looking for. Thank you.
Then just last one. The marginal tax rate on the MI business, will that be different from
your consolidated tax rate or do you expect it to be similar?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

It should be marginally higher because there may be a difference in the quarter share
percentage.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Got it. Great.
Then last question if I could offer this topic, I guess one question I have is obviously you
are seeing a lot of flux on the reinsurance side and it seems like you are prepared to
move capacity into the insurance market and particularly probably there are some
opportunities on the E&S side and as a buyer reinsurance challenging, or competitive
reinsurance conditions are helpful. But at what point do you see or could we see others
employ that same strategy of just kind of lifting the capital out of the reinsurance market
and moving it into the insurance market and kind of bringing that situation with them? Is
that something you think about?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I can't talk about others because I don't know what they're going to do. First of all, if you
have a structure like Arch, which you have businesses in both segments you have the
opportunity to do it.
If you are a pure reinsurer you don't have the opportunity to do that because if you are
lacking insurance operations you've got to stick with what you have. Having said that it is
the willingness of managements to decide as to where they're going to allocate capital
and in which segments.
Even in the insurance segment we don't have a lot of liking on the large accounts business
where rates are today especially if they are written on a guaranteed cost basis. If you
eliminate loss sensitive type of transactions that it is less underwriting risk and more
service oriented type of business.

FINAL

Predominantly we're focusing on very tiny binding authority business and small accounts
across the board not only in our program business or our binding authority business but
also in what we do throughout the world. And that is also a focus of our reinsurance
operations as reinsurers of underlying businesses. They still look for the small, mediumsize type of accounts to reinsure.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

And let me just add, Michael, don't view this as a panacea of moving capital from
reinsurance to insurance. We just got done quoting that the full accident year was about
83 combined for the reinsurance group.
They've worked hard to be well diversified. So although there's focus on cat, cat is clearly
not the only game in town.
That's a 17% return on revenue right there. So it's not -- the sky isn't falling.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

It's definitely clear that when things are getting more challenging especially in the
reinsurance business, talent will make a difference and discipline will make a difference
and I think our track record speaks for itself. We have terrific underwriting teams in our
reinsurance group, and I think they're as disciplined as they come.
I do have a management tool that I got from my father, it's a Louisville Slugger, but I only
keep it in the corner of my office because I never have to use it. These guys are more
disciplined than I am.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Dinos, what happens if there's an Andrew or a Katrina and with all this collateralized paper
are there no second event covers out there? Does the industry suddenly scramble for
protection on day two?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It depends what these facilities that have the collateralized paper will do. Are they going
to ante up additional capital so they can participate? Or I don't know the answer to it.
You can have different scenarios as to what's going to happen. For example if I'm a buyer
on a retro plan of collateralized capital and I have a major event, I am not releasing that
Page 16 of 26



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td

collateral until I know exactly who -- that I get paid for my losses. So in essence if they
want to reload and participate it is up to them but I don't know what that reaction is going
to be at that point in time.

FINAL

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

In terms of your buying are you buying protection at this point with collateralized paper
more so than rated paper or how do you view the trade-off there?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

We buy both. We buy both and we model things out and we believe if we can have a
good purchase we don't really care if it's traditional or fully collateralized.

Q - Josh Shanker

And is there reversal expected for this Canadian tax charge in 2014? Is this one time or
does it get earned back through the other direction in the future?

This is a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset. So depending upon

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

So the first question is on the debt. A little surprised that you took on debt because I
thought that you guys were sitting on a lot of excess capital. Could you help us
understand that decision please.

Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity

Well we do. But don't forget it was attractive terms especially on a net basis.

FINAL

So we said all along that we kept a very conservative balance sheet to give us those kind
of opportunities. We felt we can raise at attractive churns and in the right jurisdiction.
So we chose a path and maybe we have a bit of excess capital beyond what we had
before. But we also have the opportunity to deploy it in other business and there is a few
things that we are working on. And if that doesn't materialize we can always return it to
shareholders.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Just to amplify that, Vinay, saying it's attractively priced, it's tax-deductible, we tended to
want to raise it in the jurisdiction where it is going to be deployed. And as a general
statement we don't really like to trap capital if we can get away with it.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. The second question is on the opportunity in the mortgage insurance space. I
believe you said that you don't want to get more than about 20% of your capital. In the
next three years where do you think, how much of capital do you think you will be able to
deploy right now?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Not enough to even get as close to 20%. We just said we have put in about $400 million,
we are about 10 to 1 right now. It has a lot of room to get to 18 to 1.
If we are very successful probably you are looking out three years out before we need -and don't forget I can't even predict what my balance sheet is going to look three years
out but I can tell you we will have a lot more than $560 billion of common equity. So the
20% it will take quite a bit of time.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

We didn't say we want to be 20% tomorrow we said we will work on the opportunities the
market gives us and we are going to try to build it but from a risk management point of
view we didn't want to deploy more than 20%. And of course there is other ways to
deploy capital as you have seen with our activity at Watford.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

But just looking in terms of the capital that you are looking at deploying (multiple
speakers).

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Within the Arch balance sheet, yes.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

FINAL

Right. So do you think that the mortgage insurance operation you could maybe do about
$1 billion in terms of capital deployed in the next two to five years?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Maybe five years out, but not in the two to three years.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. All right. The last question is on the ROE.
Looking at the 11% to 13% underwriting your ROE, trying to translate that into GAAP ROE
and other deviates in the balance because you got excess capital. Could you help us
understand this difference?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I don't understand the difference. All you've got to look, Vinay, is our performance. This
year we did 11.7% on an operating basis for the year and we have done 13.5% on a net
basis and it was not a stellar year from an investment point of view because of what
happened to the fixed-income securities.
So 2011 to 2013 without significant -- don't forget there is no significant deterioration in
the underwriting conditions globally. Insurance group is improving, reinsurance group is
slightly losing some ground.
On balance when I look at it I think nothing has changed for us. I view 2014 to be as good
as 2013 and maybe slightly better, so at the end of the day we do an in-depth, and I will
turn it over to Mark, calculations on these things but they are projections and we feel
comfortable with it, that's what we put it in our commentary. Mark, anything more you
want to say?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

No. I think you nailed it. Nothing to add.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

So wasn't 2013 a very low year for cats and 2014 should be a more normal year for cats?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

The cat business for us is I would say on an expected basis the low cat might give you
another $100 million, $150 million of excess profit and on a bad cat year you take that off,

Page 19 of 26



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2014-02-12

right? Because you can't assume 0 cats and then are cat loaded like $250 million a year.

FINAL

So basically, yes, that will have a fluctuation. If you do the math, so it's a few points of ROE
that it can swing, 2 to 3 up, or 2 to 3 down depending on heavy or no cat activity, and
that's what you saw.
The other event that happened this year is that the fixed-income market didn't really help
very much with the ROE on a net income basis and or the growth in book value. So you
can do your own math but when we look at the business we underwrite we allocate it two
notches above our rating, cap it out through the SMP model. And we run everything
through to see -- I'm not saying everything we underwrite today produces that kind of
ROE.
We've got business that are in the mid-single digit, but we still in it because we like the
future of that business and we have business that they are 15% ROE. In the aggregate
when you put that all in the hopper, we come with that range. That's why I give you a
range. I don't give you a bullet point because I'm not that smart to know exactly which
segments we're going to be successful to grow versus other, and mix will make a
difference. But 11% to 13% we are very comfortable with.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Just wanted to get your thoughts on why you are making a bet on your professional lines
in D&O on the reinsurance side rather than the insurance side.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Don't forget, we are doing it on both, on insurance side and on the reinsurance side, but
you got to go by geography. We're not making a big bet in Europe and other parts of the
world because we don't see the uplift on the rate. The bet we are making in the US is we
view that as a unique situation, a good underwriting team with a very good track record
and having a significant amount of business in the primary D&O space, which has
experienced more stickiness. And also the better rate improvement than anything we've
seen in the D&O world in the last 3 to four years.
So we're backing I think a good team. We like the management from the top down all the
way through and at the end of the day we were willing to do that.
Having said that doesn't meet our insurance operations in the D&O space in the US they
are not trying actively. We have easy opportunities to grow.

M&A pipeline or for one-off type deals, I guess another use of capital going forward?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

We don't comment on future activity but in general terms we have seen as we reported
on the CMG transaction opportunities sometimes do special deals in reinsurance because
people they're looking for capital relief and sometimes you've got to have the excess
capital available and ready to deploy it immediately. If we see those type of opportunities
drying up then we've got to rethink about what do you do with excess capital? But right
now I'm still in a wait-and-see pattern looking at all these opportunities that we are
discussing.

Q - John Hall

{BIO 1497612 <GO>}

I was wondering on the mortgage insurance side, you sort of moved into that segment
first in reinsurance and now with the closing of CMG do you think being a primary player is
going to reduce your opportunities to continue to write reinsurance there?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well I don't believe so. The opportunities might have went away anyway. A lot of the
reinsurance transactions they were out of necessity because some of the direct
mortgage insurance they were in need of capital and we recognize that from the first day.
We did the first transaction and that was the reason that we were always had an interest.
Our interest to enter the primary mortgage insurance business didn't happen yesterday.
We had that interest going back four years ago. We just had to find is the right opportunity
with the right facility, etc.
As you know, technology plays a big role in that, you've got to have robust systems to be
in that space, you've got to have good relationships with organizations like yours which we
expect to do a lot of business with, you are the largest originator. And you got to have the
interfaces and all of that.

Page 21 of 26



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2014-02-12

So when we found that opportunity we entered the market. Having said that we always
knew that our reinsurance opportunities especially from the primary mortgage, it will
purely depend on their capital needs.

FINAL

And now the capital markets have opened to some of the potential clients, some existing
clients and potential clients. So I don't know what their needs are going to be in the future
but our intent is to be both as a reinsurer and also primary in the US and also overseas.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Just to augment that a bit, your question necessitates a scenario or two and how will the
capital markets continue to view our mortgage insurance spaces? As the GFC capital
requirement let's hypothesize.
They go from 18 to 1 and they go 16 and they go to 15. This could be increasingly difficult
for some of the legacy players to come to the compliance.
The extent that the Capital Markets get a little more cold shoulder towards it, reinsurance
as a capital source becomes a very attractive.

Two quick questions if I can. First in that 40% of the reinsurance segment reserve releases
that came from shorter tail lines is there any way of breaking that down between normal
run rate losses and the major cats that have been incurred since 2011?

A - Mark Lyons

Most of it is non-cat. So I am estimating, but I believe it was closer, it was north of 50% on
the non-cat.

I had a question about Watford. Generally, is the Third Quarter of this year sort of a
reasonable timeline for when Watford will begin binding business?
I was wondering if you could describe it a little bit about some of the types of lines of
business that you envision for Watford. And will it only write business that Arch Re is not
writing, or might there be deals where you both participate?
Then finally -- just to add one more related question, sorry Dinos, and then the
professional liability reinsurance deal that you did with the large unearned premium
reserve pickup in the Fourth Quarter, is there any tie between that and Watford? Is the
prospect of Watford starting soon in any way linked and will it participate at all on that
treaty? And that's it for me, thanks.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Let me start with the fresher one, the last question. No, it had nothing to do with Watford
because Watford even though the probability is very high at the time we made that
transaction we were making it for us.
We want to maintain that. Now in the future if we choose to put some in Watford or not it
will be up to us.
Having said that in your question about what business Watford will take, yes, they will take
sometimes business that we ship out today, other participants and they will participate
with that. Sometimes we're going to be side-by-side and sometimes there might be
deals that they will do on their own.

FINAL

At the end of the day the underwriting standards of Watford Re will be the same
underwriting standards as we have at Arch. I am not reprogramming the brains of our
underwriters.
What might be slightly different that it might cause some business to go to Watford it will
depend on duration of liabilities and what kind of expected return we expect from the
Highbridge Principal Strategy, it's a hedge fund who is going to be managing the asset. So
there might be situations that some accounts might not make the cut for Arch but it will
make the cut and produce north of 15% ROE for Watford.
Then for we will do those two. But I want to emphasize our underwriting teams when they
are working on Arch accounts or Watford accounts they're going to use the same basic
tools and the same principles that we have established over the last 12 years.

It contemplate everything.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

FINAL

Okay. It did contemplate this period's debt risk.
Also just wanted to square the 11% to 13% comment. I guess does that ROE comment on
business written today?
I'm guessing that contemplates the accident year loss ratio you initially book is above your
estimate of ultimate losses? Because otherwise it doesn't look like on an accident year
basis you would be there for 13%.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I don't totally understand the question. Did you understand the question?

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

In other words you had, booked a 13.5% this year, 11.7% operating --

13.5% on a net basis --

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Yes, 11.7% operating, but you had some obviously some favorable development in there.
So taking that into consideration you're probably -- that would be somewhere in the $250
million to development, maybe you are in the 7% to 8% range.
So if you are booking business on a 11% to 13% ROE basis I am guessing that assumes that
the accident year result is not going to close that gap for 2014 or 2015 that there is some
assumption that preserves and continue their trend that we have seen in the last several
years?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well some of it is, remember, these comments Dinos is making on the range are
underwriting years not accident years. In an improving market accident year 2013 will be
worse than underwriting year 2013, and underwriting year 2014 will improve even more.
So accident year is the starting point but you have to translate probably a pretty material
movement to convert that to an underwriting year in improvement.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

On your reserve question, we've been reserving conservatively all of our lives. We are not
planning to change that.

Usually performance comes -- as I say, the current accident year, it's a self grading exam.
Maybe four or five years out it becomes an exam but the professor will grade.

FINAL

And that philosophy hasn't changed with us. So I don't believe that our reserve philosophy
will change. So in essence based on historical averages I would think the same kind of
performance is going to emerge.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Great. Thank you very much.

Operator
With no further questions in the queue I would like to hand the call back to Mr. Iordanou
for closing remarks.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well thank you all and we are looking forward to talking to you in the next quarter, which is
going to be probably a little more exciting first time we are going to report the MI as a
separate section of our three businesses and I am sure you're going to have a ton of
questions. With that have a wonderful day. Thank you.
