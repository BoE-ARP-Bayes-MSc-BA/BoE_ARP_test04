Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks Keith. Good morning and thank you for joining today's call. I'm glad to report that
we had strong performance both financially and operationally in the second quarter. For
me three accomplishments in particular stand out. First, we raised over $1 billion of new
common equity, building a fortress balance sheet in anticipation of significant future
opportunities. Second, our three category approach to managing our COVID-19 exposure
proved sound, with reported claims developing in line with expectations. Finally, we
executed disciplined and focused renewals across property and casualty working
constructively with our customers and brokers to achieve rate adequacy, and improved
terms and conditions.
I will address each of these accomplishments in greater detail, and discuss the quarter
more generally. As usual, Bob will also update you on our financial performance for the
quarter. Beginning with our capital raise, throughout our 27 year history, we have placed a
high bar to raising common equity. Post IPO, we have only issued common shares on one
other occasion, not concurrent with an acquisition. To raising this equity, I believe we need
to answer at least three questions; why now, why equity and why $1 billion.
First, why now? We are confident in our ability to execute into an improved market and
believe the opportunity will persist for several years. Prior to the emergence of COVID-19,
P&C markets were already experiencing constrained supply and elevated demand,
resulting in upward pressure on rates. Numerous factors led to this supply demand
imbalance. Property markets have experienced three consecutive years of elevated
catastrophe activity, resulting in large losses and substantial trapped ILS capital.
Capital -- casualty markets were beset by a significant loss inflation caused by historically
large jury verdicts and increasing frequency of severity. This preexisting rate trend was
accelerated by COVID-19 and the deep economic recession that followed. COVID-19 will
be among the largest insured losses in history. The loss will develop slowly and will add
uncertainty which drives demand for reinsurance, as buyers look to reduce volatility.
At the same time the increase in demand has been mirrored by a reduction in supply,
caused by increased underwriting discipline in dislocated retro markets. This confluence of
factors has resulted in material rate increases that will impact almost all lines for an
extended period and which we expect will create opportunities for us over the next
several years. For all the reasons we concluded that this was the ideal time to raise new
equity.

FINAL

Second, why did we choose equity? Our strategy is to use our integrated system to
match desirable risk with efficient capital. Throughout our history, we have been
innovators and preferentially accessing the most efficient forms of capital depending on
market conditions, flexing between common, preferred cat bonds, retro, sidecars and
dedicated third party capital, as well as senior debt credit revolvers and LOCs. Each form
of capital is selected to maximize its efficiency relative to the risk it is deployed against.
Given our current conditions, common equity was the best option. It is permanent. It is
flexible capital, fully available for underwriting so we can deploy in order to maximize longterm shareholder value. And finally why a $1 billion? On our previous earnings call, we told
you, we already had excess capital, but we chose this amount as we believe it gives us
the increased scale necessary to maximize the market opportunity, we are expecting. We
ran multiple proformas to determine the size of this opportunity and feel confident that
we can deploy the capital, we raised while maintaining a prudent buffer.

Bloomberg Transcript

We envisioned two main opportunities to deploy the capital we raised. Opportunity one;
is growing into an improving market and opportunity two is retaining more risk. Our first
and best opportunity is to grow into an improving market. We have a long-term
demonstrated track record of profitable growth and believe that current conditions afford
us considerable options to grow our business by deploying more equity.
With a fortress balance sheet, we can provide our customers with certainty of execution.
Many insurers are concerned about their ability to purchase sufficient reinsurance and
retro next year. This results in a reluctance to take new risk or renew existing business
even at attractive rates. Approximately half of our business renews at January 1 and we
are already having productive conversations with our customers ahead of this important
renewal. Providing certainty of execution makes us a first call market for both new and
large opportunities and gives us preferential access to private deals.
Our second deployment opportunity is to retain more risk. A key component of our
growth strategy is the flexibility to grow and shrink the amount of risk we share with
others in order to construct the most efficient underwriting portfolio. As market conditions
have evolved, our customers are increasingly seeking the stable flexible long-term
capacity that our weighted balance sheet can provide.
With additional common equity on our balance sheet, we were able to offer more
weighted capacity which enhances the flexibility of solutions, we are able to provide to
our customers. As retro rates rise and the ILS market faces challenges, we will share less
risk and sell more retro, so as more of our capital and should be able to do so in a
manner that increasingly contributes to our bottom line.
Shifting to COVID-19. Last quarter, I explained our three category approach to managing
our COVID-19 exposures. To-date, reported losses have developed largely as expected
within this framework. If you recall, I categorized our potential COVID-19 exposure as
falling into one of three distinct categories. Category one includes event like losses
closely linked to the virus, such as event contingency, event-based casualty class and
certain types of accident and health. We booked full limit losses for canceled events

FINAL

through the end of the year, and excluded COVID-19 from future renewals. In the second
quarter, we began to receive claim notifications against these reserves as events have
been canceled or postponed, which have been in line with expectations. To be clear
however, we have not canceled events in 2021.
Category 2 covers well understood economic risks. These include losses caused by
recession and our risks we are paid to take. Last quarter, we increased certain loss ratios
in our Casualty and Specialty book to reflect the elevated risk related to COVID-19. We
continue to monitor our credit portfolio, including mortgage for COVID-19 losses, while
the likelihood of loss has risen, the current situation is fundamentally different than the
Great Financial Crisis. Loans are of higher quality. Regulations are tighter and the housing
market is under built. In addition, the US government has extended the largest and the
most comprehensive forbearance measures in history.

Bloomberg Transcript

For these reasons, we believe that our mortgage book is adequately reserved. And
Category 3 is the known unknowns, primarily business interruption. As has been widely
reported coverage of pandemic business interruption risk under property policies has
been controversial, except for communicable disease coverage extensions have been
provided, policyholders generally have not paid for the benefit of protection, and it
follows that pandemic losses should not be covered.
Our seasons continue to advise us that they have minimal exposure to business
interruption losses and intend to fight [ph] any and all attempts by the plaintiffs' bar to
impose liability. We continue to stay closely connected with our teams on these exposures
and are monitoring court actions in Europe and the US. Finally, before I turn it over to Bob,
there's one more item I'd like to address. As we announced several weeks ago, Aditya
Dutt has departed and I have assumed interim responsibility for our ventures business. I
am excited to have the opportunity to work with our close -- to work closely with our
talented ventures team, at a time we are seeing many opportunities to profitably deploy
partner capital. We thank Aditya for his 12 years of service and wish him continued success.
Our ventures unit is one of the oldest and most respected ILS managers in the business. It
has grown to play a critical role in our gross to net strategy, an integrated system, which
we will continue to do so going forward. Despite third-party capital markets becoming
increasingly dislocated, we successfully raised over $250 million of capital, including our
line participation for Upsilon, Medici and Vermeer balance sheets in support of the midyear renewals. Our ability to do so is a result of superior underwriting, excellent enterprise
risk management, and investor confidence and our aligned approach. We greatly value
the trust that our partner capital has placed in us to deliver high quality portfolios of risk,
and I'm confident that we can continue to earn that trust in the future.
So with that, I'll provide an update on the renewals for our segments at the end of the
call, but first, let me turn it over Bob to talk about our financial performance.

FINAL

Thanks Kevin, and good morning everyone. We had a solid quarter with strong financial
results and several strategic accomplishments. I'll begin my prepared comments with an
update on our operational response to COVID-19 and then will provide an overview of the
capital raise and its impact on our financials. I will then discuss our financial results, starting
with our consolidated returns and then providing more detail on our three main drivers of
profit underwriting income, fee income and investment income.
Beginning with an update on our operational response to COVID-19, after more than
three months from working from home, we began to transition back to our offices in
Bermuda and Zurich. We opened these two offices on an optional and limited basis in
June, and the transition back has been smooth. Most of our employees, however,
continued to work remotely and we are all operating well in this mix model. Importantly,
throughout the second quarter, we continued to invest in the business through active
recruiting. We hired and on boarded several new employees, remotely, to support the
needs of our expanding business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, moving to the capital raise, Kevin discussed we raised $1.1 billion in common equity
through a public offering and a concurrent private placement with State Farm of 6.8 million
common shares at a price of $166 per share. We anticipate that our largest opportunities
to deploy this capital will be at and subsequent to the January 1 renewal. In the interim,
this capital will have some pressure on earnings per share; this quarter that impact was
minimal. And finally you will note that during the quarter, our book value per share
increased $17 or 15% as a result of our capital raise, significant mark-to-market gains on
our investment portfolio and strong operating income.
Now, moving to our consolidated results, we reported annualized return on average
common equity of 38.5% driven by mark-to-market gains in our investment portfolio.
Annualized operating return on average common equity was 12.7% influenced primarily by
favorable underwriting results and fee income. Reported net income for the quarter of
$576 million or $12.63 per diluted common share. Our operating income was $190 million
or $4.06 per diluted common share. This excludes net realized and unrealized gains on
investments, TMR transition related expenses and net foreign exchange losses.
Gross premiums written for the quarter were $1.7 billion up $225 million or 15% from the
comparable quarter last year, 90% of this growth came from our property segment and
10% came from Casualty. As a reminder, we acquired Tokio Millennium Re on March 22,
2019. So, this is the first full quarter since the acquisition where results are comparable
year-over-year. As we indicated before, we did not renew a significant portion of the TMR
portfolio. So, our top line growth of 15% during the quarter was achieved despite
downwards pressure.
You will also see the impact of the TMR acquisition in the ratio of our ceded to gross
premiums. Legacy business that we acquired from TMR was covered by the ADC, so not
subject to our normal ceded program, while the ratio of our ceded to gross premiums
stayed flat year-over-year at 31%, this ratio has increased in the casualty segment from
25% to 28% as renewed business is incorporated into our ceded program. This was offset
by a decline in property ceded from 35% to 32% reflecting our decision to cede less
business this quarter.

Now, I'll dive deeper into our financial results, and to begin with, we have reorganized our
financial supplement to better align it with our three primary drivers of profit; underwriting
income, fee income and investment income. We have enhanced disclosure around noncontrolling interests and retained investments, while also removing duplicative
information. I'll begin by discussing underwriting income where we reported income of
$217 million for the quarter or a combined ratio of 78.5%. Both segments performed well
in the quarter with property contributing underwriting income of $201 million and casualty
contributing $16 million of income. Net premiums earned were approximately $1 billion up
$99 million or 11%.
Our direct expenses which are the sum of our operational and corporate expenses
totaled $61 million for the quarter, which is a decrease of $23 million from the second
quarter of 2019. The ratio of direct expense to net premiums earned was 6%, a decrease
of more than 3 percentage points from the comparable period last year, driven by strong
operating leverage as well as lower transition and operating expenses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Transition related expenses associated with the acquisition of TMR have declined by $12
million from $14 million in the second quarter of 2019 to $2 million in 2020. We anticipate
these expenses will continue to wind down over the near-term. Additionally, operating
expenses were down 2 percentage points, partially driven by about $5 million in savings
from reduced travel, marketing and office operational expenses related to COVID-19.
Now, moving to the Property segment, where gross written premiums were up by $203
million or 24% from the comparable quarter, driven by rate increases, growth in lines with
at (inaudible) renewals in Japan, mid-year renewals, and expansion of our Lloyd's
delegated authority insurance book. We reported a current accident your loss ratio of
35% and prior year favorable development of 1% in the Property segment. We did have
$8 million in adverse development in the other property book, which was driven
predominantly by a variety of small events in the attritional book. This was more than
offset by $15 million of favorable development in the property cat from reserve releases
across the last three accident years.
Underwriting expenses were down 4 percentage points, reflecting improved operating
leverage and a lower acquisition expense ratio in both property cat and other property.
Overall, we reported a combined ratio of 59% in the property book, both property cat
and other property were favorable -- were profitable, reporting combined ratios of 33%
and 86% respectively.
Moving on to our Casualty results, where we grew gross premiums by $22 million or 3%
primarily related to increases in underlying rate and growth of new and existing deals.
While reported gross was $22 million, excluding the impact of TMR non-renewals, we
estimate that organic growth in our Casualty segment resulted in more than $100 million
of premium increases in the second quarter. The current accident year loss ratio was 68%,
which is in line with our expectations. And finally, we reported a combined ratio of 97%
with favorable prior development up 2%.

FINAL

Now, I'll shift to our second driver of profit, fee income. Total fee income for the second
quarter was $46 million made up of $27 million in management fees and $18 million in
performance fees. Year-to-date, fees are up 32% compared to the first half of 2019 as
our partner capital business continues to grow unperformed. As I mentioned at the
beginning of my prepared comments, we've made several changes and improvements to
the Financial Supplement, with Page 12 providing greater insight into how the noncontrolling interest from our joint ventures business, impact our financials.
We have added a new table to this page that shows the amount of partner capital that we
manage on behalf of DaVinci, Medici and Vermeer. This capital is reflected as noncontrolling interest on our balance sheet and for the second quarter, totaled $3.4 billion
up from $2.7 billion in the comparable quarter of last year. As a reminder, this noncontrolling interest does not include partner capital related to Upsilon, Top Layer or
Langhorne.

Bloomberg Transcript

DaVinci, Medici and Vermeer reported solid results in the second quarter bolstered by low
catastrophes and mark-to-market gains. The non-controlling interest charge attributable
to these vehicles was $119 million, which reduced our earnings accordingly. Compared to
the second quarter of 2019, the non-controlling interest charge increased by $47 million.
This was driven by strong underwriting performance growth at partner capital and markto-market gains. Regarding Upsilon, which is not highlighted in the financial supplement
total managed capital at the end of the second quarter was $2.1 billion, $1.8 billion of which
belongs to our partners.
All premiums associated with Upsilon flow through our financial statements as gross
written premiums. However, we treat our partner's portion of Upsilon as ceded premium.
Therefore, only our 14% share is included in net written premiums. Fees we earned from
Upsilon serve to offset operating and acquisition expenses.
And now closing with our third driver of profit, investment income. Financial markets
snapped back in the second quarter in contrast to the extreme volatility we saw in the first
quarter. Our investment portfolio also recovered mark-to-market losses from the first
quarter of 2020 reporting total investment results for the second quarter of $538 million
with realized and unrealized gains of $448 million, predominantly in fixed maturity and
equity investments.
During the quarter, we increased both the allocation to and duration of investment grade
corporate credit, both of which benefited our investment results as rates decreased and
spreads tightened. Our fixed maturity and short term investment income for the quarter
was $76 million and overall net investment income for the quarter was $89 million. Of the
$89 million in net investment income, we retained $67 million with the remainder being
shared with partner capital.
Our managed investment portfolio reported yield to maturity of 1.1% and duration of 2.9
years on assets of $18.1 billion, while our retained investment portfolio reported yield to
maturity of 1.4% and duration of 3.7 years on assets of $12.7 billion. We're comfortable with

Page 7 of 20



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2020-07-29

our asset allocation and duration and we'll continue to monitor economic developments
and the impact on our investment portfolio.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Kevin.

FINAL

Kevin Joseph O'Donnell
Thanks Bob. I'll start with comments on our Property segment, then move on to Casualty.
Across the board however, the common denominator for the quarter from an
underwriting perspective was that we achieved higher rates and better terms and
conditions, in both our segments in almost all lines of business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Starting with property cat, we had a disciplined renewal in Florida mid-year, executing a
proactive plan to prudently manage our net risk and renew on our preferred core
accounts. Our strategy going into the renewal was to push rate, as well as terms and
conditions. Rates were up 30% to 40% on average. We were the first call for a number of
purchases and were able to obtain private market rates, well in excess of firm order
terms on a preponderance of our deals.
We consolidated our participation to a smaller number of more meaningful relationships in
Florida, reducing the number of clients we support by about a third. For our Florida book,
we've reduced our limit, while holding premiums flat and increasing expected profit.
Overall, we reduced our southeast P&Ls both as a percentage of equity and on an
absolute basis. There were several reasons we reduced in Florida at the June 1 renewal,
affected claims handling has been a challenge for some Florida companies, especially
those relying on independent claims adjusters.
We believe that claims adjusting and subsequent repair will be made more difficult, and
therefore costly by the impact of COVID-19 and the restrictions it places on movement.
Cat models do not reflect this shift. In addition, the environment of pervasive claims fraud
remains unchanged, consequently, we chose to maintain relationships with our best
partners in Florida, those who we believe will most effectively handle post-storm claims
adjusting.
Ultimately it was our willingness to meaningfully cutback on Florida exposure that allowed
us to aggressively and successfully push for higher rates. Outside of Florida, rates across
our property segment were increasing prior to COVID-19. The crisis has accelerated these
increases. For peak zone exposure, we saw rate increases of 10% to 20%, for non-peak
exposure rates were up 5% to 10%. Even with increased rates, capacity was tied and we
fully expect this momentum to carry through the January 1 renewal.
With the new capital that we have raised, we are in an excellent position to grow into the
dislocated market. The widespread positive reaction to our capital raise and drilling strong
recognition of our fortress balance sheet have further enhanced our reputation as a firstto-all market, which can bring certainty to the renewals of even the largest and most
complicated reinsurance programs. In fact, during the quarter, we are able to provide
bespoke solutions to a number of very large cedents seeking to reduce their volatility by

utilizing our full suite of cat focused balance sheets. Renaissance Reinsurance Limited,
DaVinci, Upsilon, Vermeer, Top layer and Syndicate 1458.
As I discussed last quarter, we've been monitoring the performance of our other property
book closely and have been increasing on cat exposed risk where we believe we are
being paid appropriately. We continue to optimize our other property portfolio with the
renewal focus for this quarter being on proportional and per risk contracts, specifically
with global clients. In the second quarter, we chose not to renew several large deals that
did not meet our return hurdles; in our risk book, we increased on good programs and cut
back where rates wasn't adequate. We continue to see ample opportunity in the US,
primary E&S insurance market, where risk adjusted rates are up 20% to 30% as capacity
tightens. Terms and conditions also improved with ceding commissions down materially
especially on the most challenged programs.

Bloomberg Transcript

Shifting now to ceded retro. June 1 is the second largest renewal date for the
retrosessional protection that we purchased. As I have already mentioned, retro markets
remain dislocated. We went to market early, engaged fully with brokers and had a
successful renewal despite these challenging market conditions. Prices were up at midyear as expected, but we were in a strong position due to the $400 million Mona Lisa cat
bond issued in January. On average, the price we paid for retro increased about 20%
over 2019's mid-year program. And as expected, we purchased less limit than last year
and have higher attachment points. That said, we were happy with our portfolio and
believe that we are in a strong competitive position.
Moving now to Casualty, the second quarter is a significant renewal period for our casualty
business and we were able to execute our renewals in a precise and coordinated way.
Like Property, rates were increasing across many casualty lines, prior to COVID-19, driven
in-part by loss cost inflation trends. The increased uncertainty from COVID-19 is
accelerating these pre-existing rate increases and rate continues to surpass trend in most
lines, including general liability, umbrella, D&O, professional liability and cyber. The market
has not experienced corrections of this magnitude in almost 20 years, with rate increase
in the double-digit territory for many classes and well above what was anticipated at the
beginning of the year.
In addition, ceding commission are reducing on many programs, amplifying the impact of
rate increases. Over the year, we have focused on building strong positions on highquality casualty programs. We believe this puts us in an excellent position to benefit from
underlying rate increases as the market improves, as well as to grow on the best
programs as others got back. With respect to COVID-19, we clearly articulated our risk
appetite and our approach to exclusions. We were able to attain COVID-19 exclusion on
many deals and we're only comfortable renewing business without one.
The underlying policy contained the COVID-19 exclusion, the product was intended to
cover losses from economic recession and was appropriately priced, given the elevated
uncertainty or where exposure was minimal. In several instances where we were not able
to exclude COVID-19, we chose to walk away from business. Overall, however, we
renewed our Casualty portfolio, largely intact and with an improved margin. There has
been some speculation in the market that COVID-19 will suppress loss cost inflation in

FINAL

2020, while this is possible, we believe that the underlying dynamic that led to this
problem continue to exist and to the extent, it is currently muted loss inflation will
resurface as the pandemic subside.
In closing, we overcame a number of challenges to outperform both financially and
operationally in the second quarter. We exercised discipline at the June 1 property
renewal and continued to build a market leading casualty book. Our COVID-19 risk
remains manageable and we experienced strong gains in our investment portfolio.
Finally, we've begun the process of reopening our office which we'll begin to execute
slowly but deliberately, and with that I'll turn it over for questions.
Thank you.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Elyse
Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. My first question I guess kind of goes back Kevin to some of your
introductory remarks on you pointed to that you're seeing an improving market that could
last a couple of years before what I believe you said. So, I'm just trying to tie that together
to the timeframe that you guys -- with this over $1 billion of equity capital that you raised;
over what time period do you think that you can put that to work? Would that be 2020,
2021 -- sorry are you thinking 2021 and beyond?

A - Kevin Joseph O'Donnell
I think that's a great question. We will look to deploy in 2021. We might find some
opportunities that come up, but I should note most of the business in reinsurance is
placed in the first half of the year. So, our capital raise was really targeting and deploying
in 2021 obviously January being a very important date for that. As I mentioned that we
have kind of two levers we're going to pull; one is we're going to restructure our portfolio
and the other is we're going to grow into the opportunity. The restructuring is something
that is 100% in our control. So, as we think about what the book looks like, we can
absolutely deploy a bit on the target performance we had in 2021, and we feel confident
that where the markets are and our observations -- the rate that we're seeing that we can
deploy this in 2021 from an organic perspective, based on our performance as well.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then my follow-up there, we're obviously in the middle of wind season right
now, right and it seems like it could be an active storm season, but obviously the flipside
is, it could be an inactive storm season. So, if there's not a high level of hurricane losses,

Page 10 of 20



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2020-07-29

just based off of your view of one-one right now, do you think that there is enough
momentum, can you just give us your initial thoughts on pricing there, to put the capital to
use, if there is not an active storm season?

FINAL

A - Kevin Joseph O'Donnell
Yes. So, I think there's enough uncertainty in the market and I feel confident about where
rates are headed that even if there is relatively light number of land falling hurricanes or
no land falling hurricanes that we're still going to have strong momentum moving into
2021. I think there could be substantial further dislocation if there's additional large losses
from hurricanes in 2020.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. I appreciate the color.

A - Kevin Joseph O'Donnell
Yes, thanks.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your line is
open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Hi good morning everybody. I guess, following up on Elyse's last question, I think we're
also starting to see some capital raises and even from -- I think incumbents that are
looking to get into E&S markets, how much does that impact the longer term opportunity?
I think, in 2005 we kind of saw -- I think the raised capital kind of slowed down the rate
story. Is there a chance, if that happens this time too?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

So obviously, we're watching closely what's going on with both the capital raises into
existing companies and new formations. That doesn't affect anything that we're trying to
do other than it may change -- exactly as you're saying the environment in which we're
conducting our own. We were executing a strategy. The way we look at it is, we build our
strategy. We build our performance and we engage with our customers. We're not
competing with that capital necessarily that capital is not informing our strategy. So, as we
look at what we're trying to do -- I remain confident that regardless of the capital that's
being raised by both by existing companies and by new formations, it shouldn't dislocate

the market in one-one, but maybe beyond that you could see a little more of a

FINAL

I think that's a good point. You know, our goal is to deploy the capital we raised in 2021.
The benefit of incumbency in this business is quite high, so as we see more demand for
reinsurance we'll look to meet it with this capital and also as others look to recalibrate
their books against the risk they want to take, we'll look to grow into that. So, as this other
capital comes online, I think we're just in a stronger position and it will be up to us to
execute our strategy to make sure we're not dislocated by it.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Got it. My second question and Bob I apologize if I missed it in your comments, but what
was the source for the large realized gain this quarter? I just wouldn't have expected this
large of a number considering the relatively short duration of the portfolio?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

There is two sources, and you'll see in the supplemental, probably three quarters of it
came from our fixed income and that was a result generally of our positioning -- we
started late in the first quarter repositioning into some investment grade credit and we
saw some opportunities in the spread we continued that in April and that gave us some
benefit on that aspect of it coupled with the rebound of fixed income came back, actually
stronger than it did when it gave back in the first quarter. Equities made a significant
rebound, as we saw a significant resurgence in that over $100 million so that's the other
quarter of it, you'll see that's how we get there.

And our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. Can you just help me just clarify one point and that is, you have got to think being
optimistic about this -- about the opportunities that will last on a multiple year basis. Am I
wrong in thinking that the dislocation in the ILS market subject to this year's hurricane, but
that dislocation shouldn't take more than 12 months to (inaudible) itself with the other?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

So, I think I'm not sure how to answer that, but what I would say is there the ILS market has
suffered from a couple of years in a row of trapped capital and in many instances what
was trapped to being lost, particularly because of the developments in Michael and the
Irma. So, I think there are some bruises in that market. I think the uncertainty about
Page 12 of 20

FINAL

trapped capital and BI losses will be a awakening for many ILS capital providers as to
better understanding the types of risk that they're taking. I think the retro market being
heavily impacted again will weigh on appetites for ILS capital. And then finally, this has
been seen as a low beta asset and you're seeing that it's suddenly correlating with losses
they've taken elsewhere in their portfolios.
So, when I look at how ILS capital is allocated into this space, I think there's a lot of internal
obstacles for the ILS portfolio manager to compete against other asset classes based on
the uncertainty that they've realized over several years. So, when I think about ILS capital,
we are a believer in ILS capital, otherwise we wouldn't have built everything that we built.
But I think there are headwinds there that will certainly last through 2021 and depending
on where the -- where other markets go and how losses develop, there could be some
more interest over 2021 or the lack of interest will continue to persist.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. You know that's helpful. Thank you very much. Is there any useful rule of thumb that
we can adopt in terms of how much net written premium, the additional billion dollars of
common equity would support? I'm looking that through the lens of -- even a lot of it
would be in either reduced retro purchases or additional third-party retro writings?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin Joseph O'Donnell
Yeah. It's -- I understand your question. I think the way we look at it is, we're going to
deploy -- one of the issues is, we have the money at the holding company. We will
downstream it into different balance sheets based on how we can construct those to best
leverage the return on the capital. So, it'll be different by the amount and business mix
within each of the portfolios. So, I think, it's difficult for us to give you a 2:1, 2.5:1 or
something like that ratio to think about the capital. I'd say, where we're going to focus on
is maximizing return, and then down streaming the capital as appropriate to the balance
sheet that optimizes the new opportunity and this capital most efficiently. So sorry, I can't
be more clear, but it's not a simple answer, I was just saying what the ratio is.

Yeah. Good morning, everybody. I was trying to figure out (Technical Difficulty) that you're
optimizing the portfolio. But in the decision to cut PML, I mean I guess do you expect that I

FINAL

still -- I'm not satisfied to get the answer. It seems like there would have been a
opportunity to increase exposure here at this moment, right now as well as one-one. I
mean, you went into a little bit but I just thought there would have been more exposure in
Florida given what you're talking about rate and what not. Can you go into sort of when
you raise the capital maybe timing there was an issue there, can you walk through it a little
bit better?

A - Kevin Joseph O'Donnell
Sure. You broke up for a little bit, I think your question is why didn't we grow more in
Florida. Why did we raise the capital now, because with the rate change, it would have
been good for the portfolio?

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Or maybe, I mean maybe it was because on June 2, maybe you didn't have the capital, I
don't know. I just thought that there was a great opportunities to deploy here and you
went to cutting PML, I mean, yes you cut PML to more efficient portfolio. But here we have
an non-cat quarter with a 12%, 13% ROE, it just seems like there was an opportunity
already past that maybe wasn't taken advantage of ?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin Joseph O'Donnell
Okay. So when we looked at Florida. Firstly Florida is a much smaller part of our portfolio.
Just let me outline that with a premium for Florida currently is significantly less than 5% of
our overall premium. So growing and cutting in Florida means a lot less now than it did for
a company like us 10 years ago. Secondly, the decision not to grow was ours. So, we had
ample opportunity to put more company -- to more capital at risk and we decided that
the uncertainty in the market didn't warrant the exposure of significant more capital. We
did bring some more ILS capital to the market through the $250 million that we
commented on as raising. So, when I think about the opportunity in Florida and the
opportunity for this capital, we raised it early because we needed to have conversations
with our clients early to make sure that they understood that we were coming in on
positively positioned to grow at one-one. Whether we deploy it this year or not, is not
going to matter over the long-term our success for having raised this money. Our success
in raising money is whether we can deploy it in 2021 and keep it deployed as time passes
and make sure it's accretive.
So, we didn't put an emphasis on trying to grow in Florida in the conversations we had
with the investors, we were clear that, that is not what the target of this capital was, and
what we were doing is looking to the future to make sure that in 2021, we take advantage
of the opportunity and construct the best portfolio. So, it's nothing about our actions in
Florida -- we're different than what our expectations were and Florida is a significantly
smaller part of our portfolio than it used to be and it is kind of the way I would summarize
it.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay, that's good. And an unrelated question, do you have any approximate dollar
number for how much expenses you saved in the quarter by not being able to travel and

whatnot and how much that helped EPS?

FINAL

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Yeah. Josh, it's Bob. I talked about that in the prepared comments, it's about $5 million -lower travel -- lower travel, mostly covered that. There were some marketing and
reduced office expenses. We kind of expect that to hold through this quarter here, we
don't expect much to open up. We'll see how that develops over time, but as offices start
opening up, we'll see some of that come back, the bulk of its going to be travel until the
markets open up for business travel that probably will stay down slightly.

Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. So first I had a question on just your view on COVID losses -- to what extent do
you think you've got sort of clarity on ultimate claims and you have already booked most
of them versus just ongoing uncertainty in some lines whether it's business interruption or
something else?

A - Kevin Joseph O'Donnell
COVID-19, I think is something we'll be talking about for many quarters, as we go forward.
You know firstly it's still an ongoing -- the pandemic is ongoing as we all see in the news
every day. And I believe that this will result in very large losses has not changed. We think
the best way to handle COVID related losses is with the framework that we have, and
apply discipline to that framework. So, we think about the framework we're trying to be as
transparent as possible recognizing that this loss is going to be slow to develop and very
difficult to estimate.
So, if you think about the three categories, we go from pretty transparent and the most
direct impact from the virus to Category 2 which have less direct tie to the virus and
probably more related to the recession and the depth of the recession which is unknown
and the length of the recession is unknown. It's probably the primary driver for loss into
Category 2. And the third one is a bit of an unknown because of the challenges that will
continue, I think for many -- a significant period of time with regard to how the BI losses
are or not covered in primary policies.
So, what we're trying to do is provide a framework that's transparent and be disciplined in
our approach to that framework. So, with that, it is not possible at this time to come up
Page 15 of 20



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2020-07-29

with what a final COVID loss related number is because we believe the event to be
ongoing and it's largely dependent on the shape of the recession.

FINAL

Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

And as you think about losses for your balance sheet, are you comfortable deploying the
capital that you've raised even with that uncertainty or is it likely that you'll keep some of it
as long as there's not great visibility into what your exposure could be?

A - Kevin Joseph O'Donnell
It's a great question. I think the way we think about it is, although a number is difficult to
produce we have done extensive analysis on understanding what our exposure can be,
and then testing that exposure under -- under very extreme scenarios as well as more -more likely scenarios. So, all that said and done, I feel very, very comfortable about our
balance sheets and the exposure that we have.
The realization of exposure to loss maybe it temporally is difficult to predict, but none of it
affects our appetite for risk and none of it changes our willingness to deploy this capital.
So, when I think about the capital raise that we have, it's a 100% opportunistic looking for
the future and it is not a reflective potential uncertainty with related losses potentially
from COVID-19.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Okay. And then just lastly on expenses, you mentioned -- you gave the number out on the
travel expenses, but as we look at your expense ratio overall it was fairly low. How do you
see that sort of ramping up now that more people are back at the office and I'm
assuming, your marketing-related activity will pick up as well? Do you think the expense
ratio will stay depressed through the second half of the year or go back to more of a rate
that it was at in 1Q?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Yes Jimmy, two things on that one. One, is we expect the COVID-related reductions just
because we're not working in the office that will stay around for a while because we don't
expect everything to get back to business as usual. But more importantly, the drivers, if
you look back over our history, I talked about we leverage our operational base extremely
well, relative to the gross or the net premium written, and I talked about that. So we do
step investments, we expect over time as we deploy more capital out there, that volumes
increase, we'll have to spend more on the infrastructure. But, if you look back over time,
you'll see we've demonstrated a strong track record for leveraging our operating
platform.

Our next question comes from the line of Phil Stefano from Deutsche Bank. Your line is
open.

FINAL

Q - Phil Stef ano

{BIO 18965951 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks again good morning. It feels like messaging earlier in the year, may have
been around the potential to withhold some capacity, at least into the mid-year renewals
with an expectation that there might be new purchases of reinsurance, just to help
manage volatility and the COVID uncertainty. Does it feel like that demand came through
or is it beginning to come through or -- have the conversations you had feel like this might
be more of a 2021 event, which is kind of helping to steer where the equity raise can be
put into play?

A - Kevin Joseph O'Donnell
Yeah. As we said, I think, in the last call trying to empathize, we think that the COVID is -the pandemic is ongoing and with that, we believe that the losses will emerge slowly. All
that's kind of at the lens in which we're looking at the market, we think the opportunity for
us to deploy this capital is in 2021. Should there be additional purchasing, we've been in
good contact with our customers and if they are looking to supplement their purchases in
2020, we're having those discussions. But I don't want to leave with a false impression
that we're going to deploy this in 2020, our goal is to deploy it in 2021.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Phil Stef ano

{BIO 18965951 <GO>}

Understood.. I guess my follow-up question will be, was there a reaction from the
ventures capital partners in response to the equity raise, and I guess, part of the wonders
whether they view the increase in pricing and maybe to an extent them being crowed out
as you have the ability to do additional business yourself on the heels of the equity raise?
Maybe that's an unfair correlation I'm trying to draw, but just curious has the conversations
with the capital partners changed in anyway?

A - Kevin Joseph O'Donnell
Yeah, that's a great question. I've spoken to all our largest investors over the last couple
of weeks, and we've spoken to all our investors over the last few weeks. So, firstly if you
think we raised $250 million in the quarter and deployed it, so we are continuing to bring
risk to third party capital. Going into the one-one renewal, the way I think about our
partner capital is that they have a right of incumbency on the deals that they're on, just as
we do.
So, when I look at how we are going to structure the portfolios, we were not going to
derisk them to deploy the capital that we have. What we're going to do is, is optimize
their portfolio against their rate environment and the opportunity and then build our
portfolios with the new equity. The one likely area where the risk will be underwritten in a
material way is in the retro market and in the aggregate market.
The vehicle which mostly takes that risk for us is Upsilon. So, I anticipate that the way
Upsilon will be structured, consistent with the mandate for the risk that it targets will be
less appealing to buyers than other vehicles that we have, and with that if there is a shift
Page 17 of 20



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2020-07-29

of risk, I think it's more likely to come from Upsilon than it is from certainly Vermeer,
DaVinci, Top Layer and some of our other balance sheets.

FINAL

So, we'll constantly look at how we can best match efficient capital with desirable risk. But,
we will not look -- and it's not our objective to cherry pick the investors that we have. We
give them right -- right to participate alongside in capital raises and they are true partners
to us in the risk that we take.

Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is
open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. My first question, I guess Kevin, goes back to
something that you just answered. So, in response to the capital you said at holding
company and you would downstream it depending upon where you can get the best
returns on that capital. But, is the desire to use most of the equity raise on your own
balance sheet or is it also depending upon opportunities, you could use some of that
capital in partnership with some of your venture capital?

A - Kevin Joseph O'Donnell
Yeah. It is a good question. I think, it could to be a little of everything. So, I anticipate -- if
you look at our percentage on our vehicles and you look at the size of the capital raised,
most of it will be deployed on our fully owned balance sheets. That said, if there are
opportunities to increase DaVinci's participation in the market or others, we'll look to
deploy alongside our partners into those vehicles. So, when I think about it, I would think
about it as mostly on our owned balance sheets. That said, we will also look for ways in
which we can bring more risk to -- DaVinci is probably the most likely one and we can
certainly continue to invest more in Upsilon should that vehicle -- should we want to right
size that vehicle.
The issue is what's written on some of these will likely shift in structure where the risk
appetite of the vehicle may not be as defined -- it may not be as natural a fit for the
vehicle and with that when we limited it, which has the broadest appetite is a likely home
for it.

Okay that's helpful. And then my second question, so on the TMR side, you guys had
called out right this is the first quarter we annualized the deal so the non-renewal of some
of the business had an impact on the growth within specialty casualty. I know when you
guys announced the deal, you had laid out some figures for what you expect it to retain of
the book business, but then my sense is, is we've had conversations, you got
incrementally more positive on some of the business that you would thought you might
not renew. So, can you just give us a sense of how much of that business needs to not
renew like, as we think about the modeling over the next three quarters within that
specialty business?

A - Kevin Joseph O'Donnell
Yeah, I'll give you back an answer. We did start last year -- we looked at -- we walked you
down for about a $1.2 billion in premium down to about $700 million is what we said we
thought we would be able to renew. Going through the books, getting to know the terms,
getting to know the understanding and the relationships gave us a much more favorable
view of some of the books we were unsure of at the time.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, we did outperform our expectations on the renewal of the TMR book. We did
probably well over $800 million versus the $700 million which we felt very comfortable
with. But having said that, there's a strong element that we did not renew, and I talked
about our implied growth was more of $100 million than it was $20 million -- things we
didn't renew Elyse was like auto, some things like that, drove it down and general liability
you'll see that coming down on pieces of it. But we generally renewed a lot more of the
book than we felt, got to know it better and we feel strong with what we've underwritten.

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Yes. The good news about having the $700 million target and then getting [ph] $830
million [ph] is that we found more good business than we originally hoped and that was
only added to our confirmation, so that was a good deal for us to engage in.
