Current Quarter: 8041.500

P&C Underwriting Income
• P&C underwriting income of $824mm benefited from contributions from current accident year results, and
positive prior-year reserve releases
• Both our P&C combined ratio of 88.4% and our current accident year combined, excluding CATs, of 88.1% were
excellent
• Y-over-y CAT losses were about flat
• On the back of strong cash flow, net investment income of $890mm was up 4%

Book and Tangible Book per Share
• Book and tangible book per share were essentially flat in the quarter, impacted by the mark from a rise in interest
rates and foreign exchange
• Excluding the impact of interest rate on the mark which, given we’re a buy and hold investor, will eventually
amortize back to us over approximately a four-year period, book and tangible were up about 0.7% and 2%
respectively
• Our annualized core operating ROE in Q2 was 9.8%
• Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, CATs and prior-period development

Market Conditions
• Turning to growth in market conditions, for the company overall, P&C net premium revenue growth was 5.6%
for the quarter, or 6.1% excluding Agriculture, with foreign exchange having a 1.5 point benefit
• A number of growth-related initiatives that are only possible because of the capabilities created by today’s Chubb
contributed to our growth this quarter
• And I will elaborate a bit as I go on

North America
• Commercial P&C pricing for the business we wrote continued to improve in the U.S. and certain territories
outside the U.S
• In North America, for example, rates overall were up 3% vs. 1.9% last quarter and 1% in Q4
• So, the direction of momentum in price firming that we’ve been seeing now for several quarters continued
• At the same time, our renewal retention rates were simply outstanding
• In fact, across our entire North America commercial and personal P&C franchise, renewal retention, as measured
by premium, was over 95%, recognition of the quality and the compelling nature of Chubb

U.S
• In our U.S. major account retail and E&S wholesale division, premiums were up almost 4%
• Excluding merger-related underwriting actions which are concentrated here, net premiums were up 6%

• As I noted last quarter, merger-related actions are now mostly behind us, and of the approximately $150mm, over
60% have already occurred

Renewal Retention
• For major accounts, our renewal retention in the quarter was over 96%, while new business was up 29%
• Let me give you some examples of both rate and its movement during the quarter in major accounts
• Again, for the business we wrote, rates overall were up 5.2%
• That compares to 1.9% for Q1 and 1% in Q4
• Property rates in major accounts were up 21.5%
• Casualty rates in risk management primary casualty were up 1%, while in U.S.-exposed general and specialty
casualty, rates were up about 5%

Professional Lines Book
• Rates for major account professional lines were up approximately 2% with primary and first excess D&O up
2.6%, so moving in the right direction
• For perspective, of our total U.S. professional lines book, which overall runs quite well, 15% represents those
areas that are stressed and require corrective actions, which we have been taking, namely, certain areas of
public D&O and certain classes of professional liability for financial institutions
• The balance, or 85% of the book, runs well

Middle Market
• Now, let’s turn to our North American middle market and small commercial business, where net premiums were
up almost 4.5%, and new business was up 26%, the best growth we’ve seen from this business since early 2016
• In middle market and small commercial, about a quarter of the new business came from growth initiatives put in
place since the merger

Premium Revenue Growth
• In middle market premium revenue growth, premium revenue grew about 3.5%
• Overall renewal retention was 90%, a full 2 points better than prior quarter
• Middle market P&C rates overall, excluding comp, were up 1.7%, and exposure growth added an additional
1.2%
• Property rates were up about 1.5%
• Casualty-related rates were up about 3%, while package was flat
• Comp rates were down 4.1 points, while comp-related exposure was up about 4 points
• So, the net impact for middle market comp was essentially flat
• Middle market professional lines rates were up with public D&O up 6.3% and private not-for-profit D&O up
over 2%

• In middle market, rates in the quarter, with the exception of comp, were the strongest we have achieved in
several years, continuing a positive trend

U.S. Small Commercial Business
• Growth in our U.S. small commercial business continued to accelerate in the quarter, albeit from a relatively
small base
• Net premiums were up 27%
• Based on the growth velocity over the last few quarters, we expect this business by year-end to have an annual
run rate of over $400mm in premium
• Over the next three to five years, it should be in the multi-billion dollar range
• And importantly, you wouldn’t be seeing that revenue, if it wasn’t for today’s Chubb

Personal Lines Business
• In our North America personal lines business, net premiums were up 6.4% in the quarter
• Adjusting for an accounting policy action, growth was closer to 3%
• Retention remained very strong at over 96%
• We continued to secure a better mix of business in personal lines with new business and renewals skewing
towards true high net worth or affluent customers as opposed to the mass affluent, which is our target customer,
given the richness of our coverage and services

Clients Access
• We are investing to digitally enable the customer service experience in this business
• For example, we introduced a mobile app that gives clients access to a variety of digitized services, including
insurance ID cards
• The ability to contact their agent
• Notifications that alert them of approaching weather events such as wildfires and hurricanes, so they can take
advantage of our prevention and defense services
• And an innovative Chubb at the Wheel function that tracks driver behavior and helps clients, particularly teens
be better, safer drivers
• We’re introducing additional functionality to the app every few months and this will become even more exciting
over time

Digital Marketing
• Another dimension is our digital marketing to grow our personal lines business by penetrating territories, where
we are underrepresented with target customers who are underserviced by mass market carriers
• We have digital marketing initiatives underway to attract prospects to Chubb and to independent agents and
brokers to help them build their business with leads and improve their service capabilities
• These are all good examples of the company investing to distinguish itself in the marketplace

Growth Rate
• Turning to our overseas general insurance operations, net premiums written for our international retail business
were up 10.7% or 6% in constant dollars
• As I mentioned last quarter, our growth rate outside the U.S. is increasing, and should continue to do so as the
year goes along
• Asia Pacific and Latin America both grew over 11% in the quarter, with foreign exchange contributing another
3% to 5%, while the Continent was up over 3%, and UK/Ireland was flat

Net Premium
• Net premiums for our international middle market and small commercial business, which is a major initiative,
given our capabilities today, grew 7% in the quarter in constant dollar on a base that’s now about $700mm
• Expanded distribution in product, industry expertise and technology capabilities are just some of the
complementary strengths that we brought together to grow this business, which is really beginning to take hold
and should continue to gain momentum
• Growth, in particular, is being driven by our business in Asia and Latin America, the key focus regions for us,
where net premiums were up 15% in the quarter

International Performance
• International A&H premiums were up 6.5% in constant dollars, driven by a 11% growth in Asia Pac, while the
international personal lines growth was up 10%, driven by a standout performance in Latin America with
growth of 25%

Latin America
• Speaking of Latin America, in the quarter, we announced a long-term distribution agreement with Citibanamex, a
leading financial institution in Mexico
• Under this long-term agreement, together, we will distribute, on an exclusive basis, to their customers, Chubb’s
non-life insurance products through 1,500 branches in a variety of digital and direct marketing channels
• The agreement encompasses a broad variety of personal and commercial P&C coverages for the bank’s 12mm
individual customers and 400,000 small to medium enterprises
• This is another example of an important business partnership made possible because of our growing digital
capabilities, which were a key consideration for Citi during their due diligence of us

Pricing Conditions
• As for pricing conditions outside the U.S., rates in our international retail and London wholesale businesses
varied by line and region, and by country within region
• Overall rates were up 4%, property up 8%, financial lines up 6%, and casualty and marine flat

• In total, our global A&H business had an excellent quarter with net premiums up nearly 9% or 6.1% in constant
dollars
• In addition to the strong contribution from international that I just mentioned, A&H net premiums grew about
8.5% in North America
• Meanwhile, in our Asia-focused international life insurance business, net premiums and deposits were up 19% in
the quarter, and importantly, earnings grew about 170% to $25mm
• John Keogh, Paul Krump, Juan Andrade and Ed Clancy can provide further color on the quarter including current
market conditions and pricing trends

Revenue Growth
• In closing, we are achieving improved premium revenue growth in many of our businesses around the world
• Several of which wouldn’t have been possible, but for an organization that was created with so many
complementary capabilities, we’re continuing to achieve positive rate change momentum in a number of
businesses, which is important, so that we are in an adequate risk-adjusted rate of return

Distribution Agreements
• Lastly, our digital capabilities are advancing in many corners of the world
• We’re making steady and substantial progress from signing major distribution agreements to digitally enhancing
customer service to reimagining product and customer experience
• The scale and the capabilities of Chubb have made our digital efforts, including the level of investment, possible
• In sum, our organization is running on all cylinders, and we’re optimistic about our ability to continue to perform
at a high level

Financial Highlights
Capital and Share Repurchasing
• Our balance sheet and overall financial position remains strong, with total capital of $64B.
• Operating cash flow in the quarter was very strong, totaling $1.65B.
• Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $663mm to shareholders, including $339mm in
dividends and $324mm in share repurchases

Debt
• During the quarter, we also redeemed $1B of hybrid securities in April, and we repaid $600mm of senior debt

• Net investment income for the quarter was $890mm, slightly above our expected range due to the higher private
equity distributions

• Our expected quarterly investment income run rate remains in the range of $875mm to $885mm with an upward
trend as the year continues

Book Value per Share
• Book value per share was essentially unchanged and tangible book value per share increased 0.5% in the quarter
• Both were negatively impacted by foreign exchange losses and unrealized losses on the investment portfolio
caused by rising interest rates
• Foreign exchange had $457mm after-tax negative impact on book value and $200mm after-tax negative impact
on tangible book value
• Realized and unrealized losses on the investment portfolio were $407mm after-tax

Pre-Tax Net Catastrophe Losses
• Pre-tax net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $211mm, principally from U.S. weather-related events, and
were in line with our expected level for the quarter
• We had positive prior period development in the quarter of $191mm pre-tax or $158mm after-tax
• This included $236mm of pre-tax favorable development, $200mm of which was split approximately 70% from
long tail lines, principally for 2014 and prior accident years, and 30% from short tail lines, with another $36mm
related to the 2017 CAT events
• The favorable development was offset by $45mm of pre-tax adverse development related to our runoff non-A&E
casualty exposures, which are included in corporate

Net Loss Reserves
• Net loss reserves increased about $200mm in the quarter, adjusting for foreign exchange
• The paid-to-incurred ratio was 97% in the quarter
• Adjusting for PPD, CAT losses and agriculture, the ratio was 91%
• Our P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding CATs, increased 60BPS to 88.1%, due in part to a
y-over-y increase in certain large structured transactions in our North America commercial insurance business,
which increased the loss ratio 1 percentage point and decreased the expense ratio 70BPS

Core Operating Effective Tax Rate
• Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.8%
• As a reminder, our annual 13% to 15% range reflects the variability of where catastrophe losses and prior period
development occurs
• We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15%

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
<Q - Kai Pan>: So, first question on the – just following up on the professional lines, if my number is correct, you
have about 10% overall premiums in U.S. professional surety. You said about 15% in distressed areas, so its overall

impact probably is only less than 2% of your portfolio. I just wonder if that math is correct. And how do you feel the
overall rising in turmoil, rising social inflation impact your loss PEG, as well as the action you’re taking to mitigate
them?
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Yeah, so, Kai, first of all, I’m not sure I quite got everything you said because you said
surety, and mentioned surety and profession – our professional lines book is made up of substantially E&O, D&O, our
cyber businesses within there, we have surety. And surety, by the way, is a separate line for us from professional lines,
so I don’t know what you’re mixing together, and so that’s – all that math, we’re going to take it offline.
When it comes to the question of the – which I was really making the point that – I hear all this about other liability
claims made and conflating it to D&O. And when we have talked about D&O and – public D&O and some of the
issues around it, what I thought was important was to put it all in perspective for everyone that, number one, the part
we’re talking about is 15% of our professional lines business. By the way, other liability claims made is made up of a
whole lot more than professional lines. We have environmental liability within there, and a number of other lines as
well go in there. So, I was really trying to create perspective.
On your question, our loss PEGs and our loss ratios that we select, and that we book, they reflect the environment as
we see the environment to be. So, if there are trends in the environment around what you’re calling social inflation,
which is an interesting euphemism to me, all of that is reflected in the loss PEGs that we have right now and in the loss
ratios that we book. Our underwriting actions that we have been taking that relate around portfolio management as well
as pricing have been underway for some time within that business, and they continue, period.
<Q - Kai Pan>: Okay. That’s great. I was referring to in the merger, like a slide deck, you combined U.S. professional
lines surety as a 10% overall premium. So, you didn’t break down what is exactly U.S. professional lines. That’s the
point I was trying to make.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Surety is not within our professional lines number.
<Q - Kai Pan>: Okay. Great. Then, my second question is on the y-over-y increase about 130BPS underlying
combined ratio in North America commercial P&C, about 70BPS coming from those large structured transactions. I
was hoping you can explain a little bit what are those, and will the impact be like sustainable for the next three more
quarters. And also the rest 60 basis point deterioration, what’s behind those? Are those non-CAT losses, or other
factors?
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Well, the 60BPS – I mean, first of all, let me take that part first, and then I want to talk
about the – just a minute. The combined ratio that we run is simply world-class, it’s outstanding. And at the same time,
you know what the rate environment is, you know what loss cost trends are, and you have a sense of that. And so it’s
just straight math that we’re – that you have to raise your loss ratios in areas where you’re not getting rate and where
loss cost trends and loss ratio continues to rise. But the margins are extremely healthy, so when I look at 0.6% in that, I
think it’s pretty good, especially given the work we do around underwriting, and mix change, and growing other areas
more quickly that have an interesting combined ratio signature to them, to mitigate and keep it to a modest level like
that.
When it comes to the large transaction, let me put this in perspective for everybody. Part of major accounts, which is
our risk management business – within major accounts is our risk management business. We’re the largest provider of
services to large corporations that self-insure their comp and casualty exposures. We provide substantial risk transfer
excess coverages, and all of the services around the self-funded portions. It’s a complex and it’s a large business. We’re
the best at it and have been in it for many years. It’s a core part of our franchise.
By its nature, it has always had elements of lumpiness. Think about it. On one hand, large accounts which renew
periodically with large premiums, we have good persistency, but you win some, you lose some now and again. By its
nature, accounts also – this business also has, and these accounts have, one-off transactions. We write these just about
every quarter. Some quarters, they’re bigger than others. This quarter, we wrote more than usual because of a larger
transaction, and that’s what we disclosed.

And, by the way, we disclosed it only for the purpose of telling you the impact on loss ratio and expense ratio in the
quarter. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have mentioned it, simply because it’s part of what we normally do and write, period.
<Q - Kai Pan>: Okay. Thank you for that. Before I let you go, I just want to say best wishes for Evan for your
retirement. Thank you.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Did you say best wishes for my retirement?
[indiscernible]
<A - Helen Wilson>: Not there yet.
<Q - Kai Pan>: I hope not.
<Q - Elyse B. Greenspan>: My first question, I appreciate all the disclosure on the pricing environment. As we think
forward from here and in Q3, we start to annualize when we really started to see pricing momentum on the commercial
lines side next year. I guess I’m just curious for some of your thoughts on, we don’t have a large CAT year this year,
and in addition, if interest rates continue to rise, do you think that pricing momentum can continue to improve from the
improved levels that you guys saw in Q2?
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Elyse, first of all, pricing didn’t begin to move until Q4. It really wasn’t Q3. It was very,
very modest in Q3. It was fourth quarter. So I think that’s the first point I’d make.
Secondly, look, I’m going to speak in a rational way, and markets aren’t always rational. The pricing trend we see
should continue, and we will continue to, as a core part of our strategy for Chubb’s business, to push on that.
Understand that the market remains competitive, and where it’s about capacity, which is a lot of the market and a lot of
the players who talk, pricing is not very interesting. It’s stable to slightly up or down. But so much of the business – so
much of what Chubb does is about more than capacity. They engage with Chubb because of capabilities and service
quality.
And then, we also have substantial portions of our business that are not subject to the same cycle, commercial cycle. In
my mind, we’re going to continue to insist on achieving price that is adequate to achieve a reasonable risk adjusted
return in those classes where we need to. And I think we’re doing a pretty good job of it, and I don’t see at the moment
that ameliorating.
<Q - Elyse B. Greenspan>: Okay. Thank you. And then, in terms of inflation, we’ve also heard some discussion about
Paris and international issues potentially leading to higher inflation as well. What’s your just view on that one as well?
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Well, tariffs are a complex subject. They have an interesting timing to them. I mean, first
of all, many, as you know, right now are reporting earnings and people are saying already, wow, I don’t see an impact
to the tariffs. So many goods are purchased and contracts are signed so long in advance, and so to find its way into the
stream of commerce, into the pipeline in a meaningful way, takes time, number one.
Number two, what is the actual dollar amount of tariffs today, vs. what’s being talked about, relative to the size of the
economy and relative to the size of exports and imports? It’s not a large percentage. And it is on goods, mostly on
goods. So the inflation impact, if it’s going to occur, should be relatively modest, will occur over time, and let’s see
what happens in trade overall. The tariffs aren’t for the purpose of simply tariffs for their own sake. They’re part of a
strategy to achieve what the President would say is more fair and balanced trade. We’ll see what kind of outcome that
leads to.
<Q - Charles Gregory Peters>: In your opening comments, you talked about operating cash flow. And if we look at
the consolidated financial highlights table for H1 2018, it looks like operating cash flow was up 33%. Perhaps you
could provide a little more color behind that.
<A - Philip V. Bancroft>: Yeah, I would say there’s a couple of things. We had very strong cash flow from
underwriting as part of our operating cash flow, and there were a lower level of tax payment. It’s just a timing, but the
tax payments were down substantially, which contributed substantially to the higher cash flow in the period.

<Q - Charles Gregory Peters>: So, looking at that same table, Philip, the combined ratio was actually up for the six
months 2018 vs. 2017. You said the underwriting is better?
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Do not mix up incurred loss and paid loss.
<A - Philip V. Bancroft>: Right.
<Q - Charles Gregory Peters>: Got it.
<A - Philip V. Bancroft>: So, it really is on a cash basis.
<Q - Charles Gregory Peters>: Got it, right.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: You can take that offline, if you want to get into accounting.
<Q - Charles Gregory Peters>: Yes. No, no, no, that’s fair. You talked a little bit about the digital efforts both in your
press release and your commentary. And there’s a lot in the marketplace around emerging technology ideas around
distribution, potential AI. And I was wondering if you could just give us an update on how you’re approaching your
global IT budget this year vs. last year and what your view is on all these emerging distribution ideas that are coming
into the marketplace.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Well, I’ll give you what we’ve said publicly. We spend about $1B a year on IT, and that’s
a substantial amount of money. A very substantial – a large portion of that is in new development and – both in terms
of improving legacy technology, in terms of infrastructure, for cloud-enabled and anytime-anywhere access in
processing, and in terms of new front-end capabilities, including marketing, sales, analytics, data scraping, all of the
things that would go into – API development, all the things that would go into connecting externally, both with
platforms and directly to consumer and to enable the customer experience, because it’s all about the customer
experience.
We are doing that on a global scale. We’re doing it in Asia, Latin America, and the U.S. predominantly. And that is,
we’re in – we’ve been working at it for a number of years, and it is all part of digitizing this organization, so that it
thrives in the digital age, period, just like anything has to thrive in the digital age, including you as an individual. You
remain analog, you are history.
<Q - Charles Gregory Peters>: Got it. And just as a follow-up to that point, when I think about what you guys have
spent in terms of stuff around the mobile technology, do you think that’s going to be more relevant in personal lines
than commercial lines? Or do you think mobile technology’s going to have a role in the commercial lines business?
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Well, it already does in the commercial lines business. It is personal, it is small
commercial, it is micro commercial, and it’s moving up into the middle market, and – whereas the large account
business is more about the anytime-anywhere servicing of the business and engineering, which is important to all the
constituents, from individual to large corporate, that will be revolutionized over time with IoT capabilities that are
installed fundamentally everywhere, from the building to goods and transit to your home.
<Q - Yaron Kinar>: My first question relates to the North America commercial business. So, I think you’d answered
Kai’s question about the other factors driving the accident year loss ratio up. Do you think with the rate increases that
you’ve achieved so far and what you see in the pipeline, are lost cost trends being more offset now by these rate
increases? Should we see less of that pressure point coming from loss cost trends?
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: It’s going to vary by line of business. And it’s all about casualty-related lines, and it will
vary by line. In some lines, I think the rate of increase is enough to keep pace with loss cost trends. I think in some
other areas, it’s not; and in some of those, underwriting actions and how we manage portfolio will help to balance that
out, and in some it won’t. So it’s a combination, it’s a mixed bag. You can’t simply generalize.
<Q - Yaron Kinar>: Okay. And if you had a crystal ball that you’d be wanting to share with us...
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: No.

<Q - Yaron Kinar>: Okay, okay. Going to the professional liability line for a second...
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Hey, buddy, if I had a crystal ball, I wouldn’t be doing this.
<Q - Yaron Kinar>: Well, you may be doing this and enjoying it even more.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: There could be that, too.
<Q - Yaron Kinar>: Going to the professional liability block for a second, so you said that about 15% of it required
some corrective action right now. How does that compare to where that block was a year ago? And based on the data
you have in front of you today, do you expect that 15% to increase or decrease, stay relatively the same over the next
year?
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: We expect it to decrease. And it – how I compare a year ago to today? Slightly down. And
I expect next year it will be lower.
<Q - Jay Gelb>: I was hoping to focus on a couple of emerging issues. The first one is on the Japan floods, which
seem to be among the worst on record. Just trying to think about what the insurance and reinsurance exposure might be
for Chubb there.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Right – look, it’s still emerging, and we don’t know with certainty, but we don’t expect it
to be a significant event to Chubb.
<Q - Jay Gelb>: Okay. That’s helpful. And then, potentially a tougher one...
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: From what I hearing so far, relatively modest.
<Q - Jay Gelb>: I appreciate that. An emerging area of asbestos risk appears to be coming from talc-related exposure,
including J&J having a nearly $5B judgment against it within the past few weeks. I’d like your perspective on whether
you think this as a new area of potential asbestos risk for the industry, and perhaps what it could mean for Chubb.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: First, Jay, let me ask you a question, did your mother use baby powder on you when you
were little?
<A - Philip V. Bancroft>: Getting very personal here.
<Q - Jay Gelb>: [indiscernible]
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Look, it – asbestos has had – there have been new targets of – cohorts of business every
few years, so that’s not a new trend or new things in the industry, number one. You look at – it could have been
congoleum manufacturers who made floor tiles. It was those who made motors and small motors, as you know, and so
it was determined they had asbestos.
So, this gets a headline because it’s big, it’s baby powder. There is science right now, there’s facts, as it would seem,
that are both sides, so who knows? And I’m not going to speculate about it. We see what you see and read what you
read, and we’ll just see how the facts emerge. But there wasn’t – in the grand theme, when I think around asbestos, that
did not startle me. And by the way, this about baby powder has been around. This is not like it just came up in the last
few months. This has been out there for a reasonably long period of time.
<Q - Jay Gelb>: Okay. So, it doesn’t sound like this issue is something that’s keeping you up at night.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: No. I got – my brain – no, it’s crowded – that’s crowded out with a lot of other things.
<Q - Jay Gelb>: Okay. All right. My final question, if I think about how Chubb has done kind of a soft quantification
of excess capital, I’m coming up with $4B to $5B of excess capital. Should we think about how that might get
deployed over some period of time, if acquisition opportunities aren’t available?

<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: There will be – there are organic growth opportunities. We’re in the risk business. There
are acquisitions to complement what we do organically, and we are patient, and if we have surplus capital at a point
that is beyond what we and our board feel is prudent to have for both risk and to grow the company, then we will return
it to shareholders in some form. And I think you see that since the beginning of Q2, we’ve brought back approximately
$360mm worth of shares at, I might say, a price of about $132. And had we bought back in Q1, it would have been at a
higher price.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: We just finished with Jay Cohen. We’re going to Paul Newsome, I think.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Different Jay.
<A - Philip V. Bancroft>: That was Jay Gelb.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Oh, that was Jay Gelb, sorry.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: That’s okay. We get confused – there’s worse people I could be confused with, so. I had a
question on the life earnings. We’ve had top line growth for some time. This quarter, we actually saw the earnings
begin to pick up pretty noticeably. I’m wondering really what’s behind that.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Well, I just want to give an overarching on that, and then let Phil add to that. We have
grown this business fundamentally from dust. And we’ve been saying for some time that by the nature of the life
business, when you’re growing it, particularly agency business, you’re growing distribution, and you’re growing the
premium pretty rapidly. And by its nature, the way the economics work in that business, you’re plowing back in, and
until it reaches – your in-force reaches a certain scale, that – the earnings from the in-force begin to emerge and that
begins to overwhelm what you’re plowing back in to keep growing the business. And so we said that it was hitting a
point of maturity, and that you’d begin to see earnings emerge, and that is exactly what is taking place. It didn’t
surprise us. Go ahead, Phil. Go ahead.
<A - Philip V. Bancroft>: The only thing I’d add to that is that we had very strong growth in Asia Pac, and we saw
higher investment income because we’ve begun to grow the assets under management. So, I think the point that Evan
makes together with that is what’s creating the growth. In addition, our combined North America group also has some
earnings momentum.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: But what I mentioned in my commentary was the international life business.
<A - Philip V. Bancroft>: Yes, I’m talking about the overall life.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Yeah.
<Q - Jon Paul Newsome>: A couple of questions. One, I wanted to briefly revisit the sort of sustainability of price
increases. I think, in Q1, Chubb was suggesting that, sort of, month by month, you were seeing modest acceleration,
and that gave us a lot of confidence that as we get into Q2, we’d see even more. Has that sort of month by month
improvement in the pricing environment continued through Q2?
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Yeah, well, June was the best month of the quarter.
<Q - Jon Paul Newsome>: So, that’s good news. And then, my second question is a little bit more broad. I’ve got
some smaller companies and such that are arguing that technology has changed such that a lot of the outsourced
technology is just as good as the larger companies can produce on their own, which suggests that for the bigger
companies, that the benefits of scale have reduced because of changes in the technology over time. Do you think that
that’s true, or have any view on that topic?
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Well, yeah. First of all, whether you build the technology or you buy it – and most of it
you’re buying, but you’re not buying, like, simply something ready-made out of a box. You’re buying different
components of technology, and you’re putting them together to make them work. And by the way, whether you build it
or you buy it, it costs money. And so how much do you have that you can afford to spend? And by the way, on what
scale can you do it? Across how many geographies, how many customer areas and product areas can you do it? And

then, data. Who’s got data? And by the way, your ability to acquire data, and your ability to – again, tools, put in place
tools that can help you gain insight into that data. I think, well, if you don’t have scale, sure, you have a strategy, and
sure, you can thrive, whether it’s analog or it’s digital, but you get to a certain size and I’ll tell you what, scale matters.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: A couple of mine were asked, but let’s go to some other ones. Evan, the Citi deal you
mentioned in Mexico, can you just give us – I know you mentioned the number of branches and so forth, but can you
give us some perspective, would this be one of your top three relationships in Mexico or some other way to give us a
sense of the magnitude of this.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Well, I can tell you pretty clearly it’s our largest single relationship in Mexico.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Got it.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Ian, the way to put it, Chubb is the second largest non-life writer now in Mexico. We were
number seven only a few years ago. We have a, what continues to be good growth business, and with – that is stable
with good combined ratios. It’s an agency-driven business, and brokerage and direct marketing. We have, like, 62
branches across the country. We have thousands of agents. And that’s the predominant source of the business.
Now, what we’ve added is a substantial relationship that will complement that, open up a whole new channels of
opportunity for us. With our product set, we’re the second largest auto writer in the country, as an example. They have
many auto customers. We write small commercial. We write surety, we write accident and health, we write middle
market commercial. All of that will now also be offered through their branches, and through digital and direct
marketing to their customers. So, it adds another dimension to what is a great business.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: That sounds great. And is there opportunity to do something similar on the A&H side?
Obviously, a lot of this is direct marketed as well. Or is that a different channel, or is there opportunity to do that over
time too?
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: In the Citibanamex?
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Yeah.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Oh, it includes all of our accident and health.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Okay, I’m sorry. I thought you said...
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: That will be distributed – that’s distributed digitally, that’s distributed with – digital. Most
digital, by the way, you start the transactions digitally, and in many instances, you complete them with a phone call –
with a phone. They want to talk...
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Right, right, right.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: ...whether it’s small commercial or it’s whatever. So you’re mixing and matching direct
channels plus through their branches.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Got it.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: So, all of our accident and health is actually a core product area in the strategy with
Citibanamex.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Perfect. And just one on the large account business, the major accounts. And I guess,
normally, I’d be very happy to hear very high retention, very strong new business. I guess my one question is, if we
could dive a little deeper and just sort of where that’s coming from, and I guess my concern is, given emerging loss
trends in liability and, to some extent, professional, maybe I can make a case that large accounts – and just given some
of the outsized jury awards and stuff we’re seeing, maybe it’s a good time to, frankly, be pruning a large account book
and being a little bit more careful on who you’re willing to insure at this point. Can you give us some sense of how
you’re managing that with still being able to grow and keep our retention?

<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Yeah, we’re not – I think you’re conflating a whole bunch of different things in there.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Okay.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Casualty loss trends have been behaving pretty well. And Paul O’Connell could give a
little bit on that, but what we see is frequency trends have actually been down, and severity trends have been reasonably
modest. So, we haven’t seen some pickup adversely in casualty. We have – we talked about public D&O, and I’ll just
put that to the side. The one thing you should know and remember, what I said is, this quarter [indiscernible] our U.S.
exposed large account casualty, we’ve got 5 points of rate. We’re pressing on rate and terms. By the way, you write
excess casualty in large account business, it’s about attachment point.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Right.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: I know the terms is much or more than it is about simply price or rate. We’re underwriters.
We measure this all the time. And we have a – with all that said, in our underwriting discipline, by the way, we’re
presented an awful lot of business to write that we just don’t win, we don’t have a chance to win because of terms and
rates. You offer me a book of business that I know vs. a business I don’t know, so renewal retention, a customer I know
and that I have on the books is the better customer.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: For sure. For sure. I guess my premise was, it seems like we’re seeing social inflation start to
pick up, yeah.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: It’s sort of like, if we don’t like the rate, if we can’t make an underwriting profit, and we
don’t like the rate, we’re walking away.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Oh, of course, understood, absolutely, absolutely. I was just thinking more – the reason I
was asking more on the large account side was, it seems like we’re seeing this pickup in sort of nine-figure jury awards
nationwide. And again, I know a lot is anecdotal, but it does seem like there’s a pickup, and I would’ve thought large
account would be the place where there’d be the most concern just because of the limits involved for the small to mid.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: We’re not – what you’re seeing anecdotally, we’re not seeing on a portfolio basis.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Okay.
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: And we write large – and I’m trying to relate to it. We write large limit – high limit excess
out of Bermuda, and that’s behaving reasonably well, [ph] although (56:45) it has a long tail. We’re writing in our U.S.
casualty business, in our excess in particular, because you’re not talking primary now. We write within the first
$100mm of limit, and typically we’re putting out $15mm to $25mm net, so you don’t have huge limits exposed to those
great one-offs. And then, by the way, what you see as a jury award and what you see as ultimate settlement, it’s even –
keep that in mind, too, Ian.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Just a brief question, administrative expenses on a y-over-y basis grew more than in Q1, and I
was hoping that you could talk a little bit about what’s driving that.
<A - Philip V. Bancroft>: Nothing, nothing in particular. Just normal operations, and then I assume you adjusted for
foreign exchange, when you did that.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Yeah, to the best of my ability. Okay. Second question, can you talk a little bit about workers’
compensation in the United States? I mean, we’re seeing rate decreases, but generally improving profitability. So, I was
just hoping for some insights in terms of like the macro picture.
<A - Philip V. Bancroft>: Well, the macro picture, you have record low unemployment, which actually can play – cut
both ways on workers’ comp. You have less experienced workers on the job, so you have to be careful. We’ve been
seeing frequency up until now, frequency of loss has been down. Severity has been reasonably tame. And so overall
loss cost trends have been good in comp. I think you have to – in my own mind, the market is reacting to that, the
insurers, and comp has become more competitive. And I think you have to be careful that you’re not too aggressive,
you overshoot the market. That’s the bigger picture for me.

<Q - Brian Meredith>: Just a couple quick ones here for you. First, crop or agricultural insurance domestically in the
U.S., obviously a big drop in corn prices, soybean prices, given the tariffs. How far away from the kind of threshold are
we – where we’re going to see some loss to that business or profitability be meaningfully impacted?
<A - Evan G. Greenberg>: Yeah, Brian, I’ll make two comments. First, the condition of the crop – and I can speak to
Chubb’s book only, given our – where I know our concentrations are, the corn crop – it’s too early on soybeans – the
corn crop, which is our number one crop, is in as good a condition as, or better than last year and the last five-year
average. Number two, the price drop, corn was at $3.66, I believe, yesterday. I don’t watch this too closely. And I think
February contracts were like – when we priced were like in the $3.80 range, so it’s within deductibles. So you’re not at
that threshold as you’d say.
When you look at soybeans, the average that farmers buy on our book is about 20% deductible. Corn they buy a little
less, closer to 15%. And you’re – at this moment where soybeans was, which was $8 and change, you’re right around
or within the deductibles.
<Q - Brian Meredith>: Great. That’s helpful. Thanks. And then just two quick numbers questions for Phil. Phil, other
income looked a little odd this quarter. Anything unusual there? And then also on interest expense, same question.
<A - Philip V. Bancroft>: Yeah, so on other income, we had higher than expected PE income, where we own greater
than 3%. So, when we have a partial ownership that’s bigger than 3%, we include that in other income, and that was
higher than we expected. We also had higher income on our [indiscernible] investment, our insurance investment in
China. And then, last year, we had a one-off capital charge in Switzerland. And all that drove the change year-to-year
in other income.
<Q - Brian Meredith>: Great.
<A - Philip V. Bancroft>: And then with interest expense, as we’ve said in the past, we have interest expense that
includes both fixed and variable components, and the higher-than-expected expense in this quarter related to the
variable component. We had more interest expense paid on collateral that we hold for clients, and we also had a higher
usage of various facilities that we use to manage our cash around the world.
<Q - Brian Meredith>: So, is that $177mm number a good run rate number or is there...
<A - Philip V. Bancroft>: I would use a range of $170mm to $175mm.
<Q - Brian Meredith>: Excellent. Thanks. Appreciate it.
