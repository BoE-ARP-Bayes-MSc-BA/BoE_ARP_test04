Here is Nose of Sompo Holdings.

Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Thank you very much for joining us today for the conference call of Sompo Holdings. I'd
like to explain about the fiscal year 2019 first half results as well as the full-year forecast
for the fiscal year. As to the management strategies for the later half of the current MTP,
our CEO and other management members will explain about it next week at analyst
meeting.
Please go to page two. These are highlights of the first half of fiscal year 2019. Mainly
driven by the rebound from the domestic natural disaster impact of the previous year,
consolidated ordinary profit was JPY63.7 billion, or up JPY35.9 billion, and consolidated
net income was JPY43.9 billion, or up JPY21.7 billion.
As to the full-year results, we have reflected the status of domestic natural disaster, which
occurred in October in our numbers. Full-year forecast of consolidated ordinary profit was
JPY185 billion and consolidated net income of JPY118 billion. As I'm going to cover later
on, domestic natural disasters impact and the adjusted forecast of large incidents are the
major drivers. Excluding those impacts, baseline profitability remains robust.

FINAL

As to shareholder return for the fiscal year, assuming there is no big fluctuation in profit,
our policy is to make this year's total shareholders' return greater than that of the
previous year.
Please go to page four. Here is the list of numerical results of the first half. I'd like to
explain about the factors behind those numbers on page five and onwards. Page five,
please. Underwriting profit of Sompo Japan Nipponkoa. While reversed amount of
catastrophic loss reserve decreased with good loss ratio, with rebound from the impact
of domestic natural disasters such as Typhoon 21, underwriting profit increased by JPY37.3
billion year-on-year. Excluding domestic natural disaster impact in addition to consumption
tax hike, large incidents increased by JPY6.8 billion year-on-year. Excluding these factors,
baseline earned incurred loss ratio improved by 0.4 points year-on-year, remaining robust.
With claims payment to be in progress going forward, on a full-year basis, reversal gain of
catastrophic loss reserve will give positive impact.
Please look at page six. Investment profit. Despite negative impact due to stronger yen,
reduction in strategically held shares as well as portfolio replacement leveraging the
change in interest rates produced JPY62.1 billion of investment profit.

Bloomberg Transcript

Page seven, please. Consolidated ordinary profit. Underwriting profit and investment
profit, as I have covered, as well as SI's organic growth and nursing care business steady
growth in profit. Consolidated ordinary profit was JPY63.7 billion, or up JPY35.9 billion
year-on-year. As to overseas group companies, let me add that SI's local accounting is
having some noise such as changes in hidden gains on assets being booked as profit.
Consolidated net income is on page eight for your reference. Page nine, please.
Numerical list of full-year business forecast. As I mentioned earlier, we have revised it
from that of the beginning of the year. Major points are on the next page. Page 10, please.
Consolidated net income forecast has been revised down by JPY50 billion from the
previous expectation. There are three major forecasts.
First factor -- three major factors. The first factor is domestic natural disasters such as
Typhoon 19. Expected loss amount incurred, reinstated premium for reinsurance, reversal
of cat loss reserve and temporary addition to underwriting reserves led to minus JPY35
billion from the previous forecast. By the way, temporary addition to underwriting reserve
is to be deducted from adjusted profit.
Second factor is large incidents. Based on the status of the occurrence of large incidents
in Japan recognized in October, Sompo in October, Sompo Japan Nipponkoa's large
incidents for the year forecast was revised from JPY19 billion to JPY26 billion.
Lastly, business results -- business forecast revision of Sompo International. The plan is
expected to expand, as originally expected, but the other large incidents impact made
the revision of bottom-line by about JPY11 billion.
Page 11 has the ordinary profit level breakdown of business forecast. Page 12, results
progress rate; and page 13, numerical management targets.

FINAL

So much for consolidated results. Moving on to domestic P&C business on page 15. From
here off, I will go over Sompo Japan Nipponkoa overview of first half. As for each items, I
would like to go a little more into detail on the following pages.
So let's turn to page 16, net premiums written. This increased in almost all product lines.
For example, the retail side increased. Automobile insurance has performed well through
product revision in 2019 January. And also, we saw good performance in fire and allied
lines through increase in new policies centered on long-term policies as well as unit
premium increase through the increased coverage. And we also saw increase in lines for
corporate through rate optimization and progressing in all products in common, driven by
new other products.
Next will be earned incurred base loss ratio. Mainly due to a decrease in net losses
incurred from domestic natural disasters, for the -- at the end of first half, we saw this
improvement to 63.0%, an increase by -- improvement by 10.4 percentage points vis-a-vis
last year. For the full year, we look conservatively at domestic natural disasters and large
loss. Well, that -- well, with that, we are going to expect 64.8%, an improvement by 2.4
percentage points vis-a-vis last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to page 19. Here, we have the expense ratio. At the end of first half, we ended at
33.1%, which is a decline by 0.4 percentage points vis-a-vis last year. We have been able
to keep good control for personnel as well as property expenses.
On page 20, we have combined ratio, which is the sum of loss ratio and expense ratio.
We will now turn to page 21. Here, we have investment profit. As for first half, I've already
explained earlier. But then, if I may supplement about our reduction of strategic holding
stocks, the amount of actual stocks sold stands at JPY35.5 billion at the end of first half.
But then, we feel no problem in achieving approximately JPY100 billion at the end -- for
the full year.
Now for the full year forecast, we are going to go through exchange parts of portfolio -we are going to exchange parts of portfolio, looking at the market environment, thus,
revising upward gains of sales of security. And this will be the main reason for the
investment profit to be revised up by JPY6.8 billion to JPY150 billion. Interest and dividend
income, gains on sales of securities, appraisal profit or loss would be on next page.
Let's turn to page 23 now. Here we have business forecast for Sompo Japan Nipponkoa.
The assumption of the business forecast is on the following page 24. And also, on page
25, we have the usual data around automobile insurance. So please refer to them later.
We will now turn to page 26. Let me supplement a bit on domestic natural disasters. The
group's incurred loss at the point of first half stands at JPY144.5 billion and net incurred
loss, JPY43.1 billion. For the full year, we are going to take in some buffer, for example, the
net claims for the Typhoon No. 19 in October as well as damages from snow in winter. We
forecast the full year's net incurred loss from domestic natural disasters to be JPY96
billion.

FINAL

And so therefore, this means that we are going to increase the budget for these natural
disasters by JPY43 billion from the previous JPY53 billion we had at the beginning of the
year. On fund and reserve, we have the reference data on the next page. This concludes
domestic P&C insurance.
Next, I'll move on to overseas insurance. Please turn to page 29. This is the overseas
insurance. Adjusted profit for first half have achieved JPY27.7 billion, which is an increase
by JPY500 million vis-a-vis last year through organic growth mainly by SI.
For the full year, we have revised down the number to JPY47 billion from the initial JPY59
billion. This mainly comes from large incident or large loss in SI, causing its performance to
be revised down by JPY11.3 billion. On page 30, we have business results by region, and
on page 31, we have highlights for each group companies. Please refer to them later.
We will now turn to page 32. Allow me to supplement more about SI performance. I would
also like to note that the figures here are shown in US dollars. At the end of first half, we
had an increase in provision of loss reserve related to natural disasters, but this was offset
by top-line growth outperforming the market and better expense ratio. And so therefore,
we have been able to see an increase vis-a-vis last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

For the full year, we are going to -- we have adjusted the bottom-line for multiple large
losses as well as this increase in provision of loss reserve related to natural disasters.
Also, on the following page, we have figures for Sompo International. This concludes
overseas insurance. Next, we will move on to domestic life insurance.
Please turn to page 35. Here, we have the overview for Himawari Life. We saw a steady
increase in policy as well as steady reduction of expense.
In other words, we are progressing in line with the plan. There is no major change to our
full year's outlook compared to what we announced at the beginning of the year. The
change factors of net income for Himawari Life is shown on next page as well as adjusted
profit on page 37. Please refer to them later. This concludes domestic life insurance. Next,
let me move on to nursing care and healthcare.
Please turn to page 39. Nursing care and healthcare business. The main indicator for
nursing care would be occupancy rate. This continues to improve. And so therefore, the
net income at the end of first half stood at JPY2.5 billion, which is an increase by JPY300
million. There is no major change to our full year's outlook. The trend of occupancy rate is
shown on page 40 as your reference material. This concludes nursing care and health
care business. Last part is ERM and asset management.
Please turn to page 42. First, we show our ESR. We did see an impact from the interest
rate decline. But then, our ESR is at the same level as with the level at the end of 2018
through reduction in strategic holding stocks. Therefore, we still find our ESR financially
sound. On page 43, we have a breakdown of adjusted capital and risk. Please refer to
them later.

We will now turn to page 44. My final part of the presentation is about the group-wide
asset portfolio. But then on the following pages, we have portfolios for Sompo Japan
Nipponkoa, SI as well as Himawari Life. I hope you will be able to refer to them later, but
there is no major change.

This concludes my presentation. Thank you very much.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you very much. Now we will move on to Q&A. First, from SMBC Nikko, Mr. Muraki,
please.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

Thank you. My first question is about the fire insurance and additional reserves. How much
is it? And also, as to the provisioning part, ordinary underwriting reserves for natural
disasters is deducted from the adjusted profit. And why is that?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Muraki-san, thank you for your question. So your question is about fire insurance and
ordinary underwriting reserves for natural disasters, and actual provisioning amount, and
as to deduction from the adjusted profit and why is that.
So first of all, as to the additional provisioning, extraordinary provisioning after tax, JPY17.5
billion is the scheduled. This is after tax. And as to the deduction from the adjusted profit,
the catastrophic loss reserve, as is the case for these results, there are regulatory
reserves. So we have applied the same approach to it, namely, deduction from the
adjusted profit.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

Thank you. My second question is about overseas business. Page 33, as to SI. So this time,
loss ratio compared to the previous forecast is aggravated, while expense ratio has
improved. Could you please elaborate on that? What is different from the forecast at the
beginning of the year? And also, as to liability line, I think there are big losses.
As to -- this increasing trend of the lawsuit cost is impacting the results of SI?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Muraki-san, thank you. As to your second question, it's about the overseas business,
insurance business. Also aggravation of the loss ratio and also the improved expense
ratio, how is it different from the original forecast? And also, your question is about the
increasing trend of the loss related to the CALI.

Page 5 of 15



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc

FINAL

As to Sompo International loss ratio aggravation. In the previous year, there are the
natural disasters and the loss reserves for that. But for the second half and for the full
year basis, there are large loss incidents, and there's impact from that. In addition, for
crop insurance, results are aggravating, and that is also reflected. And all in all, loss ratio
went up. And as to Sompo International, we have been reducing expenses and the fees
and the commissions, and the net expense ratio are improving.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

Thank you. I'm sorry. Yes, please.

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

As to your second question, in other words, losses related to the liability line. The SI's
large incidents and its impacts exist, and the liability loss aggravation is existent. And
talking with Sompo International people in the US, for example, social inflation is one of
the buzz words, and such inflation is actually giving some negative impact on results for
this fiscal year. That said, social inflation is emerging, is becoming more visible. So Sompo
International is taking some preemptive approach -- has been taking preemptive
approach. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

Thank you. As to SI, additional question. You have released about Sompo International's
CEO change from Nigel Frudd to Okumura-san. And from January 1, Sompo International
is going to be a controlling company of all the overseas operation. Sompo International
Overseas owner, John Charman, and Sompo International Holdings CEO. What is the job
allocations between the two?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Thank you. Today, we have released that news about the personnel rotation. As you
pointed out, as of January 1, SIH CEO, Nigel Frudd, will be replaced by Holdings CFO,
namely Mr. Okumura. As our release mentioned, SIH is going to be the controlling
company of the overseas operation to have more the linkage with the group strategies,
and that's why we will put Mr. Okumura in that position, while Nigel Frudd, he has
completed his role in the context of transformation, and now he would like to focus more
on M&As.
As to John Charman, the CEO of overseas insurance and reinsurance business, and Mr.
Okumura's relationship, basically, John Charman will continue to be owner of overseas,
the business. And he will supervise the overseas business, which includes SIH managed by
Mr. Okumura. But when it comes to SIH, which will cover all the overseas entities, and Mr.
Charman will continue to work on how to grow overseas business. And so he will think
more about strategies. So that is how they are going to coordinate their work.

Thank you very much. Next question comes from Ms. Tsujino from Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities.

FINAL

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

Thank you. I'd like to think -- ask about the underwriting profit for domestic. And every
time, I always hear about some of the -- you always exclude provisions for cat loss or
provisions for reserve for price fluctuation. But then you saw JPY30 billion or more decline
this time. But then on the full year, you are in line with the initial -- you are more closer to
what you had initially. In other words, the difference is just JPY16 billion. And of course, for
example, there was this reserve before the tax hike or there was this large incidents that
you had to prepare for. And so, I'd like for you to explain a little more about what kind of
difference you have now. But then again, I would also like to highlight the full year. You
have gone down by JPY16 billion.
And that would mean this provision in your underwriting reserve related to natural
disaster. This is something that you probably had not been expecting initially. And if you try
to include that, that you may come with JPY17.5 billion, and then also the reinstated
insurance, which is going to be more than JPY10 billion. So you have all of that. But still, for
the full year, the adjusted underwriting profit, it, of course, has been revised down.

Bloomberg Transcript

But still, it is JPY16 billion. So, there must have been something that offset it -- that offset
some of the declines that you saw. So can you explain to me the details?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Ms. Tsujino, thank you. So your question is, again, for the domestic business, the adjusted
underwriting profit. If we exclude any, for example, provisioning and underwriting reserve
for natural disasters or for a cat loss, what is the full year's impact and also some details
around some of the impacts or change factors to the full year's, so some of the factors
that pulled down the figure for the first half.
So for example, commission and other elements, we can point out to the long-term
policies for the fire insurance, which accounts for JPY6 billion amount. And also,
reinsurance cost has deteriorated by several billion yen. And also, tax hike, that's another
JPY4 billion of decline. And again, the loss ratio deterioration for fire and allied insurance,
that's another JPY6 billion. And in 2018 January, there was the price reduction of the
automobile insurance.
And so, there's still JPY2 billion impact from -- the negative impact coming from there.
And also, large incident loss. This has increased more, which accounts for approximately
JPY7 billion and, again, excluding anything around natural disasters. But then, there is still
like JPY1 billion or JPY2 billion. So that, all in all, I can say it totals to JPY30 billion amount of
deteriorating factor.

Page 7 of 15



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2019-11-19

Now why do we -- why are we not seeing all of that for the full year's? There are some
positive factors, of course. So for example, some of the new other areas are marine
insurance, the loss ratio has improved there. So, these are some of the factors that offset
some of the decline.

FINAL

Thank you. Another question?

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

So for SI, you mentioned about the changes in the top member. So, it is now going to be
led by Mr. Okumura. So in SI, I'm sure you'll be thinking of managerial areas, administrative
areas as well. But then, the North America portfolio, that Sompo Holdings would have is
now going to be really interested to SI. And so, for example, areas like pricing, you would
have to look at the pricing and rate. But then, with the new top personnel coming from
Japan, do you think you would be able to now start looking into areas, even to the pricing,
as you try to look into new ways to run SI?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you for your question. So your question -- your second question is around some of
the personnel changes in SI. So now our Japanese product policy, in other words, some of
the pricing methods, would this also be applied for what is going to be offered from SI?
Now Sompo International already looks into what we offer in, for example, North America
and as well as Europe. Some of the portfolio we would have with Japanese companies is
something that is already being looked together with SI and also from Japan.
This is something that we already had been putting into practice. But now, we have a
stronger framework. SIH is now going to be led by Mr. Okumura. But then, that doesn't
mean that we are going to be changing drastically what SI had been practicing. There still
is going to be the collaboration that we've had from before.

Thank you. Next, from Daiwa Securities, Mr. Watanabe, please.

Q - Kazuki Watanabe

{BIO 15948747 <GO>}

Here is Watanabe of Daiwa Securities. I have two questions. First, page 26, on the
domestic natural disasters. On a primary basis, gross basis, how much the claims payment
is expected? And what is the impact coming from Typhoon 19? And as to the nat cat -- the
catastrophic loss reserve, are you going to have some extraordinary provisioning to it as
was the case for the previous year?

Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2019-11-19

Mr. Watanabe, thank you. So the question is about the domestic business. And first of all,
natural disasters, the overall -- the gross -- the claims, the payment and the impact
coming from Typhoon 19 and the extraordinary provisioning of the cat loss reserves.
Starting with natural disasters, so the gross, the incurred loss is JPY322 billion, in which
JPY140 billion [ph] for Typhoon 19. As of the end of the year, extraordinary provisioning
depends on the reinsurance structure of the coming year. So at this moment, we will just
look closely at the actual -- or the claims payment, and we will continue to discuss as to
the potential additional provisioning.

Q - Kazuki Watanabe

{BIO 15948747 <GO>}

Next, my second question is page 33, about SI overseas business. Compared to the
other previous forecast, gross premium is raised, while net premium is revised down. This
means that the retention will go down. Why is that? And as to the sale -- the gains of the
other securities did more than JPY20 billion. Could you please elaborate the breakdown
of this number?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Mr. Watanabe, thank you. As to your second question, it's about Sompo International. The
first question is about gross premium is increasing, but compared to that, net premium
increase is coming down. Maybe retention is coming down, and why is that? And the
second question is about the full-year 2019 fiscal year adjusted profit has minus JPY27
billion, and why -- the background of this number.
As to your first question, as to gross premium and net premium comparison, the retention
coming down, yes, that's right. That said, for Sompo International, it is revisiting the
strategy very actively. So if there are any policies that they believe the deal [ph] was
retaining, of course, they would do so. And for other cases, they will just see the business
to reinsurers.
So at this moment, these are the numbers that we are looking at. But going forward,
when the market is hardened and when they think that it's better for them to retain more
of the other businesses, and then they will retain more business we believe.
As to your second question, minus JPY28 billion on a full year basis. Because of the
changes in the other hidden gains on the sale of the securities, they have this JPY28
billion assumed. In other words, the securities held by SI, hidden -- the gains increased by
JPY28 billion, and that will be reflected in the other net profit. And when it is converted to
the adjusted profit, that will be deducted. So that is why minus JPY28 billion.
The additional question about -- the second question. So the $3 million -- $300 million,
that is included in the original forecast according to the assumed gains of securities. Well,
it is basically the interest and the dividend payment. So, it is rather visible as a schedule,
and such numbers are booked.
And as to minus JPY28 billion, it's not about the coupon. It fluctuates according to the
market price. Interest rate is coming down, and the hidden gains are increasing. And you
Page 9 of 15



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2019-11-19

can leave it as it is. But from this year, the SI, because of the IFRS applied, the increase in
the hidden gains is inflected in the other net income, and that should be adjusted for the
adjusted profit.

Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Mr. Otsuka from JPMorgan
Securities.

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I am Otsuka from JPMorgan Securities. Thank you. My first question is on page 26. Mr.
Nose, you mentioned about the gross incurred loss from Typhoon 19. It was JPY144.5
billion. But then, there was Typhoon 21 last year. I think that was JPY290 billion. Compared
to that, how do you see Typhoon 19? And also, like overseas modeling company, they
also had some numbers. Compared to that, I feel like this number is quite small. What are
the reasons behind that? For example, it was more about the local areas that was
damaged instead of metropolitan areas, or perhaps it was because it wasn't the three
mega companies that did the underwriting, or it was other program -- insurance
programs, and so -- like mutual aids, and so there was this difference there. Or how do
you analyze the difference?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Thank you, Mr. Otsuka, for your question. So your question is about domestic natural
disasters. I mentioned earlier about the impacts of Typhoon 19. I mentioned the gross
incurred loss is JPY144.5 billion. And so if we compare this number to Typhoon 21 last year,
and for example, compare it to other modeling companies, it seems like the number is
smaller. Why is that? That is your question.
So I would say there are probably several elements but one major reason. Typhoon 21,
the damage was caused by strong wind, compared to the Typhoon 19, the damage was
caused by heavy rain. In other words, the damaged area was very large. The flood
damaged very wide parts of areas, many parts of areas. So the number of incidents
would differ depending on where the damage comes from, whether it comes from wind
or rain. For example, Typhon 19, it's not that the damage was smaller. But then when it
comes to the amount of the claims itself, on the unit cost itself, it would rather be more
because there were flood, but then there'll be less number of claims.
Now what -- how would the overseas companies do the modeling? That is something
we'll not be able to say. But then I would think that they came with the worst-case
scenario. Model companies, they probably would not want to undermine any impact, so
that is why they decided to look at the more higher part of the numbers.

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you. I understood well. My second question goes to page two. It's about the
shareholder return. Can you give us a little more flavor or color? I'm sorry to just look at
your wordings. But then you mentioned that you are trying to make sure you'll be able to
at least surpass the total payout of previous year. But then I think you showed 60% of
total payout ratio and adjusted profit. If you look at the base adjusted profit, that would
be like JPY110 billion.
That will be the amount of total payout amount, the payout amount. So was there any
change here? You're now saying this in a different way. You're saying that you will at least
try to go above the number that you have for last year, which means you must be talking
about something a little over JPY82 billion. So was there any change to, for example, the
shareholder return policy?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you for your question. For the shareholder return, what is our policy behind that?
That is your question I took. As you know, we had a downward revision. And so based on
this, the total payout ratio that you are assuming would be 50% to 60%. And so that
would mean like 50% of JPY128 billion, which means the amount of payout would be close
to JPY60 billion.
But then what we are looking at, at the moment will be a little different. In other words, we
want to base ourselves to the previous JPY82 billion. This is the floor line. This is the
baseline regardless of the downward revision that we announced. That is what I wanted
to express here.

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

In other words, at the beginning of this year, you said that your target rate for a total
payout ratio will be 50% to 60%. And you changed this, I guess. But this adjusted profit
itself has changed from your initial assumption. So people like us, we should now sort of
change our mindset and focus first on the JPY82 billion. Is that what you're saying?

What we are just trying to say here is at least achieve JPY82 billion or more. And of
course, there is still an upside possibility for full year's performance. And of course, there
is still a chance that we will be offering more. But then, I'll remind you, this is just an interim
point. There still are uncertainties as we look down the road. For example, some of the
capital needs or some of the performance, that is going to be what we'd be looking at
before we'd be able to determine the year-end payout.
And so at the moment, we're saying that the baseline or the floor line is going to be
JPY82 billion.

If I may ask once again, in the large meeting you had in May, P&C -- you said that you are
really going to aim for the highest payout ratio among the P&C companies. But is there
any change to that word that you had?

FINAL

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

That was what our CFO said. The total payout ratio, I guess this is something that may
have caused unnecessary confusion here. But then as we try to think of the ultimate
payout, we do pay attention to what the peers are doing. It's not about that payout ratio
itself. We're not trying to change that -- the idea behind our total payout ratio.

Thank you. Next, Mr. Sato from Mizuho Securities.

Q - Koki Sato

{BIO 19983862 <GO>}

Sato from Mizuho Securities. I have two questions. First, I'm sorry to stick to this point, the
domestic natural disasters. And overseas modeling companies or insurance companies
are having very conservative forecast probably because of the Typhoon 21 and the unit -the cost rise, which happened last year. Going forward, the gross incurred loss due to the
Typhoon 19, if it increased, what will be the impact on net incurred loss, ELC or aggregate
coverage you have, but more of the aggregate coverage from this year? So if you are at
the threshold, do you think you will be just well covered?
And as to overseas natural disasters, so you revised your plan. And is there any change in
the assumption? And also, the Durham and the wildfires in California and how to reflect -how are you reflecting these disasters in the forecast?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Mr. Sato, thank you for your questions. Your first question was about domestic natural
disasters. So the creep in the unit cost increase due to Typhoon 21, made you think that
the same thing could happen to Typhon 19, then what happened -- what happens? And as
to the second question, it's about overseas natural disasters.
As to your first question, domestic natural disasters, the modeling companies, for the loss
creep -- they're concerned about loss creeps, which we observed last year. I agree. As to
the gross incurred loss of JPY140 billion of Typhoon 19, that's the current estimation. Even
if this number increases, ELC has a cap. So there's no impact on net incurred loss.
As to your second question about overseas natural disasters. As to wildfires in California,
are you talking about the wildfires which are currently happening in California?

Maybe in October?

FINAL

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

So you're talking about wildfires this year, okay. Basically, Sompo International natural
disasters, as we covered at the beginning of the presentation, we had some impact
coming from last year, but when you smooth that out, it will be slightly over the original
forecast. But it is in line with the forecast, more or less. As to this year's -- the wildfires in
California, at this moment, Sompo International has not reported to us that the risks are
rising.
Of course, we have exposure to wildfires, and I do not deny the possibility of hearing
some report of aggravated risks there. But at this moment, that's not the case. It is not
giving any big negative impact on Sompo International's results.

Q - Koki Sato

{BIO 19983862 <GO>}

Second question -- the second question, for my reference, could you please compare to
the budget for the overseas natural disaster and that after the revision? And the loss
creep impact, how much is it in the case of the overseas business?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Okay. So the comparison of the budget for the natural disasters this year and last year,
JPY23 billion [ph] is the full year, and the current trend is lower than that trend. And the
development from the past year exists and nat cat impact of this year combined
together, about JPY2 billion or so negative impact on the results.

Q - Koki Sato

{BIO 19983862 <GO>}

Thank you.

Thank you very much. Next question comes from Mr. Majima from Tokai Tokyo Research
Center.

Q - Tatsuo Majima

{BIO 15338044 <GO>}

This is Majima. Thank you. My first question is about large incidents in Japan. So, I'm sure
this has been experienced by other companies as well. But you have raised it as one last
reason or the reason why your profit is declining. So, was there a large incident that only
you were engaged in? Or was it that it was covered by several other companies, but then
you just have to see a large impact and this large incident? Can it happen again? So, that's
my first question.
My second question is about SI. At the beginning of the year, I think it was a large meeting
or, perhaps, a conference call. There was a person from SI who said that this reinsurance
Page 13 of 15



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc

is something that SI is going to be really aggressive from here on. But then, it seems like
the retention is dropping at the moment. So the plan at this Holdings side versus what the
SI is trying to do, I'm sure there would always be some certain gap. So, this is something
that we would have to accept. Is this the way we're supposed to look at this?

FINAL

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Thank you, Mr. Majima. So, you raised two questions. Your first question was about the
large incident loss that we had in Japan. Was it something that we were the only company
engaged? Or were there -- was this something that we're engaged with others? And
also, for Sompo International, the thought of Holdings versus thought in SI. Would there
be any difference or gap between the business indexes? So your first question about
large incident. So it is like a buildup of each specific items, so allow me to refrain from
going into details.
So going to the second question about the business strategy of Sompo International,
Sompo International would be delegated of the right to decide, for example, how they're
going to run their business, the business strategy. This is something that, of course,
Holdings side would, first of all, give an approval to the plan.

Bloomberg Transcript

But then, if there are some good logics, Sompo International do have the right to make
some changes. But then, it's not that we have a difference in how we look at the strategy
or the direction forward. It's not that we have difference between Holdings and SI. It's just
that SI would have a more agile hand in putting these strategies into practice.

Q - Tatsuo Majima

{BIO 15338044 <GO>}

Thank you. Can I go back to the first question? So you may not be able to go into details,
but is this something like a one-off event?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Yes. You are right.

So, the time is running up. The last question is from Mr. Sasaki of Merrill Lynch.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

Here is Sasaki, Merrill Lynch. I have just one question. So as to the underwriting the
reserves or additional reserves for natural disasters, so you have provision with the small - amount, it's small, and you did not disclose it? Or this time, you have decided to add
more the provision for natural disasters for some reason or other?

FINAL

Mr. Sasaki, thank you for that question. So your question is about the underwriting
reserves for natural disasters. The question is whether we have had that reserve or not.
We -- actually, we haven't. So this is the first time that we have that provisioning for the
reserves for natural disasters.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

I'm looking at the bylaw here. So the earned premium and the fund for large natural
disasters and you look at these two and the ratio between the two and you -- the
provision for the natural disasters, so are you saying that the fund size is now larger than
before? Thank you.

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Getting to the rules, there are some elements there. As to natural disaster fund, there's a
reinsurance structure giving impact. So, now we have a bigger reinsurance protection, so
that fund is not really relevant. Rather, going back time -- and the loss ratio, excluding the
extremely large natural disasters, is now working as a trigger for us to have provisioning.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

I'm sorry, so the big disasters last year were not triggered, but this year's is triggered. Is
that what you're saying?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Last year's disasters are too big to be included in the average, the loss calculation of the
past years. This year's disasters, however, are included in the calculation. Thank you.
