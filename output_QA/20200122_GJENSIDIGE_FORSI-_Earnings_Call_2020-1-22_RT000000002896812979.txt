Presentation
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Gjensidige Fourth Quarter 2019 Results Presentation.
Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference
over to Ms.Mitra Negrd, Head of IR. Please go ahead, madam.

Mitra Hagen Negrd
Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to this fourth quarter presentation of Gjensidige.
My name is Mitra Negrd and I'm Head of Investor Relations. As always, we will start with
our CEO, Helge Leiro Baastad, who will go through the highlights of the quarter; followed
by our CFO, Jostein Amdal, who will run through the numbers in further detail. And we will
have plenty of time for Q&A at the end. Helge, please.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Mitra. Good morning and welcome, everyone. Starting with the fourth quarter
on Page 2. We delivered a strong result. We generated a profit before tax of NOK1.7
billion. The group's underwriting result for the quarter amounted to NOK920 million.
Premiums increased by 3.8%. The combined ratio was 85.4%, a good level for the fourth
quarter. The fourth and first quarters are, as you know, winter quarters in our region, which
Page 1 of 19



Company N ame: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF N O Equity
Date: 2020-01-22

normally leads to higher claims ratios. The fourth quarter in 2019 was a quite typical winter
quarter in our region overall.

FINAL

The combined ratio was significantly weaker than the same quarter in 2018 due to the
difference in runoff gains. Adjusted for this, our combined ratio was better year-on-year.
The improvement was a result of effective pricing and re-underwriting measures across all
segments as well as continued strong cost discipline.
Our investment portfolio generated the strong return of 1.4% or NOK832 million in the
quarter, reflecting the strong development in the financial markets. Jostein will work with
more detailed comments on the results for the quarter. So then turning to Page 3, and
looking at the year as a whole. We delivered a record strong full year result with a pretax
profit of NOK7.7 billion. We met our financial targets on all metrics as shown in the right.
Return on equity was 28.2%. And excluding the NOK1.6 billion in gains on the sale of
Gjensidige Bank, return on equity was 22.6%, both higher than our target. This is
particularly pleasing, considering the fact that the bank proceeds are on our balance
sheet.

Bloomberg Transcript

The combined ratio was 83.6%, significantly better than our target range of 86% to 89%.
Thanks to strong operations in Norway and progress outside Norway. Low large losses
and high runoff gains also contributed positively. The full year cost ratio was 14.7% around
the area where we would like to see it.
Adjusted for the Baltics segment, it was 14%. We have a solid capital position with the
solvency margin at 206%, adjusted for the proposed dividend. Underwriting results
outside Norway, excluding runoff gains, came to NOK494 million, well underway to reach
our 2022 target of NOK750 million.
Let's then turn to the next page for a few comments on the proposed dividend. Our
Board has proposed a dividend of NOK6,125 billion, corresponding to NOK12.25 per
share. The dividend proposal consists of two elements, a regular dividend of NOK7.25,
this corresponds to a payout ratio of 72% for the group, adjusted for the gain from the
sale of Gjensidige Bank.
For our Norwegian general insurance customers, this once again bodes for distribution of
a solid customer dividend from the Gjensidige Foundation. The remaining five kroner is a
special dividend, representing distribution of excess capital as part of ensuring an optimal
capital structure. We have been actively scoping the market for attractive M&A
opportunities for a while and will continue to do so going forward.
We still believe, we can add value from Bolt-on acquisitions in our markets. But as you
might have noticed, there has not been no deal since we sold the bank. And as we are
also highly conscious of maintaining a strong capital discipline and strive to deliver
attractive returns, we believe it's the best interest of our shareholders to pay out excess
capital at this point.

FINAL

With this, our solvency margin is at a very comfortable level, providing us with sufficient
flexibility to maintain our S&P A rating, capacity for small acquisitions, organic growth and a
buffer for regulatory changes.
Then turning to Page 5, I would like to elaborate on the operational status in a few key
areas. We continued implementing necessary pricing and reunderwriting measures
through the fourth quarter across all segments. And I'm very happy to see that despite
strong competition, we have maintained our superior position in Norway with very high
retention.
And the January first renewals have been very strong for all markets, boding well for
2020 in the commercial space. Thanks to high retention and strong new sales volumes in
the Private segment continued to increase into the fourth quarter, although somewhat
lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 due to termination of the NITO agreement and
higher churn in the first half of 2019.
While profitability for motor in Norway has remained at a good level, we have not been
satisfied with profitability in our private property line. We have intensified our pricing
efforts and expect to see the results in due course.

Bloomberg Transcript

Strong partnerships are an integrated part of our business model. To that end, we are
very pleased that we have extended our reach in the Norwegian motor insurance market
by entering into a partner agreement with Volkswagen Mller Bilfinans for distribution
through the largest car dealer in Norway Mller Mobility group.
We have also entered into a pan-Nordic agreement with the largest Nordic fitness chain
SATS, together we will be exploring the possibility in developing services and health
insurance to the benefit of all customers. I'm very satisfied with the development in our
Commercial segment, reporting strong new sales and low churn despite considerable
pricing and re-underwriting measures. There are still pockets in this segment, which we
need to address, particularly among large corporates, and hence, we will continue to raise
prices going forward.
We renewed the agreement with Bondelag, the Norwegian Farmers Union during the
quarter. The partnership supports our strong position in the Norwegian agriculture sector
and confirms our strong delivery. This is the largest Norwegian interest organization for
farmers and has been our partner over the past 60 years. As part of the agreement, we
will jointly establish a sustainability fund with the purpose of promoting claims prevention,
measures and sustainability in the Norwegian agriculture sector.
Our operations outside Norway continued to progress according to plan. We will continue
to focus on cost efficiency and improving customer experiences and loyalty, and we are
confident in our ambition to reach our target for these operations in 2022.
Then turning to Page 6, a few words on our updated strategy; we have together with our
Board recently concluded on the Gjensidige strategic plan for the next few years. Based
on anticipated long-term trends and scenarios, involving globalization, technology,
Page 3 of 19

FINAL

sustainability and demography, predicting the future is hard, but what we can be certain
about is our ambition, delivering the best customer experiences also tomorrow.
To succeed, we will have to work continuously with efficiency improvements alongside
making investments in data and technology. We are putting a lot of efforts into launching
the next generation tariffs and CRM and investments in the new core system and IT
infrastructure. Altogether, this will improve our flexibility to act and react upon future
opportunities and challenges.
Our key strategic priority over the next few years is to maintain and cultivate the direct
customer relationship. We aim to achieve greater relevance and create sales
opportunities by offering our customers a broader value proposition than ever before. In
terms of both services and products, alone or in partnership with other providers, our goal
is to become an even better and more relevant partner for customers. A problem-solver
with a stronger focus on claims prevention, and thereby further strengthening our
customer relationship.
As an example, we have recently entered into an agreement with a leading supplier of
sensor technology, exploring the opportunities which lie in earlier detection of water leaks
and the prevention of water damage on buildings.

Bloomberg Transcript

Another example is our recent launch of an online service provider, easy access to
qualified. Our customers are very happy with the new service, and we have reduced
payments for physical consultation which are considerably more expensive.
Then turning to Page 7. Before I like to -- before I leave the word to Jostein, I'd like to
remind you that sustainability is at the very core of our operation. Our key focus areas are
initiatives for a safer society, reduced CO2 intensity and responsible investments. Claims
prevention is the most sustainable thing we can do. And with reference to my past slide,
claims prevention will increasingly be core in our value proposition to our customers going
forward.
And with that, I will leave the word to Jostein to present the Q4 results in more detail.
Thanks.

Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Thank you, Helge, and good morning, everybody. I will start on Page 9. We delivered a
profit before tax of NOK1.7 billion in the fourth quarter. The solid underwriting result at
NOK920 million was higher year-on-year when adjusting for runoff gains.
As you remember, we released almost NOK 1.4 billion of excess reserves in the fourth
quarter of 2018, of which NOK 1.1 billion was beyond the planned releases. The additional
NOK 1.1 billion was related to the Private and Commercial segments in Norway. The
releases this quarter are more in line with the planned runoffs, we have communicated
earlier.

FINAL

Both the Private and Commercial segment delivered improved underlying frequency loss
ratios, effective pricing, reunderwriting measures starting in the second half of 2018 and
continuing throughout 2019 were the main drivers. The underlying results improved in
Denmark, while Sweden and the Baltics reported lower results, reflecting the size of the
operations and inherent volatility.
Profit from Pension business was higher than last year, and our investment portfolio
generated solid returns this quarter at NOK832 million.
Turning to Page 10. Earned premiums were up 3.8% or 2.8% adjusted for currency effects.
In the Private segment, we continue to put through price increases, primarily for motor
and property. The number of insured objects within motor and property insurance were
down compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, but up compared with the third quarter of
2019.
Earned premiums increased for most product lines, but increase was mainly offset by
changes in intra-year accruals. Adjusted for this, the premiums would have been up 2.2%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our pricing initiatives in the Commercial segment continued into the fourth quarter,
resulting in a healthy 7.5% growth in earned premiums. We will continue the price
increases to at least reflect expected claims inflation but in a differented way. So for some
customers and segments, the price increases will be even higher. And as Helge
mentioned, our January first renewals have been very strong.
Earned premiums in Denmark, measured in local currency were up 1.6%, mainly driven by
the termination of a reinsurance agreement. We continued repricing and reunderwriting in
both the private and commercial lines. We still see some areas requiring further pricing
actions, but we're starting to reach a point where we can expect growth in line with the
rest of the market. The January 1 renewals this year have been very strong, proving our
improving position in the Danish market.
Our Swedish operations saw a 0.8% decline in earned premiums in local currency.
Adjusted for termination of one large unprofitable contract, earned premiums are up
3.6%, driven by price and volume growth. Despite tough competition, we are very
pleased with January renewals in Sweden too, in light of price increases. We'll continue
increasing prices particularly in the commercial space.
The Baltics reported a higher top line than the same quarter last year. Competition in
these markets is fierce, putting pressure on prices. However, we experienced good
demand particularly for accident, health and motor insurance lines.
Turning over to Page 11. We generated a solid loss ratio at 70.3% for the fourth quarter.
The ration rose compared with the same quarter last year, due to higher run-off gains as
explained earlier. Large losses remained at a low level, but most important, we saw a
further improvement in the underlying frequency loss ratio due to effective pricing and reunderwriting measures.

FINAL

Profitability in the Private segment improved, following the effective profitability measures
for the motor insurance line. With the continued pricing efforts reflecting expected claims
inflation, we expect profitability to remain around the current good level going forward.
Travel insurance, and accident and health also recorded improved profitability. The
profitability of the property insurance line was weaker than the same quarter in 2018. As
Helge you mentioned, we will continue to implement pricing measures here.
I'm very pleased with the improvement in profitability for the commercial segment, with
higher profitability for both the property and motor insurance lines. Denmark generated
stronger underlying profitability on the back of improvements in both the private and
commercial lines. The improvement in the underlying frequency loss ratio in Sweden was
related to improved risk selection in the commercial portfolio.
Our Baltic operations showed a higher underlying frequency loss ratio with the increase
being due to margin pressure in motor and health insurance.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's turn to Page 12. We recorded NOK957 million in operating expenses in the quarter,
corresponding to a cost ratio of 15.2% and 14.5% excluding the Baltics. The ratio of our
combined Norwegian operations were broadly in line with the same quarter of last year,
reflecting continued cost discipline as well as necessary measures to enhance future
profitability.
The development outside Norway moves more in leaps and bounds as a consequence of
ongoing efficiency measures and the size of the portfolio. Denmark reported a flat cost
ratio, while Sweden showed an increase and the Baltics came in lower than the same
quarter of last year. We'll continue our focus on simplification of processes, automation of
internal operations and further digitalization. We expect further efficiency gains from our
efforts, particularly in Sweden and the Baltics.
A few comments on our Pension operation on Slide 13. The pretax profit came to NOK61
million, higher than the fourth quarter last year. A strong insurance risk result as well as
continued growth in our customer base, and an increase in assets under management
were the main drivers behind the higher profit. This was partly offset by higher operating
expenses, driven by increased business volume and impairment on IT systems.
Annualised return on equity came to 17.9%. Assets under management increased to
NOK37 billion at the end of the quarter, reflecting increased payments and a positive
market trend. The ratio of shared customers with our general insurance business is high.
As of the end of the fourth quarter, 68% of the customers in our Pension business were
general insurance customers as well.
Moving on to the investment portfolio on Page 14; the investment portfolio yielded a
return of 1.4% in the quarter, reflecting the favorable market conditions in the quarter. The
total investment portfolio amounted to NOK 59.1 billion at the end of the quarter.
The match portfolio yielded a positive return of 1.1% on a portfolio of NOK34.1 billion. A
large part of the match portfolio consists of bonds at amortized cost, which yielded a
Page 6 of 19

Company Ticker: GJF N O Equity
Date: 2020-01-22

FINAL

return of 1.9%. This was positively affected by earlier redemption of bond in the portfolio
with a positive result effect of NOK151 million.
The running yield in this portfolio was 3.6% at the end of the quarter, and the average
reinvestment rate for the quarter was approximately 3%. Unrealized excess value
amounted to approximately NOK0.5 billion. The free portfolio, which amounts to NOK25
billion, yielded a return of 1.9% in the quarter. All asset classes except for private equity
contributed positively in the fourth quarter.
Looking at our capital position on Page 15; the approved internal model gives a solvency
margin of 206%, down from 235% last quarter, while our own partial internal model1 gives
a solvency margin of 250%. The main driver for the reduction in solvency margin is the
proposed dividend.
The total Solvency II earnings was -- and the return in the free portfolio was 0.7% NOK7.7
billion, which is less than the IFRS result. This is due to adjustment in the calculation of
technical provisions, realizations in amortized bond portfolio and the planned runoff
results having a positive effect in IFRS figures but no effect on the Solvency II earnings.

Bloomberg Transcript

The capital requirement also increases as a result of technical adjustments. We will
continue to balance our capital structure in a disciplined way in order to support the target
return on equity while, at the same time, are leaving us some leeway for further bolt-on
acquisitions and stabilization of dividend.
Finally, a few words on the latest development of our operational targets on Slide 16. We
can report good progress on our operational KPIs as communicated on our Capital
Markets Day in November 2018. By delivering on these operational targets, we continue
to improve our competitive position and lay the ground for future profitability. There are
no major changes in customer satisfaction or customer retention.
As already communicated, the January 1 renewals were strong across the group. All else
equal, this should further strength the retention. Maintaining higher renewals and
customer satisfaction at the same time a significant repricing over the last two years,
confirms our strong position in Norwegian market. We've also seen increases in the
renewal rate for all the three segments outside Norway, boding well for the coming
periods.
Sales effectiveness has increased this quarter. The main reason being the positive trend
for volume in the Private segment in the second half of 2019. But you also see a positive
trend in the other segments except for the Baltics. The share of automated tariffs
continues to increase as further [ph] products and insurance cover are included in this
methodology.
On the claims standing side, we saw an increase in digital claims reporting, but a drop in
the share of claims handled fully automatically. There is some seasonality in these
numbers as the types of claims vary throughout the year, but we're still on track to deliver

Page 7 of 19

on both targets. And in terms of our CO2 intensity, we will report the ratio in our 2019
annual report.
I will then hand the word back to Helge.

FINAL

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Jostein. So then to sum up then on Page 17. Standing at the very beginning of
2020, I'm very optimistic about Gjensidige's prospects going forward. We will continue
our efforts to retain our strong and unique position in the Norwegian market. We will
continue to raise prices when necessary and maintain a strong focus on operational
efficiency with a strong emphasis on digitalization, automation and simplification of
processes.
Our operations outside Norway are improving, and we are confident in our ability to
deliver on our targets of NOK750 million in 2022. We have a solid financial position, and
we remain firmly committed to exert strong capital discipline. Sustainability is at the core
of our business. We are firmly convinced that sustainable operations are a prerequisite for
long-term value creation. Our financial targets towards 2022 are unchanged.
And with that, we will leave the word to the Q&A session now. Thank you.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)
(Operator Instructions). The first question comes from Matti Ahokas of Danske Bank,
please go ahead.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. I'd like to go back to the dividend discussion. Helge you mentioned
earlier, so if I understood correctly this extra dividend proposal means that a larger
acquisition is off the table. Is this correct? And what's the reason for it basically, you said,
you've been screening the market was the reason that there was simply nothing
interesting to buy or were the prices too high?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Matti. As I said, we have been scouting the market for attractive opportunities
for a while. And we will continue to do so going forward. So one day, we will see
consolidation in the Nordic Market and we want to be part of value-creating consolidation
in the Nordic Market also going forward. But we are also highly conscious of maintaining a
strong capital discipline and strive to deliver attractive returns. So we believe it's in the
best interest of our shareholders to pay out excess capital at this point. But as I said, we

Page 8 of 19



Company N ame: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF N O Equity
Date: 2020-01-22

have a strong capital position, we can continue with bolt-on acquisitions and if it arise
opportunities in the Nordic market, we will be active looking into that going forward.

FINAL

So, I think that's the right answer on that question Matti. The appetite is the same as
before. But as you know, it's consolidated, and it hasn't been any transactions in the
period from when we sold the bank. So at this moment, the board decided to pay out
extraordinary dividend. It's not --

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

It's a good dexision in my view --

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yes, yes. Sorry. It's not a signal in any direction regarding our appetite, strategic and
growth wise.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Got it. Then one detailed question. What's the expected tax rate for 2020?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

-- you dropped off in the last then there, Matti.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

The expected tax rate for this year?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

For 2020? Our normal tax rate is, as you know, 25% and then gains on realization on
equity are tax-exempt. So it all kind of depends a bit on the composition of result, but I
think usually, it'd be 22, 23-ish, depending on the kind of the actual composition of the
investment return, as I said.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

Operator
We will now take our next question from Jonathan Denham of Morgan Stanley.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. You spoke about it a little bit, but is it possible to get a
specific number for the level of rate increases you put through at January 1, renewals in
aggregate and maybe say a bit more commentary around what the impact was on
volumes. And I think you said those considerable repricing with limited churn? And maybe

Page 9 of 19



Company N ame: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF N O Equity
Date: 2020-01-22

as well, what level of price increase is still required? And then just on the actions you're
seeing competitors taking with regards to pricing private property in Norway. And yes, and
if you're seeing competitors looking to take share from you over the medium term now.
Thanks.

FINAL

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yes. If your first question is price increases and of 1/1 renewals on commercial in Norway, is
that right?

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

As you know, we repriced both and increased prices significantly, both in the private
segment and the commercial segment second-half of '18 and into '19. And we had a
significant repricing into '19 without any type of churn in the commercial book. What I can
say, now, it's even better into 2020. So, that means strong, it's increased prices, new
customers and very strong 1st of January renewals. And as you know, 40% of the
commercial book is renewed by 1st of January. When it comes to private, Jostein, maybe -

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yes. The private I mean it's not that relevant to speak about January 1 renewal, because
renewals are evenly spread throughout the year. We talked about increases within motor
being at least in line with claims inflation, which we talked about still in the 3% to 4% there,
same as we said last quarter. And on the private property side, price increases are
starting point is the building cost index which are -- which is around 4%, a bit changing
measure. But we are now, due to our perceived need of better profitability, pricing
considerably above that. But without going very much more specifically into the numbers,
we have, as we said, seen no increase in customer churn or a decrease in customer
satisfaction, which means that probably others are seeing similar needs, but as there is
kind of not this kind of this single point of time, which is more important. And I think this is
much more a dynamic effort where we adjust prices continuously.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I can give.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Thank you. And maybe --

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Sorry, go ahead.

FINAL

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

No just a comment on motor. As you know, that's a significant part of our book. When it
comes to claims inflation, we expect claims inflation to remain stable at around 3% to 4%
reflecting the general inflation pressure in Norway and the increase of technology
advanced cars.
We also expect repair costs, isolated, are expected to rise 4% to 5% partly offset then by
expected lower frequency. Thanks to our measures and easier comparable related to
bonus changes. So the figure is 3% to 4%. But isolated, repair cost, we expect that 4% to
5%. And when it comes to pricing, Jostein commented that.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

And then maybe just a quick comment on kind of market share in private property in
Norway for medium term?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I can't really guide you there. It's -- we don't have any specific expectation. Our priority is
getting the profitability right and then we'll see what the market share ends up as.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Thank you.

Operator
Our next question comes from Jonny Urwin of UBS, please go ahead.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Morning. Thanks for answering my questions. So, just stepping back a bit. Across the
whole portfolio, it sounds like pricing is largely tracking claims inflation, maybe it's ahead,
driven by commercial. Could you just comment on that? And then on the underlying loss
ratio what should we be expecting for development? It sounds like you're guiding to more
stable kind of underlying loss ratio trends from here. But given the turnaround is still
ongoing and there's a bit more rate and I would have thought there would have been a
bit more improvement to come, so any color there would be great? Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I mean, it's hard to give comments across all these segments here. It's a very
differentiated story. So but overall, I would say, yes, prices are increasing somewhat more
than the expected claims inflation, but it's a mixed picture and motor will be developed
into for many quarters in a row and we are at a profit level there which we are
comfortable with, which means that on average we aim for price increases more or less in
Page 11 of 19

FINAL

line with expected claims inflation. I think we already commented. Whereas in private
property, we'd see the need for more price increases than the expected claims inflation.
In commercial, yes, price increases are -- that we have put through now in January 1 would
be above our expected claims inflation picture. And the same goes really for Denmark
and Sweden and the Baltics, as well. But I can't give you an average figure because it's an
average of so much different stuff. That means that the underlying frequency claims ratio
should, overtime, now still continue to drop somewhat, but in a very differentiated way
across the products and segments.

Operator
We will now move to our next question from Alexander Evans of Credit Suisse, Please go
ahead.

Q - Alexander Evans

{BIO 19956412 <GO>}

Hi, Alex here from Credit Suisse. So just on the deterioration of underlying frequency loss,
it seems to be the main factors there at the Baltics, and Denmark's deteriorating this
quarter. I think you mentioned pressure and mentioned health in the Baltics. Can you just
go into a little bit of detail on what's going on in Denmark in the quarter, please?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think, we are actually quite pleased with the development in Denmark, if you look at the
underlying frequency loss ratio, it's an improvement of 4.6 percentage points from the --

Q - Alexander Evans

{BIO 19956412 <GO>}

Sorry I think it's Sweden, sorry

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Sweden? Then that's different story. Yes, Sweden and the Baltics. And then I understand
what you're talking about. Yes, there is an improvement also in Sweden, but the problem
there is a bit if you look at Sweden, there is improvement of a bit more than 4 percentage
points on the underlying frequency loss ratio. But of course, there has been this negative
growth in top line throughout 2019, but the speed of the decline has been much less in
the latter part. So, as I mentioned, if you take away this one unprofitable contract, we
actually have an increase in net earned premium in the fourth quarter of 2019. This is a
necessary result of pruning and the reprising of the portfolio, where we lose some
unprofitable contracts, we do get an underlying profitability improvement. But when
measured in kind of absolute volume, of course, there will still be some differentiation
due to the loss of business.
But if you look at the speed here now, we are quite confident coming into 2020, that we
see that the improvement is well underway, and it will contribute towards the NOK 750
million in 2022 as we have set as a target. Baltics, I think a bit different -- and of course
also the cost ratio in Sweden will suffer because of the top line issues.

FINAL

The Baltics, we see a tough competition. And -- but we are kind of improving our position.
We are working with what we can control on the cost side and also improve our tariffs and
so on, which means that we see an improvement in loss underlying loss ratio and
combined ratios for 2020. And we've seen that in the latter half of 2019; we have also
seen a pickup in the gross written premium which is kind of a signal in front that the
earned premium will grow in the coming periods.

Q - Alexander Evans

{BIO 19956412 <GO>}

Thank you, and just on the expense ratio. It looks like Private and Sweden are driving
increase higher than expectation. What's exactly going on in part of that?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yes. There are -- it's easier for us to comment on the combined Norwegian to Norwegian
segments in total because as you see, there's a large drop in commercial and a large
increase in private. And there's some allocations of course, between the two segments
that did have some changes. But otherwise we're also working on the initiatives to secure
future growth in Private, which is where costs come so much more before the problem
premium volume, but that's natural, also within our cost targets. As we say, we have 14.7%
for the year as a whole. Each and every quarter, there will be ups and downs in that ratio.

Q - Alexander Evans

{BIO 19956412 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And then just finally, on your solvency position, I know you talked about
adding a special dividend and returning excess capital back. But your solvency position is
still above your target. How should we view this at the moment? Is it for small M&A boltons? Or is it for potential future special dividend? What's the likelihood at that?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I don't comment on the likelihood. But I mean as you said, we are very comfortable with
the solvency margin. It gives us ample room for bolt-on acquisitions, a buffer against any
regulatory changes and kind of short-term volatility in results. As we say, it's about what
we, at current, it's about what we see as the normal solvency margin range. But this is
what the board decided for this point of time, and then we'll see next year.

Q - Alexander Evans

{BIO 19956412 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

(Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Blair Stewart from Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, please go ahead.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thanks very much. I've got a couple of questions left. Just looking at the underlying loss
ratio adjusting for reserve releases and large claims, it seems to be about 0.5 point

Page 13 of 19

FINAL

better year-on-year in Q4, which is not quite as good an improvement as we've seen in
other quarters. So just wondering is that 0.5 point, the sort of level you'd expect going
forward? We've talked around those issues already and perhaps you can't comment
further, but I just thought I'd ask the question.
Secondly, on the customer dividend, could you just remind us how much that is as a
percentage of premium? I think it's important because it helps to get price increases
through if your customers are getting a nice dividend. And then on the regular payout
ratio, it was 72% against your guidance of 80% or more. Just wondered if you could
elaborate on the thinking there. And you've mentioned a couple of times, my final
question, sorry, you've mentioned a couple of times about room for -- or having a buffer
for regulatory changes on solvency. I just wonder if there was anything specifically that you
like to flag? Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

There is 0.9 decrease in the underlying frequency loss ratio I think. And as I said, there is a
somewhat mixed picture here, but the largest improvement is within commercial, but we
also see a fairly okay improvement both for Sweden and Denmark, whereas the Baltic is
the only one with negative development. Whether that was better or worse than
expected, I'm a bit struggling to comment on. I mean, we are driving through as I said
price increases in general, which are above our expected claims inflation. But in motor,
which is a very big insurance on private motor in Norway.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are very satisfied with the current loss ratio level. So, there our expectations are for
price increases more or less in line with the expected claims inflation.
The customer dividend around 14% again, which is a similar level to the last couple of
years. The payout ratio of 73% is, as you mentioned above sorry, below the 80% that we
have said, but this 80% is stated as over time. There'll be somewhat -- we'd allow
ourselves some leeway around that. The starting point of the dividend is high and stable
nominal dividends. And when the underlying profits increase, we will also increase the
nominal ordinary dividend. And that's what we've done.
There are no -- this -- when we say a buffer against regulatory changes, this is a
statement we have all the time. There is no specific news on that on regulatory risk or
anything there, but in general of course there are potential for regulatory changes as you
know, it will pass its reviews out for changes in the Solvency II regime. That might or might
not come in the next couple of years. But there is no specific news from our side on the
regulatory risk

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay, great. That's great. On the customer dividend, I would have thought it was higher
than NOK 14 given that you're paying special.

Operator
Our next question comes from Johan Strm of Carnegie, please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Johan Strom

{BIO 17541253 <GO>}

Thank you. Two questions on claims, Please. First I think in the past six years, I think I can
count around three quarters where, we've -- where the large claims or large losses have
been at the expected levels. Is it fair to say that the past couple of years, whether has
been particularly benign? Or is the general guidance now at NOK 1.2 billion just very
conservative? That was the first one and then secondly, if you look at the first -- it's still
very early, of course, but first three weeks of 2020, have claims come up compared to
Q4,and also if you compare it to Q1, '19. Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I'm not going to comment on the second question, John. Let's wait till the first quarter
results. On the first one, are we conservative? I mean this is a longer-term average using
our partial internal model. So it's is the same kind of -- it is actually the same -- identically
same analysis that we use for our internal model. It is hard to judge whether that's
conservative enough, but it's our best estimate of the long-term. Remember that this is a
skewed distribution. Most of the years, the median will be better. But in some years, it
might be a lot worse. That's why we have these average estimates. So most of the years,
as you said, that we will have a positive -- kind of surprise then in quotation marks on the
large losses.

Q - Johan Strom

{BIO 17541253 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. Can I just squeeze one more? And then on in terms of the potential
claims or effects from the fire at the airport in Stavanger, any comments around that?
Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yes, it's -- as you know, it's a garage building, a garage and a hotel. And inside the
garage, it was lots of cars. The number varies up to tows and cars. We will have our share

of that. We do not exactly know what kind of total claim this will be, but just to remind you,
our maximum loss due to our reinsurance program, it's maximum 100. We didn't have the
garage and we didn't have the hotel, and we didn't have the car that started the fire.

Operator
Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Jan Erik Gjerland of ABG, please go
ahead.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay, Good morning. A couple questions from me as well. So the re-underwriting you are
talking about is that part of your being more smart in your re-underwriting in on different
kind of products? Or has it really helped this quarter or year-on-year or something or have
you done something special this time around? Is it just that you are being smarter every
day on this reunderwriting stuff ?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Not smarter every day, but may be every year. But Jostein, come in. Reunderwriting is
more related to large customers and commercial, I think.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I mean, if you look at our commercial book. It's a large part of that is small and mediumsized enterprises and it's a market that has as much similarities to the private market as to
the large corporates and its tariff driven. There we have improvements in tariff and
general repricing level increases, but on the large corporate side, it's a re- underwriting
and we reassessed the risks and the pricing that we need to take for each of these
customers or risks that we are bidding for.
And it's a process that can sometimes work to reduce the volume, because we are too
conservative or too strict on profitability targets as we've seen in Sweden and the last
year also partly in Denmark. Whereas in Norway, we managed to do this to increase
profits, but without having an increase in churn. So it all depends on the market situation,
in the different markets that we operate in, whether we are smart or not, but it hasn't had
an improved effect on the profit, at least.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. So almost in line with last year and previous quarters then. When you look out the
window, as Johan touched upon, there is no winter in Norway these times. And so let me
phrase it differently. How is the frequency then affecting you positively on motor in Q4 and
also on housing because we see different kind of weather this time around? So is housing
and motor having an opposite effect on frequency? Or is it some of that normal winter
quarter also was bad on housing or only motor? Can you comment on that?

A - Jostein Amdal

FINAL

Without taking any specific number on it, in general, where there is kind of less of a winter,
like it's been in the fourth quarter of 2019. And as we look out the window now in Oslo at
least, it's generally benign for claims both in property and motor. But bear in mind as for
motor, what is kind of is most kind of negative for us is there are a lot of changes in the
weather where it freezes and then melts again and so on because that creates difficult
driving conditions. But overall there is -- we have nothing to complain about for this winter
at least.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

You can see when it comes to winter in Scandinavia, first quarter so far, you can look at
the temperature, it's very benign.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Finally then, on your market share in the different kind of areas in the country
so that you have sort of equal every bases in Norway? Or is it so that you're stronger still
in the Oslo and the eastern part of Norway and Scandinavia area? Or is it so that you have
sort of been catching up with the others in the different kind of other areas where you
historically were at that lower point? Is there any material changes between the countries
you serve?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yes. Just to remind you, we are a clear market leader on the commercial side. And in total
we also market leader, historically reasons, we are stronger in [ph] or the Tondheim or the
Trndelag area. The Central East, we are stronger, weaker, south part of Norway, west part
of Norway and North part of Norway. So typically, Kristiansand, Bergen the north area is
weaker compared to the rest. But of course, we had -- we have -- we have strong
positions all over. But relatively, it's weaker South, West, and North

Hi, good morning. Two quick questions from me, please. Firstly, on the outside Norway
profit target of NOK 750 million. Just wondered, if you've seen anything in Q4 which has
made you more or less confident of meeting that? And then secondly quickly on the
Volkswagen partnership. I just wondered if you can elaborate on what benefit do you think
that partnership will give you, Hedge, that you don't already have perhaps? Thanks.

Volkswagen mobility group, it's the biggest car distributor in Norway. And I think they sell
around 50,000 new cars a year and we will be part of the offering to the customers. So
this -- we are really pleased about that partnership. We haven't -- we can't give any exact
targets regarding how many of the customers will choose Gjensidige et cetera. But this is
-- strengthen our distribution position when it comes to motor insurance in Norway.

Q - Philip Ross

{BIO 20618440 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

The first one, Jostein.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

-- [ph] not just in the fourth quarter, but as -- at the whole of 2019, I think, within a strong
positive development towards NOK750 million. As a reminder, it's excluding M&A
activities, and it is excluding round of gains or losses. And not the fourth quarter in
isolation, but the development in 2019 as a total, that makes us at least as confident in
that target as we were before.
