Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us this morning. So let me first
provide some perspective on the fire events that continue to develop in Northern Alberta. Our



FINAL

thoughts first go out to the people and families at Fort McMurray, including our employees and our
customers.
Our first concern is with their safety. So we've been monitoring the situation since last weekend
and activated our catastrophic response plan yesterday. Additional resources are ready to
mobilize, should the need arise in the coming hours and days. We continue to assess the situation
as we talked. But for now, we're focused on bringing our customers back on track. Earlier this
morning, we announced first quarter net operating income of $1.46 per share, 7% better than last
year on the back of a solid underwriting performance.
Our top-line grew 7% in the quarter with double-digit growth in Personal Lines. Our customer
experience innovations and organic growth initiatives have clearly been successful and helped
offset the headwinds from the Alberta economy. We improved our combined ratio to 92.5% as our
property lines delivered strong results and our auto performance continues to improve, thanks to
milder winter conditions and our initiatives to address cost pressure.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our operating ROE stood at 16.7%, a healthy level particularly in light of our strong capital position.
We ended the year with $904 million of excess capital. And our book value per share grew 3%
over year to $40.06. In terms of our performance, we beat the industry's ROE by 510 basis points
in 2015, driven mainly by our underwriting performance, offset by the effect of weaker capital
market.
Let's now look at our first quarter results by line of business. Personal auto grew 10%, including 3
points from CDI, driven by our customer experience improvements, as well as other growth
initiatives. The combined ratio improved 4 points to 96.4%, helped by milder winter conditions and
profitability actions. We seek further improvements in the combined ratio by taking actions to
offset cost pressure. In Alberta specifically, we're increasing rates and optimizing our claims
strategy to address pressure in bodily injury claims.
When it comes to the industry in personal auto, we continue to anticipate low single-digit growth in
the coming 12 months. Our view on Ontario auto has not changed, as we still expect great
reductions from reforms to be largely in line with government cost reduction measures. Given the
irrational competitive environment across the land, we anticipate that claims cost inflation will lead
to moderate rate increases in the coming 12 months.
In personal property, we grew our premium by 12%, including three points from CDI as rate
increases and growth initiatives were deployed in favorable market conditions. Our combined ratio
of 82.9% reflects a very strong performance with normal CAT activity and elevated large losses,
suggesting that our improvement plan remains quite effective. We continue to see hard market
conditions in this line of business leading to upper single-digit growth over 12 months for the
industry. With new products on the shelves, including both our Lifestyle Advantage and Enhanced
Water Damage Package, we're very well positioned to capture further growth opportunities in this
segment.
In commercial P&C, we shrank by 2% year-over-year as headwinds from a slowing Alberta
economy offset growth in other regions. This line delivered a solid combined ratio of 92.4%, as the
underlying current year loss ratio improved by 2.4 points, demonstrating that our profitability
actions continue to pay off. We believe industry conditions should support low single-digit growth in
the coming year.
Commercial auto premiums grew 3.4% in the quarter as the impact of corrective measures and
rate increases were offset partially by economic conditions in Alberta. The combined ratio remains
elevated in our view at 97.5%, but the improvement in the underlying loss ratio is a positive sign
further strengthened by milder winter conditions. That said, we're continuing with our corrective
measures aiming for a low 90%s combined ratio within 12 months to 18 months. In terms of



FINAL

industry outlook, we believe the market, while still competitive, is firmer, leading to mid-single-digit
premium growth in that segment.
While growing and improving our businesses in the quarter, we also deployed a number of
strategic initiatives. On April 19, we announced a partnership with Turo Inc., a peer-to-peer car
rental company, concurrent with its first expansion outside the U.S. into Canada. This represents
another concrete example of our strategy to develop products that meet evolving customer
needs. Actively participating in the emerging sharing economy provides potential new growth
streams and an opportunity to accelerate our learning, while leveraging our core competencies.
We also introduced our Intact Service Centre in Calgary, the first to be launched in urban areas
across Canada. Our customers can now enjoy a simpler, faster and more convenient auto claims
experience. I'm also pleased to announce some executive changes enabling us to accelerate our
strategic initiatives. Jack Ott, currently Chief Information Officer, will become Senior Vice President
of Innovation Partnerships. Jack will bring us knowledge of technology helping our venture team
advance a number of partnerships and investments and disruptors.

Bloomberg Transcript

Mathieu Lamy, currently Senior Vice President of Claims, will take on the role of Chief Information
Officer. Mathieu's focus will be on continuing our software engineering transformation and
advancing our enterprise-wide data strategy. The Intact Lab will also report to Mathieu to bring our
research and design unit closer to our development team.
Patrick Barbeau, currently Senior Vice President of Personal Lines, will now bring his depth of
experience to the role of Senior Vice President, Claims. And I'm also pleased to introduce Darren
Godfrey as our new Senior Vice President, Personal Lines. Darren brings a wealth of experience
across actuarial, claims and personal lines since he joined, in fact, 15 years ago. You'll hear from
Darren at our next earnings call.
Finally, to accelerate our drive to become the Canadian leader in specialty lines and surety, we're
creating a national unit solely focused on excelling in this segment. To make that happen, I'm
pleased to announce the appointment of Joe D'Annunzio as Senior Vice President of Specialty
Solutions and Surety. Joe's leadership over the years gives me confident that Intact will be second
to none in talent, expertise and product in this segment.
I think we really have the privilege of having a world-class team in place and changes like these
speak to the depth of our talent pool and our ongoing commitment to people development. So, in
conclusion, 2016 is off to a good start with strong momentum in both top-line and bottom-line and
a solid balance sheet to support our growth ambition. Our customer-driven strategies such our
online experience improvements, new products and service excellence support our strong organic
growth momentum.
Our property lines are performing very well in terms of combined ratios. And we're improving our
auto results. We're confident that our expanded leadership team, combined with our actions, will
continue to help us outperform the industry's ROE by 500 basis points and growing net operating
income per share by 10% over time. We believe our focus on the customer experience, our
employees and financial performance places us in a very strong position to benefit from the
environment in which we compete.
And, with that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Marcotte.

Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles. Good morning, everyone. Q1 2016 has clearly been a strong quarter for Intact,
with top-line growth of 7%, a combined ratio of 92.5% and an operating ROE of 16.7%. These



results were delivered while maintaining a strong balance sheet with $904 million of total excess
capital and an NCT of 215%.

FINAL

I was pleased to see our underwriting income grow 23% compared to last year, driven by 8%
higher earned premiums and a one point improvement in our combined ratio. This is well aligned
with our strategic roadmap to grow earnings through organic growth, margin improvements and
capital management initiatives.
When looking at our core underwriting results, we see a 4-point improvement in the underlying
current year loss ratio with contributions from our auto lines and commercial P&C. In personal
property, we incurred non-CAT weather events and large losses which were 5 points higher than
year. Despite these losses, the underlying current year loss ratio remains stable at 55% in this line
of business.
On a core underwriting basis, our property lines continue to perform well. And we're pleased to
see improvements in our auto lines. Favorable prior year development amounted to 8.4 points in
the quarter, very much in line with historical levels for Q1, despite being 2 points lower than last
year's elevated level.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, the expense ratio was 0.3 points higher than Q1 of last year, essentially due to growth
initiatives and premium taxes. Our distribution activities delivered pre-tax earnings of $14 million, in
line with expectations, but below last year when we recorded higher variable commissions. This
income source should deliver earnings north of $110 million in 2016. With regards to other
operating items, we reported stable investment income in the quarter and still expect a mild
erosion over the next 12 months as the low yield environment continues to be challenging.
Moving on to non-operating items, we reported non-operating losses at $58 million in the quarter,
$44 million more than last year. The year-over-year change relates primarily to weaker capital
markets, differences in interest rate movements and gains recorded last year related to brokerage
transactions. Despite the recovery of the TSX this quarter, we recorded $22 million in impairments,
a similar level to last year.
Our Q1 2016 effective income tax rate of 21.6% is in line with our expectations. It is three points
higher than last year essentially due to the tax treatment of non-operating gains recorded last
year. In summary, our net operating income per share grew 7% year-over-year, but lower nonoperating results led to reduction of earnings per share to $1.11.
Finally a few comments on our financial position. Our MCT increased 12 points this quarter to 215%
on the back of strong earnings and 4 points from the phase in of the 2015 and 2016 MCT
guidelines. Our total excess capital amounted to $904 million at the end of the quarter, including
the proceeds from our $250 million debt issue earlier in March.
We issued this debt to capture low interest rates and optimize our capital structure, bringing us
close to our target debt to impact capital ratio of 20%. The notes bear an interest rate of 3.77%
and mature in 10 years. Our balance sheet remains strong. During the quarter, our investment
portfolio moved into an unrealized gain position of $35 million.
This was driven by a strong recovery in the common share portfolio, offset in part by a decline in
the price of rate reset preferred shares. We executed on our buyback during the quarter
purchasing some 230,000 shares for a total cash outlay of $20 million. This is aligned with our
capital management framework and our stated intention to use the buyback opportunistically
preferring to deploy capital on growth initiatives.
In this respect, we invested some $84 million in brokerages and ventures during the quarter. In
conclusion, our profitability measures in the property lines continue to be effective. And we have



clear action plans to further improve results in auto. We firmly believe consolidation in the domestic
P&C industry will continue both in manufacturing and distribution. And we will continue to be active
participants.

FINAL

We are patient and disciplined in our approach and have been rewarded for investing in an organic
growth in this environment. With a solid operating position, a strong balance sheet and a deep
talent pool, we're well poised to capture emerging opportunities.
With that, I'll return the call back to Samantha.

Q&A
Operator
Your first question comes from Tom MacKinnon with BMO Capital. Your line is now open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you very much. One quick question and then a follow-up. I guess the quick question
would be on the distribution income. I think it was only $14 million in the first quarter, but, Louis, you
think it's going to be north of $110 million for 2016. Could you -

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

That's right.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

So, obviously, we're not in that kind of run rate. What happened in the first quarter that made it
lower than that run rate and why would you anticipate it would pick up in the ensuing quarters this
year?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So, these income sources tend to be seasonal. And our expectation, in fact, is to get roughly 15%
of the annual income in the first quarter. And that's really driven by the seasonality of the written
premiums as well. So, towards it's normal, it's a variation to last year, because last year we actually
recorded higher variable commissions in the first quarter, simply because brokerages were
recording the benefits of the previous year into Q1, a true-up of the previous year into Q1. But
that's a bit of volatility. But when we plan our income throughout the year, it's about 15% of the
annual run rate that is booked in the first quarter.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

And I think you guided to that number to be $100 million in 2015 and you actually exceeded that a
little bit. Is that correct?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

That's right. So, we did $104 million last year and we were guiding towards 10% growth. And I just
stated we would expect that to be north of $110 million this year.



FINAL

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. And then, Charles, maybe if there is any more context you can give with respect to Fort
McMurray. If we look back to Slave Lake, which was one of the second largest in terrible disaster in
Canada after the ice storm in Québec, I think that was – you had preannounced then in the area of
$45 million to $55 million after tax and that was predominantly personal property, maybe a lesser
extent commercial and some auto related coverages. Is there any way that Fort McMurray is similar
to Slave Lake with respect to the – maybe not necessarily potential losses because that's certainly
something you're trying to assess, but in terms of the breakdown of where those losses could
potential be?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So, Tom, I think it is a bit early to comment. I would say that there are lots of similarities between
Fort McMurray and Slave Lake. One big difference is that our market share in Slave Lake was much
higher than our market share in Fort McMurray. I think we could get a picture of what the ultimate
will look like. And as we did last time, I think, we'll probably inform the market of that once, A, if it's
material and, B, once we have a good grasp on what it is. I'll ask Mathieu Lamy, our – as VP of
Claims for a few days now or still to give you his perspective on the Fort McMurray.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

Yeah. So, like you said, Tom, it's very early. So the effort right now or the focus is preparing our
response for when we get access to the site – the field operation. At this point, we have beefed
up our phone resources to be able to accommodate the calls that we think are coming. So far, in
terms of losses reported since last night, we have about 40 losses reported, some are
evacuations, some are total losses. Actually, it's reported by the ensured 40 losses reported,
probably 25 fires at this point, very early to assess where this is going to end up.
In terms of exposure, it's difficult to know where the damages are at this point. But in the area, we
know we ensure about 1,500 houses, 1,300 tenants in condo, some 300 businesses, maybe a bit
more. And obviously there is an auto risk that I don't have the numbers, but it's probably similar to
those numbers on the other side.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And that's called the Greater Fort McMurray area.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

That's it. What we don't know is what is damaged, what proportion of it will be damage. This is way
too early to know at this point.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

And but like you said, Charles, like focusing on the response right now and in the coming days we'll
be able to have an assessment on those.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. No, exactly. Troops, resource, backup plans are in place. We have the people on the ground
yesterday actually. And so, it's a matter of getting access and hearing and responding to our
customers at this stage.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}



Okay. Thank you for that.

A - Charles Brindamour

Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Kwan with RBC Capital Markets.

Q - Geoffrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - Geoffrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

My first question was just the wording that you guys have been talking about on the auto – the
claims inflation. I know that you guys talked about last quarter looking at more Alberta in the bodily
injury stuff. It seems like the wording seems a little bit more widespread. I'm just trying to get a
sense as to, are there kind of commonalties, specifics that you can talk about? What's driving it?
And then I know you've also talked about the pricing increases. Is the implementation of the timing
– is that going to be simultaneous method or there might be a delayed impact in terms of when
thinking about the combined ratio?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

All right. Jeff, I think, a good observation. I would say that if you go back past few years, we were in
a net rate decrease environment in automobile insurance. In fact, if you look at the earned
premium in the first quarter, the average earned rate is minus 0.8%. If you look at the written
premium in the quarter, you see that it's shifting now in positive territory. And it is a matter of just
markets across the land for different reasons moving in a world where you will likely see rate
increases, can be normal inflation. It can be a reversal after years of flat rates or slightly decreasing
rates in markets like Québec, for instance, or it could be markets like Alberta, whereas we've
talked about last quarter, we are in a corrective mode. Bottom-line is we're seeing certainly an
environment where rates will pick up across the land as one would expect over time with the
inflation naturalizing in the system. I will leave Patrick to provide additional color. And we'll take your
next question afterwards.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

So, exactly Charles. As you might recall, in the past that two years, we've seen a bit of increase in
frequency on auto in different parts of the country. Part of it was driven by a couple of tough
winters in a row. So, that was part of the inflation overall pretty much as I think mostly the East parts
of the country.
We talked about the BI claims pressure. We have a robust action plan on both claims and rates that
we have started to implement about a year ago where we're starting to see some benefits from
that. And on overall, maybe what I could add on the rate increase or the rate actions we're
anticipating from the industry, well, on our side, we have started to already to increase a bit more
the rates in different parts of the country, namely the Eastern and obviously Alberta.
On Ontario, obviously, we're now through the reforms. There is the final rate decrease for the
industry that's coming up, but there is also normal inflation outside of the reforms that is – as I think
that line as well, a bit similar to what I just said for the others. And we're at a point where we are
also trying to reflect this inflation in our regional part.



A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. So, I think, the general reasons vary by province, but our perspective is that if you look at the
next six months, 12 months, from a written rate point of view, that will look a bit different from the
past six months to 12 months in a rational competitive environment. I think we're not behind the
curve on any of these things. I think we're trying to be proactive to make sure that we maintain and
improve our margins in that environment.

Q - Geoffrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. And then just the other question I had was on the commercial P&C side, the DPW
was down 4% year-over-year. I mean units were down 1%. You've talked about some of the price
increases in Alberta was weaker. Just wanted to get, I guess, some color on the year-over-year
change and then also how you think that year-over-year change trend as we look over the next
couple quarters.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. Not just for Alberta. I guess, Geoff, you're talking about the line of business and it's
holistically, right.

Q - Geoffrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Correct. Yeah. On looking forward, but just generally speaking and what happened with Q1, just
maybe a little bit more color on what drove the year-over-year change?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Well, Geoff, I think the 4.3% you are quoting is the total duct premium, but there is a bit of two
years policy in our portfolio. So we look at it more on a net return if you want basis and the
decrease is 2.3% basically. So there is a dip in the number you quote, two year policy effects. So
the net decrease is in fact more around 2%. There is a few elements combing into that. The first
one is we believe that the impact of the economy in Alberta has been a drag of about a point,
okay.
We also saw some elements on the surety side. Surety gets to be very lumpy on a quarter-toquarter basis, because there is no renewal. And, in fact, surety has affected our growth in the
quarter by another point. And, overall, we have a bit of timing issue. And depending on the prices,
the account in commercial lines can vary between $2,000 and up to a multi-million dollar account.
So there is a lot of variation depending on the number of large account you write or we may lose.
And we know that there has been an impact from a handful of large account in the quarter. So
overall -

Q - Geoffrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

In fact on that very point, the mix created mid-single-digit drag on the top-line as well.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Exactly. Okay. So this explain pretty much the growth in the quarter. I'd look at the historical growth
in our quarter and in fact it's been on average for the last nine quarter roughly about 2.5%. But
when you look at the standard deviation, it's about three points varying from minus 3% to plus 7%.
So that I think illustrates the fact that telling on what happens on the timing in large account. It has a
really impact on the growth overall. So, that makes me looking at one quarter not necessarily is the
right trend to look at it. In fact, we don't think there is anything structurally right now preventing us
to have a growth that would be necessarily different than what we see in the industry, which would
be low single-digit growth.
Maybe more on the market, because you are hinting on the rate increase. Basically we think the
market is still experiencing some rate increase. In fact, in the last quarter, our rate increase were



about 3.7%. And that's like 11 quarter in a row with rate increase above 3%. On top – over the last
three year, we've increased by basically 13%. So, we think we're still operating in a market that's
conducive to having some rate increase, not everywhere, but mostly targeted on more difficult
segments such as condo, realty, restaurant, things like this.

Your next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you. First question on the underlying current year loss ratio improvement of
4 points. Could you break down between the mild winter as well as the pricing and underwriting
action you've taken?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Patrick will give you his perspective. It's a little bit – I guess there is a bit science and art here in
terms of removing the impact of mild winter condition, but we'll share with you our perspective.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah. I can share a few comments on the personal lines. When we look at weather, there are single
events that can – or not reach the CAT definition – our internal CAT definition. And there's the
general winter temperature or accumulation of precipitation that can have access on the different
lines. So, it's hard to separate the two. I think if I look in the two personal lines, on the auto side,
we've seen 8% decrease in frequency year-on-year when you compare the first quarter to last
year. So, a decrease in frequency can be also caused by different things, but we know that a good
portion of that was probably driven by milder or better winter conditions.
We have to remember also that the year-on-year comparison is not an easy one because last year
was a winter at the other end maybe of the spectrum or was very difficult winter condition in many
parts of the country. So, if we compare this year to the average of the past few years or to last
year that might make a difference. On the personal property side, not much on the weather.
Weather last year or this year, there was about 2 points of CATs in 2016 in Q1 and we had none in
the Q1 of 2015. So, that's an indication. So it's not all going in the same direction. But, for personal
lines, overall, I think, it's helped our results in auto, not necessarily a part of the equation for our
personal property.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. That's great. Then my second question, on the capital management side, looks like your
excess capital, $900 million, and that's about a 15% of your shareholders' equity. If you take that
one out, your ROE could be 2 points higher. So just wonder how – my question really is how big of
the excess capital you're willing to hold and for how long before you consider other capital
management activities outside investment and acquisitions?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So, Kai, thanks for the question. At this point, so we raised a debt and that rose the excess capital.
Our view that we should raise the debt now because the interest rates were attractive, so we
were willing to carry a bit more capital, because we think there's going to be opportunities to
deploy them in the short-term to mid-term. So at this point, this is probably a level we're
comfortable at but we are obviously looking at deploying it as soon as possible but comfortable to
carry it temporarily to deploy it on a growth opportunity.



A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

I think, Kai, there's visibility of opportunity that goes one way. The other thing that matters to us is
the impact of the excess capital on the ROE and our ability to reinvest in the business in
relationship with what the industry's ROE is. And with an operating ROE north of 16%, despite the
excess capital position, I think, this leads us to be patient holding the capital given we think that
there are growth opportunities with some visibility in the market here.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Well, thank you so much.

A - Charles Brindamour

Your next question comes from Meny Grauman with Cormark Securities. Your line is now open.

Q - Meny Grauman

{BIO 15238080 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Good morning. The question is on the purchase of brokerages and other ventures, $84 million
in Q1, already surpassing what you did last year. So I'm wondering if that's just lumpiness in terms
of just opportunities coming to you or are you seeing anything different in the environment that will
lead you to believe that you could sustain a robust pace going forward with these kinds of equity
investments?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So this is clearly lumpy. We're off to a good start this year compared to last year, but it is lumpy and
difficult to predict. So we're working hard to invest in brokerages, but the timing depends on the
brokers and our ability to close those sales. So we expect lumpiness over time. But, again, I think
the run rate last year was a bit low. We had higher deployment the year before. I would think in
between the two would be a reasonable -

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

How much did we deploy last year?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Clearly, the environment for consolidation and distribution is very healthy. I think in building
BrokerLink and helping entrepreneurs in the marketplace, consolidate is a key strategy. And I think
more and more people in distribution understand the importance of scale. So if I look at the
opportunities in consolidating distribution, I would say very strong at the moment. And given these
transactions are meeting our threshold of return as a distributer, clearly, we'll put as much capital
as we can find opportunities in that space, so long as we can generate those sorts of returns. And I
think the entrepreneurs with whom we partner with and the team at BrokerLink have done a



phenomenal job of integrating and rapidly turning double-digit return and margins of EBITDA to
revenues in the 20% to 30% range very quickly, so very attractive for us and we'll certainly capture
the opportunities that exist in the marketplace.

FINAL

Q - Meny Grauman

{BIO 15238080 <GO>}

Thanks for that. And then if I could just follow-up with a question about the impact of the economy
on your business, specifically in Alberta, I wonder if there is any updated thinking on that. I think last
time you mentioned specifically for commercial P&C that you expected a reduction in growth of
about 0.5 point. Wondering how you see the environment developing a quarter later.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 21962461 <GO>}

So like I said many – this quarter we estimate that the impact of the economy in Alberta was about
a point on commercial P&C. And in fact it's probably deteriorated from what we saw at the last
quarter. It's coming basically from the two same area, which is the oil and gas sector and the
contractor sector. Last year, we had seen a fairly stable drop in the oil and gas sector to the tone
of 10% to 15%. This spiked to about 25% in the first quarter of 2016. Okay. And on the contractor,
this was an emerging trend we saw at the last quarter in 2015. And it continued in 2016 and in fact
accelerated because we saw a drop of about 17% on the contractor business. So these are the two
segments that are really affected by the economy in Alberta. So the impact we were expecting is
about 0.5 point in the quarter. It translated to something closer to a point on the overall P&C
growth in the market.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thanks, Alain. Yeah. Those two sectors represent about 27% of our commercialized portfolio in
Alberta and, therefore, are influential to our performance. I think if we take higher level
perspective, Alberta is an important province for us. We ensure almost one in four Albertans same
thing at the business level. This represents about 15%-ish of our portfolio with $1.4 billion of
business. So the interesting thing is that the areas that are affected are meaningfully affected. But
then when I look at our personal lines performance, this is the market in which we're growing the
fastest. It's not to say that the industry is growing the fastest. But this is the market in which
shopping is taking place and our value proposition is actually working very well.
In personal lines, you have to keep in mind that there are not necessarily meaningfully less houses
or meaningfully less cars on the road. I think what you see, though, is that the value of the insurer
car pool is not increasing as fast as it would normally. And it's driven by the fact that new motor
vehicle sales are down 10% and, therefore, the average age of the cars on the road in Alberta is
increasing. So, overall, a province, which is going through a tough time and we're seeing that very
clearly in commercial lines. But I think our value proposition, our product range, service we're
providing and the technology solutions we have in place certainly seem to drive growth in that
market.

I said next question, please. Just kidding, Doug. Go ahead.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

I won't take it then. Ontario auto – obviously, there is indication of a cost inflation. And just
wondering if there is anything concerning in that for you. And I think there's a new dispute
resolution process that's being adopted. And is there any relationship between the two and is
there are any concerns you have around that new dispute resolution process?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Okay. Good. Why don't we start with Mathieu on the dispute resolution and maybe a comment on
the upcoming June reforms? And then we'll let Patrick take the rest of your question. Go ahead,
Mathieu.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

Okay. First on the dispute resolution system, the new system has been implemented as of April 1.
That followed the Judge Cunningham report about a year-and-a-half ago. And the idea there was
to streamline the process, make it more predictable, more cost effective for Ontario. And so far so
good. We don't have any decision from the new Tribunal. But it has been implemented and we
have every reason to think that this is going to be successful at this point.
In terms of reform, we have some new product effective as of June 1, basically in accident benefit.
There's three types of claims in accident benefit: the MIG claims, the basic claims and the CAT
claims. On the basic claims and on the CAT claims, basically, what's going into effect is there is a
reduction of coverage with an option to buy out. And also, as of June 1, for every effective policy,
there will be a new CAT definition, which we think has progressed because it will probably alleviate
some of the problems we have with the older definition with the stacking of physical and
psychological impairment. So I think, overall, we're positive with those coverage changes.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

And yeah, I agree. I think our view on the effectiveness of those reforms has not changed. Of
course, we'll see when they are all implemented. But the way it's heading is still we think in line with
what we expect in terms of the benefits from those reforms. So, when we quote cost pressure for
this line of business in Ontario, it's not linked to the reforms, per se. It's more normal inflation. As
you might recall, this process of implementing the reforms and the different filing that we had to
go through started at the end of 2013 and we're now in beginning of 2016. So over a two-and-ahalf year period, there is normal cost inflation in all markets, including Ontario. And we think now
that we're through the reforms, it's time to be proactive and reflect that in our rates. Is that clear?

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

That takes me to my second inquiry is that – so you think that post reducing rates, I guess, by
roughly 15% come, I guess, mid-June that you'll be able to turn around and start pushing through
rate increases. And is that something you've had discussions with the regulator about is there
comfort with that?



A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yes. We're in that process right now. We've already started. And that's what we expect will happen
in the market. It's not necessarily that the trends are concerning. It's just normal inflation. That one
point also reflect in our rates.

FINAL

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay. And then just, secondly – I know, Charles, I've asked this many times and I still get confused
by this. But the prior year reserve development is running double what you've historically have run
at. And it seems to consistently be up there so much so that I kind of forget what the historical
average is. But I think it's 3% to 5%. Is this a renew in a new paradigm? That 6% to 9% is what we
should be thinking about on this line item?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No. I think, Doug, one of the things you need to keep in mind is that the first quarter tends to be
higher than other quarters. And the reason is very simple. The prior year is much closer in the first
quarter than in the other quarters. And there are a number of elements, some of them structural,
some of them not structural and, therefore, not necessarily to be there in the long run that have
led us to say that the levels we have seen in the past few years should not necessarily be
expected that level going forward. I'll let Mathieu give his perspective on that.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, that's exactly right. The first quarter is normally higher because that development of
the short tail claims have closed in the next three months, in Q2, Q3 and Q4. This is current year
development if you wish, so, in Q1 of prior year because it's from Q4 the preceding year. We think
that the development right now is at the top of the range, 3%, 4%, we expect because of the few
factors. First, the AXA acquisition has led to higher prior year development. We think there is still an
impact going forward, but that will diminish in time.
We have some assumption for the Ontario reform of 2010. And we executed probably a bit better
than the assumption and developed a few points of prior year development because of that. 2015
saw so higher development range because of prior year CAT that were reserved a big higher. So
in 2016, that should be lower because there was last year less CAT losses in 2015. And there is the
structural effect of the two impact of the discounting and the PfAD, the Provision for Adverse
Development. The discounting being lower doesn't completely neutralize the PfAD.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Right.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

Structurally generate the PYD.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay. And so I mean timing-wise when I think of all these items – and thank you for the detail – do
we start to see this kind of revert back to the normal range over the next year or two years or is
this kind of a longer-term glide path?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I wouldn't think about that mid-term.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Your next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is now open.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

Hey, Brian.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Hey. Good morning. A couple questions here for you. First one, going to the commercial P&C
business, wanted to get talk about where is rate relative to loss trend and are you done with your
corrective actions in the P&C area or is there still more to come? And I know, Charles, before you
have commented about the amount of combined ratio improvement we should continue to expect
here going forward as the earned moves in. But could you give us some insight into where that
stands right now?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Sure. We'll let Alain give you his perspective.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 21962461 <GO>}

Okay. So, basically like I mentioned earlier, last quarter, we saw rate increase at 3.7%. That is
probably a bit higher than the loss trends we're doing right now. So, if you look at our corrective
action, we think that the corrective action we took – 90% of it right now has been done and
earned, okay. We still have some earning coming up in the next 12 months to 18 months. And we're
still pushing through rate increase right now. So, this is where we stand. So, on the overall, I think,
we said we would operate in, in the low 90%s. I think we're getting very close to operating at that
level, currently. We were beyond that in 2015. And we're very close to that level in Q1 2016.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. But that low 90%s also assumes fairly high reserve releases that are going on right now.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 21962461 <GO>}

Well, if you look at the prior year development like – right now it's a number that's very volatile.
We're 3 points lower than that year, which was a ultimate buy. But we're probably a bit higher than
our historical average, but not very far from it.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And the business is priced to generate low 90%s. And when you price, you don't anticipate
favorable development from the past. Now, if there is some degree of conservatism in how our
folks on the frontline reserve, obviously, that's baked in your current accident year performance.
And it all washes out over time. Brian, when I look at commercial P&C right now and I think the first
quarter, severity and frequency largely offset each other. And the insured value, so to speak, is up
a point. So, when I wash frequency, severity, and the sum insured increases, I get very close to
zero. And we're earning 4 points of rates in the system and writing 3.7 point of rate.
So I think if I just look at the average rate increases over the past three quarters, in 2014, we were
4.4-ish, in 2015 we were 4.6-ish and this year 3.7. There has not been 13 points worth of inflation in
the system, especially if you take into account that we're also getting a few points of some insured
increases to eat that inflation. And so, it's with some degree of confidence that we say that we see
this business running in the low 90%s. There is still rate momentum in the system. And, quite
frankly, I'm always impressed despite the performance to see the commercial lines team being
focused on the corners of the portfolio from coast-to-coast that deserve corrective action. I mean
these guys behave as though the combined ratio was 110%, which is what I like to see when the
combined is in the low 90%s.



Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

FINAL

Great. Thanks. And then my second question, I guess, is for Louis. If I look at your cash flow
statement, there is a line item that says purchase in brokerages and other equity investments and
it was the $84 million in the quarter. That's actually in excess of what the total was in 2015. Is that
reflective of actually your activity in the first quarter as far as buying brokerages? Or is there
something else going into that number?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Well, it is reflective of our activities. It does include both brokers and what we put into – invest into
ventures. We chose not to specifically disclose the venture part, because we have confidentiality
agreements. But we do put the two together there. Now, the activity – this is reflective of what we
are doing in the brokerage. It's off to a good start when I look at the run rate compared to last year
in terms of brokerages specifically, but it can be lumpy. So -

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. I think it is fair to say that in Q1 a portion of that lump is venture-driven.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And venture is much lumpier obviously than brokerage consolidation because there are hundreds
of consolidation opportunities right here in Canada. And so we have a pipeline basically that we're
working on. Venture given our sandbox is tighter and we're not as comfortable with our skill sets,
so to speak, on that front, we're more cautious and it's therefore lumpier.

Your next question comes from Paul Holden with CIBC. Your line is now open.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. So, I want to ask a question related to Fort McMurray. And that question
is if you can give us a sense around potential commercial lines exposure there, whether that's
property or business disruption type insurance?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Okay. Alain, why don't you give us your perspective?

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 21962461 <GO>}

Well, I think, Mathieu mentioned that we have basically 350 policies somewhat in the region. And
that's the overall region. And we're right now in the midst of looking at all of that. That's the sum of
property, building contents as well as business interruption, okay. So, it's the sum of all of the three.
What I would like to say is that this is a number, but it ties a lot of variability because we have policy
out there in the $20,000 and probably the biggest policy in the bounds of $10 million, $12 million
which would be like a building or something like this. So, the exposure is very variable. So
depending on where it sits and everything very difficult at this point to call any forecast or anything
on that. But that's the color I can give you at this time.



Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then second question relates to CDI. I guess it's roughly a year
give or take since you acquired CDI. So wonder if you can give us quick update on how that
acquisition has progressed, if everything has just fallen in line with your original expectations or if
there have been positive or negative deviations relative to expectations?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So, the business is largely integrated. You have to keep in mind here that there's two things that
happened at the same time. First thing is the integration of Grey Power and belairdirect and the
second thing is the integration of Canadian Direct Insurance and belairdirect. So, the team has
been managing both integration at the same time. And I would say that the integration is largely
finished. So, we're pleased with that, because the timing is largely in line with what we anticipated.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second thing is that the brand of Canadian Direct Insurance has moved in Alberta to
belairdirect. And I think there will be further steps in 2017. So, so far so good. I think the direct to
consumer platform is now established from coast-to-coast with a fair degree of success. We have
in that business unit now well north of $1 billion and very healthy growth taking place. When I look at
then the core performance of the direct business in the West, which includes both business that
was in belairdirect, Grey Power and the Canadian Direct Insurance, I would say that on the home
insurance front, very good. I think on the automobile insurance front, we're seeing the pressure
we're seeing in the Alberta automobile book.
I would say the bigger issue for me, Paul, is that there are lots of moving pieces at the moment,
new claims seen, new system, the combination of two businesses. And so, I find that it is hard to
note we are on plan, better or worse than plan. And the other thing is that from a creditability point
of view, it is a little bit thin and early in the process. So there is a lot of efforts to improve our
visibility or understanding of the core performance of CDI in Alberta automobile. Overall going
very well and then we're trying to establish our brand in the market and testing ways to generate
response and transform response into new business. So there is a lot of activity taking place at the
moment but the integration is largely done.

Your next question comes from Mario Mendonca with TD Securities. Your line is now open.

Q - Mario C. Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Good morning. Probably for Louis, could you help me just think through the change in the MCT?
The debt issuance, the $250 million, that would have added something. Is that about 13 points? Is
that fair?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So the debt has actually a bigger impact on the excess capital. If you look at the MCT itself, which
is up 12 points, it's really 11 points coming from operations and then the 4 points from the phase-in
of the guidelines – the guidelines phase-ins. And then part of that is distributed through upstream
dividends. So, the MCT, per se, is really driven by the change in – or the gains from operations.

Q - Mario C. Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

But why would debt not have added to the MCT?



A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Because it's not pushed down. So, it is not pushed down into the operating company.

Q - Mario C. Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

FINAL

Oh, you left it at the HoldCo. I'm sorry. Yeah. That's that part I didn't follow.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

We did leave it up. Where it can impact is at the amount of upstream dividends we pull up. And so
that would impact it, but this has been left in the HoldCo.

Q - Mario C. Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

That makes sense then. Now just a quick question back to Fort McMurray. The reinsurance – is there
any extent to which – what is the extent to which reinsurance could limit your exposure there?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, the reinsurance will play its role in this case. Assuming the losses hit or go above our net or
our retention, then these are pretty straightforward losses subject to reinsurance. So, I think,
reinsurance will kick in the way it has in Slave Lake and in other losses. I mean fire is as
straightforward as it get.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mario C. Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Now you couldn't give us a limit there like $100 million, if it exceeds $100 million then the
reinsurance kicks in or is it more complex than that?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No, it's pretty straightforward, Mario. I think that you have the first $100 million for your own
account. And then as you move above $100 million, then it goes down from 40% session right up
to 95% session. So, the first $50 million above $100 million is 40% ceded and you quickly get close
to 90% ceded after that.

Q - Mario C. Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

So, why is it that with Slave Lake with the charge, I think, ultimately being about $50 million, why
would reinsurance have played a role there at all unless the reinsurance limits were a lot lower
then?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

This was, I think, a number of years back where the reinsurance limits and the size of the
organization was smaller.

Q - Mario C. Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}
