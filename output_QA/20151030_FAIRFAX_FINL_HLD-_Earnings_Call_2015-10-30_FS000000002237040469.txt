Good morning and welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's 2015 third quarter results. This
call may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ, perhaps materially
from those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of
uncertainties and risk factors, the most foreseeable of which are set out under Risk
Factors in our Base Shelf Prospectus, which has been filed with Canadian securities
regulators and is available on SEDAR.
I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa.

Thank you, Brad. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Fairfax's third quarter
conference call. I plan to give you some of the highlights and then pass it on to Dave
Bonham, our CFO, for additional financial details.
In the first nine months of 2015, book value per share increased 3.7% adjusted for the $10
per share common dividend paid in the first quarter of 2015. Our insurance and
reinsurance operations had an excellent first nine months with a combined ratio of 91.3%,
with excellent reserving and significant underwriting profits of $440 million.
In the third quarter, all our operating segments had combined ratios below 100%, with an
overall combined ratio of 90.9%. OdysseyRe again had an excellent combined ratio of
88.9%; Zenith, 82.3%; and Northbridge at 83.1%.

Bloomberg Transcript

As shown on page 38 of our quarterly report, we realized gains on our investment
portfolio of $65 million in the third quarter of 2015. Excluding all hedging gains and before
mark-to-market fluctuations in our investment portfolio, we earned $232 million in pre-tax
income in the third quarter. Including all hedging gains and mark-to-market fluctuations in
our investment portfolio, we reported after tax income of $425 million in the third quarter
of 2015.
Our insurance and reinsurance businesses premium volume was up in the third quarter by
31%. Excluding the Brit acquisition, business volume was up about 2.3%. At the subsidiary
level, the change in net premiums written in the third quarter and the combined ratios
were as follows: OdysseyRe in the third quarter had a premium drop of 13% combined
ratio, as I said earlier, of 88.9%; Crum & Forster was up 31%, combined ratio of 98.4%;
Northbridge in Canadian dollars was up 9% with a combined ratio of 83%; Zenith up 10%
with a combined ratio of 82.3%; Fairfax Asia was down 19% with a combined ratio of
90.1%. Dave will give you more comments on these results.
As we have said below, very low interest rates and reduced reserve redundancies will
mean there's no place to hide for the industry. Combined ratios have to drop well below
100% for the industry to make a single-digit return on equity with these low interest rates.
While the short-term is always, tough to predict, fundamentals will eventually play out.
Net investment gains of $426 million in the third quarter consisted of the following. Please
refer to page two of our press release. In the third quarter of 2015, net gains on equity
and equity-related investments were $1 million resulting from net losses of $792 million,
offset by $793 million net gain on our equity hedge, principally reflecting the 12.2% decline
in the Russell 2000 Index. Also, we had bond gains of $238 million primarily on our
treasury bond portfolio because of the impact of declining interest rates.
We have mentioned this many times in our calls, at our annual meetings. IFRS accounting
results and stocks and bonds being recorded at market and subject to mark-to-market
gains or losses. Quarterly and annual income will fluctuate widely, and investment results
will only make sense over the long term.

The market value of our CPI-linked derivatives increased by 40% during the third quarter
producing unrealized gains of $102 million in the quarter. These CPI-linked derivatives have
a notional value of approximately $109 billion, with the majority of the contracts based on
the underlying U.S. CPI index or the European Union CPI index. Further information is
available on page three of our press release where we have included a table of our
deflation swaps. On average, they have almost seven years to run. These contracts are
very volatile, but I've said this to you before, our CDS or credit default swap experience
comes to mind.
When you review our statements, please remember that when we own more than 20% of
a company, we equity account. And when we own more than 30%, we consolidate it so
that mark-to-market gains in these companies are not reflected in our results.
As you can see on page 12 of our quarterly report, the fair values of our investment in
associates is $1.8 billion which has a carrying value of $1.6 billion. An unrealized gain of $0.2
billion is not on our balance sheet. Investment gains have been an important component
of our returns over time. Since we began, we've had over $11 billion in realized and
unrealized gains.

On September 18, 2015, Fairfax Asia acquired a 35% ownership interest in Bank for
Investment and Development of Vietnam, a company that goes by the name of BIC for
approximately $48 million. BIC is a leading property and casualty insurer in Vietnam,
producing approximately $60 million of gross premiums written through an exclusive
arrangement with its majority shareholder, Bank for Investment and Development of
Vietnam, BIDV, to sell its products through the bank's distribution network.
Today, Fairfax announced that it has agreed with its joint venture partner, ICICI Bank, to
acquire an additional 9% of the issued and outstanding shares of ICICI Lombard General
Insurance Company from the bank. The proposed transaction values the company at
approximately U.S.$2.6 billion and is subject to government and regulatory approvals, and
expected to close in the first quarter of 2016.
Following shareholder approval on August 31, 2015, the company amended its articles to
preserve the then current 41.8% voting power of its multiple voting shares, which are
controlled by me, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The continuing
preservation of the 41.8% voting power of the multiple voting shares is subject to a
majority of the minority shareholder ratification vote in various circumstances. A big thank
you to all our shareholders for your support.
During the third quarter of 2015, Fairfax India completed the acquisition of NCML, National
Collateral Management Services, by acquiring an 88.1% interest for approximately $149
million. NCML is a leading private sector, agricultural commodity storage company in India.
On July 13, 2015, Fairfax India announced an open offer to acquire up to 26% of the
outstanding equity shares of IIFL Holdings, for approximately $250 million. The open offer
commenced on October 29, and will close on November 13, 2015. The transaction is

FINAL

subject to regulatory approvals in India and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of
2015. IIFL is a diversified financial services holding company in India.
As I've said to you many times, we continue to be very concerned about the prospects for
the financial markets and the economies of North America and Western Europe,
accentuated, as we have said many times before, by potential weakness in China and the
emerging markets. We believe there continues to be a big disconnect between the
financial markets and the underlying economic fundamentals.
As of September 2015, we have $7.7 billion of cash and short-term investments in our
portfolio, which is 27% of our total investment portfolios, to take advantage of
opportunities that may come our way. As a result, in the short term, our investment
income will be reduced.
Now I would like to turn it over to Dave Bonham, our CFO, so he can give you some
information on the underlying financials. Dave?

Thank you, Prem. First, I'll focus on Fairfax's consolidated results for the third quarter of
2015, and then we'll move on to the operating company results and then finish with the
consolidated financial position.
For the third quarter of 2015, Fairfax reported net earnings of $425 million or $18.16 per
fully diluted share, and that compared to the third quarter of 2014 when we reported net
earnings of $461 million or $20.68 per fully diluted share. Year-to-date, Fairfax's reported
net earnings is just a little over $464 million or $19 per fully diluted share, and that was in
contrast and a decrease to 2014 when we reported year-to-date net earnings of $1.6
billion or $73 per share on a fully diluted basis.
Underwriting profit at our insurance and reinsurance operations in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2015 increased to $177 million and $440 million with combined ratios
of about 91% in both periods. That compared to underwriting profits of $136 million and
$345 million in combined ratios of 91.2% and 92.3% in those same respective periods last
year. Quarter-to-date and year-to-date, underwriting profit was up $41 million and $95
million year-over-year. Our combined ratios benefited from somewhat higher net
favorable reserve development in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 of $151
million and $303 million, translating into about 8.6 – rather 8 and 6 combined ratio points
in each of those respective periods. That compared to net favorable reserve
development of $96 million and $227 million in the third quarter and first nine months of
2014, where that represented 6 and 5 combined ratio points in those periods.
Current period catastrophe losses were lower in 2015 and totaled $43 million or 2.2
combined ratio points in the third quarter, $108 million or 2.1 combined ratio points in the
first nine months. And by way of comparison, cat losses in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2014 were $65 million and $151 million, representing 4.2 and 3.4 combined ratio
points.

FINAL

Net premiums written by our insurance and reinsurance operations increased by 31% in
the third quarter of 2015 and by about 14% in the first nine months, and that reflected
principally the consolidation of Brit's net premium written of $412 million in the quarter,
$563 million on a year-to-date basis.
So, turning to our operating company results, starting with OdysseyRe. In the third quarter
and the first nine months of 2015, Odyssey reported underwriting profits of $62 million
and $191 million and combined ratios of about 89% in both periods, and that compared to
underwriting profits of $73 million and $290 million and combined ratios of about 88% in
the third quarter and the first nine months of 2014.
Catastrophe losses in the third quarter and the first nine months totaled $29 million and
$85 million, and that translated into about 5 combined ratio points in each of those
respective periods. And that compared to catastrophe losses of $41 million and $112
million last year in the third quarter and first nine months, which translated into 7 and 6
combined ratio points.

Bloomberg Transcript

OdysseyRe was affected by a significant non-catastrophe large loss in the third quarter,
the Tianjin port explosion in China, and that reduced its underwriting profit by $53 million
and increased its combined ratio by 9 percentage points in the third quarter and 3
percentage points in the first nine months.
OdysseyRe's combined ratios in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 included
the benefit of $66 million and $106 million of net favorable prior year reserve
development. That's about a 12 combined ratio points on the quarter, 6 year-to-date, and
that's principally related to casualty reserves and property catastrophe loss reserves.
OdysseyRe wrote $509 million and just a little over $1.6 billion of net premiums in the third
quarter and the first nine months of 2015, and that reflects decreases of about 13% and
10% during those respective periods. And that's after making an adjustment in the first
nine months of 2014 to the manner in which OdysseyRe recognizes premiums written in
respect to its U.S. crop business.
The decreases principally reflected the impact of a significant quota share reinsurance
contract that did not renew in 2015. And more specifically, in the second quarter of 2015,
this non-renewal resulted in the return of about $101 million of premium to the cedent and
that obviously impacted the first nine months net premium written. The adjustments I've
just referred to are set out in more detail on page 45 of our third quarter interim report.
Moving on to Crum & Forster. Crum & Forster's underwriting profits increased in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2015 to $6 million and $21 million at combined ratios of
about 98% in both periods. That compared to underwriting profit of $1 million and $5
million and combined ratios about 100% in each of the third quarter and nine months of
2014. And there is no net prior-year reserve development in either 2015 or 2014 at Crum
& Forster.

FINAL

Current period catastrophe losses were modest at $5 million and $12 million in the quarter
and the first nine months. And that compared to current period catastrophe losses of $1
million and $13 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2014.
Crum & Forster's net premiums written increased by 31% and 20% in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2015. That primarily reflected growth across several of its specialty
lines of business, improvements in the pricing of the casualty reinsurance that it
purchased, reductions in purchases of quota share and facultative reinsurance, and the
incremental impact of the Redwoods acquisition. And those were partially offset by
planned reductions in the legacy CoverX business.
At Zenith National, Zenith National reported underwriting profits in the third quarter and
the first nine months of $36 million and $97 million with corresponding combined ratios of
82.3% and 82.8%. And that compared to underwriting profits of $30 million and $64
million with combined ratios of 84% and 88% in each of the third quarter and first nine
months of 2014 respectively.

Bloomberg Transcript

The improvement in 2015 principally reflected a lower estimated current accident year
loss ratio. It was approximately 3 and 4 percentage points lower on a year-over-year basis
in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2015. And that was due to favorable loss
development trends for accident year 2014 that are starting to emerge in 2015.
There are also price increases that were equal to estimated loss transfer accident year
2015. And there was a higher net favorable development of prior year's reserves in 2015
when we measure it in dollar terms, and that represented 11 and 13 combined ratio points
in the quarter and first nine months of 2015. And that favorable emergence is principally
reflecting the favorable development of accident years 2011 and 2014.
Net premiums written by Zenith of $168 million and $642 million in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2015 increased by 10% and 8% year-over-year. And that principally
reflected an increase in exposure and some moderate premium rate increases.
Northbridge reported underwriting profits of $38 million and $57 million and combined
ratios of 83% and 92% in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2015. That
compared to underwriting profits of $14 million and $26 million in combined ratio points of
94%, 96% in those same periods last year.
The underwriting results in the third quarter and first nine months included the benefit of
net favorable prior year reserve development of $40 million and $59 million. That
represented 18 and 9 combined ratio points in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis,
and with that favorable emergence principally arising on accident years 2011 through 2014
and across most of their lines of business. That compared to net favorable development
of $14 million and $57 million last year in the third quarter and first nine months of 2014.
There were no material or current period catastrophe losses at Northbridge in the third
quarter and first nine months. And in Canadian dollar terms, net premiums written by
Northbridge in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 increased by 9% and 7%
Page 6 of 15



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2015-10-30

and that reflected increased renewal business, modest price increases across the group
combined with lower amounts of casualty reinsurance purchased in 2015.

FINAL

Fairfax Asia's underwriting profit of $5 million and $20 million and combined ratios of 90%
in each of the third quarter and the first nine months of 2015 compared to underwriting
profits of $17 million and $26 million and combined ratio points of 74% and 88% in each of
the comparable periods last year.
The combined ratios in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 included 14 and 9
combined ratio points of net favorable prior year reserve development and that's
primarily related to commercial automobile workers compensation loss reserves.
Net premiums written by Fairfax Asia decreased by 19% and 12% in the third quarter and
the first nine months of 2015. That reflected planned reductions in the commercial
automobile writings at Falcon, the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation and
an increase in premiums ceded to reinsurers, partially offset by the positive impact of the
acquisitions of Union Assurance and MCIS in 2015 and Fairfax Indonesia in 2014.

Bloomberg Transcript

The insurance and reinsurance other segment produced underwriting profits of $12 million
and $31 million at combined ratios of 89% and 91% in the third quarter and the first nine
months of 2015, and that compared to underwriting profits of $1 million and $5 million at
combined ratios of 99% and 98% in those same periods in 2014.
The improvement in underwriting profit in 2015 principally reflected increased net
favorable prior year reserve development and lower current period catastrophe losses.
Net premiums written by the insurance and reinsurance other segment increased by 26%
in the third quarter and 31% in the first nine months. The increase primarily reflected the
impact of the QBE reinsurance transactions at Polish Re where the majority of that
assumed premium was retained and also reflected an increase in assumed reinsurance
from Fairfax Asia.
Turning to Brit, Fairfax completed the acquisition of Brit earlier this year on June 5, 2015
and commenced consolidating Brit's financial reporting from that date. In the third quarter
of 2015, Brit contributed $412 million of net premiums written to the consolidated total
and produced an underwriting profit of $19 million at a 95.4% combined ratio.
Runoff reported an operating loss of $19 million in the third quarter of 2015, comparable
to its operating loss of $17 million in the third quarter of 2014.
Consolidated interest and dividend income increased from $74 million and $284 million in
the third quarter and first nine months of 2014 respectively to $106 million and $367 million
in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2015, reflecting interest income earned on
increased holdings of higher yielding bonds year-over-year.
Fairfax recorded an income tax provision of $141 million in the third quarter of 2015 at an
effective tax rate of 24%, slightly lower than our statutory tax rate of 26%, and that
Page 7 of 15

Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2015-10-30

FINAL

reflected the impact, among other things, of non-taxable investment income earned.
The income tax provision of $42 million in the first nine months of 2015 is at an effective
tax rate of 8%, and that reflects the impact of the gain on the sale of Ridley and in
connection with the Cara transaction that we did. Now those gains were either taxed at
capital gains rates in Canada or were on a tax deferred basis, and any taxes payable that
did remain on these transactions were offset through the application of unrecorded tax
losses from prior years.
We ended the third quarter with an investment portfolio inclusive of holding company
cash of $29.3 billion compared to $26.2 billion at the end of 2014. The majority of this
increase relates to the consolidation of the portfolio investments of Brit and Fairfax India,
partially offset by net unrealized depreciation of bonds and common stocks and the
unfavorable impact of foreign currency translations.
Moving to our financial position. Our total debt to total capital ratio decreased to 22.4% at
September 30, 2015, from 24.6% at December 31, 2014, primarily due to the increase in
our total capital outpacing the increase in our total debt. The increase in total debt
reflected the consolidation of the indebtedness of Brit, National Collateral Management
at Fairfax India and Cara, and that was partially offset by the repayment of $125 million of
OdysseyRe senior notes in the second quarter.

FINAL

I have one question on the investment portfolio and then one on the underwriting side, if
that's okay. So, my question on the investment portfolio is related to the put options you
recently acquired on the S&P 500. So, that seems to me like it's a little bit different than
the equity hedges you've been carrying for a number of years now. Thinking about it,
maybe more a bet on a decline in the equity markets over the next 12 months or so. Is
that the right way to think about it? Is that the way you're thinking about it?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

No. Those S&P put options, we acquired Brit, as you know, and some of the investment
arrangements, there's a three-month, six-month transition before we can get the money
into cash. And the S&P purchase protects us as we get into cash in those portfolios. So,
it's a very specific three-months, six-months type gating that these funds have, Paul, that
we've protected ourselves from.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Understood. Thank you. And then question related to the underwriting side of the
business. So, in most of your insurance subsidiaries, we're seeing significant favorable
reserve development, and you've talked about the conservative reserving there, so
understand the driver of that. But when we look at Crum & Forster, we're not seeing any
reserve development, either positive or negative. So, just wondering what's different
about the reserving practices there and if there's a different philosophy being used at
Crum & Forster versus...

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah. Just as an overall rule, we keep our accident year loss ratios at a high level and we
expect the reserves to come through. You're seeing it in Northbridge. You're seeing it in
OdysseyRe. And that's just the way we want to run our business. Our reserves are in
good shape.
In the case of Crum & Forster, we acquired First Mercury a few years ago. And we're just
wanting those reserves to develop favorably. We've had problems in, I guess, two years
go. And so, we are watching those reserves carefully, Paul. We want to make sure they're
conservatively reserved at. And then, I think over time, that'll happen, too. So, that's how
we've looked at our reserving. Our accident year loss ratios are high, and that's where the
reserves – it was the positive reserves development or redundancies come from.
We're expecting that to continue because our reserve positions are in very good shape.
You never can be 100% confident. But we, having been in this business for a long time
across the United States and many parts of the world, we feel comfortable about our
reserves.

Thank you, sir. Our next question is from Tom MacKinnon with BMO Capital. Your line is
now open, sir.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. A question...

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Hi, Tom.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

...about the acquisition of Lombard or the upping of your Lombard stake in India. So, you
went from the 26% to 35% now and they value all of the P&C insurance operation there in
the $2.6 billion-ish range. So, I guess, that 9% stake cost you certainly north of U.S.$200
million. Is there any metrics we could use to on a price to earnings or a price to book as to
what you paid for that piece?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah. We, of course, began that in 2001, 2002, Tom, and it'd be terrific if they allowed us
to go to 49% at that time. But the law didn't allow us, and so the law has just changed
recently as you know. And it's given us the ability to go to 49%. We went to 35% after a
negotiation with our partners.
The price that we paid on the existing company is very significant, but you're looking at a
country like India, 1.2 billion in population, you're looking at the number one private
insurance company. It's got a U.S.$1 billion in premium. It's expensed all of it. It's got, I don't
know, 250 branches, 5,000 people, all expensed.
And so, in that connection, the $2.6 billion for the largest company in that country, we
think, is reasonable. And, over time, we think that investment will do very well. So, we put
it in that perspective. We know the company very well, of course, because we began it
with ICICI Bank, and we have a very good relationship. We thought 35% was the
appropriate position to go to.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. And the commentary kind of remains the same with respect to the concern
of the financial markets in this quarter as it was in previous quarters. So, is there anything
you can share us in terms of the financial markets when, in fact, you would not be
concerned about the economic outlook or global sort of deflationary environment. What
would be the level that the markets have to be at and where would we be before you
would say, okay, we're not as concerned now?

A - David Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

So, Tom, we find the financial markets, as I said to you, the disconnect between the
economic fundamentals and the financial markets. It seems today that the Federal
Reserve and the ECB and all of the central banks, they're all-knowing. And we just
remember, we go back and remember that the Fed chairman, in June 30, 2007, about a
year before the crisis took place, the financial crisis, he said, real estate in the United
States is fairly valued. In June 30, 2008, months before Lehman went bankrupt, he said,
Fannie and Freddie were well-capitalized just months before they went bankrupt. So, I put
that in perspective to today's all-knowing Fed, ECB and all of the other central banks.
So, you'll recognize, we've had QE1, QE2 and QE3 and inflation in the midst of these
periods of QE1, QE2 and QE3. Inflation has fallen from 3.9% in September 2011 to 0%
today. So, you have no inflation, and in some places, deflation. Third quarter GNP in the
United States just came out 1.5%, which is very, very tepid economic growth in the midst
of six years of economic recovery.

So, we feel good with our position. Our CPI deflation swaps are up 40% in the quarter.
That's what they did in 2007. And, of course, 2008, you know what happened. So, when
you look at the economic environment, it's very weak. China has got all sorts of problems
that somehow the country continues to go forward. So, in this environment, we are
hedged in our common stock, we have a lot of cash, we have very little corporate bonds,
and we have $100 billion-plus in deflation swaps.
We think it hasn't produced for us in the last few years, no question about that. But I've
said to our shareholders and I've said to all of you that our objective here is not to lose
money, and there will be a time when the positioning of our portfolio like in 2007-2008
will do very well. But at this point in time, we're very conservative, very downside,
protection-oriented, and we like where we are. But if we see opportunities, we'll take
advantage of it but, we think you have to be very careful.

Q - Andrew Paul Hof er

{BIO 15345096 <GO>}

And thank you, by the way, for another incredibly comprehensive quarterly letter. It's a
pleasure relative to most of the companies we follow. I was hoping, instead of ask
questions about financials, to get your insight on the energy industry, where the tide has
really gone out, and I see your investment in SandRidge and the new transaction with
EXCO. And I was wondering if you could shed a little light on how those of us who are
value seekers in the energy industry and have been so humbled by the double dip in oil
might be thinking about value traps in this environment.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So, yeah, Andrew, you know it's public. We've put money into EXCO in a bond, five-year
bond, approximately 13% interest. We like John Wilder, who has taken over the company,
who's got a terrific track record, demonstrated track record that you can see, two
turnarounds to his name. And so we're supporting the company with the $300 million that
we put in in the second lien bonds, which they've exchanged a significant amount for
unsecured bonds.
We do think – we agree with what you said, the tide has gone away, but the price of oil
could go down. And, naturally, gas prices have come down significantly already. But the
price of oil could go down further. And then, we remember days long gone where almost
no one wanted to invest in the oil and gas industry as the price of oil went down in 1986,
1987, when the price of oil went to $10. So we might still see some downside. But this is
the time to be looking at it and we continue to look at opportunities in that area.
Tori, next question, please.

Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Dwelle with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is
now open.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning. A couple of questions, actually.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Hi, Mark.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

The first one – Yeah. Good morning, Prem. First one, I was wondering if you could just
provide a short update on some of your Greek investments. I would expect they've
recovered a little bit over the course of the third quarter. But I want to get an update on
what the total exposure is there at September 30.

FINAL

Yes. Mark, the exposure hasn't changed much from what we talked about. The
investments that we have in Greece have done neutral to well, with the exception of the
Eurobank. And the Eurobank – Eurobank has suffered from the fact that there are capital
controls on banks in Greece. They're now going through a recapitalization and
examination of their capital position. And there'll be a decision made in the next few
weeks to a month, and we're just into that.
We like the management of Eurobank. We like their performance. We think they're well
capitalized. But, of course, it's not what we think but what the ECB thinks and the
European authorities think in terms of the capital of Eurobank. On the other hand, we've
got some Greek bonds that as Greek government rates have come down, we've
benefited from that.
So, all in all, we like our Greek position. The Eurobank is still in the throes of being – their
capital positions being decided in the next month. So, we'll just have to wait and see what
happens there.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. The second question I had has to do somewhat, I guess, with Brit. I know in the
fourth quarter is when the company normally has its outside actuarial review and revisits
all of its various assumptions and so forth. And I guess I was curious as to whether you had
some thoughts on how Brit's reserves line up with Fairfax's, whether there'll be some
need to add reserves to kind of bring them into line with the rest of the Fairfax book, or if
they're fairly healthy already on their own, and we're not likely to see any charge for that?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

No, that's a good question, Mark. No, we feel very comfortable with their reserves. That's
why we acquired the company, of course. But we feel very comfortable with the reserves.
You'll know that we took the runoff of their UK company and that's going extremely well.
And so, we have a good sense of what their reserves have been in the past, and all our
reserve work that our own actuaries have done on Brit have been very comfortable. So,
we don't see any problems on their reserves. In fact, as one of the previous questions,
we will expect reserve redundancies as we go forward in the future.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay, very good. Thanks.

Q - Mikel Abasolo

{BIO 3756596 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you very much for taking my questions and good morning to you all.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning. Good morning, Mikel.

Q - Mikel Abasolo

{BIO 3756596 <GO>}

Good morning. Yes. Mr. Watsa, sharing your concerns and your views on deflation, on the
deflationary environment and the fact that prices have come down despite QE1, QE2 and
QE3, I worry about the Mario Draghis and Kurodas of this world finally succeeding in their
attempts. And I was wondering, haven't you studied the deflationary period of the 1930s
and Japan in the last 20 years? Aren't you actually concerned that with the clear
determination in a fiat money system, aren't you concerned that they will finally succeed?

Bloomberg Transcript

And perhaps in the case of the Bank of Japan, they're, if I'm correct, buying something in
the order of 16% of their GDP in Japanese government bonds every year, whereas their
deficit is something like in the order of 6% of GDP. Meaning that in three years, they could
end up by owning like 100% of the government debt of their own country.
And this is mindboggling, but to my mind, I sometimes question why did they – if the
market allows them to go all the way to that and own the whole thing, the whole
indebtedness of the country, which is huge, being owned by the central bank, effectively
meaning that the government owns nothing to anybody because the Bank of Japan is
obviously government owned. And so they could start all over again, I mean, which is
Japan going Venezuela and Argentina without consequences. Am I crazy or do you
consider this scenario feasible at all? Thank you very much.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Well, thank you for asking that question. And, of course, no one really knows the answer
to it. The banks have – central banks have continued and the United States they've
stopped now. They may, of course, if we get a recession. The question is, what do they
do if the economy goes into a recession? We've had 1.5% growth in the third quarter.
That's not significant. And I'm just pulling numbers out of the air. But, say, it goes in to
0.5% or minus 0.5%, the worry we have is the central banks in the United States or
elsewhere have no ammunition. And so, ultimately, the way to come out of this is to have
the U.S. government or the European government spend money on infrastructure or
elsewhere, except that they have a lot of debt. They have a ton of debt not reflected in
the interest rates because interest rates are very low. But I don't think that's in the cards.
Right now, it's a monetary solution. And I think what you say is right. They'll experiment
with it.
But one of these days, Mikel, we might feel that the Fed or the other central banks have
no ammunition. They've tried everything in the past and it hasn't worked. And we worry
about things like that. And all of this experimentation is taking place when markets are
high and spreads are low.

Interest rates are rising. The spreads are rising for corporate bonds in the United States,
particularly. So, we feel our position of being defensive is the right one to be. But, of
course, there's an opportunity cost to it, and we've had that in the last few years. We
understand that. But as I have said in our annual report, we think it'll – we could recoup
that relatively quickly if conditions change.

FINAL

Thank you for that question, Mikel. Tori, any further questions?
