FINAL

Thanks, James. And good afternoon and good morning to everyone on the phone. So
just to begin with, overall business operating proﬁt for the Group was $1.3 billion in the
First Quarter and net income attributable to shareholders was $1.2b. Both numbers are
about 5% lower than in the prior-year period.
As you all know, currency has been a signiﬁcant feature of the First Quarter. And it's likely
to continue to be a feature over the course of this year. Currency is mainly a translational
issue for us because we typically match the local currency liabilities and assets. And on a
constant currency basis, BOP would have been broadly ﬂat. And the 5% decline in gross
premiums written we've announced in GI would have been a 5% increase.
From an operating performance perspective, we see this as a solid start to the year both
in terms of top line and BOP, albeit with results for both Q1 and the prior period
beneﬁting from a very low level of catastrophes. And we have a number of positive oneoﬀ items in both.
Let me turn to one other topic before I start the Q&A. With respect to solvency, you've
seen that both Z-ECM and SST ratios have declined in the second half of last year. The ZECM ratio reduced from 126% at the half year to 122% at the end of the year. And SST
declined from 215% to 196% over the same period.

Bloomberg Transcript

There are three moving parts. So the ﬁrst impact net of market movements is mainly ﬂatter
and lower yield curves, which reduced Z-ECM by around 6% and SST by around 13%. It's
not all yield. But most of it is.
Second, allowing for expected growth that we expect to see in the business in (2014),
that's had a negative 4-point impact on Z-ECM and a negative 5 on SST.
Then thirdly. And for Z-ECM only, these factors were partially oﬀset by a change in how we
model certain investment risks. This had a beneﬁt of around 6percentage points.
The interest rate sensitivity that you see in the capital ﬁgures that we've disclosed today is
greater than the previously disclosed simple parallel shift that we've given for two
reasons. First and most important is convexity and our positioning. And the second is the
second; and third-order eﬀects that interest rates have on risk capital. And that has a
particularly pronounced impact on SST.
Looking into the developments since the end of last year, we'd expect to see the Z-ECM
ratio move lower in Q1 given the combined impact of currency movements and a further
ﬂattening and decline in bond yields, among other factors. And our best estimate is that
we'll see a ratio in the upper half of our target range. In other words, still a very
comfortable level. And given the levers that we have at our disposal to manage the
overall risks, this does not impact our view of the deployable capital that we hold.
With that, we'll open up for Q&A.

Questions And Answers
Operator

FINAL

(Operator Instructions) Michael Huttner, JPMorgan.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Actually, yes, thank you very much. Two questions. I must say I actually thought these were
really good results. But within that, because you've beaten a number of my estimates,
where's -- you have this target range for return on equity of 12% to 14%. You reported
12.9%, which is excellent, excluding one-oﬀs, 11.2%. So my two questions which are both
on this.
Which, from your point of view, is actually the right ﬁgure? Is it the reported or the
adjusted? And what's -- where is the main miss coming from? Is it still in life? Or are we
seeing a bit of a drift also in non-life now? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Is that both of your questions, Michael?

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That's it. Yes.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Okay. So which is right? Obviously they're both right because they're both calculation.
One is a headline number. But I think the more meaningful one is the underlying ROE
performance because it -- that gives you a better sense of what you could expect from a
go forward. And of course that's particularly relevant for the remainder of this year and
next year to make sure that we're in that 12% to 14% ROE range.
If you look at the driver of why we're not where we expect to be, I think there are probably
two key pieces. I think one is the same theme that you heard from us at the end of last
year. So it's mainly GI. If you look at the GI combined ratio, if we adjust for cats and for
one-oﬀ expense on both sides, the underlying ex-cat combined ratio hasn't changed very
much; in fact it's almost exactly the same.
If you drill into it, we have a small improvement in attritional, which we believe is oﬀset by
large loss. But of course the large loss piece is an estimate rather than a science. Overall
though, we need about 2; to 3-point improvement over where we ended last year on GI.
We've only made a relatively small step in the right direction. So we need much more
from GI to be in that 12% to 14% range.
Second is capital. We're still carrying more capital than we need. That obviously
depresses the overall ROE. And as we've highlighted before and I guess we'll discuss

Page 3 of 18



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2015-05-07

during the course of this call, certainly we'll discuss again on May 21, capital deployment
also has to ﬁgure in us achieving that 12% to 14% ROE.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi there. One straightforward question. The large loss noise you alluded to in Q1, is that
still the same area that's generating large losses that generated large losses in Q4, which I
think was things like, for example, US commercial auto, Brazilian surety or is it new areas?
And maybe just give us a sense as to is it revealing any issues or is it genuinely random?
Then on capital, you said in your opening comments, I think maybe I misheard you, that
there was an eﬀect in the required anticipate -- required capital 2014 growth. But I thought
the ECM and SST took into account anticipated organic growth for 2015. So it's forwardlooking in its requirements. Maybe if you just clarify that. And if that is the case, what level
of organic growth is penciled into that number? And is that one of the levers, I guess, the
ﬁnancing of that future growth when you talk about levers and things you can pull?
Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So on the second one ﬁrst, I misspoke. It's absolutely 2015. Thank you for that. I guess as
one of the levers, I guess levers sounds odd. I guess it's a margin of prudence that we
have in the calculation. We've got about negative 4 and negative 5 points on Z-ECM and
SST.
I apologize, I don't really want to give you a forecast for volumes for the year. But we -even with the growth that we see in Q1, we're well beneath the level of growth that we
had planned for and allowed for the capital calculations that you see. So we'd have a
signiﬁcant reduction in both that 4 and 5 if the current trend continued through the
remainder of the year.
On the large loss side, I'm not sure whether it's good news or bad news. But they are
completely diﬀerent from Q4. We have a large corporate loss in North America. It's by far
the largest single loss in the quarter. And we have some large losses in Europe, in
particular the municipal business in the UK stands out as the source of two of them. So
they're completely diﬀerent from what you saw last year.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

The issues that cropped up in Q4, have they calmed down? Has there been development
on them or have they not really come across your desk in Q1?

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

If you look at large losses overall, it's actually a touch higher than it was in Q4. But the
theme, I guess there are no themes in large losses, are there? But the large losses that
have occurred, you don't see the Brazilian topic crop up again and the other items you
saw even then looked as though they were one-oﬀs. So the themes in Q1 are completely
diﬀerent on the large loss side.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Operator
Andrew Broadﬁeld, Barclays.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Hi there. Good afternoon. Two questions. First one on the need for capital for the growth,
you mentioned just now that you -- the Q1 had missed what you had hoped to achieve
and therefore to consume. Can you just give us a little bit of an outline on where that -why you failed to reach that growth target, what part of the business it was in and where
you think you might be able to catch back up over the course of the year?
Then the second question is also in relation to solvency but in terms of what you
anticipate. You talked about levers. Does it take into account things like the steady decline
in Farmers Re quota share, etc.? That, although I know it's not in stone, is your intention.
And I see the surplus improved again in the quarter at Farmers. So does it capture those
sorts of actions within your plan?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So Andy, on the ﬁrst one, all I can say in response to that, it's broadly across GI. If you look
at GI in Q1, we've got pretty strong growth in global corporate. We actually think the
headline there tends to overstate the growth that we expect to see from global corporates
for the year.
Rate is generally still modestly positive. It continues the trend that we've seen through the
course of last year, even if the absolute numbers by the various businesses or territories
move around.
Where can we catch up? I don't know yet. We're obviously looking to ﬁnd sources of
proﬁtable growth. And we've allowed for that in the capital requirement that we forecast
for the year. I think it's too early to declare that we will or won't achieve that, albeit we're
behind already in Q1.

FINAL

On the solvency side, the anticipated levers, Farmers Re is -- I guess it's not a lever
currently because it's -- we'll have the reduction already baked into the new ﬁgures for
this year, which is the beneﬁt of the -- the immediate beneﬁt of the piece that's reinsured
into ZIBB or Zurich Bermuda branch.
The levers I was thinking of are more of a combination of our ability to manage the
required capital on the risk side because of the choices that we take and the way we
allocate that capital. It's no surprise that the main consumer of capital requirements is
market risk. And that's something that the ﬁrm can choose to have more of or less of as it
sees ﬁt.
On the available side, that's obviously a bit -- slightly trickier to manage it. We can
manage capital structure, which can be helpful. But mainly on the available side, it would
be the outcome of the year in terms of a ﬁnance performance and the impact of ﬁnancial
markets on the overall equity position that we have. But the levers for me are more
obviously focused on the risk-based capital requirements and what we can do there to
inﬂuence our capital consumption.

Q - Andrew Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

So sorry, is it fair to assume that you make no assumptions around reduction in capital
needs because of natural run oﬀ or changes that we, as a market, I guess we're expecting
on Farmers Re and other areas?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

No.

Q - Andrew Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Okay. All right. Thank you.

Operator
Paul De'Ath, RBC.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yes. Hi there. Just a couple of questions on the life performance again, on Latin America
speciﬁcally. So you've had obviously good performance in the Santander JV. But slightly
disappointing in the Zurich-branded vehicles in Latin America. What's the driver there? Is
that an active choice to favor the Santander JV or is there something else going on there?
That's question one.
And secondly, just looking at the ﬂows -- the net ﬂows in the life business, the European
ﬂows have been very strong in the quarter compared to prior years. What's the key drivers
behind that? Is that the corporate life and pensions business in the UK? And how much of
that is coming from winning new schemes and how much is from general auto-enrolment
type growth.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

FINAL

Thanks, Paul. So ﬁrst of all on the life performance in Latin America, it's not that we prefer
the joint venture but we haven't -- we have one particularly large contract that we haven't
rewritten this year. So that's largely why you've seen the underperformance on the Zurichbranded element of Latin America. Having said that, of course the -- I guess the contracts
are sharper because of the very strong performance of the JV. It's produced a very, very
strong growth in Q1.
On the net ﬂows in Europe, I guess there are two or three main drivers. As you hint, CLP in
the UK is a piece of it and it's a combination of both new schemes and contained
enrolment. And also new product in Germany. So we have a new product that we
distribute through a bancassurance partner and that's also had a positive impact on ﬂows
within Q1.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Is that a unit-linked-type product or is protection or what?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'd guess you would describe it as a hybrid product. So it's -- if you look at our product
mix, we don't sell signiﬁcant volumes with guarantees. But typically many of the products
have guaranteed elements. And this is a new product with a guaranteed element rather
than an overall guarantee.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Great. Thanks.

Operator
Stefan Schuermann, Bank Vontobel.

Q - Stefan Schuermann

{BIO 3235442 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions. The ﬁrst one still on the life part. You showed
basically new business margins down in so-called other retail, which I think is mostly due
to the traditional agent business in Germany and Switzerland. Can you maybe -- can we
expect that stabilize or do you take any corrective action here, like cutting commission, or
will that continue?
Then the second one on the Farmer surplus ratio that's standing at 39%. And you guide
towards a decrease of 33% to 36% in the near future. So I'm not quite sure to understand
why that should drop there.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Okay. So Stefan, on the ﬁrst one, you're right; it is mainly Germany and Switzerland and
it's the impact of rates on the business there. I think in the short term I don't expect it to
Page 7 of 18



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2015-05-07

stabilize. So I think you'll see a further reduction in new business values given the further
reduction that we saw in rates in Q1 for both those markets.

Q - Stefan Schuermann

{BIO 3235442 <GO>}

FINAL

Maybe to -- volumes basically are up, new business volumes are up and margins are
down. So you just continue like that or you don't take any corrective action there?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So two things. So I guess we do take corrective action. So if you look at where we sit in the
league table on certain key measures, such as bonus, we're not at the top end by far. It's
too early to determine what the outcomes for this year will be. But that's one of the levers
that we have to signiﬁcantly impact the overall ﬁnancial performance. And there has to be
a close correlation between what we're earning in the portfolio and what we share with
the policyholder. That's one of the key levers for us.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think just be careful. On new business value you could optimize purely for new business
value. And I think you'd end up with potentially an even more negative outcome. So I
think we try and look at both new business value and BOP when we're trying to make
decisions about where we would prioritize growth. Germany and Switzerland are both
very diﬃcult though because of where interest rates are.
On surplus for Farmers. So the key reason you haven't seen it fall straight back into the
target range is because of the way the calculation is done. The calculation is based on net
written. So it's actually as they recapture the reinsurance, you'll see a bit more strength as
a few more quarters come by. And that will cause, all things being equal and dependent
on the earnings at the exchanges, the surplus ratio to fall. And we would expect to see it,
again depending on the actual ﬁnancial performance, fall back into the exchanges target
range.

Q - Stefan Schuermann

{BIO 3235442 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Operator
Nick Holmes, Societe Generale.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hi there. Thank you very much. Two questions. First is on the GI expense ratio. Just
wondered if you could share with us how you see the Q1 result developing throughout
the year. I was really thinking, I guess, the upfront distribution costs that have taken us up
31%. Are they going to continue? And is 31% the sort of number that you would expect to
see?
Then the second question is on US commercial pricing. Just wondered again how you see
this developing. 2% rate change seems a pretty good result. Does this sum, do you think,
Page 8 of 18



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2015-05-07

throw doubt on what MarketScout have been saying about the appearance of a soft
market? Thank you.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you. So on the ﬁrst one on the GI expense ratio, what you see for this quarter,
before we take action on the eﬃciency side, is pretty what you'd expect. So there's no
reason why, for example, the impact of the distribution would increase or decrease
through the course of the year.
Having said that, I guess I made it clear at the year end and we're working on it currently,
that the expense ratio that we see is too high. And that's a topic we'll speciﬁcally address
when we have the investor update on May 21. So for the time being, based on what you
see currently, the current level is reasonably indicative of what you would expect. But we
have intentions to bring that number down.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Right. And sorry, can I just ask, would that be for this year or is that looking out over the
medium term, two, three years? Or perhaps you'd prefer to wait until the Investor Day to
tell us.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Well the one thing I will say, Nick, is that medium term would be too long, with two to
three years. As I mentioned to Michael in response to Michael's question, an
improvement is required to make sure that we achieve the required return on equity that
we have as a target. So that means it needs to be achieved over the course of the next 18
months.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On US commercial pricing the -- I guess the challenge is that -- it's bumped around a bit if
you look at our rate monitor. I'm not sure I would describe it as a particularly positive
environment. We've been in a position in the US for some time now where the rate
change is roughly in line with loss cost inﬂation.
Q1, I think we've seen the market respond to some of the challenges. But where evident
from a number of companies, including us in Q4, for example, in commercial auto, we've
seen a number of areas where rate increase has been pushed through. But if you look at
the market overall, we're still in the position where rate is covering what we think loss cost
is increasing by, which means that margin is not currently expanding.
And also if you look at the individual lines, property still has pressures. That story hasn't
changed recently. And auto workers' comp has a bit of pressure currently. So -- but I don't

Page 9 of 18

think it's particularly negative. I think I mentioned on the full-year call that I didn't share
MarketScout's more negative outlook for the full year. But we certainly haven't turned any
corners on the US pricing environment. And to be honest, I don't expect to see that take
place over the course of this year. I think we'll see continued pressure.

FINAL

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Right. Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
Farooq Hanif, Citigroup.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you very much. I apologize if this question has been asked because I wasn't
right at the beginning of the call. But looking at your Z-ECM ratio, you make the comment
obviously that Q1 has been tough because of interest rates. And obviously that's reversed
quite strongly in Q2. So presumably if this is maintained, the current environment, then
you will recover back up to the upper end of your capital rates or above the upper end.
That's one question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then secondly, you have this 4 points of business proﬁt uplifting your Z-ECM ratio. Is that
a -- can we just normalize that for the year? And presumably you'll grow pre dividend 8
points a year in that Z-ECM ratio. Is that kind of a decent rule of thumb?
And lastly, in global life, you've mentioned that going to the $350 million or above the
$350 million was harder because of FX. Has that got worse or better based on
movements to date? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Farooq. So ﬁrst on Z-ECM. So the only comments I provided are through the end
of the quarter. And I've commented on the fact that given the continuing move on yield
curves, we expected to see Z-ECM come down and we expect to be in the upper half of
our range. And we still believe we're in a comfortable position because of the extent to
which we can control our capital consumption.
I'm going to avoid commenting on what's happened post the end of the quarter. I guess I
may mention that when we come back on the Investor Day. Interest rates, as they rise,
particularly at the long end, particularly in some of the European markets certainly would
be helpful. But I think we're going to be in a relatively volatile period for a time. So it will
go up and down a bit. But I think the good news certainly from our perspective is that we
have enough ﬂexibility to manage.
On the business proﬁt piece, the -- so I'm not sure exactly which -- so I guess if you're
looking at the waterfall chart, you need to be a wee bit careful that you've got the
business proﬁt on one side and then you've got dividend on the other. So given the

Page 10 of 18



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2015-05-07

FINAL

payout ratios, you tend to ﬁnd that we pay back to our shareholders a very large
proportion of the economic proﬁt that we generate. So if it's 4.5 points and we have an
accrual of, say, 3 points within the 5 that we've disclosed for dividend, it tends to be a
relatively modest addition to the overall capital base because we're handing it back.
On the GL topic, maybe to give GL a bit of credit for what they have achieved, I think if we
had stuck simply to the more than $350 million a quarter based on the foreign exchange
levels when we ﬁrst announced it, we'd be there already. But having said that, when we
talk about more than $350m, we actually had in our mind a lot more than $350m.
Today as FX moves and particularly euro weakens against the franc, given the
preponderance of earnings that GL has there, it becomes tougher. But when we looked at
it earlier in the year, we were just above $350 million in terms of expectation once all the
improvements had come through from GL.
The one point I'd like to add though, I was asked on the full-year call about GI and GI's
expectation of growing their earnings by 5% comp. And I commented there that of course
I didn't expect then to compensate for any possible FX movement. And the same is true
for GL.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we've stuck to the $350m. It's become tougher because of foreign exchange. But
they've done a lot of what we'd expected of them already when we ﬁrst announced this.
But we still hold to the more than $350m.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. That's really clear. Thank you very much.

Operator
James Shuck, UBS.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. I have two questions, please. Apologies for returning to the Z-ECM
number. But I just wanted to pick up on something you said earlier on, George, that two
of the reasons why the ROE is not hitting your target at the moment is, on the one hand,
the GI combined ratio. But on the other hand, you have more capital than you need. I'm
just struggling to see why that's the case because you're targeting 100 to 120 of Z-ECM
and you're currently, on a Q1 basis, towards the upper end of that range.
I appreciate you've got some levers to manage. But I just wanted to understand whether
you've actually got surplus capital and that's the way I should look at it, or whether this is
more a case of, well, we're going to pull some of those levers and then that will release
capital. And if that's the case, I just wanted to be clear that there's no modeling change to
the plan. That is strictly around the required capital management. And when you consider
the required capital, you're also considering what the impact is on the potential earnings

Page 11 of 18

FINAL

growth, because obviously if you take less market risk than the outlook for earnings, it will
come down even if volatility is improved. So that's my ﬁrst question.
Secondly, just around the underlying accident -- the underlying loss ratio and the ex prior
year. So if I look at the accident year, loss ratio improved 70bps in Q1 year on year. You
had a higher large losses of about 1 point and lower nat cat of about 40 basis points. So in
theory you have about 130 basis points of underlying loss ratio improvement there. I was
just hoping for some insight geographically where that's been coming from, please.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Okay. So let me try and do the ﬁrst one. So on the ﬁrst one, I guess we've been pretty
clear. Given the target range, we would try and measure ourselves oﬀ the midpoint of the
target range. So 110. And if you think back to prior conversations about how much capital
excess we had, we would often -- well I would often talk about the fact that if we have 16
points, 16 translates into, let's say, around $6b. But we don't have $6 billion because we
have other constraints. And therefore we'd use the shorthand of 3. And in fact that was
the basis for that additional step that you saw in the ROE walk that I presented back in
London in December.

Bloomberg Transcript

So part of what's happened to the second part of last year and the early part of this year is
that I guess the constraints have come more into line with each other. Some of the rating
models don't move as rapidly in response to some of these things as the Z-ECM. And in
particular the SST. So the numbers have come down. But I guess the constraint picture has
changed, if that makes any sense. So I don't see a fundamental change in the ﬂexibility
that we have.
On top of that, you're right; we have the ability to manage required capital. We need to
be careful that we don't give up eﬃcient earnings as part of that. But again, our peak
capital requirement is for the ﬁnancial market risk. And that's certainly something we
manage actively and we have done in the past and we continue to do in the future.
Would modeling changes be part of the story? It would not. I think the -- one of the big
diﬀerences you see between the two numbers today, between SST and Z-ECM, is that ZECM has the beneﬁt of what we think is a signiﬁcant improvement in the way that we
model market and credit risk and the tail.
I think in due course we'll review that and may propose that to FINMA for inclusion in SST.
But of course the acceptance of that by FINMA is purely at the discretion. And I would
imagine that it would take some time from the point at which we would propose it. And
we do need to manage the gap between Z-ECM and SST. So model change couldn't be a
signiﬁcant factor.

And just to clarify one point, any decision on capital that you may not need, either
because you can't ﬁnd sources for it or it might make sense to return that, that
presumably would be a year-end decision.

FINAL

From where we stand today, yes. So I think the -- we'd make it -- again, going back to what
I said at the year end, we work broadly to an annual cycle. So as we come up to the year
end, we make any decisions there. But what we see in terms of inorganic or organic
opportunities ahead of us versus return to shareholders in the early part of 2016 is
decisive for us.
Underlying loss ratio. So I didn't quite understand the walk that you did. In my head I
guess the numbers on the combined ratio were that the -- if you adjust for some of the
one-oﬀ expense in the prior year, if you adjust for the cat ﬂuctuation, we're about the
same, that we have a positive impact and the attritional oﬀset by negative on the large
loss. So there's about a 60-, 70 basis-point improvement rather than -- you mentioned 130
basis points. But you may have included some of the things I'm normalizing out in my
head.
The improvements we see are combination of various items. So it's something that we
expect to drive proﬁtability over the course of this year. So portfolio management, we
describe it as tiering. So obviously emphasizing the positive parts of the portfolio and
looking for signiﬁcant rate in the weaker areas. And I mentioned commercial auto earlier
in the conversation.

Bloomberg Transcript

We've had some small steps on turnaround. So obviously Russia, from a loss perspective,
is no longer in the picture. South Africa is slightly better, albeit Brazil is probably slightly
worse than it was before. But those drivers are mainly the drivers of what we perceive the
attritional loss ratio improvement to be in Q1.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

And North America commercial, how has the attritional loss ratio developed there at Q1?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Well overall, North America commercial has improved, both from underlying attritional
and from a PYD perspective. So the results in North America commercial stand out as one
of the -- as very positive Q1 this year over Q1 last year.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you. Good day, everyone. Two questions. Number one, on the investment income
side, we calculated you had a sharp drop year on year in regular investment income of 38
basis points. And I wonder, although in the context of, George, what you've just
discussed, should we now expect Zurich to re-risk to mitigate a further sharp drop in the
investment income or should we actually expect Zurich to de-risk in order to get more
room to maneuver on the capital side? I'm not clear about that.
And the second question on the capital, I think there are more changes, of course. But in
the end would assume (116). The model change is not, as you said, available in SST. And
therefore from an outside perspective, SST appears the more robust metric. If I
extrapolate the Z-ECM number you gave for Q1, I would say that SST is probably around
the 180s now after Q1. And I wonder if you also have a threshold for this externally
certiﬁed capital metric. So how low would you be willing to go on SST before it gets
painful?

Bloomberg Transcript

So if I start with the ﬁrst one, again going back to the full year, we indicated that we had
decided that we would change asset allocation in a couple of areas. And that was
predominantly in equities. So we've given Cecilia and the team a 1% shift in the equity
asset allocation predominantly away from ﬁxed income.
On top of that, the IM team already had an existing strategy around illiquids. They've
been completing that. They haven't completed it yet but they've been continuing to do
that through the course of this year. And those two steps were really the only steps that
we had planned to take on the asset side to help mitigate the impact of negative rates in
some of the countries we discussed earlier in the call.
Will we take further steps? No. Cecilia has the ability to tactically decide to be slightly long
or slightly short depending on market circumstances. But we have no further intention to
shift the (SAA).
On Z-ECM and SST, I guess you can get a sense of where we're comfortable from an SST
perspective from where we've operated in the past. 196 is still a very strong position for
the Company to operate at. I'm not sure you can do what you just did and extrapolate the
thing straight line. If you look at the moves we've had both for Q1 and some of the
comments around what happened in April/May, I wouldn't get to the same level that
you've estimated. But Z-ECM is where our focus is.
It think the point that you make though that we need to manage the gap is absolutely
true. We haven't set a formal ﬂoor for SST as we would expect over time Z-ECM and SST
to remain somewhat in some kind of harmony. But SST is not a formal part of the risk
tolerance. And we're still very well capitalized under SST.

If anything, I would have expected SST to react more from it than macro risk materially in
Q1 compared to Z-ECM. And that is also what we have seen in 2014, isn't it?

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I think that's what I said at the beginning of the call. So SST reacts more strongly,
principally because of things like market value margins and the way that calculation is
done.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

And hence I would have expected that the 196 you reported at the year end after Q1, it's
easily in the 180s if you have a 10% drop on Z-ECM after Q1. That's just my -- of course not
a linear extrapolation here.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yes. I tried to give guidance around Z-ECM because we see that as the essential capital
measure for us. I haven't given guidance around SST.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, George.

Q - Niccolo Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Just one follow-up question. On a comment you made at the
beginning of the call regarding the 2, 3 points combined ratio improvement needed in GI
to bring you closer to the center of the target ROE, could you give us any sense of how
big a role expense ratio improvement compared to underlying loss ratio improvement
have to play in there? Or do we have to wait a couple of weeks to get more clarity on
that? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

We'll do much more in a couple of weeks when we have the Investor Day. But we already
said that of the 2 to 3 points' improvement, broadly about one-third from expense, almost
one-third from turnaround and the remainder from portfolio management. That's roughly
how we expect it to break down.

FINAL

Good afternoon. Just two questions. Firstly we talked about pricing in diﬀerent markets.
But if you had to look at how the rate evolution has been compared to the claims, how
would those two compare on a Group level?
Secondly, on the FMS business, there was commentary in terms of an uptick in terms of
the expenses. Is that one-oﬀ or is this the number going forward?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So rate versus claims, broadly in line with each other. It varies market to market. But from a
Group perspective one broadly equals the other.
On FMS. So the comment on expenses was due to the fact that last year we had a margin
on FMS of about 7.2%. And I guess we'd guided that we'd be at 7% over the course of this
year and next year. And we've arrived at 7% a bit more quickly, I think, than we had
anticipated. That's due to that expense feature. But I don't expect it to go further. 7% is
where it's (going to).

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Yes. And it is just one question. Thank you very much for all the answers from that. So life,
$350m. You're keeping your target. That's brilliant. Or over $350m. We achieved $319m.
Which reasons or which levers or which -- do you think there's a little bit of -- are there
easy wins?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I think Kristof would shoot me for describing any of what he has to do as easy wins. I think
the broad (book) is, Michael, via a combination of I guess what we refer to as in-force
management in some of the more mature European markets. So that means expenses,
persistency management, those types of things.
I think on the more positive side of it, given the growth that you've seen again from the
joint venture with Santander in the quarter, we expect that also to be a pretty signiﬁcant
contributor to the growth on the positive side of what life is doing. Those will be the two
most obvious areas we expect further improvement from life.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

And if I may just very brieﬂy, if you were to consider selling the remainder of your UK
business in a runoﬀ deal, closed block or whatever, what impact would that have on your
ROE metric?

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

The -- so I guess the only straight answer I can give that, Michael, is that we don't expect
to sell the remainder of our UK life business.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

In general we're looking at the entire life back book for opportunities to try and optimize,
to ﬁnd maybe parts of the portfolio that we ﬁnd better owners who perceive a higher
value. And that certainly would continue. But our life business in general is actually
expected to contribute strongly positively to some of the strategic priorities that life has
currently, particularly CRP.
