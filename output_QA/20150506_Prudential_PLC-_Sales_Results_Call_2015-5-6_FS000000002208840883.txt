MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Hello and welcome to the Prudential Plc 2015 First Quarter IMS Conference call. And just
to remind you this conference call is being recorded.
Today I'm pleased to present Group Chief Executive, Tidjane Thiam. Please begin your
meeting.

Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Thanks, Jerry, and good morning everyone. I am joined this morning by Mike Wells, Jackie
Hunt, Nic Nicandrou and Pierre-Olivier Bouée. The group has made a positive start to
2015, driven by a very strong performance from Asia. Our first quarter performance is well
aligned with our strategy, which as you know is to grow in growth markets, in our case
Asia, while we flex volumes in the more difficult mature markets of the U.S. and U.K. to
deliver earnings and cash to our shareholders.
In these first quarter performance comments I will continue to use the constant currency
basis to discuss our Asian and U.S. businesses, to maintain comparability with the
comments we made in the first quarter 2014.

FINAL

So in this first quarter the group has reported new business profit of £496 million and APE
of £1.25 billion. Within these headline figures Asia, which is the only region where we have
explicit profit growth of 50s (1:24) has made excellent progress. In Life, Asia new business
profit in the first quarter grew 22% on a local currency basis to £309 million led by higher
volume.
In APE terms they were 28% higher at £681 million. In reported currency terms NBP grew
an even stronger 27%, while APE grew by 34%. So some of the headwinds we had last
year have become tailwinds this year. Our team's consistent execution has now delivered
22 consecutive quarters of APE sales growth since the fourth quarter of 2009 averaging
16%.
In Asset Management, so moving on from Life but still in Asia, in Asset Management in
Asia Eastspring attracted £2.3 billion of net inflows, more than twice last year's already
record levels. We're crediting these strong flows and positive market movement, overall
third party assets under management, a key driver of earnings grew by 48% to £29.8
billion, which is more than double the stock of assets at end of 2009.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the U.S., leaving Asia, separate account assets, which really drive our earnings and our
cash generation, grew by 16% to £89.2 billion. We remain convinced that our personal
business, which adopts volumes across the cycle to maximize returns, is the right one. In
the first quarter, new business profit was 28% lower at £153 million, reflecting this volume
discipline, a historically strong first quarter 2014 where we took very opportunistically and
the adversity part (3:16) of lower interest rates.
In the U.K. our business is adapting well with new environment. In the Life business first,
retail sales grew by 8%, to £169 million. So very strong and commendable performance,
as customer demand for our retirement and accumulation products more than offset the
lower demand expected and observed for individual entities.
Retail new business profits fell by 11% to £34 million, primarily reflecting reduced individual
energy sales, which were very profitable. We remain selective in bulks, completing one
attractive transaction in majority after the quarter but none in the first quarter.
Still in the U.K. but lastly in Asset Management, M&G attracted £0.7 billion of third-party net
inflows led by continued strength in Continental Europe.
So in summary we continue to deliver profitable growth in Asia, one of the world's most
attractive, vastly under penetrated, and fastest growing markets, while being focused in
our approach in the mature U.S. and U.K. markets on value over volume.
So now let's take, as we usually do, a closer look at each of the geographies and
businesses in turn. Starting with Asia. Our focus on delivering quality growth through a
professional growing agency sales force and our proven bancassurance model remain
key competitive advantages for us in the region.

Our first quarter performance provides stronger evidence of the strength, with booked
agency and bancassurance channels making handsome contributions. In there, agency
channel first, APE was 25% higher with eight local business units delivering double-digit
growth. Pressingly this group was driven both by increases in the active manpower base
and by higher APE for activation for productivity.

FINAL

In the banking channel APE, if we exclude the discontinued agreements (5:18 – 5:23).
Our relationship with Standard Chartered Bank continued the strong momentum since
renewal in July, delivering 46% APE growth year-on-year. Even after 17 years of strong
growth we have only penetrated 3% of Standard Chartered customer base. And we can
confidently say that we are not about to run out of growth from SEB any time soon.
So let me now make a few specific comments about some of our Asian markets. And I'll
cover Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines in this order.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Hong Kong as you have seen we have delivered another outstanding quarter with APE
sales up 74%. Here clearly we are benefiting both from strong local demand and the
growing interest from the increasingly wealthy Mainland Chinese customers for our
products.
To meet these demand we have significantly increased our distribution scale and
launched new products with a particular focus on protection. We now have the largest and
most productive agency sales force in Hong Kong with first quarter APE growing by 70%.
This was complimented by a very strong performance from SCB, which delivered 45%
APE growth.
And our newly launched protection products, a long-held ambition for us in Hong Kong to
increase protection sales, are proving very popular with Health & Protection APE in the first
quarter up 50%.
This enduring success in Hong Kong is testament to our team's ability to grow scale and
deliver profitable growth in a market, which many have seen as being mature. Something
we don't really agree with.
Now I'm going to spend a few minutes on the Mainland China itself, a market where we
have been executing for a number of years and which is becoming increasingly material
for us after many years of effort. Our business in China is doing very well, and that
delivered first quarter APE growth of 37%. Our strategy remains the same. Similarly to
what I highlighted in Hong Kong, we are expanding our distribution and improving the
protection content of our product to enable us to deliver high quality growth in one of the
world's largest insurance markets.
In the agency channel in China APE grew 27%, due to higher active manpower and strong
demand for protection products. Our protection APE in China grew by 71%, very, very
good number.

FINAL

In Banking we are seeing success in selling for our joint venture partner, CITIC Bank, sales
– where sales grew 82%. We are also seeing renewed momentum in Standard Chartered,
which is one of the territories I believe in your improvement (7:54), and since last year the
sales grew by 89%.
So in summary we are executing well in this important market. APE sales growth since the
first quarter of 2013, so over the last nine quarters, has averaged 39%. So as a result and
you it shouldn't be a surprise, China on a 100% APE basis is one of our largest units in the
Group, posting this quarter, second in Asia after Hong Kong. But we are also now the
leading foreign owned IP insurance (8:28) business in the country.
With access to an addressable population of 600 million, we are positive about our
prospects in China. At a time when there is an increasing understanding that promoting
health insurance is crucial if a Chinese citizen is expected to save less and consume more.
Let's move now to Singapore. Here the first quarter reported APE was down 19% at £72
million. And this was largely impacted by the loss of two bancassurance relationships. We
mentioned that in prior result. Maybank, a successful relationship which was taken inhouse by Maybank in July last year, and Singpost, where we were out beat as what we
consider uneconomical terms.

Bloomberg Transcript

On a like-for-like basis excluding these two banks, APE was down 7%, but new business
profit was up 2%, which is what matters the most to us, as we saw more protection
products, which are lower volume, but higher value.
So the key message here is that we remain focused on delivering long term profitable
growth in a market where we are a leader, over 24% market share.
Next Indonesia. In the first quarter APE sales grew by 7% to £93 million. We are pleased to
see a return to growth in this important market. We continue to invest for the long term
and have stepped up our agency recruitment efforts to be well-positioned to benefit
from gradual market recovery we expect.
In banking – in bancassurance we're seeing good momentum in SEB here too, albeit from
a low base, after we have secured exclusivity in this market. We remain optimistic and
positive about our long-term prospects in this large Southeast Asian country where we
currently only have 2 million customers.
Now let's talk about a market where we have seen some signs of improvement following
our efforts to refocus our business, Malaysia. In the first quarter APE in this market was up
26% with broad-based growth across our agency and banking channel.
Our focus on selling protection products and on growing our Takaful business, which is
fundamentally oriented to the Bumi profitability (10:26) or the Bumi salesforce has
delivered good results. In the first quarter overall Takaful sales were up 50%, contributing
a third of overall volumes, while protection sales were up 23%.
Page 4 of 25



Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity

Malaysia is an example of our abilities, because we have reconstructed one of our oldest
and historic businesses in the region to meet to growing customer demand for Takaful,
while also achieving our financial goals.

FINAL

In the Philippine (sic) [Philippines] (10:52) we continue to make strong progress year-afteryear, delivering APE growth of 17%. We're making headway in building out a high quality
agency salesforce and this channel remains central to our performance.
The Philippines continue to a bright economic spot in the high performing Asian region.
And as you know the IMF recently upgraded its GDP growth forecast, reinforcing its
position as the fastest growing economy in the region with a 95 million population.
Still in Asia moving to Asset Management, Eastspring, our Asian asset management
business have seen strong third-party net inflows of £2.3 billion in the first quarter, more
than double prior year's levels. Stronger equity market coupled with healthy investment
performance have driven good flows into both our equity and bond funds, particularly in
Japan, China, and India. So overall funds under management grew 32% to £86 billion,
reflecting both strong third-party and strong LIFOs and higher (11:50 – 11:52) – reflecting
strong third-party and LIFOs and higher market levels.

Bloomberg Transcript

In summary our first quarter performance highlights the strong progress we are making
towards the delivery of our 2017 Asia objective, by profitabiliting from growing
investments and protection needs of the Asian middle class.
In our more established markets we are consolidating our leadership positions, while at
the same time, we are accelerating growth in our nascent markets. China and the
Philippines are clear examples of this progress with our second largest business this
quarter (12:22).
Looking ahead we're building the foundations for sustainable long-term profitable growth
from this region. Asia remains at the heart of everything this Group does and is becoming
increasingly material to the Group's long-term prospects. We're well-positioned across
the region. And have only scratched the surface what is a multi-decade opportunity for
our Group.
Moving now to the U.S. Our success in the U.S. is underpinned by our disciplined approach
to a cyclical VA market, which allows us to deliver earnings and cash flow across that cycle.
To achieve this we are focused on growing our separate account assets, which ultimately
for a fee income, rather than purely focusing on quarterly AP, which only describes gross
flows, which of course allows us to be opportunistic in the market and to maximize return
to shareholders.
In the first quarter we have grown separate account assets by 16% year-over-year to
£89.2 billion, driven primarily by higher net inflows. At the same time APE declined by 15%,
mainly reflecting a particularly strong first quarter 2014 and the subsequent actions taken
to manage sales of VA with living benefits within our annual risk appetite. New business
profit fell by 28% to £153 million, reflecting, one, this volume discipline; two, a very strong

quarter in 2014, it was Jackson's strongest ever first quarter; and three, the negative
impact of U.S. 10-year Treasury yields are going down 80 basis points year-over-year.

FINAL

Moving on to reinforce we remain well positioned. We have over 97% of the book being
issued below S&P levels as at March 31, 2015. And our hedging performance is tracking in
line with our expectations.
Let's now look at the U.K. In the Life sector in an environment of unprecedented change,
our sales is working well. Retail APE sales were up 8%, reflecting strong demand for our
PruFund-backed product wrappers, including our newly launched items, have done very
well. PruFund's attraction of strong investment performance and volatility control for
smooth returns continues to drives its popularity.
Overall, PruFund's assets under management have grown by 9% in the first quarter to
£12.6 billion. This strength has offset the 61% fall observed in individual annuity sales, which
was in line with our expectations. Retail new business profit of £34 million declined by 11%,
mostly reflecting these lower individual annuity volumes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Please allow me to (14:56) but when we make capital allocation this year and then we
manage the business we do not – we have no regard for margins. We allocate capital
based on return on capital and capital consumption to maximize absolute profit, not to
have the highest margin business possible, but to generate the maximum amount of
profit for our shareholders.
So turning to wholesale business, which is in application of that philosophy, we did not
write any bulks in the first quarter, because we didn't find an offer (15:26) matching our
appetite. But we have completed one very sizable transaction we closed in (15:33) April.
Our teams are working hard and we are encouraged by the strong customer response to
our overall product offering in the savings space. And we continue to maintain latitude
(15:44) for the development pipeline and change portfolio to meet changing consumer
needs and to help us prosper in this new environment.
Staying in the U.K., let us move on now to M&G. M&G had a good quarter with net return
inflows of £0.6 billion, driven by 1.5 billion of inflows from Continental Europe, offsetting
outflows in the U.K. Overall, retail funds under management grew by 10% year-over-year,
£75.7 billion, with the international business accounting for 43% (16:13) of these assets.
M&G has now delivered strong net inflows for a record 14 consecutive quarters, which as
we have previously flagged is an exceptional performance in what is a cyclical business. As
you hear us say every time.
In April following a strong start for the year, our Europe and retail flows were negative,
leaving the overall retail business in a cumulative net outflows position for the first four
months. These outflows however have to be viewed in the context of the overall retail
fund of £75.7 billion, which is the ultimate driver of earnings and cash.

FINAL

So after this tour of Asia, the U.S., and the U.K. let's move now to balance sheet. We
remain defensively positioned on the asset side of our balance sheet. At the end of
March, our IGD surplus was robust at £4.3 billion, which is after deducting the 27 -- 2014
sorry final dividend of £0.7 billion. And which is equivalent to a cover of 2.3 times.
So just a word to close these opening comments about outlook. In the first quarter the
group has continued to make good progress in executing on a clear unchanged strategy
by making good progress in converting the Asian promise into growing and tangible
returns for our shareholders.
Turning to environment. Global group profit remained uncertain, while markets are
increasingly pricing in the prospect of diverging monetary policies between the U.S. and
Europe. We've seen a rising dollar, while yields remain persistently low. The start of
quantitative easing in Europe has trailed or exacerbated the slow year environment, which
is a challenging backdrop for our industry.
We at Prudential have taken decisive actions to de-risk our earnings over the last seven
years by lowering our exposure to interest rates. But we are not completely immune
(17:59 – 18:02) by the impact of the first quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

In this context our scale positions in the most attractive insurance market in the world in
Asia provide a reliable engine of long-term profitable growth.
The rise of the Asian middle class offered us a historical opportunity, like the one we had
in the UK in the 19th century to meet the significant investment and protection needs on
the coming decades.
In the U.S., we continued to meet effectively and profitably the retirements needs of 77
million baby boomers. While in the U.K. we are focused on providing investment and
retirement products to an aging but wealthy customer base.
So in summary we remain – we believe we remain well-positioned to deliver a good value
to our customers and quite uniquely in this sector, both growth and cash to our
shareholders.
So thank you for listening to these comments. And we can now move on to Q&A.

FINAL

Morning, Blair.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

I have three questions. The first one on Asia, huge growth in Hong Kong. I just wonder if
you can talk a little about the growth drivers coming from the Mainland China? And if
you're noticing any difference in the purchasing behaviors of those customers relative to
the Hong Kong customers?
Secondly, on the U.S. a lot going on in that business, interest rates moving around as well. I
just wonder what you see the outlook for the rest of the year there? And if you could
comment as well at what point you would expect to make an announcement on Mike's
[Wells] replacement at Jackson.
And finally, a quick one on M&G. You talked about outflows in April. Could you just
comment on whether they're coming from bond or equity mandates please? Thank you.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Blair. Asia, some color on Hong Kong. It's number of factors
driving that. First of all, (20:22) both are doing very well. So bancassurance we said up
45%, thanks to the Chartered contribution, and agency doing very well too.
But within agency Derrick – you've met Derrick (20:34) – has driven a very effective
recruiting – recruitment drive for a number of years now. We have close to 10,000 agents,
so we by far are the largest sales force. We are skewed towards Mainland customers in
our agency, which is part of why we're getting disproportionate (20:52) upside from this
influx of Mainland customers, because we're structurally more geared towards that.
If you look at what they buy, they are – it's higher case size, so that's another, if you wish,
lift too. More of those customers very good because they have more money than the
Hong Kong customers. A significantly higher case size.
So we have more agents, more activity, bigger case size. And then they -- what you see in
China is that they kind of fall out of love with their own currency, strong appetite for U.S.
dollar. Don't forget a little of our – of what we sell in Hong Kong is U.S. dollars. So they like
that. And they also like the protection product.
So really and actually a lot of that is regular premium. That's really worth noticing.
So when you ask us about those customers, we always say, well they're genuine Hong
Kong customers. And if you wish first of all, we cannot sell a policy to someone unless
they have an explicit economic interest in Hong Kong.

Page 8 of 25



Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

FINAL

And they actually sign regular premium contracts. So the fact that they happen to be
going back and forth between the two is not so relevant. They really -- I can't remember
the number, don't know if any of you knew it -- it's a high proportion of regular premium,
very, very significant. We can -- if we find it we'll give it to you during the call.
So really that's the color. So very good, very profitable business, increasing proportion of
protection, very sticky, regular premium, higher case size. There's nothing there not to
like.
If I may just add one thing from into U.S., it's you see that in the China numbers, I've said
already 27% (22:30) growth in Mainland China. That whole kind of appetite in China for life
insurance is something that we see in Mainland China, and that's also grown true Hong
Kong, because the clientele that goes to Hong Kong is also slightly more affluent than the
general clientele we have in China.
And I'm told 95% of APE is regular premium in Hong Kong, so that's actually very, very
high, so very profitable.

Bloomberg Transcript

The U.S. I'll let Mike talk about the outlook. And maybe I'll say a word to get the rate of
you on the replacement. As we've done for the group, we have succession planning in
place. We have very good processes in place and that process will yield a candidate. And
we'll communicate back to you in due course. But, Mike, do you want to talk about the
outlook?

A - Michael Andrew Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Yeah, Blair, I think the U.S. franchise looks as strong as ever. I think we've certainly seen an
increase in competitor appetite for VA, but I don't think we're seeing any displacements
of the relationships or distributors we have.
Remember we – the volume controls we put in place at year end, we didn't turn back on
prospective too (23:50) in the full sense until the second week of January. So there is a –
no small effort for the wholesalers to revitalize those relationships to – we saw some
clever tactics I think by competitors to try and win some of our advisors over. From what I
hear anecdotally those were not particularly successful. So that's good to hear that the
producers are sticking with us.
And the franchise looks very good. So I don't – without getting into a forecast I don't think
– I don't have any concerns there in our abilities.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Just a follow up, Mike, if I can. Is there any impact from some of the regulatory noise? I
know you talked about there has been some noise about distribution conduct and
distribution compensation.

A - Michael Andrew Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}
Page 9 of 25



Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

Yeah, there's two major issues out. There's a letter from Senator [Elizabeth] Warren that
got a lot of publicity. And that was, Blair, on how incentives were built into the U.S. market.

FINAL

And the other was -- is on the DOL's [Dept. of Labor] proposal, which we've discussed at
a couple of other meetings. It's in the comment stage for another somewhere between
five – and I think you'll see that, the latter one, finalized four months to six months from
now.
On the Warren letter Jackson has applied the FINRA SEC standards to sales practice
management on all products for a dozen years. So we do not have any concerns about
this discussion. We don't – the way we – as you're probably aware they're very restrictive.
Everything that's done with the advisors is tracked. There's limits on anything from
entertainment to value of gifts and it's – we have systems that track all that. So that's not
really a concern for us.
And we apply those same rules to the non-registered products, which should be the fixed
index annuity and the fixed, even though they're not applicable by statute. We have by
policy just carried them across. So that's a nonevent for us.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second, the DOL, there's – no one knows where that's going to land. I read a number
of competitors' comments on it. I think the two comments I guess I would say generally, it
will be a test of capabilities. That's one of our favorite chests. When something changes,
your firm's ability to react is I think one of our strong suits.
And the other is I think in an owner-ist model it's probably a 15% or 25% reduction in
volume, and volume is not one of our concerns in the U.S. Managing volume is one of our
concerns.
So again I don't think for us – I think it will be work for us. But we have an excellent product
for the consumer. I think it will do very well in that regulatory look. And I think any
adjustments they require we can make as quick as anyone can in that market and
accurately deliver them. So it'll just be a normal tactical issue to deal with as far as I'm
concerned.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. And on M&G, quickly?

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

M&G is the last one. Look, on M&G we have – we're talking about Europe, okay, my
comment was about Europe. We've had 14 consecutive quarters of net inflows in Europe.
And we have repeatedly said -- so you've heard Michael (26:53) say this many times,
which is this was (26:55) performance, and we always also recognize that it's a cyclical
business, but is susceptible to change.

Page 10 of 25



Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

So we have seen negative flows from our bond funds, to answer a question (27:05), and
particularly one lumpy outflow. But we also – so a general increase in outflows, and we
think they are due to concerns around liquidity of bond funds and the relative very strong
performance of equity funds. So we are picking up some of this stuff elsewhere.

FINAL

And I should mention here that actually multi-assets is doing well (27:23) both in Europe
and in the U.K. So overtime we want to see that strength coming through.
So it's too early to say whether this trend is likely to continue through the rest of the year,
because for instance market performance is one of the many unknowns, but it will have an
impact. But so far the outflows are small in comparison to total funds. And we don't think
that they are likely to have an impact on earnings.
But clearly of course continued sizable outflows would impact earnings from 2016 onward.
But so far we don't see more than kind of normal volatility, given the size that the
business has now reached, you will see from quarter-to-quarter outflows.

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Great. Thank you very much indeed.

Thank you, Blair.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Steel of Deutsche Bank.
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Oliver G. Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Morning all, and thanks for taking the call. Two questions to start with. First of all, you
talked about a 3% penetration rate at Standard Chartered. And I was wondering whether
you can give us sort of any, not specific examples, but sort of general examples as to
what sort of penetration rate you could get to in a typical bancassurance deal?
And then back to Hong Kong. I mean Hong Kong is now – I think it's 36% of your Asian
sales in the first quarter. I wonder what stage does that get outsized relative to the rest of
the Asian business?

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Okay. No. Thank you. Thank you, Oliver. Yes, we have commented on 3% at the time of
the – all I can say is that the business is – I think the number I have in mind, 170 times
bigger than when we started in 1998 in terms of sales. And that we have very strong
growth, we said 45%. I think (29:18 – 29:22). We think that we can grow comfortably a
double digit for a long time in SCB. So we won't give you a target penetration rate, but it

Page 11 of 25



Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

can be significantly in excess of 3%. Just a way to say that demand the organic is not a
good phrase (29:37 – 29:40).

FINAL

On Hong Kong just looking at what affecting now (29:46) maybe benefit of hindsight and
the number of quarter, we said 22 quarters, 16% average growth (29:57) on Asia, but we
will deliver at a regional level.
The rarity is this stock is a way of an emerging markets play. There is no way to say that
emerging markets are not volatile. (30:11) large platform, a diversified platform. That's all
you can do in emerging market.
So in all my years I've put into it, I've always heard comments along the lines of well it's
coming from wrong place. Or it's too close on trade key (30:22). Or it's not straight
enough.

Bloomberg Transcript

The reality is those markets move in such a way – this is why we are adamant on never
giving you guidance by country. It was really this – if you wish for standard deviation, the
sigma is very high. That's a nature of those economies. They stall, they grow, they grow
very strongly, they come back for two years into a major story (30:39 – 30:42), and then
also, oh you're a one-trick pony investing in Asia. (30:45) Guess what? We become a onetrick pony in just Hong Kong.
And then you've seen what Asia coming back (30:50). I think my own ability to predict
going forward on country by country level, I consider zero, close to zero, surprises over
time.
But the reality is they're moderately so healthy, the focus on distribution is so strong. The
focus on growing the distribution on activating the Asians, on selling quality products and
getting new distribution is so strong. But when you do that in spite of the large, larger
numbers – if you ask me what – a subset of 10,000 Asians out of 470,000 (31:21) that we
have in the sweet spot is going to do, well our ability to believe that (31:26) is very weak.
But my ability to predict what the 470,000 (31:29) are going to generate, it's just the law
of large numbers, is very, very strong. And what you've seen growing through.
So yes, you are right. Right now we are very concentrated in Hong Kong. But I'm very
confident that is the way the zone operate as a region. And that growth will come
through. I just cannot tell you where it's going to come from. I cannot tell you when
Indonesia is going to come back on the stream (31:50). I cannot tell you when Hong Kong
is going to slow down. I cannot tell you when Singapore is going to pick up.
It's a complicated story on the market-by-market level. But the fundamental drivers of this
– the growth of the middle class at a regional level, the under-penetration at the regional
level, the strong demand for our products at the regional level remain very, very strong.

FINAL

So Hong Kong I think is a good story. The fact that China is going in the same direction
gives me confident that there is really something going on there. If you look
fundamentally the Chinese have become wealthier. I've been talking about their growth
for a long time. (32:30 – 32:33)
And really what they're doing is diversifying their holdings. They are behaving like every
reasonable investor, the same way rich Europeans have U.S. equity and all kinds of assets
in their portfolio. The Chinese are no different. So you can see with the roll of money
coming out of China, and it's growing into – one day I was now thinking Hong Kong is very
happy to use it
You know that there are projects to allow Chinese investors, connect projects between
Hong Kong and Shenzhen to allow them to invest more abroad. That's going to be a huge
wave, and it's trillions of assets in there that are going to come. So I think that story is still
some way to go.

Q - Oliver G. Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Can I just sort of follow-up quickly on that? I mean obviously Hong Kong is becoming so
large, it almost needs to be sort of split into component parts dare I say that we can try
and understand the drivers a bit more. I think you said that the Chinese – Mainland China
flows were half of the Hong Kong flows now. Where does that come from? Just so that
we have a sort of a guide as to just how much of an impact that has had?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

What do you mean when you say where does it come from?

Q - Oliver G. Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Well sorry. Not – well what percentage of flows was that in 2014 or first quarter of 2014?

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

(33:48 – 33:50) That's kind of what we said, it's 50% of the sales, of the flows that are on
Mainland. Okay?

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

So that hasn't – so that has... (34:00 – 34:10)

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Hong Kong per se is also doing very well. I think that's the message that maybe we don't
understand, because people tend to look what changes. So yeah, Mainland is growing but
Hong Kong is doing very, very well. I mean very, very strong – very strong growth.

Q - Oliver G. Steel

(34:29 – 34:34)
(34:35) that Hong Kong would grow. And we were being told that it's a business that

I'm very happy to be sitting here and having a big debate around the extraordinary
growth of Hong Kong, the mature market. I think it's just another message about the
power of this story. But Hong Kong grew in excess of 40%, the local Hong Kong business
itself, forget Mainland. The local Hong Kong (35:07).

Q - Oliver G. Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Our next question comes from the line of Abid Hussain of Société Générale. Please go

Q - Abid Hussain

{BIO 17127644 <GO>}

Hi afternoon. Just three questions if I can please. Firstly, on the U.S. So there was some
material deterioration in the new business margin, more so than I would've thought given
the pricing action that you were probably putting through. Can you just talk about what
drove deterioration in the first quarter? And what sort of pricing action you may have left
obviously for the rest of the year? That's the first question.
Page 14 of 25

FINAL

The second question is on Singapore. I was just wondering if the base bonds on (36:00)
the minimum healthcare benefits there that have come in, has that impacted your APE
sales? Or was it entirely your own decision to refocus the business on higher value
protection products?
And then finally on Indonesia. You said the macros have been challenging, and it seems
that they've been challenging there for a while now. And I'm just wondering what needs to
change in order for you to be more comfortable with Indonesia? And if you might suggest
a sort of timeline? I know you just said that your ability to forecast country-by-country is
zero, but just sort of if you could add some color on that that would be helpful.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Okay, thanks Abid. And again good morning. Just maybe one comment before I let Mike
and Nic take that. But really again we're not great believers in NBP, and this quarter just
illustrates why. You've heard us drop down embedded value for a long time, we about
IFRS and cash. I tell you (36:59) all over the place, which is why we dropped the NBP
target for Asia. We just don't believe in NBP as a short-term indicator quarter-by-quarter.
So the margin is directly derived from that. It's what I leave to Mike, but really I've been
dreaming – I was dreaming of dropping NBP as an objective. We've done that for 2017,
thank god. And I was contemplating (37:20) taking margins out. But even if we took it out,
we would still compute it.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we have been thinking of just like not disclosing it. But it just leads to (37:32 – 37:34)
sorry about that. (37:36 – 37:38).

A - Michael Andrew Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

(37:37 – 37:39) to not try and defend the NBP number.
Abid, it's Mike. I think there are two things. The interest rate implication is material. And so
it depends on how much weight you put on that sort of movement and that sort of point
in time metrics on rates. Again I think Tidjane's made it clear we don't value that
particularly highly.
You had a couple weeks where you didn't have the most profitable product in the
marketplace. That's not trivial, given the number of weeks in the quarter. And the product
we brought online has a full array of guarantees as you have seen. And it has got very
good margins in it and is selling well. And the accounts are appreciating it as they should
for the consumers, and we benefit from that. So there is no economic outcome from the
first quarter in the U.S. that we're not happy with.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Absolutely. You've seen the assets on the American going up 16%, yeah. (38:30) if you
want to see IFRS (38:33).

{BIO 17127644 <GO>}
Page 15 of 25



Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

So can I just come back on what sort of economic metrics are you sort of fixing on? It's
clearly some of the biggest margin here at one. (38:41 – 38:44) What metrics are you
looking at?

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

FINAL

A fantastic question.

A - Nicolaos Andreas Nicandrou

{BIO 15589153 <GO>}

Okay. We look at the internal rates of return that we generate on the products that we
sell. Let me just remind you of the history here. We saw interest rates fall at really low
levels for the second half of 2012. At that point Jackson repriced all its product set under
VA in order to deliver the very demanding returns that we required for VAs at the time. So
at the time we repriced it to give you high 20s% in the IRRs.
Then interest rates recovered for a period of 18 months. And those IRRs became
exceptional, exceptionally high, as we didn't reprice to give that value back. Our interest
rates are back in the last six or so months. So what we've come back to is a very strong
IRRs, maybe not as attractive as they were, and when interest rates peak up again. So
that's what we use.

Bloomberg Transcript

And the other mechanism on -- so, no, we are very happy with the returns that we're
getting, even at these levels of interest rates. As I said high IRRs, very fast payback on the
product.
And our mechanism in terms of counter managed volume is gone beyond simply
repricing. We're now giving ourselves more flexibility by creating slightly different flavors
or guarantees, which have slightly different pricing structures. Clearly the lower the
guarantees, the lower you can charge.
And that nuance and that flavor isn't coming through very strongly in the NBP measure. It's
not nuanced enough to pick that up, as is the case with Elite Access. We said Elite Access
is a high IRR product, but in NBP terms it's not very.
So these are all the -- these are -- hopefully that gives you a little more color around
what's happening in the underlying dynamic.

Q - Abid Hussain

{BIO 17127644 <GO>}

Yeah. That's very helpful.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Okay. No, thank you. It's important points (40:54) -- for us to comment on that.
Quickly you asked about Singapore and Indonesia. Singapore is completely our decision.
We really want to increase our protection content there. (41:06 – 41:09) headline down
Page 16 of 25



Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

19% (41:12 – 41:14) and NBP up 2%. (41:16 – 41:18) And we're going to continue doing that.

FINAL

Indonesia, you kind of answered your own question. I really always shy away from making
microeconomic forecasts. That's really a very, very, very, very dangerous thought.
But fundamentally I think the government is focused on the right thing. There's a bit of
impatience there. They're trying to clearly focus on the infrastructure, absolutely vital.
They really must do that.
And as always they've got to both drive (41:47) short term and long-term economic
growth. (41:51 – 41:53) seeing employment, construction, et cetera, et cetera. But the
reality (41:57 – 42:00) in this market. People want to grow ahead of itself. (42:03 – 42:07)
takes time, takes time. They'll get there, but it takes time to get the projects off the
ground, get the funding in place, and it takes a long time.
So we're very confident again in the medium term prospects of that economy. Very happy
to be there. Plus 7% is (42:23 – 42:27). I don't want to be quoted on calling a quarter-byquarter growth. (42:32 – 42:34)

Q - Abid Hussain

{BIO 17127644 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Yeah. But we think overall again, the Asia performance will be strong. And we have
enough levers to pull, enough diversification that you see the performance coming
through (42:45 – 42:48).

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

Just a few. Indonesian active agents' recruitment in the first quarter. I wonder if you could
give us the year-on-year growth there?

FINAL

And then in terms of the other markets, I wonder if you'd give us an idea where active
agent growth is accelerating? Which markets are accelerating besides Indonesia?
And in terms of the U.K. bulk annuities what was the sort of change in the competitive
environment versus second half of last year? Because you wrote no bulks in the first
quarter. One of your competitors implied that it was competitive, but there hadn't been a
change. I was wondering what your view on that was?

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Greig. On the first one yeah, very legitimate question. But as you know
we don't – we really don't communicate on the activity levels country-by-country. In Group
that discussion we just had on our ability to forecast or have – on a 720,000 (43:58) sales
force, but not in sub-segments of that (44:02) country-by-country. So we're always
recruiting. We're always activating. The experiences out there (44:07) varies a lot from
one quarter to a quarter, from one country to another country.

Bloomberg Transcript

But again if you look at the group, it has been a good balance between recruitment,
activation, and if you wish productivity (44:26) case size. So that's all I would say on that.
Jackie, on the bulk and the current market environment?

A - Jackie Hunt

{BIO 16204866 <GO>}

Yeah sure. So, Greig, in terms of the competitive environment we've actually seen no
change from when we last updated you. I think at the last year-end results I was indicating
that the pipeline is very strong. It remains immensely strong.
We are disciplined. And we don't say those words lightly, so we do make sure that the
deals that we do transact we're not chasing quarters. We do actually find the deals that
match our risk and return profiles. And you see that paying through in the deal that was
written shortly, within a few days of the quarter end. We didn't kind of – weren't
concerned I guess about the impact in terms of the lumpiness of that business.
So I think the outlook is very strongly. We continue to focus on the right metrics. We make
sure for example that we have the assets that we're comfortable with to back some of
these deals there of the nature of M&A. But you should expect it to be lumpy by nature.
That's how we act in this market.

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

(45:31) thank you. Keeping – and just a point if I may, just in terms of our forecasts and for
this year. I'm just wondering which markets are seeing strong active agent growth and
which are not? I mean for instance we know Singapore is not. I was just wondering so
we've got some kind of – something to hang our hats on in terms of forecast?

(46:05 – 46:06)

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

It's not helpful. I mean it's not helpful. You really – it's not helpful to put it in the public
domain, because it just moves a lot. All I can tell you is that roughly should have a growth
in Asia, Q1, it's about healthy growth in activations and healthy productivity roughly. But
that will move around. I've seen it move around. Going to be 50/50 one quarter, it can be
30/70 another one, it can be 20/80 another one.
So it's as I've told you many times. When you look at the country-by-country level, it really
depends on a lot of factors. You push hard the quarter, you push that hard the following
quarter, because you need to digest what you've taken on board, et cetera.
So you could really trigger too much noise to start having those discussions country-bycountry. I know you. We've been having this dialogue for a number of years. Maybe you'll
convince Mike to... (47:02 – 47:06)

FINAL

Hi, thanks guys. A couple of questions. First of all to follow-up on the DOL fiduciary
responsibilities. There was some discussion about moving away from commissions to
fees. You did (47:33) actually quite positive for the industry. It will being the advisor
remuneration more in line with how these guys make profits. And then secondly on that
again, would there be any potential to move away from the non-guaranteed products to
the guaranteed products where you can issue more tangible value to the client?
And then just a last question on the U.K. one of your largest competitors just closed its
profit's fund (47:58) this year due to lack of net flows. Wondering if you could update us
on what you're seeing in Pru? With profit's fund some (48:05) success when others can't
seem to make it work. Thanks.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Okay. Alan, thank you. Do you want...

A - Michael Andrew Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Again the DOL piece is a work in progress. So it's hard to comment, to get too granular
on it. But the direction the Travol Commission (48:21) look like they will be a part of it. I
think if you think of the U.K. sort of reasons why letter or our U.S. investment policy letter
of a registered investment advisor, you're going to see something along those lines, if
you read the text carefully.
Those exist now in certain broker-dealers, it's not an unusual – there's firms that have that
process in place around variable annuity sales. The – one of the key components is the
disclosure of the compensation made to the advisor (48:50). And again which firms
operate successfully with that model now.
The fee/non-fee piece, I do think the alignment of interest piece on that is not as simple
as how the advisor is paid. There's an implicit trade with the consumer that they're giving
up a bit of duration for -- on liquidity over the discerner (49:12) charge period in exchange
for a better product.
So I don't accept necessarily the premise that a fee-based product is better than a
commission-based product with a trail surrender (49:24) charge. But again that's
something we can talk about offline if you want.
And then finally on the guarantee/non-guarantee. We deal with this with Elite Access.
There's some firms that don't allow Elite Access and qualified plans for a variety of
reasons. It just affects you distribution strategy, it affects how the consumer saves. There's
a lot of ways to add value, and Elite Access is a good example.
Getting institutional solutions on diversification is what that product does, getting them
away from having to use simply a total return bond fund to get non-correlated returns. We

Page 20 of 25



Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

have lots of ways to get value to consumers in the U.S., and obviously those are
transportable to other markets if we chose to.

FINAL

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Yeah. And really we've had various talks with policy makers in the U.S. And the
understanding we have is as a group that the U.K. experience on commissions. And we
have no intention of flowing that example (50:16). So we haven't heard any attempt or
intention to touch commissions.
Jackie, with profit policy making?

A - Jackie Hunt

{BIO 16204866 <GO>}

Yeah, so thanks for the question. I mean clearly with profits there's a core part of our
proposition. And we've – having considerable success with a lot of momentum and with
profits business.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think if you compare our proposition with some of our competitors, I'd raise a couple of
observations.
The first is that pre-funded sales is what we would see as a modernized form of with
profit contract. So it's considerably more transparent. It's easier in many ways for
consumers to understand what it is they're getting and feel less that it's a black box,
which I think was always the concern expressed about some of the more traditional with
profits products.
And I think in terms of how that has landed and continued to grow in the market share, we
talked about the 9% growth in PruFund more generally. We have seen ongoing interest in
PruFund as a proposition.
If you put that then alongside the fact that actually the returns out of our with profit funds
have been very strong over whether it's a five-year, 10-year, 20-year timeframe on most
metrics. And the with profit product have outperformed relative examples in the FTSE by
some margin. And I think consumers have valued obviously that trend about performance.
It's critically important to the proposition and what the consumer gets out of it.
You then put that against the fact that actually if you look over the last 18 months, one of
the things that we set out to do and what we're starting to deliver now is we're
broadening the product proposition. So for example we're putting it into new raptors
(52:03). We talk in the release a little bit about the fact that we now have an ISO version
(52:07) available. I mean it's not a big contributor to Q1. I think about £3 million of AP. But
by the end of April – we only launched on the 27 of February – end of April it was £9
million. And we think there's a lot of legs in it.
So we're broadening the proposition. We are also adding considerably new – more new
advisors. Actually if you look over the course of the last 15-odd months, since RDR was

Page 21 of 25



Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity
Date: 2015-05-06

FINAL

implemented, we are seeing new advisors coming to the proposition off the back of
training that we give, WebExes that we run. And just an understanding that actually
smoothed returns at a time of significant volatility really work from a consumer
perspective.
So it is one of those environments where in some ways we are backing the trend. But
actually if you look at the components, if you look at the strength of our distribution, if you
look at the strength of the product proposition, if you look at it, what it is that consumers
need around more smooth returns and good solid returns, our with profits fund is really
playing well into that space.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Hi there. Afternoon everybody. I've got two questions please. I just wonder whether you
could give an update on the specific items you called out at full year results? On obviously
to specifically the transitionals for the annuity bulk handle. So the aggregation of the Asian
business, whether there has been any update there?
And then secondly just on the U.K. business that the drawdown volume is very high in Q1. I
wonder whether that's sustainable? And whether that's something which is ramping up
post the pension freedoms? Thank you.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Okay. Well thank you and good afternoon, Jon. Nic you want to take on those two?

A - Nicolaos Andreas Nicandrou

{BIO 15589153 <GO>}

Sure. As you said, Jon, we gave you some very full disclosure with our prelims, explaining
actually the capital generative nature of our business even on through this particular land.
And illustrating that and also commenting on the open areas of discussion if you like, the
points on the discussions at the time. I mean we've continued those discussions. There's
no update to give you.
But to reiterate the points that we made on Asia fungibility, a question under Solvency II.
Let me just reiterate, this has no impact on dividends from Asia, because Asia will
Page 22 of 25



Company N ame: Prudential PL C

continue ultimately to be regulated on a local basis, which has been forming our dividend
flows.

FINAL

It's simply a question of how much of the excess are over and above the local rate, we're
bringing to the Group, Solvency II number. Clearly we'd like to bring it all. We're not going
to be able to bring it all. But let be emphatic with it's not going to be nil. It's going to a
number that that is greater than nil.
And on transitionals we – yeah. We continue with the process in terms of making -preparing our application. And no update there.
So we'll keep you updated. We said we'll have certainty towards the end of the year, but
there's no change in the key message that Tidjane and I gave at the prelims that the
Solvency II impact will be manageable for our Group.

A - Jackie Hunt

{BIO 16204866 <GO>}

Yeah. No. The quick answer is that drawdown I think, a significant deal of the period
(55:41). We see this as actually being the alternative. The vast majority of conversations
we're having with both existing and new customers are either about them taking money
as cash, if they tend to small sizes (55:54) or if they're younger or if they are in a sort of
more affluent, more asset rich position. It gives you better drawdown products of some
form.
So I think this is a structural change that's happened to the market in these seven years
(56:07). And into drawdown and various other savings and investment type products. And
we're clearly gaining market share in that space.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

Yeah. I think we're triple.

Bloomberg Transcript

And Tidjane, I won't take longer. Just like a very short question. Any update on Malaysian
regulation? I remember there was some debate on the commission, et cetera. Any
update on that would be great. Thank you. And I won't take your lot of time.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

(56:54) important question, but really there's no -- nothing else. I said I think we've been
very reassuring when we've answered this in last time that we did not expect any major
change.
But we attempt to download the – sorry, to capital loadings (57:09) that anywhere you've
seen the numbers in Malaysia. What the Malaysian authorities want is the development of
takaful market. And I think the industry explained to them what we needed to deliver that.
And they have been very (57:23 – 57:29). So I think those concerns, as far as we knew,
have not materialized in a negative way for the industry. So far, so good there.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Tidjane Thiam

{BIO 7518525 <GO>}

So thank you all for attending our call and for your questions. Our first quarter results
demonstrate the power of our strategy. Probably some indication of the policy (57:48) of
our individual businesses. We are continuing to deliver profitable growth by embracing
(57:53) capital at double-digit IRRs, an attractive equity story in an environment of very low
returns, historically low return.
