{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody, and good morning to the USA, and thank you for joining us
at this conference call. With me is Lars Thykier, the CFO; and Steﬀen Heegaard, the Group
Communications and IR Director. We are holding this conference because earlier today,
we published our results for the ﬁrst half year of 2019. So we are now ready to answer your
questions. Please ask them one at a time. And operator, may we have the ﬁrst question,
please?

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions)
And our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Youdish Chicooree of Autonomous
Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone. I've just -- I've got three questions, please. The ﬁrst one is on
your life result. If you could help us understand why it's so high and whether there were
any one-oﬀs we need to be aware of?

Date: 2019-07-18

And secondly, it's on your guidance for the rest of the year. You're guiding for a range of
200 and 300 for the year, which means that even at the low end of the guidance, you're
suggesting a quarterly result of around 40 million [ph]. I was wondering, are you just
being very conservative here? Or are you anticipating any impacts going forward?

FINAL

And ﬁnally, on your underlying claims ratio, I just wanted to know whether you actually
adjust for discounting impact or is it stated before those changes for the year? Thank you.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Sorry, I didn't get the last one.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

So you reported that -- you reported a claims ratio before run-oﬀ, whether and large
claims of 69.3 in 2Q and 69 for the half year. Does that adjust for the changes in the
discount rate on claims reserves or not?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

So I'll answer the last one ﬁrst, yes, it does.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

It excludes or it does not exclude, sorry?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

It does. It is made up taking into consideration how the discounting rate changes.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay. So if the discount rate was stable this year, so the improvement you would have
shown for the half year would have been all at 2 points instead of 1 point, is that right?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

That's right.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay. All right. Thank you.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

And in the forecast we'll make for the rest of this year, the impact is actually 1.2
percentage points from -- diﬀerent from what it would have been three months ago.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Yeah, understood. Thank you.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

And then investment on life equity, that was your question?

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah, yeah.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

We have had a very good run. There has been some asset classes. It has performed
unusually well. There is no speciﬁc one-oﬀs. But we certainly do not expect this to
continue that is -- that this year investment stochastic sort to speak.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

So just a follow-up on that. In the ﬁrst quarter, the result was very similar, but in the ﬁrst
quarter did have strong recovery in market, so in the second quarter, I'm a bit puzzled to
see this the same level. So that's why I was wondering what asset class did perform well?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. There is a -- the fact that the Danish market branches actually performed well. And
since we don't have the liability side one which [ph], so we need investment income in
life, the income hasn't been heard for -- from the changes in discount to rate, On top of
this, we have had -- we have had some very steep increase in price and index-linked
bonds.
Our CDOs have come back. It has performed well in the quarter and so on. We have built
the property, which is now ﬁnalized and every all apartments are did out. That means that
the contingency, we have had in this -- under this clipping has been cancelled.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. Understood. Thank you.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

And then the diﬀerence between the change in expected combined ratio and the
forecast, I remind you that when we use intervals so in principle, if the expected
combined ratio moves some from 86.1 to 85.9, then we might change in (inaudible). So
the change in combined ratio of -- from 86 to 87 and to 85 to 86, is not necessarily a full
percentage point.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Fine. Well, that's the --

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Page 3 of 12



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2019-07-18

That's the ﬁrst thing. And the other one is that we -- with the very low interest rate, we are
having now, we expect the investment income to be somewhat lower than we did three
months ago.

FINAL

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay. Understand. But my question on the guidance was speciﬁcally with respect to the
Life segment and the fact that you've already recognized 220 million in the ﬁrst half and
you're saying, you're going to -- it's going to be in the range of 300 to 330 for the full
year, so that suggested that the results would be like in the region of 40 per quarter,
which is very low compared to even last year?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

I admit slight conservatism in this context.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay. Now, I understood right. Thank you. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jakob Brink of Nordea. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Thank you. Actually, coming back to the same question about life insurance, to what
extent did customers get same good return as you got for shareholders' equity in the
quarter? And I guess to follow on that, what is the sensitivity for you to be able to book
the full year risk allowance when the year is over? How far are you from being able to do
that or how is that calculated? That's my ﬁrst question.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

It depends on which customers. I can't [ph] really give to you one answer to this. There are
customers in our linked environment. They have had a very good result in this quarter.
While the customers we have in the interest rate groups, they are not very exposed to
shares, and that means that they get more or less a hedge of the guarantees that they
have bought, and that means a pretty low result.
The sensitivity, again, we have 9, 10 interest rate groups and sensitivities are diﬀerent from
one group to the next. You may remember that there was one group in -- at year-end '18
that did manage to -- Steﬀen is going to say something? Well, we didn't get the return we
should have had or the administration fee that we should have had. If you are concerned
about whether the interest rate changes as such should bring the solvency in danger, the - in general, we have hedged the interest rate risk in the interest rate groups.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}
Page 4 of 12



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2019-07-18

So with the current interest rate levels, you should be able to book full risk allowance at
the end of the year?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

FINAL

If this was the end of the year, we would book for risk loans.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

But it'll also depend on the development on equities, of course.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Yeah, of course. And then, I guess secondly, on the termination of the Danske Bank
agreement, you're guiding that it's less than 10% of new sales, but of course, it's also
around 10% of the back book. If -- now it's only 2.5 months or three months away from
you having to give a premium growth guidance for next year, at least if you give us
normally, what would you -- so maybe take sort of a small prime around that, what would
be the expected impact next year?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Now, we need to see how things are working out for the next three months, and we don't
really know what kind of initiatives that Danske Bank are going to show. So I would rather
not give an impression now of what is going on to happen next year. But obviously, we
have told you that we expect this to be around 0.5% slower growth this year, and if you
double that, it is 1 percentage point. But what I don't like to guess is, what is the
consequences of the initiatives we may need.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Fair enough. Thank you very much.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Welcome.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Denham of Morgan
Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Thanks very much. Just three questions from me, if I may. And ﬁrstly, your SME premiums
grew by almost 2% -- sorry 5% in 2Q. Just quickly, what was that excluding the indexation
of workers' comp? Secondly, you said the life premiums wouldn't -Page 5 of 12



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Jonathan, the line is pretty bad. Could you repeat slowly, please?

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

FINAL

Sorry. And the SME premiums grew by almost 5% in 2Q. What is that excluding the 9%
indexation of workers' comp?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

That is -- we made a couple of agreements that has been a bit large, an anomaly.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

(technical diﬃculty)

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Most of the indexation on the 9% is actually happening in the start of the year. So it seem
[ph] just focusing on Q2, then the indexation of 9% has actually not had that much of an
impact.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

That's right.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Thank you. Secondly, you said the life premiums were negatively impacted by the
implementation of the new IT platform. Should we expect ongoing reduction in the inﬂow
of new single premiums or is that all in ticket?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

You should not. We still have some problems with the implementation and this may slow
things down to some extent. But we expect to be in full speed within a couple of months.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Thanks. And just ﬁnally, you highlighted that the VA fell to 6 basis points at the end of 2Q.
Where is it now and what have you assumed in your say forecast model?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

It has increased somewhat. There are diﬀerent ticks on how high it is. It is made up by the
regulator. It is made up by Danske Bank, and is maybe made up by Nykredit and they

Page 6 of 12



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2019-07-18

don't agree. But something like say between 10 and 15 basis points now, and I think that it
will probably increase a little bit more during the quarter and everything else equal.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

FINAL

And is that included in your proﬁt forecast model?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

No, it's not.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Okay, perfect. And just the guidance for 5 million for every 1 percentage point change in
the VA still stand?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Perfect. Thank you very much.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

I guess, 4.5% -- 4.5 million, that's after-tax.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Brilliant. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Per Gronborg of SEB. Please go ahead. Your line
is open. Hey, Gronborg, you may go ahead and ask your question. If you have your line
muted, please unmute.

Q - Per Gronborg

Can you hear me?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Yes.

FINAL

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect. Two questions from my side. In Q1, we saw your bonus risk in the -- in your
solvency numbers going up quite a lot. I would -- why is it only moving marginal this time
taking into account that the VA is continuing its downtrend. That's the ﬁrst question.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Yes. That's of course we had a very good run on non-equities, which means that the loss
absorption capacity here for our customers has increased.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

So it's oﬀset by equity gains, primarily.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect. My second question, can you put some ﬂavor on the gap between your
return on your more plain vanilla bonds and the revaluation of your liabilities, the gap is
pretty big. I know, there is a 60 million from the VA. But the fact that, something else must
have gone quite wrong this quarter?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Yeah, you may say so. It's an -- an inherent problem, when you -- when we or whenever
you are trying to hedge DHENA [ph] liability with a curved asset proﬁle. The things -- the
way things work, when we are tuning this hedge is that, if interest rates stay stable, I mean,
we have an extra income that of course, had written options on the interest rate level.
When interest rates changes up or down, we'll always lose money. And in this case, we
saw very diﬃcult markets and very strong fall in interest rates. And that means that we are
-- every time, the interest rate ticks down, then our hedge is too small. We had to ﬁnd -buy more bonds. And the market has been squeezed, so it has been very hard to buy this
bond at a reasonable price. So yes, it has been one of the worst quarters concerning
hedging for many years.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. That explains it. Thank you.

FINAL

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ross of Mediobanca. Please go
ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Phil Ross

{BIO 20618440 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon. Two questions from me, please. Just looking at the slides from the
roadshow presentation, the Slide 9 shows your trend in average premiums and motor
starting to pick up again, and I guess more so in Q2 of this year. Can you talk about why
that is? Have you made some deliberate price increases? Or is the market becoming a
little bit easier for you?
And then secondly on, I think, it's Slide 23, the break-down of run-oﬀ proﬁts. They are
materially higher this year, but you also have a negative 91 million impact. I wonder
whether that is a function of discount rate? Or is there sort of an area where you've had to
strengthen some reserves? Thanks.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. The ﬁrst one about cars is that, this is the comprehensive start of cars actually
coming up, and also people buying larger cars.

Q - Phil Ross

{BIO 20618440 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

So that's (inaudible) some of the reasons for the average premiums going up on the
motor side.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

We had a change in taxation of cars a few years ago -- two years ago, and this means that
people are buying larger cars now than they did before. We have not increased prices.

Q - Phil Ross

{BIO 20618440 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

And on the run-oﬀ, we have -- yeah, we have negative run-oﬀ on house. We have a
negative run-oﬀ on the contents, including consequential losses, negative run-oﬀ on the
professional items. And in total, it is -- and half [ph] actually -- some little unusual run-oﬀ
costs. On the -- yeah, you can see on the other side that we have had run-oﬀs on
workmen's compensation and third-party liabilities in motor. Especially the -- concerning
Page 9 of 12



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2019-07-18

the workmen's compensation, we had a long time where the public body that handles
workmen's compensation of disease [ph] or accidents covered by workmen's
compensation, where they didn't decide anything, so we were in darkness when we tried
to make up where the right stable of things were.

FINAL

Q - Phil Ross

{BIO 20618440 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

And that has been thrown some light on this now, so we have a better idea about this. We
have been able to release some of the serves we've made.

Q - Phil Ross

{BIO 20618440 <GO>}

Okay, thanks. Very helpful.

Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from the line of Steven
Haywood of HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Hi, thanks very much. I wanted to ask two questions, please. One is on the core [ph]
agreement you have still. I wonder if you can give us any sort of potential update or
insight on what this agreement is providing in terms of premiums, how that's developing
going forward, and the potential really here to oﬀset the sort of Danske Bank termination
agreement.
And then secondly, now that the Danish government bond, the tenure is negative, I
wonder if there is any implications for your life business here and if there is any convexity
issue on your solvency capital requirement here? Thanks.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

I'm going to answer the last one. Yes, there is a kind of convexity. It is kind of leveraged in
the Shipt [ph]. But we don't really use Danish government bonds for this hedge. We use
swaps. And it is not a matter of speciﬁc concern that the government bond yield is very
low. On the --

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

On the core side, we have actually -- this half year, actually delivered ﬁve new products to
the core platform. It has been content, travel insurance, (inaudible) and cat, and also
accident insurance. And this fall, we will also deliver our house products. Actually, I don't
have a number for you to -- like what are we going to see in terms of premium, but we are
saying that we expect around 8,000 [ph] to 10,000 policies on the core platform after this

Page 10 of 12



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2019-07-18

year. But it will not be core alone that can actually be take oﬀ the eﬀect on the Danske. So
it will not be 0.5% on the premium on the core for this year.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thanks very much.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mads Thinggaard of ABG. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi, this is Mads from ABG. Thank you for taking my questions. The ﬁrst one is on, I
mean, on the life income, where we're behind you the last quarters, how should one think
about Life pretax proﬁt in 2020. Would that be like checking '19 and then the detecting
[ph] 100 million, would that be kind of the standard view here.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

I'd say yeah, you just look at the forecast we made before '19 and then there is [ph]
anything, very far away from this.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Okay, thanks. Then just to understand correctly, the VA component. Now you say it's a bit
back here after Q2 to 10 to 15 basis point, but if it were to trend downwards again, could it
go below CBOE [ph] or will stop at zero?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Technically, it can go below zero, but we don't need to use it. So if it goes below zero, we
drive it.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Okay. And then just a bit of add on question that is not that much related to Q2 here, but
your competitor Tryg is talking a lot about fraud detection potential in their business.
What kind of the potential, are you ﬂagging here on fraud detection over the next years.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

We don't work exactly as Tryg does. As you know, so we have not stated, how much we
intend to ﬁnd or how much we hope to ﬁnd. But we have, by our machine learning team
developed our own fraud detection protection model, which seems superior to the
models that can be bought in the market. So we expect this to have reasonable impact, so
to speak.
