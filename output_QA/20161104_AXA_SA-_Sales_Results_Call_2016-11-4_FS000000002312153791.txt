Thank you, Andrew. Good morning to all. So let me begin by giving you an overview of
the main ﬁgures for the third quarter of the year and then we'll move, as said by Andrew,
to the Q&A.
So ﬁrst, total revenues were up 0.4% on a comparable basis to €75.7 billion. On Life &
Savings, APE growth improved in the third quarter with a 3.4% growth of the quarter,
ahead of market expectations. For the 9-month period, APE remained stable as compared
to the previous year. Protection and Health APE grew by 4%, driven primarily by higher
sales of group business in France, in Hong Kong, and in Switzerland.
G/A Savings grew by 23% mainly from good momentum in China, the continued success
of G/A capital light products in Japan, and the recovery of sales in Hong Kong, including
successful launch of the G/A capital light product in Hong Kong.
You will remember the high Chinese New Year single premium sales in the ﬁrst quarter. In
the subsequent quarters sales in China have been driven by relatively higher margin
whole life savings products.

Bloomberg Transcript

The growth in Protection & Health and G/A Savings APE were however oﬀset by the
adverse impact of the volatile ﬁnancial market conditions in Continental Europe on our
Unit-Linked business and lower reported (2:26) and other business, driven primarily by
the non-repeat of an exceptional sale of a large contract in France. NBV margin remained
high at 38%, indicating that along with the growth in the third quarter, we continued to
successfully focus on the proﬁtability of the business.
Life & Savings net ﬂows were strong at plus €4.9 billion with Protection & Health at €4.7
billion, Unit-Linked at €1.1 billion, and G/A capital light at plus €2.7 billion, partly oﬀset by
net ﬂows at minus €3.6 billion in traditional G/A, in line with our strategy. This includes
€0.6 billion of traditional G/A outﬂows related to the successful Class 20 (3:24) buyout
program in Belgium. This buyout program was opened from August 24 to August (sic)
[October] (3:32) 21, and so we may expect to see further outﬂows recorded in Q4. Yes, it
was from August 24 to October 21. I'm sorry. And so we may expect to see further
outﬂows recorded in Q4.
P&C revenues were up 3.4%, with strong growth in both personal and commercial lines,
driven by a positive price eﬀect of 3.4% overall. It had to be noted that the slight
reduction in growth rate in P&C gross written premium as compared to ﬁrst half 2016 was
expected due to the dissipation of the Turkey pricing impact. Excluding Turkey, the
revenue growth for the ﬁrst 9 months was 2.5% in line with half year 2016.
In Mature markets revenues increased 2%, mostly driven by tariﬀ increases notably in U.K.
and Ireland. In high growth market revenues were up 10%. This was primarily driven by
Turkey pricing impact and business growth in Mexico, mostly from the Health business.
Excluding Turkey, revenue growth in high growth markets was 5%. Direct revenues grew
at 6%, driven by Japan, the U.K., France, and Poland.

FINAL

Asset Management business now. Net inﬂows in Asset Management were at €18 billion –
plus €18 billion in the ﬁrst 9 months. Strong inﬂows in AXA IM, including some good ﬂows
into our Asian JV, were partially oﬀset by outﬂows in AB following the loss of two large
mandates in the institutional channel.
Average AUM dropped 2% driven by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact and the
withdrawal of ﬁrst tranche of assets from Friends Life in Q4 2015. Revenues in Asset
Management dropped 6% due to lower management fees, mainly driven by lower
average assets under management at AXA IM and the decrease in average management
fees at AB linked to higher share of ﬁxed income products.
Solvency II now. Solvency II ratio was at 191%, down 6 points versus ﬁrst half 2016. As the
change in EIOPA reference portfolio, which was minus 6 points, together with the impact
of adverse market conditions and estimated dividend accrual was partially oﬀset by a
positive operating income – return.
I would also like to remind you that on October 27, S&P upgraded its long-term ﬁnancial
strength rating of AXA's core operating subsidiaries to AA- with a stable outlook from A+
with a positive outlook. This is a recognition to our continued balance sheet strength and
resilience in face of the current rate context. Overall, I could say that the 9 months
numbers reﬂect our strong and continued discipline and resilience in this challenging
macroeconomic environment.

So the ﬁrst question comes from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Sir, please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Many thanks. I guess the ﬁrst thing I wanted to ask about was the – sort of the regulatory
landscape and update, like I said, in particular in France. I mean you mentioned the
Hamon law in your release. And perhaps you could talk through the impact you're seeing
on a net basis there.
But also I appreciate the irony of worrying about interest rate rises in the current
environment. But could you also comment on the second two (8:15) amendment, which
allows the regulator to restrict withdrawals from the bonds on euros (8:20), which – and if
that happens. And perhaps you could share with us the scale of the issue as you see it and
the level of protection you have there from unrealized gains in that portfolio.
And then the second area I wanted to ask on was just perhaps some general comments
on the business mix. I know it's a very positive development in the capital light G/A
Savings, but the non-capital light G/A Savings are also still growing signiﬁcantly. I was
wondering if you could just give us your thoughts on that.

Bloomberg Transcript

And also on the growth rate at the high-growth markets in P&C. I guess if you exclude the
price eﬀect there, the growth is sort of fairly ﬂat there. So I was just – yeah. Just wonder if
you could have some general comments on those. Thank you very much.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. So, Peter, let's ﬁrst start with the regulatory evolution and the points that you made
about France. What I can tell you is that there is also the ACPR, which is a French
supervisor already as a possibility to limit the surrender. So it's nothing new.
To be honest with you, this has been not very well managed from a communication point
of view. So honestly, in September we had a drop in the sales in both General Account
and Unit-Linked. And since then it recovered. So that means that October is better. So it's
– I believe that it's not – it shouldn't be in the end a big issue. And most people didn't
understand that the objective indeed of this measure is in case there will be – as you said,
in case there will be a sharp rise of interest rates. hen there would be some unrealized
losses and this would avoid these companies to realize losses.
As far as we are concerned, we have a quite high – the level of capital gains in France is
pretty high. So that means that we are, roughly speaking, in France, on top of my head,
we should have a running yield which is close to 3.5%.
On top of this maybe remember in the past I told you that we had in case of a sharp rise
of interest rates, that we had some options, swaptions. And we still have these swaptions.
So that means that for me, it's not at all a matter of worry. And I would say that the fact that
there is a recovery in October was quite a good sign.

FINAL

Your second question was about the business mix. And I would say that the fact that –
what I can tell you is that on the AB side, we had an average an average growth of – your
question was about the G/A investment and savings. And on average we were at 23%. So
we had a strong – a quite stronger recovery coming from Hong Kong, coming as well from
Southeast Asia, where you were focusing on the capital light versus capital non-light. But
indeed the capital non-light is mostly coming from China.
But on that side, it's a good news, because you remember that in the ﬁrst quarter you
were – I told you that we were in the negative NBV territory. Since then we recovered. NBV
margin from China for the ﬁrst 9 months is back at plus 8%. And I'm still expecting it to be
in this territory.
So that's quite good news. So, yes, we have a strong growth in both capital light and noncapital light, but with a strong recovery in non-capital light of our proﬁtability.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks very much. I guess the only other point I mentioned was the high growth
markets in P&C where – so if you exclude the price eﬀect, there's not a lot of growth
coming through at the moment.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gérald Harlin
Yeah. That means that it's excluding the price eﬀect in the high growth countries, we
should be more or less ﬂat. That's what I can tell you. But anyway the fact that we have a
strong price eﬀect coming from Turkey means that it explains why we are in such a
situation. So that's – keep in mind that in Turkey we increased, on top of my hand...

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Gérald Harlin
...my head, we increased our prices by 145%.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Yeah. Yeah. So thanks very much.

Operator
Your next question is from Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley. Sir, Please go ahead.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Morning, everybody. I've just got one question, please. Just on the Life margins. I just
wonder whether you could talk a little bit about the mix impacts on the margins? And
what would the interest rate impact be for you to update for current assumptions on the –
so the Europe margins? Thank you.

FINAL

Okay. So, ﬁrst, a general remark. We have a strong margin at 38%, Jon. And as you know,
this is based on the interest rates of last year. So when updated with the interest rates,
today's interest rate, we should be at 34%, 35%. So it doesn't change fundamentally the
fact that we have a strong margin and that we keep a strong margin. So that's the ﬁrst
point.
As far as going into a bit more detail, we could say that we still have an NBV margin which
is pretty strong. In Hong Kong it's 78%, in Southeast Asia, we are still at 24%. Also we had
a strong growth in China. In France we still have an NBV margin at 25%, which is quite ﬂat.
In the U.S. – and this is in France.
Sorry, your question was about the business mix. And the business mix is still quite strong,
because we still improved in Protection & Health. So we had an increase in our NBV
margin by almost 4 points in France. We had this decline in the savings product. But an
important point is to mention that we still have roughly 40% of our savings, which are in
Unit-Linked products. So that's mostly it.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the United States we have an NBV margin at 21%, which was slightly down 3.5 points.
But again we won't suﬀer in the U.S. from this decline and adjustment of interest rate,
because as you know for the VA business, it's adjusted for the year, and that's mostly it.
In Japan we still have a pretty high NBV margin, 105%, and we were quite stable
compared to last year, because we were at the same level last year. In countries like
Germany, Switzerland, we slightly increased our NBV margin. We are at 39% in Germany,
56% in Switzerland.
So I will say that across the board, we have a global stabilization or improvement, and we
have this dilution eﬀect coming from China. That's what I could tell you. But positive again
in China, which is a great news.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Excellent. Thank you very much.

Q - Paul De'Ath

FINAL

A couple of questions, please. Just on the growth in Hong Kong. It was obviously very
strong in the quarter. And I was just wondering if you see going forward any impact from
China getting tougher on some Mainland Chinese going to Hong Kong and are buying
life insurance products?
And then the other question was just on the Asset Management business. And so you've
obviously lost a couple of institutional mandates out of AllianceBernstein towards the end
of the quarter. And would you be able to elaborate slightly on what the – on those
mandates? So kind of why did they – why did you lose them? And also were they high
margin, low margin? Potentially, what's the impact going forward on revenues from those?
Thanks.

A - Gérald Harlin

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. First, what I could say about Hong Kong and your question is relative to union pay.
What I can tell you is that – a few comments. First of all, I should say that 98% of our
regular premium are below US$50,000.
And second, I could say that if I give you sensitivity, because I cannot be more precise.
Nobody knows exactly how it will end up. But even if we would have a new business – I'll
give you – new business sensitivity, that means that if we would have a decrease of AP
(18:26) by 10% or 20%, it means that our earnings calculation I made is that our impact on
earnings would be between minus 0.2% and minus 0.4%. So it's extremely small at the
scale of the group. Of course it's an important news. But compared to some of our peers,
it's much, much smaller on our balance sheet and P&L.
The second question is about Asset Management. Yes, you are right. So we lost two
contracts. And the impact of these contracts is quite signiﬁcant. It's contracts with
relatively small fees, because in basis points it was something around 7 basis points. And
this explains most of the decline of AB.
As far as AXA IM is concerned, it's diﬀerent. It's coming from Friends Life. And as far as
Friends Life is concerned, we had a drop. And excluding the impact of Friends Life, which
was expected, which was already announced, we would have been roughly ﬂat in term of
revenues.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Okay. Thanks.

The next question is from Andy Hughes from Macquarie. Sir, please go ahead.

FINAL

Hello. Hi. I wonder could you talk me through the 3Q-on-3Q price changes of P&C?
Because I'm not really following the point about the price declines being due to MedLA?
Because I look at the [Slide] A24 from the half year, on personal lines, you had 6%
increase in prices over the ﬁrst half of the year. That went to 4.2% over the ﬁrst 9 months.
And to get that math, I have to have price declines 3Q-on-3Q across most of the regions.
And is that actually what's happening? Are you cutting P&C prices to try and stimulate
growth? Or maybe you could explain the trend? I mean I can see the MedLA price rises
were 19.5% here for the ﬁrst half year. But how does that get to 10% for 9 months, unless
prices have gone down Q3-on-Q3? Same in France, other regions, please?

A - Gérald Harlin
I believe, Andy, that the most important factor is coming from Turkey, because the Turkey
increase on a relative basis was much more important in the ﬁrst part of the year, because
it's diluted, I could say, over the 9 months. Which explains why you – on the ﬁgures you
are right. But in fact if you exclude Turkey, we don't have such an element.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So just to be correct, even if I take out Turkey, Turkey true prices must have gone down on
personal lines to get you from 19.5% down to 9.7%? And even if we exclude Turkey, France
was up 0.07% in the ﬁrst half year and went to plus 0.04% for the 9 months, which
suggests Q3 had price falls for personal lines to get to that weighted average of 0.4%.
Have you changed the methodologies or...

A - Gérald Harlin
Excluding Turkey. Excluding Turkey, we have a plus 2% price eﬀect, plus 2% price eﬀect
excluding Turkey.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

For the third quarter?

A - Gérald Harlin
Yeah. For the ﬁrst 9 months, for the ﬁrst 9 months. And on top of my head, it was more or
less the same for the ﬁrst 6 months. That explains why I told you that it's mostly due to
Turkey.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Okay. Then maybe we can take it oﬄine, because I'm kind of a little bit confused on that
one. And then can you update on the reinvestment rate, please, for the Life business,
which was 2% at the half year? Is there any chance you could give an update on that
number? That'd be great.

A - Gérald Harlin

You remember that last time, in beginning of August I told you that presently we were
likely to invest between 1.6% and 1.7%. It's presently the case. And of today's conditions,
that's more or less the rate at which we invest, 1.6% roughly.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
On average. So in other words it's in line with what we thought. It's in line with our plan.
And so no worry on that side.

Q - Andy Hughes

Okay. Thanks so much.

Operator
The next question is from James Shuck from UBS. Sir?

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gérald Harlin
Morning.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

I have a few questions from my side, please, Gérald. So ﬁrstly, just looking at the net ﬂows
in the third quarter for NORCEE and MedLA, moved to outﬂows in the third quarter. I was
just wondering if you could just comment on what was going on there, please.
Secondly, in terms of the new business value as opposed to the APE, Southeast Asia and
China still declining in the third quarter. Obviously, you're piling on volume in China, but
I'm just surprised to see that Southeast Asia and China new business value is not actually
growing. Can you comment on that?
And then thirdly, just returning to your point around the NAIC proposals in the U.S. So I
was wondering could you give us an update on what your latest RBC ratio in the U.S. is? I
think you've previously given a number for 2015. And where you want to actually manage
that level to? I think you rely on voluntary reserves to some extent, which is boosting that
number to around about a 600% level. So a 400% kind of guidance is probably not
strictly appropriate, given the reliance on the voluntary reserves. And then if you could
just do a kind of update on how you see the NAIC proposals aﬀecting that number? And
any potential risk of recapitalization over time, please?

FINAL

And then ﬁnally, if you are able to comment on this one, great. I thought I'd have a go
anyway. But there's some kind of talk around the – revisiting the calculation of the
dynamic VA. I was just wondering, could you tell me – I mean there's a 6-point negative
impact in your Solvency II bridge from half year to now from a change in the reference
portfolio. What would happen if you were to move from a dynamic VA to a static VA,
please?

A - Gérald Harlin
No. There is – I'll start with this point. Yes, you are right, the VA has been updated. And it –
as we said and as we told you, it's a bit of a mystery, because it's quite complicated and
the way it's been – this adjustment wasn't expected, as you know. It's due to the revisions.
There is a yearly revision, so there will be one within a year. And the static VA is not at all
something which is under consideration. As you know there are – keep in mind that there
are still some companies which are using the VA with their own portfolio and not with the
reference portfolio. So we are miles away from – for companies using their internal
models. We are miles away from a situation where we would move to a static VA.

Bloomberg Transcript

And it's not at all the spirit of Solvency II. I remind you that the VA was a basic principle of
Solvency II. And last but not least, keep in mind that it wouldn't be consistent with – we
see in the U.K. the matching adjustment. Because in the U.K., the matching adjustment is
quite favorable, because it's linked to the assets. It's not the reference portfolio. And, of
course the matching adjustment is something which is not – and a threat. So I have no fear
on that side. I can tell you that we never discuss this with our own supervisor. So it's not a
threat for me.
As far as the NAIC is concerned, which was your other question, we don't – we are still –
the RBC ratio we don't give the ﬁgure for the quarterly account. But the RBC ratio is still
pretty high in the U.S. Last time, at the end of June, we were around 600%, so we are
pretty – actually high level.
As far as the NAIC is concerned, there is nothing new. As you know we are just in the
process now of we will get – we are in a testing phase, I would say. And we'll get news
next year. I don't expect to get news before.
About your questions relative – that it means that we would – we could be in a situation to
recapitalize our U.S. business without any ﬁgure, without any new rules, it's diﬃcult for me
to tell you how it will work. Nevertheless, I could say that we are quite well reserved. Keep
in mind that including the exact reserves, we are in the CT, 98%. So in the high 90s%.
(27:58) So very good level of capital.
And last but not least, as I told you already, I believe that I got your question at the end of
June. We are – we have – we – on the Solvency II point of view, we are using, as you know –
with the equivalents we are using the RBC ratio. But we are using a 300% CAR as a
requirement, which is pretty high, as you know, that we are by far the highest one.
So in case there would be a revision, a global revision of the NAIC capital requirement,
most probably there will be also an adjustment on the way we analyze it, because 300%
Page 10 of 20



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2016-11-04

of the low requirement has nothing to do with high requirement. So that's further point.

FINAL

You had also questions on NORCEE and MedLA, and it's coming from two elements. First
of all, it's coming from Belgium. Because in Belgium, we have an APE drop of 55%, which
is – on the ﬂows, sorry. It's from the ﬂows and I was answering on APE. Yet and back on
the ﬂows, we have a €500 million – a bit more than €536 million – €760 million outﬂows in
Belgium, most of it, €600 million, is coming from Class 20 (30:04).
As I said in my initial comment, why? Because it's a way for us – it's in-force management.
It's pure in-force management, because it was a traditional G/A business with very high
guarantees. And it's quite interesting for us, because it's a way to get rid of high
guarantees. And there are excellent condition.
As far as MedLA is concerned, it's minus €200 million in term of outﬂows. And it's mostly
coming from the Unit-Linked business and linked with MPS and the global situation of the
bank. Nevertheless, as far as MPS is concerned, I just wanted to ﬂag one element, which is
important, which is at the end of October, on the 24th, the bank presented its plan. And it
was clearly said – and you can go back to the presentation. And it was clearly explained
that they were relying on the growth and the strength of our partnership as far as Savings,
Protection, and P&C is concerned. So we can expect to have quite an improved
environment on that side.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

And I said the ﬁnal point was just on the Southeast Asia new business value in the third
quarter, in the 9-month stage?

A - Gérald Harlin
New business value on Southeast Asia. Yes, it was 24%, minus 10 points. But it's the minus
10 points is explained by 80% due to investment and savings. And investment and
savings again it's mostly linked to China, which means that roughly speaking, we have
20% – in Southeast Asia we have an NBV margin at 24%, and it was 21% in ﬁrst half. So
that's – and that's globally speaking, the improvement that I mention to you.

Hi, there. Two questions, please. Coming back on the U.S., wondered if you could update
us on the DOL reform, your latest thoughts. I think you were expecting 10% sales
reduction. Wondered if that is still true. Also you've been growing very strongly in the
non-GMxB variable annuities and wondered if you could give us a bit more color on that.
And second question is on the capital light G/A Savings product. Wondered basically if
you can give us more color on what sort of products these are? Are they hybrid or/and do
they have interest rate guarantees? And if so at what sort of level? Thank you very much.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. Thank you, Nick. First of all, about the DOL, no news. We conﬁrm the minus 10%. So
I don't change on that side, but no speciﬁc news. Maybe we'll have some news in
beginning of next year.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the non-GMxB in the U.S., it's mostly due to a product which is a Unit-Linked type of
product, which is SCS. And that's a product which is Unit-Linked with some protections,
and these protection are through options, where the client is protected on the limited
decline. And they give up in exchange some part of the upside. So that's the ﬁrst point.
It's high and it's SCS means less capital, and it's a slightly lower NBV margin. But on the
net return on capital, it's excellent.
As far as the capital light, your question about what type of products do you sell. Look, we
are – the best example is in some countries we don't give anymore a yearly guarantee.
And that's what will happen in France. I'm sure, Nick, that you heard about the (34:43) is a
guarantee in the end, 100% after 8 years only, which means that you can change the asset
allocation, you have much more ﬂexibility in some countries as well. We are selling
products with guarantees below 100%.
In the present interest rate environment, that's what we will do. And we are not the only
one to move in that direction. It's a global move of the market, which is good news.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

That's great, Gérald. Just a little bit more color on the Hong Kong capital light G/A
Savings product.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

I think that this is a new product, isn't it?

A - Gérald Harlin
Yes. It's a completely new product. It's a product – it's not exactly – so in Hong Kong it's
not exactly the – we have – we still have some very low guarantee. But on top we have

high surrender premium, surrender margin, surrender fees in the ﬁrst year. So that
explains why we are capital light.

FINAL

I mentioned that capital light is when the numerator, the AFR, is above the SCR. So that
means that it's accretive in term of capital and Solvency II capital.
So almost typically where presently when we – at the same time we still want to have a
strong percentage of our sales which are in Unit-Linked products. But at the same time in
order to sell more, even in conditions which are not very favorable for Unit-Linked
business, it's important to have these capital light products, which even in a very low
interest or close to 0% interest rate environment, allows us to sell products with a high
return in capital.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. It's Farooq Hanif from Credit Suisse. Just wanted to go back on the EIOPA
reference portfolio. Can you explain if there are going to be any asset allocation shifts? My
understanding is that the whole philosophy behind how they calculate the reference
portfolio has changed to include Unit-Linked. So if you could just explain (37:17).

A - Gérald Harlin
Yeah. It's no problem to discuss this topic. There are two. Again I'm not absolutely sure.
My own guess is that it's coming from Unit-Linked. So that means that including UnitLinked and then they're excluding Unit-Linked, which by deﬁnition reduced the ratio.
That's the ﬁrst assumption. That's the ﬁrst possibility.
And the second one is also the fact that they don't take into account the part which is
swapped. In other words imagine that in the portfolio, in the European portfolios, we
would have some U.S. dollar denominated bonds swapped into euros. Apparently, they
don't take this into account. But this is what I believe, but I'm not 100% sure. But I cannot
tell you more. So that's – and even when we discuss with them, they are not 100% clear. So
that's it.
So but from now on, I don't expect any further adjustment. Maybe it could be a pure, I
would say, mistake that they made at the beginning possibly. I don't know. I cannot be
more precise.

But doesn't it encourage you to take more kind of foreign bond risk, so to buy U.S.
corporate...

FINAL

A - Gérald Harlin
No, no, no, no. Let's be clear. Let me explain to you that, yes, we are using some U.S.
dollar bonds, but they are swapped into euro. So that means that we don't from an ALM
perspective – and in order to optimize our capital, our Solvency requirement, it's
important for us to hedge and not to take an open FX risk. We have some, but it's
extremely limited.
So that means that because it's – for us it presents a signiﬁcant risk that would immediately
translate into higher capital requirements. I don't think I'm clear, but – which means that,
yes, we are using plenty of diﬀerent bonds, even denominated in other currencies. But
they are swapped back into the balance sheet currency of the underlying company.
We do the same in Switzerland. That's another example. In Switzerland, as you know,
there is a scarcity of paper. And today, globally speaking, in Europe it's also starting to be
the case due to the CREE (39:59). But nevertheless, we have this capacity. We have plenty
of – the market, the U.S. market, the bond U.S. market is very deep. But anyway when we
invest, then we swap it back into Swiss franc for Switzerland or into euro for Europe. It's
clear?

Yeah. Yeah.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

What happened to Unit-Linked since 30 of September? Has there been any recovery in
terms of sales and net ﬂows?

A - Gérald Harlin
I told you that it was slightly better in France. October has been a bit better. So but I don't
have suﬃcient, I would say, vision in order to tell you. But France, which is one of our
biggest market, apparently recovered. That's in line with the – but in France when I said it
recovered, the Savings business recovered. But we are still around 40%. So we still sell
60% of General Account and 40% of Unit-Linked roughly speaking.

The next question is from Michael Huttner from JPMorgan. Sir, please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you. I just have two questions. One is the 191%. I just wondered if you could give
more granularity on that. Consensus and I was at 192%. And you might say, well, it was
only 1%. But given you had ﬂagged the 6% change so well, I just wonder if there's a
moving part I'm missing here? I don't know what it would be. So it's an open question.
And the other one, of the – you mentioned the S&P review. In there, there was only one
negative. And I'm sorry I'm mentioning a negative, the rest was brilliant. So it's a very
good job, well done. And the negative was that they said they downgraded your ERM
factor, because they said you were subject to multiple something or other. And I just
wondered if you could explain their thinking? What it could mean for you Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. May I start with the last question? Yes, it was a great news for us, because it's a strong
recognition of our strength, balance sheet strength. And so it's bright. You are right. That
means that we have been downgraded. We are still good, but we are not at the top of the
year end. Why? It's coming from the fact – and if you go into detail in their comments, it's
coming from the fact that, as I said, that in the U.S., we have two diﬀerent frameworks. We
have one framework, which is equivalence, and we have another one, which is Solvency II.
As you know and many times I repeated it today. So where we manage our products ways
– the way we price our products is completely linked to Solvency II. Although we'll beneﬁt
from the equivalence, it's driven by Solvency II.
But the fact that the U.S. represent a large part of our business makes that this discrepancy
between two diﬀerent frameworks is something that they considered as justifying a slight
penalization. But thus far, I insist on this on that provision on which we have been always
crystal clear, the way we manage our business including in the U.S., including for pricing,
RBS, and so on, is a pure Solvency II type of approach with the Solvency II requirement.
The ﬁrst question – your ﬁrst question was about the Solvency II...

191%. The 191%.

A - Gérald Harlin
Yes, 191%.

FINAL

So let's – we have been discussing, there were many questions on the reference portfolio.
So starting from 197%, which was the Q2 2016 Solvency operating return, it's roughly 4%,
dividend it's roughly 2%. I remind you that we are using as usual the dividend of the
previous year. And then we have a marketing part excluding FX, that means that it's minus
3%. And then the remaining part is roughly minus 5%, of which minus 6% are the
reference portfolio. So that's mostly it.
If we would do it today, maybe we would be slightly better on the marketing part. That's
what I could say. But it's ﬂuctuating by deﬁnition.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

And on that thing I was discussing with your really helpful colleague yesterday, and he
was explaining that when – I'm going to get this wrong, so don't – when the corporate
bond spreads narrow, the impact on you, because of the way the volatility adjustor works,
is actually negative. So now corporate bond spreads, which I always think is positive
because the bond values go up, is actually not great, because there's a bigger impact on
the way you value the liabilities. Have I got it right? For my kind of...

A - Gérald Harlin

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, no. I believe that it's relatively marginal. The ﬂuctuation, today's ﬂuctuation in the
spreads, we know it's small, because it's 1, 2 points. So I would not ﬂag this event as an
indicator of a change in the Solvency ratio.
I could say on the reverse that compared with the situation of August – July-August, the
recent rise of interest rates of 20 basis points roughly, because in Germany, we are at 15
[basis points]. It's a good news, because it's an improvement, which will translate into our
future earnings marginally. But nevertheless, it's important and in the Solvency as well. So
that's it. But, no. I would say it's a secondary factor.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Secondary factor. Okay.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay?

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Good morning.

A - Gérald Harlin

FINAL

Morning.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Three questions if I can. Can I come back on James Shuck's question and just ask the
numeric answer to what the impact on your Solvency II coverage would be if you moved
to a static VA? I understand you don't think it's on the table, but it would be interesting to
know.
Secondly, just wanted to understand the consumer proposition of oﬀering guarantees
below 100% on general account products. I mean you can probably guarantee to give
somebody's money back if you put the money under the bed. So doesn't look that
promising to give less than that.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then thirdly, a more generic question. I'm still – looking back over 5 years, the
proﬁtability of the Protection & Health business hasn't moved at all. Every quarterly
update, we get ﬁgures from you saying that there's strong net ﬂows and good sales and
high margins in General Account Protection & Health. I just wonder why that's not ﬂowing
through to the IFRS proﬁt.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. Let's start with the last part of your question. I believe that your question is that, yes,
I hope and I expected it to ﬂow over time in the IFRS proﬁt. And I look to – I can refer to
what I said in the presentation of the plan at the end of June. And you remember that at
that time, I said that I was expecting the Protection & Health loss ratio to go down
between 93% and 94% from a level of 95.4% at the end of 2015. And I can tell you that we
are doing everything.
And even if we have some one-oﬀ events in the past that made that, you are right, our
proﬁtability in term of Protection & Health was not – improvement in proﬁtability was not
obvious. I'm still expecting it. And I'm doing – and we are doing everything in order it to
ﬂow into the earnings. So it's, yes, I'm expecting it. I repeat what I said at the end of June.
Your other question about the 100% and the guarantee. The point is that it's a way – look,
it's a way for people, it's a way for investors to have a part invested in unit in – a higher
part invested in equities or in hedge funds or in more volatile instruments without running
the risk to be below their guarantees. And I can tell you that even if – in Italy, for example,
we sell products which are below 100% and with guarantees below 100%, people prefer
to have in a period where rates are close to 0%. They accept and it conﬁrms the maturity
of our clients to accept – to take a bit more risk, while at the same time giving up factors
for guarantees. So that's something that more and more appears and in diﬀerent markets.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

But, Gérald, what is the money invested? And what proportion is in equities or hedge
funds versus bonds?

FINAL

A - Gérald Harlin
Instead today, let's say that these are traditional product, that's one of the concerns you
have, let's say 5% roughly, invested in equity. And with this if you have a guarantee, take
my ﬁrst example of guarantee after 8 years. Then in such a case, you could have a more –
an even more important part invested in equity.
In other words, today, I have one ﬁgure in mind. If you make some projections today with
guarantee, if you invest today in your portfolio, you would have a traditional portfolio with
a guarantee at 100%. Every year you can expect to have 1.5%, whereas if it's at the end of
the 8 years, it should be 2.5%. That's roughly what we can expect. In term of percentage
of equity, that means in such a case, we would move to 10%, maybe 15%.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Okay, thanks. And the static VA question?

A - Gérald Harlin

The next question is from David Barma from Exane BNP Paribas. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - David Barma

{BIO 19957338 <GO>}

Thank you. Hi. Good morning. I just have one question on the French business. So
recently, Mr. [Jacques de] Peretti in an interview gave us some color on the organizational
changes in France with the creation of three divisions namely. Is there any additional
details you could provide us on this? And more speciﬁcally, will there be I guess an
integration between the online business of Direct insurance and the traditional multichannel business? Or will the direct remain a separate platform? Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. So relative to your ﬁrst question on France, I would say that it's – since 2003, that
means over the last 13 years, we had an organization which was by market. By market
means that you had an organization with ﬁrst line of business for individuals and next for
the commercial. And we believe today that at the time where there is much more
interaction between both, it makes more sense.

And in term of eﬃciency, it's better to have the networks dedicated to both. I remind you
that in France, our strength is mostly on the SME and main market. And that's why it's – I
would say that it's much more eﬃcient. You can go to the – there is a press article that was
issued yesterday, and which is an interview from Jacques de Peretti, the Head of AXA
France. And you will have all the detail concerning this restructuring. At the same time,
what we are expecting is much more eﬃciency. And I would say that it would be part of
our €2.1 billion plan. And we can expect that France will contribute signiﬁcantly to it.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everyone. It's Blair Stewart from BofA. Just one follow up on the U.S.,
please, Gérald, with regards to the DOL. We've had some of the distributors come out
and talk about whether they're going to move to fee or go down the best interest clause
exemption route. I just wonder if there's any update from the AXA perspective.
And then secondly, on your 10% guidance. Is that something that you feel is appropriate
for this year and then have a gradual increase in sales thereafter? Or how do you see the
medium-term picture for the U.S. business for the year? Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
Yeah. We will have a gradual improvement after. So that means that we consider that it will
be 10% But that after and normally within a reasonable period of time, we should recover.
So it's not minus 10% for the next 5 years. And, Blair, it's an important point.
As I told before, as far as DOL is concerned, we don't have so much experience. And it
will be next year, so it's I cannot give you any more insight. But we are preparing
ourselves. And I would say that we consider that it will be temporary, and this will be a
temporary decline.
