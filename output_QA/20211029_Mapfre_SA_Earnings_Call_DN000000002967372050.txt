Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Mapfre's Results Presentation for the first
nine months of 2021. This is Felipe Navarro, Head of Investor Relations and Capital
Markets, as well as Corporate Treasurer. Fernando Mata, our CFO, will walk us through the
main figures and highlights of the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

As a reminder, additional information can be found in our website, including the MD&A, as
well as the usual spreadsheets. At the end of the presentation, we will open up the Q&A
session. You can submit your questions using the "ask a question" link on the bottom of
your screen. We will try to answer all questions as time allows. The IR team will be
available to answer any pending questions after the call.
Before we start the presentation, I would like to give an overview on how the pandemic is
developing in our main markets. As you are aware, infection and mortality numbers are
coming down at global level. This allows us to feel more -- feel more optimistic about the
outlook of the pandemic with more countries close to reaching some form of normality as
vaccination rates should continue to increase, but at a slower rate. At the end of
September, around 96% of employees in Spain were working from the premises, 78% in
the US, and 89% in Brazil. We will continue adapting to changes in conditions in every
country.
Now let me turn the call over to our CFO, Fernando. The floor is yours.

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Felipe, and thank you everyone for being here with us. Before I go into the
details, let me start by saying that we are very satisfied with our third quarter results.
Performance at insurance units was in line with expectations, showing that we are on track
to meet the guidance announced at our AGM. Top line performance was excellent and it
is worth highlighting strong local currency growth in Spain, Brazil, and also Mexico. The
normalization of economic activity and lifting of restrictions should continue to support
premium trends.

FINAL

There were three main elements impacting third quarter results. One, regarding COVID
claims, there has been a normalization in mature markets and the reinsurance business.
Life Protection and Health Claims in Latin America continue at high levels, but improving
compared to previous quarters. We expect these improvements to feed into results in
the coming quarters. Two, in general, the normalization of economic activity has led to an
over-reaction in mobility causing the Motor combined ratio to increase.
On the other hand, we are also seeing positive trends in other lines like Homeowners and
Health. In the end, we should expect these ratios to normalize in the coming quarters.
Last, in terms of NatCat losses, it has been an active quarter with the Bernd storm in
Germany and Central Europe being the most relevant event. In order to offset these cat
losses, we opportunistically took advantage of market conditions, realizing a significant
amount of capital gains fundamentally in equity. In Iberia, we continue to outperform the
market in premiums in key Non-Life segments with good -- very good growth in Life, while
maintaining strong underlying technical margins.

Bloomberg Transcript

Reinsurance and Global Risks are also consolidating positive trends on the back of tariff
increases. Despite the active NatCat quarter, the combined ratio is still down over four
points year-on-year. In the United States, results are resilient. Thanks to the streamlining
process over the last few years. And the Northeast continues to be the largest contributor
to profits. Brazil is also well-positioned to improve metrics as the economy recovers.
Finally, I would like to highlight our strong capital position with the solvency II ratio of 195%
at the end of June, which is in line with our risk appetite. Dividend upstreaming continues
to be a strong as subsidiaries and the Board has approved an increase of EUR0.01 to
reach a EUR0.06 interim dividend to be paid on November 30, one month earlier than
usual, in line with the group's commitment to returning to a sustainable dividend.
Now I will comment on some of the main figures. We are on track to meet our guidance.
Premiums are up 7% in euros. At constant exchange rates, growth was over 10%, with
strong trends in both Life and Non-Life. Currency movements reduced growth by
approximately 3 percentage points, but have been less of a drag than the previous
quarter. On the other hand, the renewal of the multi-year policy in Mexico added
approximately 3% of growth.
The Group combined ratio was 96.5%, slightly above guidance and 95.7% at insurance
units, mainly due to the high NatCat activity during this quarter.
Also, I have to remind you, the provision for early retirement booked in the second
quarter. Excluding this provision, the combined ratio would be 95.8% for the Group, 94.8%
at insurance unit. And the expense ratio would be 28%, with a nearly 1 percentage point
reduction. As a conclusion, we are on track to meet the 95% guidance, assuming normal
Cat activity in the fourth quarter.
Mapfre's net result is EUR524 million, up over 16%, in line with the EUR700 million
guidance for the year-end. The ROE excluding goodwill write-downs is 8.6%, slightly

FINAL

above the guidance of 8.5%. And finally, shareholders' equity is slightly down on the year,
mainly due to the reduction of unrealized capital gains on the available for sale portfolio.
On this slide, I will take you through the breakdown of the adjusted attributable result.
Regarding NatCat claims, it was an active quarter. We had smaller impacts from storm
Volker and hurricane Ida, but we have considered this claims business as usual. On the
other hand, storm Bernd in Central Europe, in July, which was initially considered as a midsized event has become one of the largest Cat events in Europe with a EUR92 million
impact for Mapfre. We have reached the priority limit of EUR125 million, so we will not be
affected by any negative -- any potential negative loss development from this claim.
Furthermore, a second layer of Cat coverage, what we call the frequent cover -- the
frequency cover has also been triggered. Therefore, potential impact from any single
relevant event would have a quite limited impact on P&L. In previous quarters, we didn't
consider the different COVID impacts at insurance operations as extraordinary due to the
offsetting nature. This year, most of the COVID impacts in Non-Life lines remain neutral,
but COVID-related Life Protection claims are being considered as a large loss, particularly
in Latin America. So we are disclosing the effect for both years.

Bloomberg Transcript

The impact of COVID claims, including insurance and reinsurance reached EUR107 million
as of September, EUR23 million higher than last year, but lower on the quarter. Our
investment portfolio was well positioned to take advantage of the favorable financial
markets to offset these losses. As a result, realized gains are up over EUR76 million.
The line Other has contributed positively, mainly due to asset sales and the release of an
earn-out provision in Spain, which were communicated in the second quarter. You can see
the details on the slide. In 2020, other items included a provision for restructuring.
Excluding this impact, the adjusted net result was EUR623 million, slightly higher than last
year. And regarding the third quarter, the EUR210 million adjusted result is down
compared to the second quarter due to the uptick in Motor frequency.
Finally, I would like to mention that this quarter reflects at EUR20 million contribution from
Bankia second and third quarter results, stemming from the change in accounting
treatment following conversations with regulators. The changes are consequence of the
length of the process and the majority voting rights still held by Mapfre.
On this slide, we show the main trends this quarter. I would like to highlight the positive
performance in Iberia. Premiums are up over 7% and we are outperforming the market in
both in Life and key Non-Life segments, recovering the leading position. We are growing
1% in Motor, while the market is down by a similar amount. And the number of units
continues strong, up 3.6%.
Growth is also robust in other segments. Health is growing nearly 10%. Condominiums is
up 6%, and commercial lines nearly 10%. The combined ratio remain strong at 96%,
despite an uptick in mobility and Motor frequency during the quarter. In Brazil, currency
headwinds are still relevant, but improving significantly, with average real exchange rates
down 8%. Premiums are up over 16% in local currency, with healthy growth trends in Agro,

FINAL

Motor and Life Protection. The EUR31 million decrease in the attributable result is mainly
due to still high COVID-related Life Protection claims. The combined ratio remains strong
at 87%, slightly higher than last year, driven by the uptick in Motor frequency. The
economic outlook continues to improve with growth in consumption and exports and
SELIC rates up. The currency is improving, but with high volatility while we're keeping an
eye on inflation trends.
Premiums in LATAM South grew around 7% in euros and premiums in LATAM North are up
over 44%, 5% excluding the largest multi-year policy in Mexico. Local currency growth was
solid in most segments, and it is worth mentioning, Colombia, up 30%, Peru, up over 15%,
and Panama, up 8%. Combined ratios in both regions remain at good levels with some
deterioration in LATAM North due to COVID-related claims affecting health, as well as the
uptick in Motor frequency.
Performance in North America has been affected by currency depreciation, with average
dollar exchange rates down around 5%. The combined ratio is in line with the previous
year, and investment results have been strong. In the US, we should expect new business
to catch up as the economy continues to recover.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Eurasia, premiums are down due to the non-renewal of the dealership channel in Italy
as well as some depreciation of the Turkish lira. All countries have contributed positively to
results, except Italy, which was affected by hailstorms during the quarter and also high
expenses that still need to be adapted as we mentioned in previous results presentation
to the new business model.
At MAPFRE RE, premiums are also up, supported by positive pricing trends. The combined
ratio is down over 4 percentage points year-on-year at 98.5% despite the high NatCat
activity. The net result is up significantly, and the unit has shown a high level of financial
flexibility realizing investment gains to offset this impact. Furthermore, the turnaround in
Global Risks is evident with results up over EUR20 million year-on-year.
In the Assistance business, volumes are down 18% as we continue with our streamlining
process. Regarding the results, we're very close to breakeven, reporting a slight profit
during the last two quarters. As a reminder, last year was strongly affected by travel
cancellation claims, and this quarter, there was a positive EUR5 million impact from the
closing of InsureandGo in the UK.
On this slide, I would like to comment on the Life business at insurance units. In Iberia,
premium performance has been outstanding. Thanks to the rollover of product maturities,
with a focus on unit-linked and also several large single premiums policies that were
issued during the quarter. In Brazil, premiums were affected by currency depreciation,
while local currency growth was healthy, with improving trends throughout the year in both
channels. The Life attributable result is down, mainly due to strong impact from COVID
claims in LATAM. Mortality in Brazil has declined continuously since June, and is now at the
lowest level since November 2020. The situation in Mexico, Colombia, and Peru is also
improving. Just as a reminder, the result in Iberia is up significantly, due to the already
mentioned release of an earn-out provision.

FINAL

On the right you can see the quarterly evolution of the impact of COVID-related Life
Protection claims in the region. There was a total impact of EUR92 million, of which, EUR43
million were in Brazil. Mexico, Colombia, and Peru were also strongly affected. The thirdquarter impact was lower than the previous quarter, and with September data, it seems -it seems that we have passed the peak. Average cases and the figures are beginning to
come down, which us -- makes us more optimistic about the outlook for the coming
quarters.
Now I will move on to the balance sheet and capital. This slide includes a full disclosure of
the breakdown and variation of the investment portfolio and total assets under
management. Spanish sovereign debt continues to be our largest exposure, now EUR12.4
billion and Italian debt with EUR2.8 billion is the second largest. Both sovies are mainly
allocated to immunized portfolios. The investment portfolio is slightly up, mainly due to
the rally in equity markets, which helped mitigate the fall in fixed income investments due
to higher yields, with the Spanish sovereign up over 40 basis points year-to-date.

Bloomberg Transcript

Pension and mutual funds have had strong performance, growing 7% and 14%
respectively, both due to market movements as well a positive net contribution of EUR104
million in pension funds and EUR290 million in mutual funds at the end of September.
On the top left are the details of our euro area actively managed fixed income portfolios.
Market value of these portfolios is around EUR12.6 billion. The non-life portfolio has an
accounting yield of around 1.5%, down only 15 basis points year-to-date. The Life portfolio
has a yield of a little under 3.5%, down 20 basis points. The fall in yields is consistent with
the reduction in duration in both portfolios. Duration in Non-Life is now at 7.8, around 4.5
years excluding the burial segment, which as you know, is a long tail business, while in the
Life portfolio, duration is 6.8.
On the bottom left, you can see the details of the fixed-income portfolios in other
markets which portfolio yields up around 50 basis points in Brazil, now at 6.6%, and
relative stability in North America. Realized gains and losses in actively managed portfolios
in the Euro area were around EUR96 million, significantly up year-on-year and on the
quarter as well as we took advantage of favorable equity markets to realized gains, to
compensate NatCat losses. At the end of September, there were still EUR85 million of
unrealized gains in equity and investment funds in our actively managed portfolio in Iberia
and MAPFRE RE.
Shareholders' equity stood at a little under EUR8.5 billion, slightly down on the quarter.
Currency conversion differences were relatively stable in the quarter, but up EUR113 million
on the year, stemming from a notable appreciation of the US dollar, together with stability
in the Brazilian real. Net unrealized gains on the available for sale portfolio were down
EUR397 million on the year, due to rising yields.
The breakdown by region, which is new information we're disclosing is as follows. LATAM
with a fall off EUR151 million; Iberia with a EUR136 million; MAPFRE RE with EUR57 million
and North America with EUR50 million. As you can see, Iberia's impact has been limited
due to the high degree of immunization of Life portfolios as well as a profit-sharing. There

was also a EUR92 million negative adjustment against reserves due to the acquisition of
minority in MAPFRE Peru Vida in the third quarter, which is reflected in the line Other. The
breakdown of currency conversion differences and currency movements are shown in the
table on the right, along with the standard sensitivity analysis.
On the chart on the left, you can see the breakdown of the capital structure, which
amounted to EUR13 billion, of which over three-quarters is equity. Leverage is slightly up
on the quarter around 24%. The slight increase is mainly due to seasonality. The upstream
of dividend forecast for the fourth quarter should lower leverage and financial needs by
year-end.
On the right, you can see the Solvency II figures for June 2021 which were released last
month. The ratio sits at 195%, comfortably near the midpoint of our range. The main
moves in the quarter were related to the investment portfolio, including the -- the rating
downgrade of Colombia as well as the symmetric adjustment which increased the capital
charge for equity.

Bloomberg Transcript

Before moving on to the Q&A session, I would like to make a few closing remarks. First of
all, we are very satisfied with the results in Iberia, our largest operation. We have
recovered our position as market leader, with a strong premium performance and we are
well positioned for profitable growth. We are moving ahead with our transformation and
digitalization plans to have leaner and more efficient operations.
Profitability is robust in the United States, especially in the Northeast, and we are
benefiting from a successful restructuring process. The new agreement with the AAA club
will strengthen our position in this distribution channel. In Latin America, we successfully
adapted our business model to the new environment. The pandemic and economic
situation remains challenging, but with a significantly improved outlook. It was a tough
quarter for the reinsurance industry, no doubt, from a NatCat perspective. MAPFRE RE still
reported resilient results, underpinned by its investment approach and a strong
contribution from Global Risks.
As for Bankia, the exit process is moving forward, and the approval from the Competition
Authority was already granted. Furthermore, we are expecting to receive the independent
appraisal value by November. So if everything goes well as planned, the transaction
should close by year end. As usual, we will keep you updated with any further
developments.
In conclusion, it has been an another positive quarter, showing growth in premiums and
results in a more positive scenario, but not without uncertainties coming from the
economic environment. Volatility in combined ratios will remain in the short-term across
different segments and geographies as activity continues to normalize with an expected
neutral impact on the underwriting results. In the medium and long-term, future tariffs will
be adapted to reflect changes in underwriting trends and risk profiles.
We are on the right path to meet our 2021 commitments, and so far, we haven't seen any
evidence that jeopardizes this guidance. The interim dividend of EUR0.06 is proof that
Page 6 of 16

we're committed to return to a sustainable dividend path.
Thank you, again. I will now hand the call over to Felipe to begin the Q&A.

Questions And Answers
A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Thank you. Thank you very much, Fernando, for this very complete and deeper
explanation of the results. So we move now for the Q&A. First one is from Maksym Mishyn
from JB Capital. Do you see risks on the Non-Life claims if inflation persist and logistics
costs remain high? Which segments could be the most impacted?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, we have to analyze. I mean, this inflation risk for both line of business. Regarding
auto, as we already mentioned, we are very well protected. We've got a wonderful
garage chain network -- preferred garage network, with a significant reduction in cost
when we compare to standard garages. And also, we have bargaining agreement which is
-- I mean is fixed for this year. There is no adaptation to inflation rate at year end. And
also, we directing most of these claims to this preferred garages. According to the data
from the last month, I guess, like 90% of the car crashes are directed to the preferred
garage network. So from this side, I don't see an inflationary risk affecting motor line.
Other, such as Health and we mentioned at the June presentation, we really notice a
significant increase in hospital bills. I mean, the rate -- the increase due to the COVID
scenario, and also the average cost from medical services increased as well due to the
additional test carried out in this COVID environment. Fortunately, this trend has changed,
and average costs are coming to normality.
Even though, I mean, we should expect a significant increase in health for renewals as you
probably read in the paper -- in the Spanish paper affecting civil servants and also -- which
is -- by far is the largest policy in Spain, but also affecting too normal personal policies.
The remaining particularly commercial lines, I don't see any inflationary risk. And just as a
conclusion, if you look back for the last 10 years, I mean, Motor line has been extremely
competitive. And also, there is a lot of transparent basically derived from price
comparison sites. So for the last 10 years, most of the efficiencies in cost were
automatically transferred to prices. And so, it has been in relative terms have reduction in
the average premium for auto for the last 10 year. So we should see a similar trend. And
let's say that as a general rule, I mean, we expect the sector assuming part of inflation
cost and transferring only a small part of inflation to rates.

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. We have another question coming from the same - the same person from JB Capital. Do you see -- no, sorry. No, from Ivan Bokhmat from
Barclays. We have seen a deterioration in the combined ratio in Iberia in the third quarter
2021. Same trend as same of your peers have experienced already. How much of that

Page 7 of 16



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2021-10-29

comes from the accident frequency normalizing? Can you update us on claims inflation
and pricing in Motor and other -- another PC lines?

FINAL

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. I'm -- I'm going to take first the last one. I mean, regarding trends in pricing and also
talking on Motor line business. And as you remember, I mean, last year, we implemented
a sort of individual discount policy for good policy holders in order to retain and reduce
any potential churn among the COVID scenario. These discounts came to an end at the
end of 2020, but obviously, I mean, this reduction in premiums is also being carried over
for earned premiums in 2021 also affecting the combined ratio.
Let's say that as a general rule, I mean, rates has come to normality, and we should
expect this reduction in non-premiums to phase out over the coming months. And
regarding loss ratio, I know that some of the peers, they already made comments on that
topic. We are a little bit different. Regarding average cost, we haven't seen any change in
previous metrics. So practically, I mean, we're close to zero in terms of variation.

Bloomberg Transcript

Regarding frequency, you're right, I mean, it is quite similar to the increase in mobility, but I
would like to give an additional comment on this. Most of the increase in the frequency on
the reported claims are on smaller crashes, smaller scratches and affecting physical
damage for the full cover policies. And -- but that we understand, they're being filed with
the company due to some reduction on coverage. It is a trend that we seen in the past as
well in time of restriction of economic unrest and we see some change from full cover -to full cover with deductions on -- sorry with deductibles, and also from full cover to basic
policies only TPL.
So let's say that the -- it seems to me -- it seems to be a sort of catch-up effects as some
of these claims are coming from previous months and -- of the clients before switching
from coverage of -- from other cars -- to other cars. What they want is just to leave the car
in perfect conditions before reducing coverage in their policies. So my conclusion is that
some of or part of this increase in frequency is temporary and it should phase out in the
coming quarter, but obviously, there is an increase in frequency as we've seen in other
peers.

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much, Fernando. Now from Maksym from JB Capital. Do you
continue to see pressure in premiums in Motor insurance in Spain? Are they easing?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

More than pressure on premium which has existed for -- since ever. I mean, in the Spanish
Motor market what we're seeing is a reduction in coverage. And also switching to other
carriers, which is normal in economic scenario, like the one we are living. I guess, it is also
related to the age of the Spanish fleet. It is almost 13 years old, if I remember well, and
it's basically due to the reduction in new car sales. I mean, it's extremely difficult to see full
cover policies for cars older than seven years. So our policyholders even remain within
MAPFRE and they change to lower and simpler policies in order to reduce the bill. So this
Page 8 of 16



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2021-10-29

is the basic, let's say, new trend that we see in this quarter and probably will remain for
the fourth quarter as well and some months.

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Basically this not such a war -- or softening in the market that we can translate into
war pricing in

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

I don't see a war price. Currently a lot of pressure on -- I will say, on coverages, I mean
switching from full cover to simpler policies.

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay. There is a question from Mario Ropero from Bestinver, and he is asking about what
can we expect from the Palma eruption. This volcano that erupted in the Canary Islands
and which is mainly cover -- I mean, it is all covered by the Consorcio here. So any other
consequence for the --

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Not really. I mean, it's part of the social aid that we granted to some of our policyholders
with properties ensured in Mapfre and we granted 9,000 indemnity for those that they
lose their properties. And Mapfre has a quite significant market share in the Canary
Islands. And as has happened in other Cat events, Mapfre will be close to the
policyholders in order to provide the -- the help they need.

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much, Fernando. Farquhar from -- Murray from Autonomous has a
question on COVID. In broad terms, what is the net balance of COVID impacts in the
primary insurance business, between positives from frequency versus negatives from
mortality? He says that he thinks that previously the suggestion was been that around the
balance -- they were around almost balanced. And now it feels that these are presumably
a net negative for the nine months 2021. We can have some kind of a color on this effect?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Farquhar. This is a quite interesting question. As we've mentioned in
previous presentation, I mean, it is still difficult to isolate or differentiate those
improvements in combined ratio due to efficiencies or better underwriting policies
implemented in the auto lines and differentiate from the lockdown or the confinement or
the lack of mobility. As we mentioned in previous presentation, we understand that the -both negative and positive effects from the pandemic were neutral in 2020. And also
during the first half of 2021, we're sort of neutral.
I wouldn't say that in the third quarter that we presented the numbers and we expected
an uptick in Life Protection, particularly in LATAM, because of the lack of the small space of
vaccination and the lack of vaccines. But the third quarter was a surprise, and let's say, that

Page 9 of 16



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2021-10-29

the third quarter wasn't symmetric effects, and I will say that it is a little bit negative from
Life Protection.

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

FINAL

It should be -- we could define that third quarter as transitional quarter between normality
and...

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah, I guess, yeah, I mean, it is quite different from different geographies, because in
LATAM South, there are still some countries, if you see the financial report with combined
ratio below 90, which is amazing. I mean, in these conditions, even recovering mobility.
Other countries such as Brazil and Spain, combined ratio in Automobile is around 100. And
so, there is a lot of moving parts affecting different geographies and different lines as
well. This is a transitional quarter as Felipe said, and we've seen recovery in mobility,
reduction in other lines as well, and increases particularly in Life Protection. But as I
mentioned in the wrap up, I mean, we should expect those lines and those combined
ratios to converge into standards in the coming month.

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

In the coming quarter sorry.

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Fernando. Next question is related with dividend. I mean, it is Ivan
Bokhmat from Barclays. He is asking, can you remind us intention regarding the dividend?
Is it return to 2019 level with EUR0.14 per share?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well, Ivan, this is a -- at this moment, it is a difficult question and it can't be answered. I
mean, we returned to the same interim dividend EUR0.06 is the first step to return to
sustainable dividend path. And once we finish this year and we meet the guidance, I think,
we will be a big push and probably another step, I mean, to return to this dividend path.
The final amount we have to wait on the Board at the beginning of next year, just on the
final decisions. But we are pretty committed with investors and we will come back to the
sustainable path as soon as possible. That's what we mentioned and we stick to this
policy.

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much, Fernando. Maksym from JB Capital. Could you
update us on how you plan to replace the business volumes loss due to the end of the
Bankia-Mapfre JV?

FINAL

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well, organic growth, a big push from Santander. Any potentially market opportunity we
can get. And I mean, Mapfre is growing very, very well, and 7% in Spain. I think with this
growth, we offset any lack of new business from Bankia, and we're not worried, I mean,
with the situation. We know that it was a very important channel, but what Mapfre has
shown with this extraordinary performance in premiums growth is that we are able, I
mean, to offset any potential lack of -- or any distribution channel that could lower, I mean,
their expectations.

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

I mean, it's very important to speak about the extremely resilience of the organic business
now of Iberia that is ready to offset any other big effect like the one of closing the
Bankia's network.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Absolutely. You can have a look into the financial report that the Life Mapfre VIDA. You see
this the extraordinary premium growth on the Mapfre's network compared to the
bancassurance distribution channel. So let's say that this is a very important distribution
channel that we have to optimize in this situation and also putting in value, I mean, which is
very important.

Thank you very much, Fernando. We have another question for you related with RE
activities coming from Phil Ross from Mediobanca. Can you recap on reinsurance, please?
You mentioned 125 million limit with the reference of -- to the 92 million storm Bernd loss?
Any -- and secondly, how you recognize some benefit on third quarter from frequency
cover? Do you anticipate an impact on your reinsurance and retro buying next year? It's
quite a complex question.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah, you're right. I mean, the -- we hit the priority limit which is 125 with a storm Bernd. So
we booked a recovery from reinsurance for this particular event. Regarding the impact in
our next year cost of protection, probably we can see an increase, but in any case, I
mean, if we get an increase for our retroceded business, I mean, we will pass it to our
ceding entities as well. So --

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

It's normal with a hardening of the reinsurance market that we will be able to pass these
kind of --

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

In the end, it will be neutral.

And one -- just one comment on the EUR125 million and EUR92 million is the net retention
of the same claim.

FINAL

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

That's correct. EUR92 million effect is without taxes and minorities. So in the end it is the
net effect of the gross EUR125 million.

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay. Another one coming from JB Capital, Maksym, asking on how should we see
premiums of MAPFRE RE evolving in 2022 after -- I mean, I say that after this excellent
increase during 2021?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

But at this moment, I mean we are at an early stage in order to give you more color
regarding 2022. But we should expect, let's say, a moderate increase. Renewals for midyear, they were pretty good in terms of rates, and we should expect a similar scenario, I
mean, for next year.

Okay. Ivan from Barclays is asking another question related with Bankia. Was the EUR204.4
million one-off from the inclusion of Bankia second quarter and third quarter -- result in the
third quarter included in the Life business results during these quarters?
Okay. I'm trying to explain this. The way we -- as Fernando said, we made an adjustment
on the third quarter on the result of Bankia because of the change in the accounting way
that we were recognizing these results. So there is a full disclosure of the figures in the
financial report. There is -- I think in Page 22. So that says that the EUR20.4 million figures
is after tax and minorities considered our 51% stake. So you need to gross it up and to
add the minorities in order to make the total figures. Throughout the entire year, the
result of the Life business included 100% of the result of these entities. So if you look at
the total profit and loss account on the balance sheet, you see 100% of this entity with
before taxes and minorities. So this is only on the -- it was only on the last -- on the last
line that you will see the adjustment.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah, Felipe. I may add something regarding this, I mean, just to put say some clarity or
additional clarity to the situation. I mean, we booked following the accounting policy that
we were told to. And before presenting results as of June, I mean, we called regulators
and we presented, I mean, the -- basically the shareholder agreement with Bankia. And
also, we concluded that the -- the attributable result for the -- 51% shareholding of Mapfre
should be fully allocated to Caixa. But then due to the length of the process and also
because the members of the Board represent in Mapfre at the Board didn't step down.
And so, we held the majority of vote at the board. It was raised that we should book again
and reflect in attributable results, the 51% shareholding of Mapfre as a profit contribution.

So both -- and also with the agreement of the external auditors. And we again back to the
regulators to say that we should change the profit contribution from Bankia at the end of
third quarter and they fully agreed. So, I mean the -- sorry for the confusion, but we did
what we were told to, and that was pretty clear.

FINAL

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Thank you. Thank you very much Fernando. Carlos Peixoto from CaixaBank has a question
on Spanish combined ratio. What are the expectations of the evolution of the combined
ratios in the different Spanish business lines?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well, that's -- Carlos, that's extremely difficult to answer. We should expect a lot of moving
parts as I already mentioned. The third quarter has been a transitional quarter. We should
wait for some increase in frequency particularly in auto in the coming quarter, and -- but
we should reflect as well an increase in premiums earned from the increasing rates or the
absence of discounts and rebates. And the remaining lines, I guess, we should not expect
significant changes. That's basically my view.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. Fernando. Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays. Can you
provide an update on Bankia MAPFRE Vida joint venture. Is the deal completion still
expected for 2021? I think that Fernando was quite clear during the presentation. He said
that we were expecting in November the final appraisal from the external appraiser and
that would give us to expect that everything will be completed by 2021. I don't know if
Fernando if you want to --

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

No, I mean this is the -- this is our expectation from our side. But let me tell you as well
that over the paper, probably, assuming that the paper is correct, but a similar statement
was made by Gortazar, the CEO of Caixa saying that the -- it should be expected -- this
deal completion by year-end. It should be completed, yeah.

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. It seems that we don't have any further questions.
Okay. So just one more. Carlos Peixoto from CaixaBank asks about the expectation on
NatCat losses on the fourth quarter?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well, nobody knows what is going to happen. I mean, the -- so far, the -- in the Atlantic, I
mean, it has been a quiet season from hurricanes. Earthquakes, there is still a risk in any
territory that we are operating. But since the frequency cover is -- has been already
triggered. As I said at the presentation, the net effect of any individual Cat event would
be pretty, pretty reduced.

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay. So that allows us some -- to have some kind of visibility or peace of mind related
with this kind of frequency cover that you were mentioning? There is another question.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

FINAL

Global Risk.

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Global Risks, sorry, had a good quarter with lower volatility/large losses. What should we
expect going forward?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Phil. I mean, that the -- a couple of years ago, we implemented any change
in order to lower retention in Global Risks business, and also increased the commissions.
So the current quarter and also previous quarter reflect -- are reflecting these change. So
lower impact from losses and a more stability in results. So let's say that we put a cap in
order to reduce losses and also to increase gains. But we are quite comfortable with this
reduction in exposure in Global Risks.

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank you. Today it's a quite a successful operation right now.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Absolutely.

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Farquhar from Autonomous on 2021 guidance. Does this guidance include Bankia which is
now the headline figures a little -- a little longer. And are we still only adjusting for NatCat
which would seem to imply that we are not adjusting for the COVID-related claims in
arriving to the guidance figure?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes, thank you, Farquhar. This a question raised many, many times, where we mentioned
the guidance, the first and part of the second quarter results contributed by Bankia was
included in the bank -- in the guidance. Obviously, the first quarter pertained to Mapfre.
And the second quarter, it was part of the second quarter, because at that point, I mean,
when we published the guidance, we didn't know what was the right moment when the
Board of Director representing Mapfre will step down. So we assumed that part of the
profit for the second quarter will be included in -- in the quarter.
Actually with the new accounting policy, let's say, that the -- if we assume that the second
quarter was included -- part of the second quarter was included in the guidance. The third
quarter wasn't included in the guidance. What we're doing with this new accounting

treatment is just anticipate part of the -- of the capital gain that we will book when the
transaction is completed. And because the net equity, that doesn't change. It's the same
at the transition date, which is March 31st. And the only thing we're doing is adding to this
net equity, the profit contribution from Mapfre. That's pretty simple.

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay. From Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays. Can you offer any early thoughts on IFRS-17?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah, we are working on this project with external advisors. The period has had a lot of up
and downs, and provisional figure, they're not ready yet, Ivan. But let's say, I mean, our
external advisors -- we are working with Deloitte, EY and also with SAP. And we believe
that by -- at the end of, probably after summer, I mean, we will able to give you more
color on this topic.

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Okay. Philip Ross from Mediobanca, and together with Carlos Peixoto has a similar interest
on Global Risks. I mean, we already said that it was a good contributor to the results. What
could we expect going forward? I mean, is this going to be -- provide a lot of volatility to
our results or the way of managing Global Risks is changed?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

No, we should be a more normalized and stabilization in low ratio. We reduced our risk
appetite. We reduced retention as well, increased commissions as we mentioned. So let's
say that we are limiting losses and also gains in order to have a narrower variation for
profit. So in the end, I guess, that there will be quite similar trend in the future. And also,
we didn't renew some large policies that with really bad experience in the past and they
were loss making portfolios. So let's say that we should assume that the current trend for
the Global Risks will remain in the near future.

A - Felipe Navarro

{BIO 3737558 <GO>}

Thank you. Thank you very much, Fernando. It seems that there are no more questions. So
thank you very much everybody. I mean, we've been almost an hour here in this
presentation. But before we close the call and moving to -- we should move to logistics,
I'm sure that most of you have received an invitation, but next Wednesday, November
3rd, I will be hosting together with the IR team, two group meetings. First, there will be a
group in Spanish at 9:30 Central European Time, followed by another one in English at
3:00 PM also Central European Time. Both meeting should last around 40 minutes to an
hour. Please make sure that you confirms your attendance using the email invitation you
received earlier this week or get in touch with the IR team in order -- if you have any kind
of issue. You have the contact details in the presentation. Please stay safe and thank you
very much for your time.
