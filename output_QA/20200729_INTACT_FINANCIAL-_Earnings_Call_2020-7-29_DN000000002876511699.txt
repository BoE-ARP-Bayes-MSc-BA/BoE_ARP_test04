Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Ken, thanks for the introduction.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a signiﬁcant impact on society. Healthcare
professionals and essential workers have done a tremendous job on the front lines, while
governments have moved fast on many fronts.
Despite these eﬀorts, there is still uncertainty as to how long the crisis will persist. So
businesses have an important role to play here in supporting their communities, as they
cope with the economic and societal impacts. We have stepped up to support millions of
Canadians through relief, community support and being there and good in bad times.
And it's more important than ever, that we work together to get through this. We entered
the crisis in a position of strength, which has enabled us to support our customers. To
date, we've provided more than CAD350 million of relief to over a million policyholders
across North America. Our relief continues to be risk-based and needs-based and will
evolve as the situation develops.
Speaking of strength, yesterday evening we announced second quarter net operating
income of CAD2.35 per share, an increase of 63% over Q2, 2019. The team delivered
solid results, despite navigating a diﬃcult environment and accelerating investments in
our people and technology, all that while providing relief across all our customer base in
North America. Topline growth was 7% in the quarter, with 6% in Canada, and a robust
10% in the US. IFC growth in the quarter was impacted by 4 points of written premium
relief. The overall combined ratio was 89.5%, with strength on both sides of the border.
Our view of the ultimate direct cost of COVID-19 has not changed since Q1, as we've seen
no evidence to warrant the change to our prudent Q1 bottom-up, policy-by-policy
reserving to ultimate losses.
In Canada, the combined ratio of 89% was strong, driven by underlying performance,
while US commercial lines delivered a solid 93.2%. Let's now look at our results by line of
business, starting with Canada. Personal auto growth was solid at 3%, given we've
provided 7 points of relief in the quarter itself. In the next quarter, that is in Q3, we expect
the impact from premium relief to be in the low double-digit range. The combined ratio in
the quarter was strong at 84.7%, given the work we've done in the past three years, which
meaningfully impacted our mix of business, in addition to reduced driving during the
quarter.

FINAL

The beneﬁt from reduced driving was partially oﬀset by a portion of premium relief that
was earned during the quarter. Looking to the coming quarters, the remaining relief will
roll through net earned premium, while we expect driving activity to gradually return to
normal. From an underwriting standpoint, since the start of COVID, we largely expect
relief and driving activity to oﬀset each other over time. Overall, the fundamentals in
personal auto are strong.
In personal property, premiums grew a strong 11%, driven by favorable market conditions,
the GCNA acquisition and unit growth. The combined ratio of 88.6% was the best Q2 in
over a decade, driven by our proﬁtability actions over time and mild weather conditions.
Personal property continues to be a solid contributor to our strong underwriting
performance overall and I'm conﬁdent this will continue.

Bloomberg Transcript

In commercial lines, premium growth of 7% reﬂects the GCNA acquisition and was
tempered by the economic slowdown and our multiple relief measures. The combined
ratio of 95.1% reﬂected strong underlying performance, oﬀset by lower prior year
development. The underlying loss ratio improved 5.5 points year-over-year. We're already
seeing pricing momentum return, and I expect us to operate this business close to 90%
going forward. Moving to our US commercial segment, premiums grew a strong 10%, with
robust organic growth across most lines. The underlying loss ratio improved 4.8 points,
driven by our ongoing proﬁtability improvement game plan. The combined ratio of 93.2%
was strong, as this segment continues to trend towards our sustainable low 90s objective.
Let's turn to the industry outlook. The prevailing hard market conditions we experienced
in Canada in 2019 and into early 2020 has been impacted by the crisis. Rate increases in
both personal and commercial lines were tampered to help our customers navigate what
is a very diﬃcult economic environment. In the coming months as activity moves back
towards normal, we expect the industry to return to the corrective measures required to
restore its ROE to historical levels.
In the near term, the trends that have emerged in the past few months will likely
exacerbate the industry's need for rates given lower reinvestment yields, economic
impact and potential loss exposure likely to arise from the crisis. In the U.S., we see similar
trends supporting the hardening market conditions. And looking at the rest of 2020 for
IFC, the crisis is expected to impact top-line growth in the mid-single to low double-digit
range. Given the strength of our operations entering the crisis. I expect our underwriting
performance for the rest of 2020 to be on track.
While managing the crisis and providing relief has been all-consuming in the past few
months, we haven't lost a beat on the strategic front. The teams across North America
delivered and accelerated initiatives to ensure that we expand our leadership position. As
you know, our roadmap for the next decade is rooted on expanding our leadership here
in Canada, building the best specialty insurer in North America, transforming our
competitive advantages and ensuring that our people win in this changing world. And
while progress in the near-term is important, the key question for us now is how will the
future be permanently altered as a result of COVID-19.

FINAL

So for consumers, our view is that value for money, ease of access and strong digital
engagement will become even more important. Our breadth of products, brands and
distribution channels provide optionality for us to emphasize these changing
expectations. We've made great leaps on the digital and AI front in the past few years and
these have accelerated in the past few months. Our intent is to double down on our
digital edge.
For businesses, we believe that there will be an increasing diﬀerentiation between small
and mid-sized businesses. So, we intend to build our leadership with more than one-infour small businesses in Canada to simplify and make it easier for them to access our
products. For mid-sized businesses, we intend to better diﬀerentiate our oﬀer and
broaden the range of services to those. Our rapid expansion in specialty lines, and the
acquisition of GCNA and Frank Cowan give us the perfect platform to win for these
businesses across North America. Finally, this crisis will exacerbate the income and skill
disparity that exists in society while we're stepping up our eﬀorts in the communities
where we operate to be an agent of change and a force for good. And we're also
ensuring that our people across North America will adapt and gain from this changing
world. We're committed to investing in adapting our people skills to our needs of
tomorrow and we're also committed to continue to ensure that our environment is one of
the most inclusive.
So, we intend to integrate these trends and initiatives with our 10 year strategic roadmap
in the coming months. Our aim is to position ourselves to excel in a post-COVID
environment, and come out of this crisis stronger and even more resilient. So in
conclusion, this quarter was a testament to our business' trend. We ended the quarter
with a robust capital margin ready to absorb severe shocks. And invest in strategic
unfortunate fees. Our operating ROE has moved into the right zone and our book value is
up 8% year-over-year in a turbulent environment. Our business is very resilient and we're
well-positioned to continue to beat our ﬁnancial objectives in the quarters and years
ahead. I would now turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Marcotte.

Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles, and good morning, everyone. Net operating income per share was
$2.35, up 63% versus last year, driven by strong underwriting performances across North
America. Before turning to our Q2 operating results, let me share a few points related to
the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to impact communities in our markets and
around the globe. We have provided signiﬁcant relief totaling more than $350 million to
our customers. Included in this amount is $263 million of premium reductions of which
$134 million was written in the quarter, impacting our top-line by four points. Although
these measures are meant to compensate customers for the lower driving activity
observed in Q2, the top-line impact will continue to be felt in future quarters as the relief
is earned.
In terms of COVID related losses, we have not changed our best estimate of $83 million
booked in Q1. However, we took a prudent approach on bad debt due to the economic
uncertainty and recorded a $34 million provision in Q2 2020, most of it in Canada. This
represents approximately a 1.4 point impact to the expense ratio across our three lines of

FINAL

businesses in Canada. Overall, we expect the crisis to impact the top-line in the midsingle to low double-digit range for the rest of 2020. From an underwriting perspective
the impact of the crisis is expected to be neutral for the rest of the year, although it may
vary by quarter and by line of business.
Now turning to our operating results. Net investment income of $141 million was down 5%
compared to last year. This was mainly due to lower reinvestment yields and lower
dividend income, partially oﬀset by higher invested assets from the GCNA acquisition.
Assuming the U.S. dollar and interest rates stay where they are, we continue to expect
investment income in 2020 to grow between 1% and 3% compared to 2019. Distribution
EBITDA and other income grew 8% to $78 million in the quarter, driven by both
acquisitions and organic growth. Although there remains uncertainty surrounding the
length and severity of the crisis, we expect the growth of these earnings for the full year to
be in the high-single to low double-digit range.
Now let me provide some additional detail on the underwriting results, beginning with
Canada. In personal auto, proﬁtability was solid in the second quarter at 84.7%. The
underlying current year loss ratio improved 13 points, driven by a combination of lower
driving activity, better weather conditions and our ongoing proﬁtability actions, all of
which were partially oﬀset by higher severity and relief. Prior year development was
muted in the quarter and although Q2 is typically a seasonally favorable quarter, CAT
losses were three points above historical averages due to severe weather events in
Alberta. In personal property. The combined ratio improved 11 points, driven by our
proﬁtability actions better weather and fewer ﬁre losses. On the other hand, the expense
ratio increased 2.4 points, driven by a bad debt provision and higher variable
commissions due to our strong underwriting performance. Overall, personal property
continues to deliver a strong performance.
In our Canadian commercial lines, we saw a premium growth of 11% in Q2 if we exclude
the impact of premium relief. The combined ratio of 95.1% reﬂected a solid improvement
of 5.5 points in the underlying performance which was oﬀset by elevated CAT losses
lower favorable prior year development and higher expenses. Overall, the Canadian
expense ratio of 32.2% for the quarter increased 3.7 points from last year, mainly driven by
an increase in the provision for bad debts as mentioned earlier and higher commissions.
Turning to U.S. commercial, growth was 10% in constant currency with strong organic
growth in most lines of business as rate momentum and unit growth continues. The
underlying loss ratio of 53% in the quarter improved 4.8 points which was largely driven
by the impact of our proﬁtability actions. The CAT loss ratio in the U.S. of 1.7% in the
quarter was entirely weather-related with no COVID losses recorded in the quarter. The
increase in the U.S. expense ratio to 39.4% is consistent with our expectations, and is
mainly due to the addition of GCNA's surety business. All in, I'm pleased with the
performance in the US. On the consolidated basis level, there is no doubt our business
has delivered solid operating results and led to an operating ROE of 15.6%, 300 basis
points above that reported in the 2019 calendar year.
Now looking at our balance sheet, we ended the quarter in a strong ﬁnancial position with
a total capital margin of $1.7 billion and a debt-to-total capital ratio at 22.1%. We remain on

track to reach our 20% target over the next 12 to 18 months. We also have $300 million of
cash at the holding company and our $750 million credit facility is entirely undrawn. Our
book value per share increased 4% since March 31 to $53.95. Thanks to solid earnings and
favorable capital markets, but oﬀset by losses related to our pension plans. Overall, we've
maintained a strong balance sheet throughout the crisis and I am conﬁdent it's going to
severe shocks or help us capture growth opportunities that may arise in these turbulent
times.
In closing, I would like to thank our teams across North America for stepping up for
customers, suppliers and shareholders as we navigate through uncharted territory. They
have shown an extreme agility and ﬂexibility to maintain our operations in top shape and
deliver solid results. Finally, with our resilient operations, talented teams and strong
capital position, we continue to be able to support our customers throughout this crisis.
With strong fundamentals across our business on both sides of the border, we are
conﬁdent that our underwriting performance will be on track for the remainder of 2020.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Ken.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions)
Our ﬁrst question this morning comes from Geoﬀ Kwan from RBC Capital Markets. Please
go ahead.

Q - Geoﬀ Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. I know you talked about not changing your claims provisions relating
to COVID-19. But can you talk about how many business interruption claims you've
received so far and what the aggregate dollar amount that's being claimed?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Geoﬀ, good morning. Good morning, Geoﬀ. I'll ask Patrick to take this one and if there is
anything to add, Darren can chip in as well. But Patrick, why don't you run with that?

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yes. So, maybe ﬁrst of all on business interruption claims. Firstly, our view has not
changed on this during Q2, following our discussions we had at the end of Q1. I'd like to
remind that the language in our policies is very clear. The business interruption coverage

Page 6 of 25



FINAL

Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2020-07-29

requires direct physical damage from an insured peril to be triggered. This is the case for
99.5% of our policies in commercial lines. There is only in very exceptional circumstances
that we have provided limited business interruption coverage that can be triggered by
pandemic. For the most part, by the way, all claims related to these limited exceptions
that's been received and settled, so paid and closed as we speak. So not a lot of
remaining uncertainty around that, I should say. But as expected, some groups have
insured and law ﬁrms have initiated litigation in Canada and other and in other
jurisdictions as well in an attempt to challenge this interpretation, but we continue to be
very conﬁdent with our defense arguments and various levels of defense we have.
One of the main developments during Q2 is that a few decisions actually have started to
be rendered on BI litigations. It is the case as an example of two federal court decisions in
the States, one in Michigan and one in New York that are relating to wordings almost
identical to ours. Both of those decisions have conﬁrmed that one, physical damage to
the property is necessary to trigger BI coverage and; two, that depend to make itself or a
government-mandated closure of businesses cannot be considered as physical damage
to the premises. So here in Canada, none of these class actions, motions have been
certiﬁed yet, but we are actively preparing our defense and I'm very conﬁdent with our
position.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, we have received a number of individual businesses that have ﬁled for business
interruptions and we have explained individually to each of them our position of coverage
and why coverage would not apply. I don't have the exact number, but yes, we have seen
a bit of that. So overall on BI I'm very conﬁdent in our numbers, and that's why we haven't
changed the CAD83 million overall.

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yes, and I think the other thing that's important here is that the CAD83 million of reserve
was not just BI, in fact, you've got liability, entertainment-type claims and I would say,
Geoﬀ, we've done such a rigorous analysis in Q1, doing a bottom-up policy-by-policy
assessment of what might be a COVID direct-related claims, that things are-- what we've
seen in terms of activity has led us to not change our view of the ultimate at this stage.
You know, maybe Patrick can provide color, ballpark. Out of the provision, we put what-how much actual case incurred have we seen. By case-incurred, we mean ﬁle-by-ﬁle that
have actually been received. So, just ballpark for the Group, Patrick.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yes, it's roughly, if I combine both Canada and US, we're talking about just under CAD30
million so far, and on all the reported claims directly linked to COVID at the moment, 80%
of them are already paid inﬂows within that CAD30 million.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So we've got a decent visibility, I think, three, four months in the case-incurred gives us a
sense that our ultimate assessment is very good. And we're ready for more, clearly, with a
provision at CAD83 million. So that's where we stand. Darren, I don't know if there is
anything else you can add here.

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

FINAL

I think the other thing, as you said, Charles, that the activity we've seen to date is very
much consistent with that bottom up exercise, there's no real surprises of misses from
coverage or anything else like that. So it's very consistent. So that, for me, it gives us more
comfort around our CAD83 million ultimate view.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. And maybe just to add a bit of color to Patrick's point on US decisions. We've talked
in the previous quarter that our language was also very well supported by common law
here in Canada and previous court decisions here in Canada, and the decisions we've
seen in the US would be consistent with the common law we've seen here, as well. But,
Geoﬀ, did I hear you or--?

Q - Geoﬀ Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Yes, if I can just clarify, because when Patrick talked about the US decisions and the way it
was kind of described, because in the US, I think you have talked about, it's quite explicit
around pandemic not covered. But I just want to-- it sounds like what you were saying-sort of what he was saying was the US Court decisions were relating to policy that had
similar wording to what you have in Canada, and hopefully there is something -- is that
correct?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. The debate here, like the virus exclusion is the second -- third line of defense, the real
debate in BI is direct physical damage, and our language on that front compares-- is very
comparable to the language in the US, and that's where the beat is in courts. It's not as to
whether you have an exclusion or not. And, in that regard, we're seeing the court
decisions are very clear, they are in line with what we expect. They are in line with the
common law in Canada, it's not great, it's kind of pretty straightforward, and I think the
courts hear [ph] in that direction.

A - Ken Anderson

{BIO 16846692 <GO>}

Actually, I would even add, in the Michigan decision, the judge actually limited his
decision to the ﬁrst line of defense commenting on the physical damage, and stated that
didn't have to even consider the other line because it's what's clear and his view that
physical damage was required.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. And Geoﬀ, as you know, in Canada, we have other lines of defense in the product, as
well. We've got two additional lines of defense. And so, all in, sitting here today, we feel
even more conﬁdent than we did at the end of Q1. And we were very conﬁdent at the end
of Q1 about the clarity of our product and, you know, that's it.

Q - Geoﬀ Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay.

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thanks for your question, Geoﬀ.

FINAL

Q - Geoﬀ Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay. I'm sorry, my second question is just on the bad debt expense. Are you able to
provide some clarity? I know you mentioned it was mostly in Canada, but just
whereabouts, which lines of businesses or any sort of color around that and how that
might play out in upcoming quarters? In other words, is it more of a one-oﬀ or might just
linger a little bit, albeit a smaller amount?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, I'll ask Louis to give you his perspective, our thought processes to front load our
assessment of ultimate as much as possible, the same way we've done for the Q1 reserve,
but we-- go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Ken Anderson

{BIO 16846692 <GO>}

Sure. So essentially, it's been spread over premiums and this is where I shared about 1.4
points of impact for each line of business in the Canadian market space, which is where
most of the provision was made for. So you can spread it accordingly. And then, from a-how it's going to pan out here, our view is to take a strong stance in Q2. Knowing that
there is a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace right now, we've given a lot of relief to our
customers to facilitate their ability to pay for the coverage. But as the government
released unwinds, people have to pay, the delays are expiring. We're expecting some
headwind there. So we've tried to provide as much as we could for that in Q2, and our
hope here is that we're not going to use as much as we've provided for in future quarters,
but at this point, that's our best view of where the cost could be overall, based on what
we're seeing in terms of our data and our intelligence in the relationship with the
customers.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think, Geoﬀ, one data point that I was impressed with is the fact that, when people ask
for help, it's because they need it and 80% of the people that have asked for payment
deferrals paid the second payment, and so, only 20% of people that have asked for help
have delayed more than one payment and obviously, the bad debt provision, even
though we've given a lot of ﬁnancing relief, the bad debt provision is aimed at those that
have deferred payment three, four, ﬁve times. But the vast majority of people take this
very seriously and have stepped up to stay on track in terms of paying their insurance.

A - Ken Anderson

{BIO 16846692 <GO>}

And so, to be very clear, we took a bit the same approach as we did in Q1 for the loss
provisions. We have been prudent here and the expectation is-- this is what could be
needed. And we don't expect that need to add more unless something really bad would
happen, that we think we're good to hear.

FINAL

Our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes, thanks. A couple of questions here, ﬁrst one related to personal auto insurance. One,
Charles, could you talk a little bit about what are we seeing right now, trend in what's
going on with miles driven in Canada in frequency and are there any oﬀsets on severity?
And then I'll follow up

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. Brian, I think that's the key question, we've seen starting in the second half of April a
gradual increase in driving and, from a severity point of view, you've got a couple of
things happening. One is, and this always happens when your mix of claims shifts
because your frequency drops, the nature of claims changes, and this has an impact on
severity. And then, there was the very peak to start with. I'll ask Isabelle to give her
perspective on what she is observing and where we think we stand now.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Isabelle Girard

{BIO 21256467 <GO>}

Sure. So in terms of change in miles driven, we've been using our telematics tools or UBI
data to follow on a regular basis. How much of the kilometer driven were done by our
customers, as well as the number of trips. So that was a tool we used during the crisis to
monitor how things were evolving. So, what we saw is that for sure a big drop in driving at
the peak of the crisis early April, but since then we see that both the kilometres driven and
the number of trips are increasing gradually since that moment over time. So I would say,
at this time, we still see that it's below the same level at the same period of time last year.
So we're not fully back to what we would say no more driving. But clearly, this has been
increasing since the mid-April.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So it's like, every week gets taking up again year-over-year. You're in the teens in terms of
diﬀerence, Brian, and then, of course, the severity will adopt accordingly. Do you have any
comments on severity you want to make, Isabelle, or are we good?

A - Isabelle Girard

{BIO 21256467 <GO>}

Yes. Maybe on severity piece, as Charles mentioned. We see a change in severity due to
the change of mix in claims we received during the crisis while the frequency was lower
and this is mainly due because we see less of the small accidents, since there is no urban
traﬃc or less traﬃc the city. So in that period of time, we are seeing less of those small
accidents. So that's why --

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you.

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And so, Brian, in practice when you run with that, then you ask yourself, okay, so severity
looks diﬀerent. The way we've looked at results is also tried to anticipate and be cautious
with the body [ph] injury type impact and so, we made sure that we took a cautious stance
in the quarter.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you, makes sense. And then as a follow-up to that, I guess, given what's going on
right now, Charles, what makes you conﬁdent that we're going to see a return to aﬃrming
a hard market in personal auto when we get through this crisis? And do you anticipate
any regulatory push back or making it harder to get that type of a rate?

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, I think that-- this is a ﬂuid environment. It is changing every week and we will adapt
our not only relief measures, but our pricing actions based on what we're seeing in the
environment to make sure that our performance remains on track. I think that we've been
working with governments to address the root cause of the product, Brian, where -- was
inﬂation coming into this, there is inﬂation coming out of this and root cause of issues in
automobile insurance Ontario being a good example, Alberta as well, still need to be
addressed. And we'll work with elected oﬃcials and regulators to make sure that we start
turning our attention to reforms.
I think that, look, if there is permanently less driving and less accidents in the system, rates
will reﬂect that over time, from my point of view. But to the extent that the root cause of
the product is not solved and the fact that the industry's combined ratio is north of 100%
in auto, coming in the crisis, I don't see why rate corrections should not continue. Now,
there is less driving, the rate correction need will not be as big. What matters to us is we
keep operating the business within the box we've given ourselves from a proﬁtability
point of view in automobile insurance and give as much relief as we can, when driving in
frequency is out of the norm.

FINAL

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Continuing with the theme of personal auto, I want to ask a question on written insured
risks. Now, if I go back pre-COVID, I would have expected Intact to start gaining some
market share this year in terms of volumes. And I think you kind of guided to that
expectation, as well. Now, if I look at written insured risk trend, it's roughly ﬂat year-overyear. I'm just trying to think how should we view that? Is that just because COVID is
resulted in less vehicles being insured at the industry level or is it-- you've kind of pulled
back on your marketing eﬀorts in order to gain market share because of the COVID
disruption. Just wondering how you're thinking about that?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, I think, Paul, just go out of memory here and look at the policies in force in personal
automobile. In Q1 2019, when we were deep into the correction, our policies enforced
dropped 4.6%. I think you-- let's take this six months later as the market started to change,
fall season force, then shrunk by two but half the rate at which they were shrinking coming
in to 2019. Starting 2020, fall season force were up 2.2% and in Q2, up 2.6% this year. So
for me, I see the trajectory that I'm looking for in terms of our portfolio. The written risk
R&D still ﬂat, but quite diﬀerent from where they were 12 months ago where we were
shrinking the business by 5%. I think that the industry was meaningfully behind us, from a
rate point of view.
And as such, there is a time lag here, but the trajectory is there. We remain cautious in
automobile insurance. We've been through what I would describe as three years of
serious pain and we don't want to be back in that zone. We want to ﬁrmly operate the
business in the mid-90s at worse, and we're taking all actions we can, but I like the
trajectory that we're seeing.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Great, I hear you on that. And second question is related to investment in mix. So your net
exposure to equities, have come down since the start of the year and obviously, there is
some market -- mark-to-market factors behind that. But wondering, in any way, has your
long-term thinking towards asset mix changed at all?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Let me ask Louis to take a shot of your question and then I'll conclude at the end. Go
ahead, Louis.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles. Paul, we have, as you saw, as you noted, diminished the asset mix in
terms of the equities. For sure, largely driven by the impact of the markets. We have
chosen not to go back to our previous asset mix on purpose. I think we are a bit cautious
here on the risk taking on the equity front, and we took some actions in Q1, that panned

Page 12 of 25

out well with a strong balance sheet, same position in Q2. And I think we're being
cautious here before rebalancing our mix to what it was in the past.

FINAL

Now, my sense is the long-term view has not changed. At some point, we will migrate
back towards that mix. But in the short term, there is a bit of a preference to -- for caution.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, Paul, I would say that -- ﬁrst point I'd make is the team under (inaudible) in Montreal
have done an outstanding job navigating the environment. We don't sign the market, we
have a long-term total after-tax return strategy, which is optimized against our portfolio,
but the guideline I gave these guys late February is we want to play oﬀense and defense
in this environment. So not only do we need to absorb severe shock, but in relative terms,
we want, as an organization to be in a position to use our balance sheet to grow the
business.
And I think when you throw this sort of strategic direction in the mix, that's why we've -we are in a position now probably, one of the most conservative position compared to the
policy for a long period of time, and it's with an objective of being able to play defense
and oﬀense.

Hey, Jaeme. Good morning, Jaeme.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Good morning. I was actually hoping you could talk about the U.S. business and some of
the developments that are going on there in terms of pricing around certain products and
performance of certain products. Are you looking to tweak up or down any of the other
lines that you're in or potentially looking at some new lines, given what's going on in the
market in the U.S.?

A - Charles Brindamour

are doing in this environment and the competitors we need to watch. And I'll say I'm
thrilled with how things are going. The lines of business, as you know, I would put them in
two buckets. I would say you've got the lines of business that are doing very well and
you've got the lines of business who are in segments that have been tough, and we call
that our proﬁtability improvement lines.
I mean, the bulk of the business that is not in proﬁtability improvement, at the moment is
running in the 80s. And these lines of business are growing at about 16% in the quarter.
The line of -- the lines of business where we're doing correction, that are heavily on the
liability front, we've seen tremendous improvement compared to last year in those
segments. They are not yet at the level of proﬁtability we're looking forward to grow those
and that's why when I look at these lines, we're, from a growth point of view, shrinking
those by 20%.
So, Jaeme, I'll say high level, the strategy we put on the table in 2017 to grow the best
performing lines and words on the lines that we believe in, but that are not yet at the right
stage is very much still what is -- what's happening now. Conditions are ﬁrm or hard in the
U.S., and I'd say we're open for business. We're seeing good progress across all the lines
that are proﬁtable.

Bloomberg Transcript

And as I said, I mean, these lines are growing at 16% at the moment. We have a very good
footprint, we're keen to build on that footprint. We're also, I think making progress on
expanding within those lines, our distribution footprint. And I'm quite pleased with what
I'm seeing south of the border at this stage.

Our next question comes from Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Charles, in your comments, you talked about the
digital NAI emphasis. And I guess a couple of questions around that. One is, where does - what parts of your business are you talking about there that you'll be more digitally
focused? And then secondly, you said double down the digital edge. Does that mean any
kind of near-term investments, and maybe a little bit of headwind on the expenses that we
should expect?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Page 14 of 25



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

FINAL

Yes. So you've captured my words very well. So NAI, 75% of our eﬀorts which have not
slowed down one bit are directed to predictive analytics through machine learning in
pricing and segmentation. Digital, more broadly, is in all our channels. So our thought
process there is to make sure that the digital value proposition compares with the best
insurers in the world. And that's very much the tools we have, and and then that we use
digital in claims meaningfully.
And so I'll ask Patrick in claims for instance. So it's very much customer experience driven.
I'll ask Patrick to give you a sense of the progress we've made in claims in the last three
months on the digital front. Patrick?

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yes. So we had started to develop quite a few tools in claims even in the last year or so. I
would say some of the tools, were there what this situation of COVID allowed us is, we've
seen a very sharp increase in the take-up rates. So what this does is it help us learn much
faster and improve those solutions much faster than in a slower progression of
penetration.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of more speciﬁcally the tools we've been using, we -- there are possibilities for
our clients to ﬁle their claim online, track the progress. There is a lot of automated
notiﬁcations that allow clients to keep track of -- what are the next steps in their claim, et
cetera.
But given the pandemic, we've also leveraged videos and pictures that are taken from
clients to be able to do a lot -- a big portion of the assessment of the losses from distance.
And we've seen that that has started to accelerate in many cases, the cycle time and the
quality of service.
So to give you a perspective today over Q2, it's more than 60% of all the auto claims that
we were able to estimate completely the damage from remote based on pictures taken
from clients. And that number was in the teens entering the crisis. So a big progression,
that allows us to then accelerate also the next steps to oﬀer to clients a more straight
through processing and accelerate that process.
From a residential perspective and other example with on-site, we conﬁrm coverage
based on videos that are taken by clients and on-site staﬀ from remote, and instead of
taking us two, three days in average to be able to conﬁrm to the clients that coverage, we
need to do that within three to four business hours. Just a few examples of developments.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, so massive jumps in Q3. Now the last part of your question, Mike, was accelerating
investment and expense drag and I'll ask Louis, who has done a really good job with his
team to basically look at the pandemic, assess the additional cost that came from the
pandemic and ﬁgure out two things, how we could absorb those costs to make sure our
performance remain on track and how we can take advantage of an excess supply in the
system to accelerate some of our investments in technology without creating a drag to
Page 15 of 25



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2020-07-29

keep expenses on track. So, Louis, why don't you talk about the exercise we've done in
March on that so that Mike understands there will not be a drag here.

FINAL

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Sure. Thanks, Charles. So in March, we -- as soon as this crisis started, we undertook a
process to identify what kind of headwinds we would face in terms of costs, and
potentially, the savings we would harvest from the crisis as well. And it became fairly clear
that, in fact, the savings would basically oﬀset the cost so we could manage through the
crisis without drag at that point.
We also took on a project to actually take people that were perhaps underused in some
sectors. We saw clearly that phone calls were not coming in the same volumes as usual.
It's about 1,000 people that we actually redeployed in multiple areas of the business
where we saw more needs. And you won't be surprised that portion of those people will
have been re-aﬀected to the AR function, for example, for collections.

Bloomberg Transcript

But we took a number of people as well to support the digital engagement processes,
and we took a further number of people to accelerate our digital initiatives and our
developments. And so the view here was to take advantage of the resources that are
suddenly a bit less occupied, redeploy them in the right areas and accelerate some of the
developments we were already working on. We went further than that, tried to harvest
further savings from the pandemic throughout the year, and those savings, essentially, are
being reinvested in acceleration of our technology investments, so we've shifted some of
that money from the savings into the investment investment pool, if you want. And with a
view that overall, it would not have a signiﬁcant impact on the expense ratio,.
It might not be totally true on a quarterly basis, but our overall view for the year, in fact, is
that we come out in neutral on expenses even after taking into account the bad debt. So
that's how we undertook this and the view is, here the very limited drag on expense ratio
with accelerated development of technology.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Good morning. Charles and Louis, both of you in Q1 cautioned us that results could be
lumpy quarter -- on a quarterly basis throughout 2020. Would you say this quarter was
lumpy to the positive, and if so, what were some of the reasons why that played out?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Louis, do you want to -- you want to take a crack at this?

FINAL

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Sure. So the lumpiness I think here comes from the mismatch between when the relief
measures are given and when they actually get earned. And then going against that
would be the frequency, for example, impact and elements like bad debts.
So as much as most of the impact from the activity reduction were -- seem to be
happening in Q2, we knew that the relief measures we were putting in, and because our
risk based were adapted to customers, they weren't all going to roll out in the same
quarter as the beneﬁt would come out. And so we knew we'd see diﬀerent results per
quarter and we're trying to give as much clarity as we can in terms of how they will impact
future quarters.
But dealing with a lot of uncertainty where it would land, we feel comfortable saying it's
going to be on track, overall, but quarterly, it might evolve a bit diﬀerently. And that's why
we took that stance.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think it would be fair to say that we're -- it was positive in Q2 and then for the rest of the
year, we're suggesting on track, it could evolve Q2 -- Q3 -- between Q3 and Q4, not
being necessarily even, but come back to be on track for the rest of the year.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. I would say, Mario, I don't expect negative lumpiness to the bottom line for the rest
of the year. I think Q2 was the clean strong quarter with very strong fundamentals across
the business. I think personal auto might have a mild positive there, but then commercial
lines at 95% in Canada, in my mind, was a negative. And so in aggregate, I think this was a
very good, very strong, very clean quarter and we'll try to keep the bottom line on track
for the rest of the year.
I think from a topline point of view, this is where you will see more lumpiness, Mario. And
when we said mid-single to low-teens with variations by quarter in line of business, we're
putting the spotlight this quarter on the fact that personal auto topline next quarter will be
impacted by roughly 10 points of written relief measure. We're conﬁdent, though, that the
bottom line throughout the year will remain on track, sort of in line with what one would
otherwise expect our performance to be for the rest of the year.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Charles, I don't want to put -- to ﬁnd a point on it. But if you're saying that that's true for
full year 2020 and the ﬁrst half was I think better than what you might have expected,
because of the phenomenon that played out. Doesn't that necessarily mean that the
second half has to be -- actually have to show some negative lumpiness, if you will?

FINAL

Yes, I don't really see that, Mario. I think that we're using words like on track and the range
we're providing from a top-line point of view, admittedly is wide. But you'll, like me, admit
that we are in a bifurcated environment. When we model a good, a bad and an ugly
scenario, we think that we've got the lever to make sure that the underwriting
performance remains within a fairly narrow range. You and I had talked about that in our
ﬁreside chat in early April. My view is still the same.
The ﬁrst part of the year beneﬁted a bit from weather, admittedly and Q1 was one of these
elements. And whether is one time and making the average between the ﬁrst half and the
second half here is not how I would look at this, and so when we see on track for the
remaining of the year, that's pretty much what we mean.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Okay, I follow you. One -- my second and ﬁnal question relates to, Charles, you refer $30
million in response to Geoﬀ's question. It was one of the ﬁrst questions on the call. And I
thought you were referring then to COVID-19 related claims, but in the MD&A, I thought
you said there were no COVID-19 related claims. Maybe I just misunderstood.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, I think one of us misunderstood. But the $83 million Q1 provision that we have put up
would be direct COVID-19 related provision, okay? So you look at all your portfolio and
you say what claims can arise because of COVID-19? And so we came up with $83 million.
In the quarter, our ultimate view of the direct COVID-19 losses is still the $83 million. The
point I made, and I gave a ballpark $30 million as the case incurred, that is the actual
claims we've received. The $83 million was a bottom-up assessment of what could
happen, and the $30-ish million is actually what has happened so far, and obviously, it's
early in the process.
So, maybe somebody can add here.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Chuck, I agree with you, I think maybe to further illustrate, Mario, the -- when we started at
the end of Q1 this analysis, all of it was in reserves. Now as the claims come in and we sell
them, obviously we reduced the reserve because we pay those claims, so that $30 million
is the actual incurred, but the sum of the ultimate cost, say, that $83 million, so there is no
impact in Q2.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

I see. So you haven't actually paid the $30 million, that's just what's been incurred so far?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Well, a good portion of it is paid, so that's paid and case reserves of ﬁle by ﬁle reserves,
and then the total reserves, including what's expected that could be reported later is still

Page 18 of 25



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2020-07-29

the same $83 million, so during the quarter, there was no impact. It was just to give a feel
of the actual activity we see in the claims.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

FINAL

My confusion is if you paid some of those reserves, why wouldn't -- so if you paid some of
those COVID claims, why wouldn't you have released the reserves?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

We did.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, I think, Mario, if you think about it, you break it into three buckets here. You have
paid losses that are closed or partial payments that you make, then you have the actual
claims that came in for which we've set up case reserve. Let's say the ballpark sum of
those two things is $30 million, the rest is IBNR. It's what we might receive in time for
claims that have been incurred, but not reported to us just yet.
The ultimate is $83 million. Now, when you get a claim, you had set up a case reserve
which upsets your payment, but overall, the ultimate is very much still in the ballpark that
we have put out there.

Q - Mario Mendonca

Our next question comes from Tom MacKinnon from BMO Capital. Please, go ahead.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yes, thanks very much. You continue to say that the impact of COVID-19 in terms of DPW
growth is going to be in the mid-single digit to low digital -- the low double-digit range
for 2020. And I mean, that's consistent with the guidance that you provided in the ﬁrst
quarter as well. I mean, pretty well consistent with what you said almost going back to
early April.
My question though is on Page 5 in the MD&A, particularly with respect to personal lines.
When we look at the impact of premium reductions, in terms of what was written in the
second quarter or year-to-date in the second quarter, and then there is another column to
say "to date provided," and that's with policy issue. And one number of 96 in terms of the
written and then provided for personal lines of 198.
Now, I thought premium relief measures that you were putting in place just occur which
you announced in early April where people can call and say, I'm not driving as much and
so I get a 15% discount for three months, or my car is parked for a long time and I get a
Page 19 of 25



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

Date: 2020-07-29

FINAL

75% discount. And I thought a lot of those things were all to remain [ph] around June 30.
So I would have assumed there wouldn't have been as much diﬀerence between what's
been written and what's been -- in --between what's been written year-to-date in terms of
the 96, and then the other column, to date provided in terms of policy issues of 198. So
I'm trying to ﬁgure out what is the diﬀerence there. Are you giving some other -- are you
tempering rate increases at renewal for various personal auto policies? Is that why there's
that diﬀerence? Maybe you can help us understand that.

A - Charles Brindamour

Yes, there is a couple of things. So, ﬁrst, the mechanics of the program, which by the way,
we've increased to July 30. So if you haven't called us, you still have one way to do it. So,
we gave -- we gave -- we came out early with this like, before any other relief measures
were announced in the industry. We were out with the risk based, needs-based program
that basically said look call us until June or now July and we'll give you a break for three
months. That break turned out to be an average discount of 22-ish percent. Now we've
given those right up to tomorrow and of course when you give that you've got three
months forward of this impact right; so that is why the return on these measures will
impact other quarters as well. Then on top of that we've mitigated rate increases in the
system as well to make sure that there were no extreme dislocations or not too large
dislocations in a period like this one. Isabelle, this is your domain so I'll let you add to
what I had said and then maybe correct what I've said if you feel that there is something
that was up the market.

A - Isabelle Girard

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

{BIO 21256467 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles. No, I think it's totally right and you're right Tom, in your assessment that
with the tempering of rate increases since we are issuing our policies in advance, so some
of those policies have been issued to date, but will impact our client only in Q3 so that's
why there is a diﬀerence between the total amount issued in relief and premium relief
versus the ones that are impacting Q2.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay and then I'll take a stab at trying to get you to help quantify what you mean by
underwriting performance being on track. Would you say that it's on track in terms of
what you expected for a dollar amount of underwriting proﬁt or is it on track in terms of
what you would have expected the combined ratio?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think that we're talking about the underwriting performance as measured by
underwriting proﬁt basically, Tom, which is not too far from combined ratio quite frankly
but that's the way to think about it. I think when you look at it by line of business before
the crisis you had a good sense of what we wanted to achieve high level by line of
business and really that's what we mean when we say on track. We're saying automobile
should operate in the mid-90s. We're saying commercial lines should be in the low 90s.
We're saying personal prop should be sub 95, even in bad times. And as you know, in
personal prop, weather is a big component of the numbers. So it's hard to have a number
we're seeing here, sub-95, even in good times, and the U.S., low '90s. So, that is what on

Page 20 of 25

track looks like from a combined ratio point of view, as far as we're concerned. But our
perspective is the operating and the underwriting performance really should be on track
in underwriting proﬁt terms.

Our next question comes from Steve Theriault from Eight Capital. Please go ahead.

Q - Steve Theriault

{BIO 6755287 <GO>}

Thanks very much. Just to follow up a little bit on Tom's question, I guess how deferrals
lag into earned premium. But when we consider the recovery in miles driven -- and
Isabelle gave some color on that -- do you expect that to translate into premium
reductions dropping signiﬁcantly in Q3? I know there's the two pieces. There's the
reductions in the payment ﬂexibility. But maybe a little bit of color there would be helpful.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Do you want to provide a bit of color on Q3?

A - Isabelle Girard

{BIO 21256467 <GO>}

Yes, sure. So, as we just discussed in the previous question, part of the top-line impact of
the release will happen in Q3. And so, also on the earn perspective of those relief, they
will follow progressively, the written over time. So, the diﬀerence between what they have
been provider will be earned over the coming quarter while we are still seeing driving
activity that will be returning to normal. So we need to keep in mind that those two eﬀects
will have said, but we're not be perfectly symmetric over time. But our program was built
having that in mind. So from an underwriting standpoint, since the crisis has started, we
largely expect that the relief and driving activity will oﬀset each other. But we know that
there may be some timing diﬀerence between quarters.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. And I think that the relief measures clearly were based on our expectation of what we
would see in the next three to six months. And also, based on our expectations that return
to normal would be gradual over time, and that part was more reﬂected in the rate
tempering that we've put in place and so on.

Q - Steve Theriault

{BIO 6755287 <GO>}

Okay and then just secondly, I wanted to follow up on one of the comments on digital,
and that an interesting example in terms of 60% of auto claims being appraised digitally.

So how permanent -- can you talk a bit about how permanent a shift you would either
expect to see or really want to see there and how comfortable and how should we think
about any risk of misuse?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

I think that the changes we're seeing on the digital front and the steps up that we've seen
in Q1 in our mind will be a new plateau to grow from. We're not going backward from
there. And our value prop from a digital point of view will improve over time. Because, as
I've mentioned, we've doubled down on our investment there. In terms of misuse per se,
I'll let Patrick maybe share his perspective, given how much activity has taken place in
claims. And I think misuse -- if I get you properly, more likely to be an issue in claims than
in sales or underwriting, which was to start with data driven very much so. So, Patrick, why
don't you comment on that and some of the work being done with data from the fraud
management as well?

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

That's right. So by misuse and claims, of course, you -- when you start doing estimates
from pictures especially if they're taken and fully in control of the client, you want to make
sure that you don't miss any information compared to when you actually send someone
looking at the car, as an example. So I think this was from the start one of the key
questions for us moving into that digital way of estimating damage. So we had prepared
quite a few controls around that. We have to understand that at the end of the day as well,
there is a relying that's work that actually make the repairs and that can adjust that
estimate with us, and we also have a pretty robust audit process based on data. In fact, on
the high-end of people looking at simple of those things. And so far, I would say that the
signs are very positive. In fact, we've seen an additional precision up to now on the exact - on the assessments that are done with this way, partly because the process is consistent.
Our clients, when the send us the information about the claim, they are guided through
our mobile app of what type of pictures they have to take. There's metadata behind those
pictures that allow us to conﬁrm timestamps, and locations, and all sorts of things that is
very useful in the investigation of the claims. So I think we have quite a few angles that
control how we -- any abuse that could arise from a digital process.

Thanks for that color.

Our next question comes from Doug Young from Desjardins Capital Markets. Please go
ahead.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Just maybe I'll start and hopefully, these are fairly quick, but can you
quantify how much of the year-over-year improvement in the personal auto loss ratio
related to the past actions, which you've clearly done a lot to the ﬁx the business, versus

what you can kind of bucket within the COVID impact? I was just wondering if you can
quantify that?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No, that's -- I think -- go back to Q1 and look at what happened to the fundamental to get
a sense of proportion, Doug, because there was really no COVID in any meaningful way in
the ﬁrst quarter. Otherwise, it's very hard to break down the impact of mix versus the
impact of reduced driving net of relief and net of severity. It's something that we don't
want to come out and speculate about because there is a lot of judgment to separate a
claim that you don't get from a source as opposed to another claim you don't get from
another source.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay. But if we looked at Q1, assume maybe a little bit incremental more beneﬁt, that
would give us at least a rough guess ballpark. Is that what you're suggesting?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. Well, I guess what I'm suggesting is Q1 showed a lot of momentum in terms of
frequency and severity, and I think that it's fair to assume that this carries on in Q2. It's
highly imperfect, but it's certainly a good sense of what that momentum was sure.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

If I may add, from a claims perspective especially comparing Q1 versus Q2, it's important
to factor in seasonality, especially on the other line. Q2 is historically the best quarter.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think that's a critical point that -- you're right. And in personal automobile, this is where
the delta is the most meaningful from a seasonality point of view.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

That's fair. And then just second -- yes, the prior year reserve developments were a little
bit lower this quarter, which I think was 0.1% of opening reserves you've guided to 1% to
2%. But I think you've also indicated that it's going to run lower, speciﬁcally around
personal auto. Was there anything unusual in the quarter? I mean, this was just generally
just an unusual quarter. I think it's going to be for most companies. But just wondering if
there's anything else in there that we should be thinking about from a PYRD perspective.
Thanks.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think there's nothing perspective slash permanent in this. We have a range of one to
three. We said that in auto, we would try to run this as close to the line as possible, given
the uncertainty in that line of business. And maybe, Louis, do you want to comment on the
TYG here?

FINAL

Well, I think we said one to three, and by line of business we were guiding to, as you say,
close to the mark in the U.S. as well. And then on the other lines of business, a bit of
activity. But I would concur with you, Charles. There's nothing structural or permanent
here. I think it's one quarter, and we're still conﬁdent in our long-term guidance.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, and I wouldn't qualify this (inaudible) necessarily at a normal quarter. I think we've
tried to front load the impact of COVID-19 as much as possible in Q1, and I think the
quarter showed a fair bit of momentum. Bit of plus here, a bit of minus there. But overall,
a very good, clean quarter.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

All right.
