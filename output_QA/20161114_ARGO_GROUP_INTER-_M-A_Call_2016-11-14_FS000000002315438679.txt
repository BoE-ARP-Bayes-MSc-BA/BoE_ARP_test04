With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark Watson, Chief Executive Officer of
Argo Group. Mark will provide an overview of the transaction's strategic rationale, and
other key highlights and assumptions. Following prepared remarks, both Mark Watson and

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Thank you, Susan, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us
particularly on such short notice.
As you may have seen in our press release, we announced the acquisition of Ariel Re by
Argo Group earlier this morning. The transaction is another step in the building of a global
specialty platform, which we started more than a decade ago. And this acquisition in
particular enhances our scale at both our Lloyd's platform and Bermuda as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

This transaction will allow Argo to better capitalize on distribution relationships, and more
effectively compete across the market. Most important, it will enhance our ability to
generate better returns for our shareholders. We expect the acquisition to be
immediately accretive to earnings per share and return on equity with modest dilution to
tangible book value, which we believe will be made up shortly.
But before I highlight some additional details on Ariel Re and its very profitable track
record, I want to emphasize that Argo remains committed to the specialty insurance
business. While this acquisition enhances our scale in the reinsurance market, it does not
dramatically change our business mix. We have a well-diversified product and geographic
portfolio that on a pro forma basis next year will be approximately 88% written on primary
insurance risks and 12% on reinsurance risks.
Now, let's talk a bit about Ariel Re. First, I want to welcome the team to Argo. My
colleagues and I have spent a lot of time getting to know them, and the way they think
about, and approach the business, and the more time I spend with them, the more
excited I am, and see the potential for this transaction to help us further achieve our
international expansion plans. And as the numbers will show you, Ariel Re is one of the
most profitable.
You all hear me talk a lot about digitization, and make it easier for our customers to do
business with us. Ariel Re brings us even farther along on that track. They have been
investing in their business quite a bit, and Ariel Re has a longstanding profitable position in
the market, dating back to 2005. They underwrite a global portfolio of insurance and
reinsurance business with teams in London, Bermuda, and the U.S. through Lloyd's
Syndicate 1910. And not only does the business have one of the most profitable track
records at Lloyd's, but it is also well-diversified by distribution, regional exposure, and
peril.

FINAL

The company has achieved superior returns by sourcing low-frequency/higher-severity,
high-margin business. And similar to the strategy at Argo, Ariel has effectively used thirdparty capital that expands their market presence, enhances capital flexibility and provides
a stable source of fee income.
When we put our two businesses together, we will be one of the top 12 underwriters at
Lloyd's. Ariel also has new capabilities that can be leveraged throughout the entire
organization, including Ariel Re's unique modeling and risk analysis tools, which will
enhance Argo's already-robust underwriting analytics.
Ariel Re is a great fit with our existing Lloyd's operations. We have complementary
portfolios in similar discipline and underwriting strategy, selection of clients and risk.
Combining these businesses will be very straightforward and will enable us to increase
our already-strong presence in this very important specialty markets. We expect the
integration to be quick and effective with very little disruption during the transition period,
which we expect to be over within the next 12 months.
As Susan mentioned, I've got, Jay Bullock here with me, our CFO to answer any of your
questions. And operator with that, I'll turn the call over for questions.

Q&A

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
Our first question comes from Arash Soleimani of KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

Thanks. So just to figure out, I guess, for the segment reporting, so will Ariel be its own
segment, if I understand, like the fifth segment?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

No. You maybe referring to the presentation that we...

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

...filed along with this. I think, the point of the presentation was that, Ariel uniquely
enhances our Lloyd's business and our Bermuda-based business, which is International
Specialty. To the extent we continue to write the business on the Lloyd's platform, our
current intention, although this is still under consideration would be continue to report the
business as part of our Lloyd's platform.

Okay. So it will be long-term there (07:40), okay. And for modeling purposes, is it better
to assume the 1Q 2017 close is more likely towards the end of the quarter; just wanted to
know, (07:54) little bit more specificity around that?

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

FINAL

Well, I don't think it matters, because we'll be closing as of December 31, 2016.

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

Oh, okay.

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

I mean, that will be the reference balance sheet for the close of the transaction, right.

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

So the current shareholders will own the financial results of the company up till the end of
the year, and then we'll own the results as of the beginning of 2017.

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

Okay, perfect. And then, I saw you provided the premium volumes and that â€“ can you just
discuss what the loss and expense ratios were the last maybe two or three years?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Well, I think that's disclosed on that schedule, the loss ratios in those businesses and
some of those track records go back for almost nine years. I think that, Ariel like all
businesses that trade at Lloyd's or...

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Sorry, you're referring, Jay, to page 9 of the Investor deck?

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Sorry. No, thank you. I am Mark, on page 9 of the Investor deck, at the bottom of the
page, you'll see the historical loss ratios. What I was going to say was that, as a
standalone platform, Ariel like all of us that trade at Lloyd's and in Bermuda has had to
support quite a bit of infrastructure around, whether it'd be Solvency II compliance in
Bermuda or the same in London.
And so their expense ratios have worked very much like the market for other Lloyd's
businesses, and not that dissimilar from ours. That said, we think part of this as we talked
about quite often is, our interest in building more scale, this works for both of us, and so
we do expect to be able to generate some savings from the transaction.

Thank you for that. And from a PPRD (09:49) five-year development perspective, how has
that trended in the last few years?

FINAL

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Well, our track record as you know, goes back many, many years of positive prior-year
development, likewise I would say that, the track record of the guys at Ariel and the team
has been very prudent, and as a result, more often than not they've had modest prioryear development. Although, it's nothing that we â€“ I would say, factored into our analysis in
terms of an ongoing run rate.

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

As I mentioned in my remarks, one of the things we like about them is the way they
underwrite. They also manage their claims and loss reserves the same way.

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

Thanks. And the other question I just wanted to ask is, just around the strategic rationale
of the acquisition given that you already had a Lloyd's Syndicate â€“ why make an acquisition
rather than increase your capacity of the existing Syndicate?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Well, increasing capacity is pretty easy. Putting premium through it in this competitive
marketplace right now is a whole different challenge, and I've said for several quarters
now that, I thought that we needed to be a bit larger to really be at scale in terms of
affording the cost of the â€“ particularly the compliance cost of a platform at Lloyd's, and so
this gets us there now, and it puts a nice portfolio on the books and the process.

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

Okay. That makes sense. And does this change your tax rate on a go-forward basis in
anyway?

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Yeah, probably not that materially, because remember they write lot of business in
London, and so it is â€“ it would be factored into the tax rate very similar to our existing
London business. So it's possible that there could be a very marginal improvement, but
it's â€“ again it wasn't a factor that necessarily went into our analysis and had any material
influence on our analysis.

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And my last question, can you â€“ how big is the fee income stream they
have from the third party capital management?

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

FINAL

Well. The â€“ so it's 50% of the book is in a quota share structure with a Special Purpose
Syndicate, this tend to be on pretty consistent market terms, they have a fee component
to them, and they have a profit commission component to them. The fee components
tend to be in the 1%, 1.5% range and the profit commissions can range anywhere from
15% to 20%.
So if you can factor that into the 50% premium; that would give you a sense as to what
the go-forward is. The reason I can't answer that with more specificity historically is
because, the support has changed, meaning the structure in which the capital of support
Syndicate 1910 has changed over time. So that would be â€“ those would be different
numbers, historically.

Q - Arash Soleimani

{BIO 18869554 <GO>}

All right, great. Thank you very much for the answers.

Operator
