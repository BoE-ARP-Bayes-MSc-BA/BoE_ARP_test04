{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Good morning and thank you for joining us today. The Hartford had a great quarter with
excellent financial results and significant progress on our strategic goals. Third quarter
core earnings were $1.15 per diluted share, up significantly from $0.35 last year. Year-todate, The Hartford's core earnings are $3.55 per share, compared with $1.94 in 2017. A
higher level of earnings this quarter and for the year were driven by several items,
including better underwriting results in Property & Casualty, increased Group Benefits and
Mutual Funds earnings, and a lower U.S. corporate tax rate.
Let me share some details on these items. P&C underwriting margins, which Doug will
cover in more detail, improved with a third quarter combined ratio of 97.3 and 95.4 for the
nine months. The underlying combined ratio was 93.2 and 91.3 respectively, each better
by nearly a point over last year. Group Benefits earnings for the quarter and year-to-date
were up 50% and 74% respectively, due to the acquisition and lower tax rates. Margins
remain very strong, with a core earnings margin for the first nine months of 6.4%,
including the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Excluding intangibles, the core
earnings margin was 7.5%, compared with 6.1% last year.
And Mutual Funds core earnings were up more than 50% for the quarter and year-todate, with continued growth in assets under management. Book value per diluted share,
excluding AOCI, grew 11% since December 31, and the annualized year-to-date core
earnings ROE was 12.7%. Looking at earnings and returns for both the quarter and the
year, I'm very pleased with our overall results. This quarter, we made continued progress
on important strategic and operational goals. In August, we announced the agreement to
acquire The Navigators Group. This acquisition advances several of our key objectives: it

FINAL

enhances our Commercial Lines presence with specialty and E&S capabilities; it broadens
and deepens our product offerings with expanded industry verticals; and it expands our
geographic underwriting reach with an international presence.
Leading agents and brokers are demanding deep expertise in comprehensive risk
solutions across many industries from their carrier partners. With our expanded platform,
particularly in specialty lines and industry verticals for Middle Market, we will strengthen
distribution relationships and improve our access to new business opportunities. The
combination of our capabilities and talent with the diverse product offerings and deep
expertise of the Navigators team, we'll accelerate the next stage of our journey as a
market-leading Commercial Lines company. This acquisition is strategically important to
The Hartford, achieving the financial targets we have set forth will require effort and
teamwork. We are focused on execution and recently kicked off a joint planning process
regarding integration.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are excited to work with our future colleagues to develop our go-to-market plan. As
previously discussed, we expect to generate core earnings before intangibles of $200
million within four to five years. About half of the increase from Navigators' current run
rate earnings will come from relatively straightforward investment portfolio and expense
actions that will begin to impact earnings in the first year. We expect the remainder of the
increase to be achieved over time from topline growth and improved underwriting
margin. We look forward to sharing our future plans and progress with you.
Another key accomplishment is the continued successful integration of our Group Benefits
acquisition, which closed almost a year ago today. This quarter, we began deploying the
disability claims and lead management platform across both books and renewing former
Aetna contracts onto The Hartford systems. January 1, 2019, new sales and renewals,
which are in line with our expectations is another important milestone. We've had
outstanding financial results this year despite higher-than-normal catastrophes. Although
workers' compensation 2018 frequency trends are elevated from expectation, it's a
modest change in trend that we're addressing. Total workers' compensation results this
quarter continued to be quite strong. I'm pleased with the speed and diligence of our
team in identifying this trend, which reflects favorably on the capabilities of our new claims
system and a competitive advantage of our expanded data and analytical skills.
Finally, just a few comments on capital management before turning the call over to Doug.
In 2012, we began the transformation of The Hartford away from capital market-sensitive
businesses to more underwriting-centric ones. Since that time, from organic excess capital
generation and the proceeds of sales of businesses, we have redeployed a significant
amount of capital in a balanced manner, including equity repurchases, acquisitions, and
debt reductions. In total, we returned more than 50% of the total to shareholders through
both dividends and share buybacks. Since 2011, we have repurchased approximately 35%
of our outstanding shares, most of which was done at prices less than book value. In
addition, almost 25% was used to strengthen the balance sheet, which earned us several
credit upgrades in the process. These actions included debt repayment, the asbestos
environmental reinsurance cover purchase, and a reduction in our pension liability.

Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2018-10-26

Lastly, the remaining $4 billion or 25% was used for several acquisitions, including
Navigators, which have met our strategic goals and financial targets. As I reflect back on
this track record, I am proud of the balance that we have struck in our deployment of
capital. We have repositioned our portfolio of businesses to underwriting-centric product
lines, where we have made deliberate investments, both organic and inorganic. And we
have done this while strengthening our balance sheet and returning capital to our
shareholders. As I look to the future, our near-term focus is squarely on the successful
integration of the Aetna and Navigators acquisitions, with the goal of achieving and
ultimately exceeding our expected returns on these investments. These integrations will
consume much of our operational bandwidth for the time being.
Looking forward, we expect our businesses will continue to generate excess capital over
time. In the medium to long term, we will continue to be deliberate in deploying this
capital to create shareholder value. As we do so, our philosophy around capital
management will remain consistent. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to deploy
excess capital, including investing in our businesses and capital management, which
includes reducing leverage with a focus on both financial returns and strategic objectives.
To conclude, The Hartford made a tremendous amount of progress against our strategic
goals over the past year. Looking forward, we are excited by the opportunities we see to
build on the momentum as we move into 2019. We look forward to sharing our progress
with you.

And now, I'll turn the call over to Doug.

Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We posted strong results this quarter in
Property & Casualty and Group Benefits. In Commercial Lines, we're pleased with our
performance and returns, particularly as markets remain competitive and workers'
compensation rates are increasingly under pressure. In Personal Lines, auto loss trends
remain favorable and new business growth rates improved. And in Group Benefits,
margins remain very strong as we continue to execute on our integration plans. It was
another active quarter for catastrophes, but losses were well below third quarter 2017.
This year, Hurricane Florence was the single largest event of the quarter, but there were
also a number of wind, hail, and wildfire events contributing to losses. Current year CAT
losses in the quarter totaled $169 million, $183 million less than a year ago.
Before I cover results for our business units, I'd like to comment briefly on workers'
compensation trends, updating my observations from our second quarter earnings call.
The market remains competitive, as industry returns have been strong over the last five
years. Loss costs trends over the same period have been quite moderate with low
severity and negative frequency trends, driven by favorable economic fundamentals as
we emerged from the Great Recession. With the economy at or near full employment,
our frequency in Small Commercial and Middle Market has turned positive this year. Based
on our business and economic analysis, we view this trend as broader than just our book
of business. With the unemployment rate below 4% for the last six months, the ratio of

Page 4 of 24



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2018-10-26

FINAL

unemployed workers compared to open jobs has continued to decline. This ratio is now
below one for the first time since 2001, the first year this metric was tracked.
Many businesses are struggling to find qualified employees and beginning to add more
new workers to their payroll, generally increasing the risk of workplace injury versus what it
would have been, say, a year or two ago. Additionally, the tightening labor market
produces more hours work per employee, often resulting in fatigue and less training time,
compounding the risk of injury for less experienced workers. Our uptick in frequency
change has been moderate, turning positive on a rolling 12-month basis. The actual
frequency levels are now comparable to what we experienced in 2016, which is a very
manageable shift in a book of business as large as ours.

Bloomberg Transcript

The frequency increase is more pronounced among less-tenured employees and can be
several times that of experienced workers. All-in-all, we see this shift as part of managing
both the industry cycle and the broader economic cycle. This includes making appropriate
adjustments to underwriting, pricing, and loss ratio selections. We are deep inside our
workers' compensation analytics and profitability measures across geographies, account
size, industry class, risk profile, and loss experience.
Based on this analysis, our 2018 accident year loss ratio for Middle Market workers'
compensation is 3.5 points higher than 2017. No changes have been made in Small
Commercial, as current accident year loss cost trends remain within our overall estimates.
This recent frequency trend has not changed our view of accident years 2017 and prior.
Workers' compensation is a very important line to us. We have the expertise, tools, and
data to address exactly these types of market challenges and we will continue to manage
all the leverage available to us as we stay on top of these trends.
Let me now shift into the results for our business segments. In Commercial Lines, the
combined ratio improved 12.5 points from prior year to 96.1, due to lower catastrophe
losses and higher favorable prior-year development. The prior-year development was
driven by continued favorable trends in workers' compensation from accident years 2015
and prior, and favorable emergence in financial products.
The underlying combined ratio for Commercial Lines, which excludes catastrophes and
prior-year development, was 93.7, deteriorating 0.5 point from last year, but still very
healthy. This change was largely due to workers' compensation margin compression in
Middle Market as we react proactively to the frequency trends I described earlier and
adverse non-CAT property results in Small Commercial, largely offset by favorable results
in general liability and commercial auto.
Looking at pricing, our renewal written pricing in Standard Commercial Lines was 1.7%,
down sequentially from second quarter by 130 basis points. This was heavily driven by the
competitive workers' compensation environment. Standard Commercial Lines pricing,
excluding workers' compensation, was 4.9% in the quarter, essentially in line with second
quarter.

FINAL

Within our Commercial Line business units, Small Commercial continued its strong
performance with an underlying combined ratio of 88.7. The margin improvement versus
last year was driven by general liability and auto, partially offset by higher non-CAT
property losses and slightly higher expenses.
Written premium was up slightly as we began to see business flows from the Foremost
renewal rights deal, partially offset by the downward pressure on workers' compensation
rates and competitive market conditions for both new business and renewal.
Small Commercial policy counts have been increasing quarter-over-quarter in 2018, having
declined throughout 2017. This reflects our disciplined approach to profitable growth.
Over the last two years, we've reduced our Small Commercial auto book of business to
improve profitability. Likewise, we've made adjustments to our package policy appetite to
improve returns. Our margins in Small Commercial are industry-leading, as is our platform
for new business and service. We're very excited about our long-term prospects for
growth in this segment of the market.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Middle Market, the underlying combined ratio of 100.2 increased 3.2 points from 2017
with 2.6 points of that increase due to higher current accident year loss ratio and workers'
compensation. Written premium was up 6.5% over last year with solid production in lines
such as property and general liability, as well as verticals such as construction and energy,
offset by declines in workers' compensation.
In Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 96 improved 2.6 points driven
by an adjustment to reflect higher premiums on retrospectively-rated accounts and lower
expenses, offset by slight margin compression in national accounts and financial products.
Moving over to Personal Lines, the underlying combined ratio of 91.8 improved 3.1 points,
representing 5.5 points of improvement in the underlying loss ratio, partially offset by an
increase in the expense ratio. The loss ratio improvement is reflected in both our auto
and homeowner results, driven by earned pricing increases and favorable auto loss cost
trends and non-CAT homeowners' experience. The higher expense ratio is primarily due
to lower earned premiums versus last year and increased marketing efforts in AARP
Direct, where we are focused on new business growth and retention.
New business was up over 30% in AARP Direct auto. Our marketing spend and product
adjustments continue to gain traction, and our competitiveness measures continued to
improve. We are pleased with the underwriting profile of this growth and encouraged by
the improving trends. Despite strong improvement in new business growth, total written
premium was still down 7.6%. Retention remains below our long-term targets as prior rate
increases and a reduced agency footprint continue to work through our book of business.
However, as those rate changes decelerate, retention is improving. And coupled with our
new business trends, will provide a strong foundation for future growth.
Group Benefits delivered another excellent quarter. Core earnings was $102 million with a
margin of 6.7%. The increase versus last year is primarily driven by strong organic growth,
the addition of our 2017 acquisition, and lower tax rates. Although the group disability loss

FINAL

ratio is up slightly versus last year, which experienced unusually high claim recoveries, we
continue to see very strong disability results, including favorable emergence from recent
accident years. The group life loss ratio improved slightly from the volatile adverse trends
experienced in recent quarters.
Persistency on our employer group block of business remained steady at approximately
90%, and fully insured ongoing sales of $104 million were up 53% from prior year. January
2019 sales in national accounts are firming up, and we expect a strong start to next year.
Our expanded sales team is executing very effectively in the market, and our
differentiated service and claims value proposition is clearly resonating with employers.
We're excited about how this business is positioned in the marketplace.
We will remain very pleased with the overall integration of the Aetna Group Benefits
business. We have completed the conversion of former Aetna small business customers
to The Hartford platform. Conversion of Middle Market and large case customers to The
Hartford platform is on track to begin in December and will continue throughout 2019 and
2020.

Bloomberg Transcript

In summary, this was a very solid quarter across our Property & Casualty and Group
Benefits businesses. We are executing effectively against our plans, responding to loss
cost trends and competitive market dynamics with appropriate pricing actions and
disciplined underwriting.
We continue to make excellent progress on our initiatives in product, operations and
technology, all of which contributed to a competitive platform for the years ahead. We are
also very encouraged about the possibilities with our announced acquisition of Navigators.
As Chris has shared, we have kicked off integration activities across all business
disciplines, and we will share more details at an appropriate time.
Let me now turn the call over to Beth.

Beth Ann Bombara
Thank you, Doug. I'm going to cover investment results, mutual funds and corporate
earnings as well as book value and ROEs. In addition, I have a few updates on the
Navigators acquisition and holding company resources.
Starting with investment, net investment income totaled $444 million, up 10% over the
prior-year quarter due to a 9% increase in invested assets, primarily as a result of the
higher level of invested assets in Group Benefits from last year's acquisition. Limited
partnership income did not meaningfully impact the comparison to 2017, as third quarter
LP income was $45 million before tax, down $3 million compared with third quarter 2017.
Excluding LPs, the annualized portfolio yield was 3.7%, down slightly from 3.8% in third
quarter 2017 due to the impact of the acquired Group Benefits assets being recorded at
market yields and the higher level of holding company resources held largely in shortterm investments.

FINAL

The P&C investment yield was up modestly to 3.8%, primarily due to higher interest rates.
For the consolidated investment portfolio, the average new money rate in the quarter
exceeded the average yield on sales and maturities by about 20 basis points. This
reflected higher interest rates as well as a roughly $400 million reduction during the
quarter, an exposure to municipals, given favorable after-tax yields on comparable
taxable investments. The credit performance on the investment portfolio remains very
strong. Net impairments in the quarter totaled $1 million, flat with third quarter 2017.
Turning to Mutual Funds, third quarter core earnings were $41 million, up nearly 60% from
last year due to both higher assets under management and a lower tax rate. Total mutual
fund and ETP assets under management, which excludes assets related to Talcott
Resolution, was $106 billion at the end of the quarter, up 10%. This growth was driven
principally by market appreciation as well as by positive net flows of $1.3 billion over the
last 12 months. Fund performance remained strong as 61% and 69% of funds beat their
peers on a three- and five-year basis, respectively.
Core losses in corporate were $45 million in the third quarter, down from $68 million last
year. There were few ongoing items that affected results this quarter. First, interest
expense declined by $10 million before tax, both on a sequential basis and compared with
third quarter 2017 due to net debt repayment over the period, including the June 2018 call
of $500 million of hybrids, which had a coupon of 8.125%. In addition, there were several
items related to Talcott, including The Hartford share of income from its 9.7% ownership
interest. Similar to our other private equity investments, income on this investment is
reported on a three-month lag. As the sale closed at the end of May, this quarter's results
include income for the month of June, which was about $2 million. Fourth quarter 2018 will
reflect a full three months of results. The amount of income recorded each quarter will be
9.7% of Talcott's net income, which, as you know, can fluctuate based on market
conditions and the impact of hedging.
In addition, fee income in corporate included approximately $11 million of revenue for a full
quarter of managing investments for Talcott. This was offset by corresponding investment
management expenses. Stranded costs related to Talcott were about $9 million before
tax. We expect these costs to be eliminated over the next 15 months. Finally, net
investment income for the quarter included income on the net proceeds received from
the Talcott sale of $1.5 billion.
In total, The Hartford's third quarter core earnings were $418 million, up from $130 million
in third quarter 2017 due to higher earnings in each of the company's main business
segments, including the benefit of a lower corporate tax rate. Core earnings per diluted
share were $1.15. As a reminder, in July, we announced an increase in our quarterly
common dividend by 20% to $0.30 per share, the sixth consecutive annual increase as a
result of stronger earnings from our businesses.
Book value per diluted share at September 30 was $34.95, down 6% from December 31,
largely due to the impact of higher interest rates on the fair value of the investment
portfolio and the removal of AOCI related to the Talcott sale. Excluding AOCI, book value
per diluted share of $39.12 increased 11% since December 31. Core earnings ROE, which is
calculated on a rolling 12-month basis, was 10.3% in third quarter 2018, up more than four
Page 8 of 24

FINAL

points from last year, due in part to strong operating results, including the benefit of a
lower corporate tax rate as well as lower average equity to the sale of Talcott and the
fourth quarter charge related to tax reform. Our annualized 2018 year-to-date core
earnings ROE was 12.7%.
Before taking your questions, I'll provide a brief update on The Navigators Group
acquisition. The go-shop period under the acquisition agreement expired without any
competing bid, and Navigators have filed their proxy with an expected shareholder
meeting date of November 16. The antitrust waiting period under Hart-Scott-Rodino
expired last week, and we have filed the required change in control materials with the
regulators, including New York, the UK, and Belgium. We continue to expect a closing in
the first half of 2019, subject to those approvals, and have begun integration and planning
activities with The Navigators' team. While the acquisition does not have a financing
contingency, we continue to evaluate financing alternatives to maintain appropriate levels
of holding company liquidity post closing. Holding company resources at September 30
were $2.3 billion, compared with the cash purchase price of approximately $2.2 billion,
including expenses.
Last week, we filed a dividend request with the Connecticut Department of Insurance to
accelerate our 2019 planned P&C dividend to fourth quarter 2018. This dividend of
approximately $1 billion will help provide financial flexibility and liquidity to support 2019
interest expense and dividend payments and January 2019 bond maturity. As we have
discussed in the past, we have a robust framework around evaluating capital margins and
liquidity requirements across our company. Importantly, our approach begins with
maintaining sufficient capital and liquidity in our operating insurance companies for stress
scenarios that contemplate much higher catastrophe and credit losses than are typical. In
those stress scenarios, we seek to maintain P&C capital at a AA level based on S&P
models and Group Benefits capital at a 350% RBC. We also seek to maintain sufficient
operating company liquidity to meet cash flow-related stresses, such as large
catastrophes.
Capital resources at the holding company are also evaluated for liquidity requirements in
stress scenarios. We begin with a minimum target of holding company cash and shortterm investments sufficient to cover interest and dividend payments for the next 12
months, which is about $700 million currently, as well as some provision for upcoming
debt maturities, depending on our financing plans. Capital resources above this level are
what we consider excess and can be redeployed for other opportunities. Based on our
current projections, after the closing of The Navigators transaction, we expect the level of
excess capital resources will begin to rebuild in the latter part of 2019 and into 2020.
Consistent with our long-standing philosophy, we will continue to evaluate opportunities
for the use of any excess capital, including investing in our businesses and capital
management opportunities.
To conclude, this marked another quarter of strong underwriting and investment results
for The Hartford, with core earnings growth at each of our main business segments and
steady progress on the Group Benefits integration. Looking forward, we are optimistic
about closing 2018 on a strong note with sustained healthy margins and the benefit of
rising interest rates, although fourth quarter results will be impacted by Hurricane Michael.

FINAL

Based on claims received and inspected to date, we currently expect our Hurricane
Michael losses to be $50 million or less before tax. As a reminder, our original CAT
estimate for fourth quarter was about $55 million, pre-tax. So, we may come in above that
number, depending on our final estimate for Michael and any additional CAT activity for
the quarter. Finally, consistent with prior years, we will provide a 2019 business metric
outlook in February when we report fourth quarter results.
I will now turn the call over to the operator, so we can begin the Q&A session.

And your first question comes from the line of Randy Binner from B. Riley FBR. Please go
ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

Good morning. Thanks. I guess the question and what seems to be driving the stock
today, I think, is the commentary around higher loss picks in workers' comp. Yeah, I
appreciate the kind of the straightforward way that you communicated it. And so, the
question I have is what kind of claims are we talking about here? So, you have a pretty
broad book. Is it kind of basic slip and falls? Is it auto accidents? Is it something else? You
are addressing it, and you are making a higher loss pick. So, it would be helpful, I think, for
me and others to understand what kind of losses are hurting you with less experienced
workers?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Randy, it's Chris. I'll start, and Doug will add his commentary. I think the context on the
whole discussion, hopefully, you sense from our commentary is we're starting in a very
good position. I mean, this is a product line that is performing well. It's a large product line
for us, where we have great data and insights across the country. So, as we're trying to
describe when we see a little pressure in the context of particularly Small and Middle
Market, it is an overall manageable trend line through adjustments in pricing, through
adjustments in underwriting, as Doug would say. So, I would like you and our investors to
understand that the starting point is strong. It's healthy. And this is not a run-away train
situation with loss costs to trends and frequency. So, Doug, can you add some color on
the types of claims we're seeing?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

I will. So, Randy, when I think about injury types, and I look across and we have spent time
looking across fractures, sprains, contusions, slips and falls, et cetera, we see general
uptick in frequency across all those injury types. So, as I described to you, we are looking
deeply in the book. We're seeing some of those trends in both Small and Middle, but I
can't sit here today, based on the data and the reviews we've done, and suggest to you
that it's only a couple of injury types. It looks a bit more broad-based and a bit more
elevated in the inexperienced worker defined by workers in position less than one year.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

The follow-up I have there is that if those are kind of, I guess, higher frequency, lower
severity-type workers' comp claims, is that having inflation from trial attorneys and
medical costs? Or is it more just kind of a frequency thing?

FINAL

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Yeah. We certainly feel like right now our severity is in pretty good shape. We're watching
it carefully. This looks to us like numbers of accidents are up, which is inside that frequency
ratio, and it looks isolated there. And I don't feel the external litigation as a factor. I feel
injury and inexperience as a driving factor.

Q - Randy Binner

All right. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Go
ahead, please. Your line is open.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks, and good morning. Thanks for the color on workers' compensation. I had a followup on that, and this ties back to Randy's question. Would it be possible to remind us either
what the top NCCI Hazard classes are or even talk what are the top classes which make
up your workers' compensation book?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Amit, let me try to just share a profile of our book of business. I'll let you do the work with
NCCI. So, obviously, our Middle Market book, extensive classes. So, construction,
manufacturing, retail, wholesale. Essentially, we're in the entire Middle Market space with
very few exceptions. So, it's broad-based and certainly that would be the case for our
small commercial market as well. We offer a pretty extensive product, and there are very
few sectors of the economy that we don't touch. So, it's not like we're sitting here talking
about a specialty-based market that is lasered into two or three SIC code. That's not,
indeed, the case with our book.

that process? And obviously you spent a quarter now or a few months, do you feel any
different to you versus what you might have looked at that time? Thanks.

Yeah. As I said in my prepared commentary, I mean, we're beginning an integration
planning process. And I think it would be realistic to assume that we'll look at what
Navigators does between now and closing with any reserve positions and make our
adjustments at closing. So, there's really nothing we could comment upon now until we

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Sorry. I also had a couple questions on workers' comp. Doug, I
appreciate the disclosure. You kind of tried to say we're back to where you guys were in
2016. Yet you guys are attributing this to pretty low unemployment levels, obviously, more
inexperienced workers in the workplace. So, the unemployment rate is obviously lower
than what it was in 2016. So, when you guys look at your book and what you're seeing out
there, how do we know that this will not get worse?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Elyse, I guess I can't promise or suggest to that I know exactly how the world's going to
play out in 2019. What we do think we have a good handle on is how 2018 is playing out. I
do think I would say to you that we'll have a great sense of where frequency lands for the
2018 accident year within a quarter or two into 2019, right? These are not long developing
estimates on the frequency side. It's claims in the door. The first quarter is relatively
mature right now from 2018. Second quarter is maturing as we speak. And so, it's a fast
line to measure. The work we're doing in terms of trying to predict and make our best
assessment of 2019 is going on as we speak, which is why we'll bring it all together in
February when we talk and give you our predictions for 2019.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then, you guys have often said, and others in the industry as well, just given the
very strong possibility of comp, that's where we've seen a lot of rate declines. Can this
higher frequency give you the ability to get actuarial-justified rate increases? Or do you
still think just given that the margins still seem to be even with this uptick and frequency
still pretty attractive, that we will still see price declines in the business from here?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Elyse, you're right. The absolute level of performance across comp, across multiple
sectors is very healthy right now. And certainly, our book demonstrates that as well. The
other fact is that as rates are worked on across the industry and loss cost trends are filed

by the NCCI, and carriers like ourselves are adopting multipliers and dropping our own
experience over the top, they're using prior experience periods.
So, as I look out across the various states, and I think about the various effective dates for
the changes dropping into 2019, they're still looking back at prior years, which are very
healthy. So, we're balancing that. We're obviously working levers in our own underwriting
machine, trying to make sure that our underwriters have the greatest sense of where we
sense trends are. We're adjusting based on experience to the account, what we know
about the class, et cetera, et cetera, and bringing all that to bear and making choices to
either write, renew, or to not offer a quote when we feel like the price won't match our
fundamental economic goals.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then one last question on overall prices for Small and Middle Market did
decelerate, away from comp, can you just give us a sense of what's going on broadly in
the Commercial Lines market and would the Q3 pricing levels be what you would expect
to continue into the fourth quarter?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, I see a pretty stable environment non-comp across all the other lines, and I expect
to see that into the fourth quarter. So, I don't see any drivers of change, with the one
exception that we continue to see weather in certain pockets of the country and I expect
to see a bit of tightening, maybe, in terms and also in pricing on the property side,
geography-based.

Q - Michael W. Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you. Good morning, everybody. First question, kind of the follow-up one on
Elyse's last question there, I guess more at a higher level, if you could talk about -- your
margins in the Small Commercial are clearly better and have been than the Middle
Market, so, just at a higher level, the difference in the competitive landscape between the
two, if you're seeing shifts in more competitive environment, I mean, in general, for Small
book versus the Middle Market book?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Relative to Small, what I would say is we have been a focused small business carrier for a
long time. It's a combination of underwriting acumen, platform, speed, automation, retail,
relationships, et cetera. And that formula continues, although in this new digital age, we

are refreshing that for a world where customers will want to reach out 24/7 and be
serviced in different ways. So, that is the formula, I think that's driven our success, and we
clearly think that's a great foundation going forward, with adjustments we will continue to
make.
In the Middle, it's been slightly more competitive. I think that has at least been the case in
my career, that the cycles have had a bit more maybe amplitude to them over time. We
do see competition there. I think we've been successful. We are clearly, in the last five to
seven years, growing our product breadth. Chris has talked to you about what The
Navigators will add to our dimension. I think our underwriting acumen continues to
improve. Yeah, it's a challenged environment, but I think we've got great upside and I see
us as a key player in that market for the long term. So, I'm excited about our prospects.
What's happening now, I see these as kind of shorter-term challenges that we'll work our
way through, but I love what we're doing in Middle, and I think we're going to be a terrific
player there.

Okay. Great. Thanks. Let me switch over, if I could, to the Personal Lines side, and personal
auto, specifically. You're still getting pretty decent rate there, maybe down a bit
sequentially, but the core margins, the core combined of 96 or so, maybe plus a little bit.
Are you where you want to be with profitability in personal auto? And maybe throw in kind
of what you're seeing from the competitive landscape on that line, and you're dropping
PIF, what that means by your competitive position? Thanks.

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

From a profit perspective, we're very pleased about where we are, pleased about our
performance, pleased about the trends we see in our book. So, just an aggregate
performance comment that, yes, we're very pleased about today. The other side is we'd
like to be growing a bit more. And so, as we have gone through and made changes to
get the health back in the profitability piece, we know we've got to continue to adjust to
get our new business stimulated. So, we are keenly aware of that, focused on that,
working every side of that, as I have talked in prior quarters about what we're doing inside
our sales engine, what we're working on the actuarial front, and I've now seen progress,
as I've evidenced through the numbers I've shared with our direct auto AARP growth on
new over the last couple of quarters. I expect that to continue and working hard to make
that happen.

A - Christopher J. Swif t

Doug, I think you really pointed out too that we are spending more to stimulate response.
Responses are up, conversions are up, new business period-over-period is up. We're
working with AARP differently about how we can begin to market to their membership
base. The partnership's never been stronger or more vibrant, in my particular point of
view, and I think 2019 growth will start to kick-in in a more meaningful way that you'll be

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey, thanks, good morning. First one for Doug. Just trying to get some confidence that
next quarter we're not going to be taking another charge for workers' comp. We brought
this up second quarter, and then there's another charge this quarter. So, I'm just trying to
understand what are you assuming? What exactly needs to happen for you to have to
take up your loss tick again? Are you assuming positive frequency now? I mean, where
exactly are we?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Ryan, our accident year 2018 pick for comp, we feel very solid about across all of our lines
of business. And we're assuming that our estimate of trends in those assumptions is solid
and will repeat itself in Q4. So, that's about all I can share. I feel like we're on top of what
we need to. I don't expect any surprises, but I also don't think we're going to see the
world return to negative frequency in the next three months.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Got you. Okay. And then just another one is really just for Chris. And it's more just about –
it's, I guess, the stock price underperformance year-to-date. You guys gave guidance in
February. And I think you're going to exceed guidance in basically every single segment.
You deployed capital. I guess, when you just kind of look at how the stock has been
working, is there anything you think that you could be doing differently over the next 12
months or that you plan on doing that Hartford could do better or differently that you think
could maybe be helpful? Thanks.

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Sure. Ryan, I'm just going to tag onto Doug's last comments on the prior question on
fourth quarter and basically heading into 2019. Remember, the frequency numbers we
quote is a rate of change. It's not an absolute, I'll call it numeric level of frequency. So, my
non-economic analysis is we should not see a continued rate of change increase, even at
lower employment levels, given time does help with training, with job skills.
So, as long as employment doesn't lag down to, say, in a 2.5% range, I think there is a
general level of stability in the workforce education training in the sectors that Doug
mentioned. So, but again, it's something to watch, which, again, with our advanced data
and analytics, we're all over. I think your commentary on the stock price, we share your
frustration, if I could read between the lines. We think we're doing the right things to
create shareholder value over a longer period of time, and we're going to continue to do
what we believe is right. I think the only thing that Beth and I will probably – particularly do
is just spend a little bit more time with investors communicating, being crystal clear on
Page 15 of 24



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity

priorities, execution, going forward. So, that's probably the big thing that I see that we
could do at this point in time.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

FINAL

So, I take that to mean that you think the market is reading too much into this workers'
comp issue as a material problem at Hartford?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah, I do. I mean, if I think about intrinsic value, if I think about cash flows, if I think about
starting points on ROEs and margins, this is a modest pullback in a margin or a loss ratio,
point or two, particularly as we head into 2019. The fundamentals of our business, our
broad-based business isn't really changing. If I look at benefits and the numbers we've
been putting up there, if I look at all the organic product lines that we've been building
that will add meaningfully to earnings going forward, again, I still believe we're doing all
the right long-term things. And can't control short-term mark to markets and fluctuations
in people's views. All we're going to try to do is be as consistent as possible in producing
the results that shareholders expect.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. First question is on the Group Benefits. It feels like it's been
running ahead of expectations. I know, you – there were some prepared remarks about
maybe things were better development than expected. I just wanted to kind of get a
sense for whether the loss ratio is trending more favorably, and we shouldn't take that as
a run rate level.

A - Beth Ann Bombara
Yeah, it's Beth. I'll take that. So, yes, we have seen on our disability book, continued
favorable experience. And, sitting here today, we'd expect from a loss ratio perspective
to see some continuation of that. Again, if you look at our development there, it definitely
has been higher than we would have expected. But, again, a lot of that is related to more
recent experience, so you do sort of expect that experience to continue in the short term,
sort of different than when you think of the longer-term P&C-type liabilities where you're
making adjustments on very old accident years that maybe don't indicate kind of current
trends. So, we're very pleased with how that book is performing overall and like the
momentum that we see.

That's helpful, Beth. Switching gears to Homeowners, we've had a couple peers saw
deterioration in the underlying. You guys didn't. But some of those peers also mentioned
kind of trends that were negatively impacting the – they think, the broader space in terms
of more water and fire losses. Are you guys seeing any of that in your book?

FINAL

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Mike, our Homeowners book has been running really sound this year. Now, we've worked
on that for the last three to four years. So, as we were rebuilding Auto, both in the
financial health and the product, we were also doing a lot of work in Homeowners. So, I
attribute our strong performance, number one, to the underwriting actions, the earned
pricing actions over the last couple years. And then there's all this volatility, and this is a
pretty good quarter. So, I'm not going suggest that we're not going to ever have volatility
again in the line. But I feel pretty good about our Homeowners line, and our ex-CAT
weather running very favorable at the moment.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. If I can sneak one last one in for Beth. It sounded like Talcott, from the prepared
remarks, had some benefit from capital markets, and that could be choppy going forward.
And this might not be the run rate. Is that the right way to categorize that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Beth Ann Bombara
Yeah, I mean, again, if you go back and look at when we owned 100% of Talcott, and
again, look at the net income numbers because, again, often times people focus on core
earnings, which are a little bit more predictable. But we'll be picking up our share of their
total net income, which would include any impact of hedging. My only point is it just can be
volatile, period to period. So, I wouldn't want someone to take $2 million for one month
and assume that that's sort of the run rate.

Thank you. Yeah. Two questions. The first one is a quick one. You might have said – I'm
looking in my notes for the dollar value number of the 3Q reset in workers' comp versus
the 2Q reset. I don't know if you said that, but if you have that, it would be great.

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Josh, I don't have that. What I did say is that our accident year 2018 number in Middle
Market is up 3.5 points over the 2017 accident year number. That's 3.5. We did move that

Page 17 of 24



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity

in the quarter a couple of points. I don't have the dollar component of that. But it's just
math. So, it's millions, not tens of millions.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

FINAL

And that's all workers' comp?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

That was a workers' comp, I'm talking about what we did.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay. And the second question, maybe I dig in a little bit. With the sale of Talcott, it looks
like the Mutual Fund business still is producing the same type of earnings power. With that
loss, are you going to continue? Is there any risk that those funds go away, I guess, and
that kind of dovetails into very strong Corporate results, which I think there's a lot of
moving pieces. And I think it's mostly Talcott-related. If you can sort of talk about what the
going-forward earnings power is, I guess, of the Corporate segment and the Mutual Fund
business, post-Talcott.

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, I'll let Beth talk about the Corporate segment. But on Mutual Funds, again, I think,
you can see the Talcott AUM, roughly $16 million-ish.

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Billion.

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

It's billion, excuse me. Been pretty stable. So, there shouldn't just by our ownership
change to new owners, and by itself, that would not going change that relationship. Those
funds inside the VAs are still managed by Wellington. So, the only thing, Josh, there is just
your views on how quickly does that block run off and what happens to the AUM and if
there's any changes in market conditions and performance. But I don't see much change
right now. It should be pretty stable. Beth, can you add in your color on?

A - Beth Ann Bombara
Yeah, so on the corporate piece, I mean, again, as you pointed out, there were a couple
of moving pieces this quarter. I think the biggest one really, I think, is the reduction in
interest expense, when you kind of think about that from an ongoing perspective. A lot of
the Talcott balances that I referenced, some of those kind of net out with the revenue
versus the cost that we have. So, when I look at the quarter, $45 million loss for Q3, I kind
of see that run rate going forward of being around $50 million-ish is kind of probably a
safe place to be. And I would say that will change, depending on what happens with debt
costs, and then, as I said, what the actual income pick-up we get quarter to quarter from
the Talcott piece, because again this quarter it was $2 million. I would expect that to
bounce around a bit.

Q - Thomas Gallagher

Good morning. Doug, just to come back with a few workers' comp questions. The pick-up
in frequency that you saw, was that just most pronounced in Middle Market? Or did you
also see that in Small Commercial?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Tom, we also saw the pick-up in Small Commercial as well. Yeah.

Q - Thomas Gallagher

{BIO 3311667 <GO>}

Got it. And when you mentioned it went from negative to positive frequency, can you
quantify that a bit? Was it a small negative to a small positive or a bit wider? The band?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

The frequency trends, really going back five, six, seven years, but even longer than that,
have generally been favorable and negative. So, that's the overall industry, and certainly
our book has performed equally as well. So, we're talking single-digit minuses going back
in time. That did move to this moderate single-digits, small single-digits, mid-single-digits
as we moved into 2018 accident year.

Q - Thomas Gallagher

{BIO 3311667 <GO>}

Got it. And then just on severity side, I think that's been coming in favorably for a while.
Has that trend really been claim durations? Or is that lack of wage inflation? And would
you still expect that to develop favorably on the severity side?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Tom, when we think about severity, we separate the medical from the non-medical, and
both parts of severity look pretty much in check. So, we are aggressively managing with
our claim resources and talented medical executives inside a claim – the medical side and
feel good about that. Feel good about our workers' compensation networks, feel good
about our strategies, and I think are doing a lot to control the medical costs inside our
workers' compensation environment.
On the non-medical, our expectation and what we're seeing in our trends is very
moderated. So, pleased about those trends, right in line with expectations. And as an allin basis, the severity estimates are pretty much on top of what we're seeing. So, I feel
good about the severity end of this story.

are still getting some reasonable rate. And I know, Doug, you talked a little bit about
some concerns about maybe GL claims inflationing. You haven't said it this call, and I'm
curious what your views are going forward. But as I look going forward, as that earned
rate comes through, is there perhaps some offsets here with the rest of the Commercial
book on your kind of underlying loss picks versus what's happening with comp?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Brian, I look across and we're spending time on our loss trends across all the lines. And,
yes, I have talked about liability in the past and we're watchful of that. We've seen a little
bit across the industry, not just in our book, but others have talked about product, others
have talked about D&O. It's a watchful area for us, but in general, our loss trends across
the non-workers' comp lines, basically in line with our expectations for the year.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay. And then are you seeing rate in excess of trend right now, aside from workers'
comp?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

I would say it's more about equal to trend in the aggregate. And again, there's a property
story off to the side of this with CAT that we all have to come to grips with, right? We're
disappointed in our CAT results and have some work to do in our CAT pricing and our
CAT underwriting et cetera, but that aside, generally I think we're holding serve relative to
our margins in our non-comp lines.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. And then one other just quick question. Is there any kind of read-throughs from
what's going on with comp over to the Group Benefits area, perhaps maybe the lower
incidents has something to maybe do with the real good employment situation? Do you
think about it that way?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

top of it and to look at your metrics and watch your trends is much advanced from where
we were five years ago.

FINAL

And so, we have monthly and weekly discussions, but we're sitting on top of trends that
candidly five years ago were very manual in nature to try to get our arms around, and they
were slower than we like them to be. And so, it's a completely different environment and
one that I think is leading to outstanding claim performance.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

It's an interesting topic. I'll follow-up offline on that topic later. But thanks for the insight.

A - Sabra Rose Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

Thanks, Jay. I think, we have two more questioners in the queue, and so we'll finish those
up. I know, we're running past a little bit on our time and there's a 10:00 call. But we will
finish up the queue.

Operator
All right. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from
Janney Montgomery Scott. Go ahead, please.

Q - Robert Glasspiegel

{BIO 1764160 <GO>}

Good morning, Hartford, and thank you for squeezing me in. On the year-to-date catch up
on comp in Middle Market, it seems like your deterioration was overstated sequentially, or
year-over-year by Q1, Q2 adjustments. So, on any way that you can do with, the 300 basis
points plus sequential increase, how much of that was catch-up for comp?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

So, Bob, the 3.5 points of change occurred over the three quarters, primarily the last two
quarters, because Q1 didn't change much. And essentially half of that change was in Q2
and half of it in Q3. So, in our Q3 change of a couple of points, two-thirds of that change
would have related to the first two quarters of the year in terms of impact in the quarter.

Q - Robert Glasspiegel

{BIO 1764160 <GO>}

Okay. And that's just within comp, so, overall, you take – comp was 75% of the
deterioration, I think you said?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

I don't know if I said that. I'll go back and think about that math. But I did say that our other
lines are essentially holding and comp is the only line that we've made an adjustment to in
the current accident year primarily. Beth?

FINAL

Your next question comes from the line of Sean Reitenbach from KBW. Go ahead, please.
Your line is open.

Q - Sean Reitenbach

{BIO 20103487 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you. How well can you incorporate the trend of inexperienced workers into
workers' comp underwriting and pricing, going forward?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Good question. We certainly can ask the questions of our prospective clients and renewal
clients how fast they're growing, on the payroll side, how many new workers do they
expect, so you can get a sense by looking at their payroll and their sales projections, et
cetera, Sean. We're trying to do all that and more today, as we speak, kind of leaning into
this environment, trying to understand where those sectors and those clients are that
need a little more rate as they've got a lot of inexperienced at the desk level or at the
machinery level.

Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. My second question on the Personal line's other agency
book, is that something you guys are looking to turn around growth in? Or should we
expect that book to keep shrinking?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah, I think that the latter, Sean. It's a – it's a book we have, we don't want to call it a runoff or discontinued, per se, but AARP has got 100 plus percent of our attention and
energy going forward.

Q - Sean Reitenbach

{BIO 20103487 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. That's all I have.

Operator
Thank you. And with that I would like to turn the call back over to Sabra Purtill for some
closing remarks.

A - Sabra Rose Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

Thank you. We appreciate that you all joined us today and we look forward to seeing you
in the future. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to follow-up with
the investor relations team. Thank you and have a good day.
