Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you Natalia, and good morning everyone. It is a pleasure to be here with you again
for our third quarter 2018 earnings call. Let's begin on slide 2, where I will run through the
main figures. First of all, I would like to highlight that we are still facing significant
headwinds from foreign exchange movements especially for two largest exposures, the
U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real. At constant exchange rates, premiums are up 2.2% and
the net result stood at around €529 million, up nearly 19%, largely driven by lower NatCat
losses. At constant exchange rates, it would have grown close to 26%. Shareholders'
equity is down 4% year-to-date, again mainly as a result of currencies. I would like to
highlight that currency movements have lowered net equity by over €850 million, in that
case since January 1st last year. Our combined ratio closed at 98.1% and includes the
snowstorms in the U.S., balance sheet adjustments in Brazil, and the recent typhoon Jebi
in Japan. The ROE was over 9%, improving 2 percentage points compared to September
2017.
Please turn to the next slide, and I will briefly comment on the main highlights. Currency
headwinds have been quite strong and they are expected to continue being a drag on
P&L during the coming months, but to a lesser extent, that's the good news. Regarding
Brazil and the USA, the restructuring process needs to gain momentum. In Brazil, we will
introduce the MAPFRE business model when we close the transaction with the Banco do
Brasil, which will be key to improving results in Motor.
In North America, Puerto Rico has had a solid recovery after 2017 net cat events, and as
mentioned, the Northeast USA was affected by winter storms during the first quarter of
the year, and the non-Northeast combined ratio is improving, but it is still too high and is

being carefully monitored. We expect 2019 to be a turning point for both USA and Brazil
operations.
Iberia, LATAM North and South and also MAPFRE RE are the strongest units in terms of
profit contribution. ASISTENCIA and Global Risks show significant improvements in results.
Trends are improving in the Life business. In Spain, growth in Life-Savings has been quite
strong, even when excluding a large policy issue in the third quarter. Underlying
profitability is also growing. In Brazil, there has been return to growth in Life Protection but
results still need to catch up. Talking about our capital position, it remains strong with our
Solvency II ratio above 200% at June. Our financial flexibility was underpinned with the
successful issuance of €500 million in subordinated debt in this quarter. Finally, MAPFRE's
strong financial situation has been confirmed by the main rating agencies throughout the
year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Please turn to the next page. In this challenging context, I would like to highlight MAPFRE'S
resilience which allows us to reaffirm our commitment to a stable and growing dividends
within our 50% to 65% payout range. Of course, the main driver of dividends will be
results. Our goal is to surpass last year's net result around €700 million, assuming ordinary
NatCat losses in the fourth quarter. We are currently working on our new three-year
strategic plan, which will be announced in our AGM next March and will continue to be
focused on profitable growth and business transformation.
Please turn to slide 5. On the right side, you can see the main drivers of results by region
and business unit. Iberia continues to be a strong driver of profitability with a €354 million
net result and also excluding real estate gains and last year's extraordinary benefit from,
probably you remember, the cancellation of bancassurance provision, profit will have
grown by over 3%. Again outstanding results from Iberia.
MAPFRE RE was the second largest contributor with €113 million net profit. Results in
LATAM north and South are consistently improving year-on-year, while Brazil is still facing
headwinds. And the turnaround at MAPFRE ASISTENCIA and absence of cat loses at
Global Risks help us improve results this year.
Please turn to slide 6. This slide shows the effects of currency depreciation on P&L. The
Argentine peso and the Turkish Lira were the worst performers with the 39% and 25% fall
in average exchange rate respectively. The Brazilian real is still down over 17% year-onyear. We have also seen an over 7% decline in the Mexican peso and the US dollar has
fallen over 5%.
On the left side, you can see both premium and operating profit figures at constant
exchange rates. Premiums grew 2.2% at constant exchange rates and 3.4% excluding the
two following extraordinary singular policies: They bi-annual PEMEX policy, you know it very
well, for approximately €500 million, issued in 2017, and a Life Group policy for €282
million, issued in Spain in the third quarter of 2018. Regarding the result of insurance
business which was stable year-on-year, we've grown over 9% at constant exchange
rates, with strong growth in both Life and Non-life.

On the next slide, I will go through the main highlights by the different regions. In Iberia,
we've seen a strong underlying growth both in Non-Life at 7% and Life at 11%. The
combined ratio is under 94%, with an outstanding 90.7% in Motor, well below the market
average. In Brazil, on the right of the slide, we're beginning to see a pick-up in local
currency growth, 10% in Life and 3% in General P&C, while Motor growth is more modest.
Regarding profitability, there were further balance sheet adjustments in the third quarter,
mainly in the Motor business, even excluding these adjustments, the line is still
underperforming. Lower financial income and higher acquisition expenses are also still
weighing on results. We expect profitability measures in Motor to begin to deliver in the
coming quarters.
And meanwhile, we reaffirm the three-year combined ratio target of below 100%. In North
America, the Non-Northeast USA is growing around 1% in U.S. dollars on the back of tariff
increases, while premiums in the Northeast region are still being reduced. In Puerto Rico,
premiums are up 26% in dollars as a result of higher tariffs in commercial lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

And finally, in LATAM North and South, there are positive premium trends across the
region with Mexico up 14% in local currency, in that case excluding PEMEX. Peru is up 14%
and we've seen relevant growth across Central American countries. Premiums in Chile are
still down year-on-year due to the cancellations of unprofitable business, which is having a
positive impact on results. In addition, the sale of a building this quarter has had a €22
million net impact on group results.
Finally, in Colombia, additional provisions have been made in annuity and Workers'
Compensation run-off portfolios, as a result, it was mentioned in previous presentations,
of updating long term financial assumptions, as usual following MAPFRE's quite prudent
valuation policy.
Please turn to slide 8. In EURASIA, Italy continues growing both premiums and results.
Turkey is facing a reduction in its Motor portfolio, which has a high combined ratio due to
both the already noted 2017 MTPL regulation as well as a higher inflation. In Malta,
premiums are up 10% year-on-year, thanks to Life-Savings, that are performing very well.
Profitability is excellent at MAPFRE RE, as I mentioned, despite an increase in attritional
claims during the first quarter, already mentioned as well and a large event during this
third quarter.
Finally, ASISTENCIA and GLOBAL RISKS continue reducing premiums as a result of ongoing
business restructuring. As you can see, the improvement in underlying results in
ASISTENCIA was €36 million and in Global Risks around €18 million. Again, these are
underlying results, because in absolute terms, the reduction in Global Risks was almost
€80 million.
Please turn to slide 9. Here, I would like to talk about extraordinary impacts that affected
results. Weather-related and NatCat claims are down over a €150 million year-on-year.
Hurricanes and earthquakes affected Direct Insurance, MAPFRE RE and GLOBAL RISKS in
2017, as you know. This year there had been severe winter storms in the U.S. during the

Page 3 of 16

first quarter with an €11.5 million net loss for MAPFRE USA and €7.6 million for MAPFRE RE
due to the quota share reinsurance agreement.
Also MAPFRE RE was affected this quarter by Typhoon Jebi in Japan, with an initial
estimated net loss of €39 million. There were several corporate transactions in 2017 and
they're fully disclosed in the footnote, with a total net impact of €15.7 million. This year
corporate transaction include the negative €7 million impact from the U.S. exit plan, and
also a €4 million hit from closing the GLOBAL RISKS office in Germany, this last one was
taken in September of this quarter. Realized gains are stable year-on-year as real estate is
up and financing investments, on the other side, are down in a volatile market context.
This year's transactions include the sale of the two buildings, one in Chile, although
commented, and another in Portugal, with a €22 million and €8.5 million net impact
respectively, both in the third quarter. Finally, 2017 figures also reflect €27 million net gain
from the reversal of our provision for contingent liabilities in bancassurance. Taking into
account all these effects, the adjusted net result is down around 2%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Please turn to slide 10. There were additional extraordinary adjustments in Brazil in
September as a result of a final – I want to emphasize the final review to achieve a more
conservative balance sheet valuation with a €22 million negative net impact during the
third quarter, reaching €31 million total for the year.
This is good news. On November 6, the last approvals were received from the SUSEP and
in this context, the transaction will be completed on November the 30th. Full disclosure of
these adjustments, which are mainly related to Motor and Life business lines, is at the
bottom of the slide.
Please turn to the next page to look at the main figures of the Non-Life business by
region and Business Unit. Here I would like to focus on the combined ratio. As you can
see, there have been solid improvements in Iberia, LATAM North and South, thanks to the
successful implementation of our profitable growth strategy in these regions. The
combined ratios at MAPFRE RE and GLOBAL RISKS have been exceptional, especially
when considering the current market context. Brazil has been affected by the balance
sheet adjustments that we just commented on the previous slide and excluding these
adjustments, the combined ratio would stand at around 91%.
Please turn to slide 18, where I will briefly comment on the balance sheet and solvency
position. Shareholders' equity has fallen this year by over €340 million to around €8.3
billion. The net unrealized gains on the available-for-sale portfolio fell by over €200 million
and currency conversion differences fell by over €210 million during the year. These
declines were driven by several market movements. First, the depreciation of our main
currencies, second, higher yields in Europe and in the U.S., and finally, the fall in European
equity markets
As you can see on the right, these currency conversion differences have been the largest
in Brazil, followed by the Turkish lira. Also the diversification of our balance sheet has

FINAL

helped mitigate these changes and we have seen positive contributions from the U.S.
dollar and the Mexican peso.
Please turn to slide 19. On the left, you can see the assets under management are down
slightly since the beginning of the year. This is driven by volatility in the stock markets and
peripheral bonds as well as currency movements, mainly again the Brazilian real. The
breakdown of the investment portfolio is on the left. Asset allocation has been relatively
stable throughout the year, and our cash position is up from €2.2 billion to €2.6 billion
during the quarter, mainly as a result of the recent subordinated debt issuance. The
largest exposures correspond to Spanish sovereign debt with €16 billion, and Italian
sovies, our exposure is €2.8 billion, close to the €3 billion limit recently approved by the
board. It is worth highlighting that over two-thirds of these positions are located in
immunized portfolios, as you can see on the bottom right chart. Somehow it limits our risk
exposure.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the slide 20, we will look at our actively managed investment portfolios. Our portfolio
yields are quite high, 2.3% in Non-Life and nearly 4% in Life, well above market yields.
Duration in Non-Life has slightly increased throughout the year, trying to keep accounting
yields quite stable. Regarding realized gains, during the third quarter, Spanish debt has
been very volatile. Realized gains reached €73 million in Non-Life portfolios, down around
€36 million compared to last year. Gains are also slightly down in Life portfolios, basically
due to MAPFRE RE.
Please turn to the next slide. On the left you can see the breakdown of the capital
structure, which amounted to €12.3 billion. During the quarter, we issued €500 million in
subordinated debt with an effective yield of under 4.2%, 20 basis points lower than the
last debt issued last year. With this, bond leverage has increased to over 20%, still at very
low levels compared to our peers. We now have €680 million undrawn on our credit
facility, which gives us significant financial flexibility.
Let's move on to Solvency II figures. Solvency II ratio stood at close to 202% at June 30th
above our 200% target range, confirming MAPFRE's strong and stable solvency position
even in a year marked by high market volatility. We have a high quality capital base with
93% of Eligible Own Funds in Tier 1. And the near subordinated bond is Tier 2 debt and
will be reflected in the September figures, those are as of June, when we release them.
Let's move on to the last slide, and I will make a few closing remarks. Regarding
currencies, we have faced significant headwinds during the recent quarters, and we
expect this to continue, to a lesser extent, in the coming months. Again, this is a
consequence of our diversified business model, which in the long run provides us with
balance sheet resilience, earnings stability and also growth opportunities. We have
achieved our restructuring targets for both Brazil and the U.S. and we expect these
processes to gain momentum after the transactions are closed. As we previously
mentioned, for MAPFRE, day one will be January 1 next year.
We are pretty confident in the outlook for Brazil. The economy is improving. The political
situation is stabilizing after recent elections and we will be able to optimize the new

FINAL

agreement with Banco do Brasil in a more favorable environment. In USA, we are now
beginning to see the effectiveness of the new profitability initiatives already
implemented, and California is a very good example of how we can implement the
turnaround in other states.
We believe that MAPFRE's capabilities are greater than what current numbers are
showing. Several important units are performing well, Iberia, LATAM North and South and
MAPFRE RE, which is proof of our ability to successfully implement our profitable growth
strategy.
Finally, MAPFRE has a solid capital position, which will underpin dividend stability and allow
us to continue to meet our commitments with shareholders.
That's all from my side. Thank you. And now, I will hand the call over to Natalia to begin the
Q&A session.

Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Fernando. But before the Q&A, I would like to make one quick announcement.
I am pleased to let you know that we will be hosting our next Investor Day on April 8,
following the AGM in March. We will provide you with the specific details at a later date,
but we can anticipate that the agenda will cover the main topics from the new strategic
plan, and we look forward to sharing this opportunity with you again.
So, now, we can start with the Q&A session.

Q&A
A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

The first question comes from Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays, and is in Iberia, regarding the
combined ratio. The combined ratio appears weaker in 3Q across the board, Motor,
General P&C and Accident & Health, is there a trend behind losses?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Ivan. First, a general comment about the weather and seasonality in
Spain. Usually severe rains happen before summer. This year, it happened mainly in
September and also in October. So these rains are increasing the combined ratio both in
Auto and Homeowners, but it is seasonal. We have to look at the combined ratio in the
long run in order to see future trends.
We keep our best-in-class combined ratio in Iberia, we're extremely satisfied with all the
measures implemented, and we are pretty, pretty satisfied with the excellent
performance in the area – in the country.

Page 6 of 16

FINAL

The combined ratio in Spain goes from 93.5% in June this year to 93.7% at the end of the
third quarter. And it was, as I mentioned, due mainly to weather-related claims affecting
these three lines – Motor line, also Homeowners and Agriculture lines, which is very
important. I would like to mention the very positive evolution of the combined ratio in
Portugal from 101% in June this year to 97.2% at the end of the third quarter. And it was
thanks to a relevant improvement in our claims experience. In particular, Workers'
Compensation, this is a line of business we are leaving due to the high loss ratio.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. Another question from Ivan is, what is MAPFRE's competitive strategy in
Spain at this moment? You mentioned at the second quarter 2018 that low combined ratio
left room for market share gains.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Let's say, Ivan, that the growth is important, but profitable growth is even more
important. And this is the main message I want to send to you and to the rest of your
colleagues. Iberia has a leading positioning in the main Non-Life segment in Spain and a
very low – very good level of combined ratio, approximately it's below 94%.
In the Motor line, what we've seen is further improvement year by year. And our view is
that the current 90% level will be quite challenging to keep in the future, especially to gain
market share. In the long run, what we've seen is 92% combined ratio for Automobile as a
more reasonable level. Obviously, this gap allows us to be a little bit more competitive in
terms of tariffs, but keeping our stricter underwriting policies and also our prudent
guidelines. With the recent insurance data published by ICEA in June 2019, we're still
maintaining a gap of nearly 5 percentage points versus the market in the combined ratio.
For growth opportunities, we're looking at the different opportunities we can see in the
market, but always focused on profitability. As we already mentioned in previous
presentation, we have begun to certainly grow again in the fleet segments, small bank
fleets after several years of reducing exposure. It will give us a room for growth in
automobile, which is very important for MAPFRE.
In other Non-Life segments, we've seen some room for improvements in homeowners
and third-party liability combined ratios that our view is that currently there is room for
improvements in both lines of business.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Looking at another question that is regarding Iberia. This
question comes from Farquhar Murray from Autonomous. Could you outline where you
expect the tax changes related to unit link to have a material impact on the sales,
reserves and operations of MAPFRE VIDA in Spain?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Page 7 of 16



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2018-11-08

Well, first of all – I mean, this is not a change, this is a proposal. We have to see whether or
not it will come to be enforced in law. And so far, I wouldn't like to comment on this topic.
But anyway, in the end, it is a levy on these products, I don't think it will affect neither our
balance sheet nor our sales in MAPFRE VIDA.

FINAL

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Now, Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays asks about the increase in
the loss ratio in the reinsurance and Global Risks businesses in the third quarter, and if we
could give more details of the geographic distribution of losses?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. First of all, let me take a positive view on both entities. And to highlight the excellent
combined ratios in MAPFRE RE and Global Risks, which both are around 96%, and both are
improving in comparison with last year when we were affected by the five catastrophic
events in the third quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'd say that the improvement is a result of our strict technical management, underwriting
guidelines and our effective reinsurance strategy based on a quite low risk appetite. With
regard to this quarter, we have seen an increase in non-catastrophic losses, what we call,
attritional losses in both units, which have led to a slight increase in the third quarter in
some regions, worth mentioning Europe and the U.S. regions, for example, but all in all,
we are very proud of this technical management, especially in a quarter affected by large
catastrophes.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you so much. Now, another one from Ivan from Barclays is regarding LATAM.
And it is, strong improvement was seen across LATAM North and LATAM South in both
Life and P&C. How sustainable is this result?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Ivan. It was said many, many years ago that MAPFRE wouldn't achieve a
combined ratio in LATAM North and LATAM South below 100. Fortunately, I mean, those
forecasts were wrong, and we're happy with the current performance that we have seen
in both regions. And last year, they were around 98% and this year belowthat with 2.4%
decrease and 1.9% decrease in both the regions. MAPFRE has proved a high level of
expertise and track record in emerging countries. And now, we are harvesting the fruits of
the initiatives implemented in the majority of the countries and also the know-how and the
expertise that MAPFRE is able to deliver in these regions.
In LATAM North and LATAM South, the main driver is value creating and long-term
resilience, as we said, earnings stability and also strong capital position. So, despite the
economy, which is cyclical, and the insurance market which is quite complex, we are
extremely confident in our current footprint in both regions, LATAM North and South.

Great. Thank you. Now, there's a question from Michael Huttner from JPMorgan, it's
regarding strategy and targets. What is the sustainable profit run rate once the planned
Brazil and North America restructurings are complete?

FINAL

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well, we're about to complete in both countries' restructuring processes. Michael, as we
said, day one for MAPFRE in both countries is January 1. And also, you know that we are
currently preparing the new strategic plan, which will be finalized over the next few
months and approved by the board at the end of the year, beginning of next year, and
presented at our AGM in March 2019. At that point, we'll be able to provide you with a
clearer picture and also the new financial targets.
Anyway, in any case, we do not expect any major change from our current strategy, as we
are convinced that the current one is correct, but there will be a greater focus probably on
transformation and innovation in order to adapt the company to the new market trends.
In a nutshell, we're looking at where we want MAPFRE to be in the longer-term, not only a
three-year plan. So, at the AGM, we'll give you more information regarding the financial
targets.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Now, also from Michael Huttner, the commitment to at least
flat earnings for the full year 2018 versus full year 2017 seems relatively undemanding.
Year-end 2017 was affected by extraordinary NatCats. What is your view, and also in line
with this question, given the strong Solvency II of 203% at June and that the full year 2017
comp period was affected by extraordinary net cats, the commitment to a stable dividend
seems to be relatively modest. Why not to pay more?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, again. And as we mentioned, our target is stable and growing dividends
within our 50%, 65% payout range. Stable dividend for the current year 2018 makes sense
when taking into account the current economy and also the market context. The
underlying result was down 2% year-on-year, and we didn't exclude the adjustment in
Brazil that we're still facing, and also we're still facing currency headwinds, and also the
low level of interest rates, and in several markets and two key units the need to gain
momentum in the restructuring process.
Overall, we are satisfied with the results we've seen. Iberia continues with an excellent
performance. MAPFRE RE and Global, as I mentioned, have combined ratios around 95%
even after a higher NatCat quarter, and LATAM is proof of the success of our effective
profitable growth strategy. Further improvements in results and ROE will help us to
continue to grow dividends in the medium-term. So, all in all, I mean, we're looking at
improving our results and also improving dividends but both figures have to be together.

Okay. Thank you, Fernando. Next question is regarding LATAM was sent by Francisco
Riquel from Alantra. As for Argentina, what is the impact from hyperinflation accounting
expected in Q4 both in P&L and in equity?

FINAL

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Francisco. We have included a full disclosure of the hyperinflation
accounting on page 22 of our Financial Report Management Discussion and Analysis,
which is already available at the CNMV, but this is an approximation, because we haven't
booked in our financial statements the hyperinflation effect.
Let me see the numbers. Also I have to mention that the importance of Argentina in the
financial statements of MAPFRE taken as a whole is quite reduced. Our current MAPFRE
Argentina equity is approximately €30 million without restatement, and after restatement
it will grow to €45 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Regarding profit, with our restatement, the profit contribution from Argentina is €13.7
million, and restated is €1.5 million, so the net impact will be a reduction of the benefit of
almost €12.2 million. Please, as an advice, I mean, you shouldn't extrapolate these figures
for the full year.
First, because for hyperinflation countries, the currency rate applied is the end of the
period. So at September, the current exchange rate for the peso Argentine was ARS 47
for €1, and currently it's like 40. So it means there is an appreciation of the Argentinian
peso during the month of October. So probably, I mean the effect on the P&L will be
lower, if the Argentinian peso keeps the same trend for the remaining part of the year.
But for sure, I mean we will include the hyperinflation accounting rules in the annual
accounts for the full year.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay, thank you very much. The next question comes from Ivan Bokhmat [Barclays], Silvia
Rigol from BBVA, Michael Huttner from JPMorgan, Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America
Merrill Lynch and Paco Riquel from Alantra. So this set of questions is regarding Brazil and
as you can see, it has raised in lot of interest. First one is regarding the combined ratio in
3Q 2018, that continued to deteriorate. When should we start seeing an inflation point?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well, first of all, it's a general comment in Brazil. We have a quite well diversified position
in this country and what we've seen in the third quarter is deterioration of basically Motor
line business, but in agricultural business, the combined ratio is quite low, and also we're
seeing quite good profits coming from the Life business. We're pretty confident for the
outlook in Brazil. The agreement with our partner has been reinforced and we will
leverage MAPFRE's expertise and our proven track record in the Motor business.
As already mentioned in previous presentations, we are already implementing some of
the initiatives and measures to streamline the organizational structure and processes, in
order to have a more efficient decision-making process. There are several initiatives in the
Page 10 of 16

FINAL

pipeline that were designed by the task force in February involving technical and
commercial functions. I said this is a pipeline, because some minor initiatives have already
been implemented. But we have to wait, as you know in the insurance business, increases
in tariffs, reduction of some agent accounts, and also the streamlining of some – or
reduction of coverage in some products. It take time to see – or to harvest profits. So we
have to wait a little bit longer and probably next year, will be the first one to see a better
performance in automobile.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Regarding politics, do you anticipate a change in policy or economic direction from Brazil
presidential elections?

Well, we don't like to comment on political issues, but as a general view, I mean the
greater political stability is always good news for a democracy like Brazil. Markets have
reacted positively with Brazilian real exchange rates recovering nearly 20% from minimum
levels. Remember last month, we see BRL 5 and now it's like a 4.23-4.25, it's like we
gained some lateral movements for the last weeks.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, let's say that the markets have welcomed, I mean the new government in Brazil. We
are quite confident as well that the new government will help Brazil to enter this phase of
economic recovery and they will adopt measures and reforms that we consider necessary
to recover the stability that Brazil needs for its long-term growth.
But we are quite happy. I mean it's like there are three situations. I mean, the new
agreement with Banco do Brasil, political social stability and macro figures the three things
are good factors to improve and to grow our operations in Brazil.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you. There is one also on Brazil. Considering the restructuring costs booked in
Brazil, the new measures and higher acquisition expenses to pay to Banco do Brasil, could
we consider that the actual price for the operation is not €490 million but it could be
higher? Were all these charges already included in negotiation talks and already
discounted from the final price? Does your10% ROI target for the operation include all
these charges?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Silvia. I mean, value of the business consideration has been discussed
for many, many months since we announced these transactions. I mean, frankly this is an
acquisition that is being made not from scratch. MAPFRE has managed this company –
both companies for almost seven years and we know very, very well the business, both
the strengths and the weaknesses, and both were taken into consideration when we
valued the business and the transaction.

FINAL

What I mean is that the value we announced at the origin of the transaction was a fair
estimation, was a market valuation and we consider that it is absolutely valid at this
moment. And also I would like to reaffirm that when we made the targets we knew the
situation of the company. We are quite confident with the three-year targets that we
announced. There are no changes. We reaffirm the targets for the three-year period that
we announced some months ago that I don't mind to repeat it: Combined ratio below
96% in Non-Life and below 100% in Motor.
If you eliminate the effect of those adjustments in Motor line, you will get underlying
combined ratio for automobile lower than the numbers published, and you see that the
reduction in combined ratio is quite achievable.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Regarding Brazil, we have seen adjustments to reserves every
quarter since you announced the deal. What is the reason for these adjustments?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. First of all I mean, again a general comment. We have to put this
adjustment to reserves in the proper context. MAPFRE has been extremely prudent on
balance sheet devaluation. This is part of the tradition, our conservative view and our
DNA. And we have seen when we booked a special reserve for the Baremo
implementation in Spain and also when we increase our mathematical provisions in some
countries in Latin America in order to mitigate perhaps future increases in yields. And
regarding particularly Brazil, these adjustments are a result over the valuation process,
that we studied at the beginning of this year and they're quite normal in this sort of
transactions.
And what we're trying is to apply the more conservative and prudent valuation basis in the
companies. The review has been a gradual process and some of these adjustments were
booked in the first quarter, some in the second quarter and other minor adjustments
were booked in the third quarter and but let's say as I mentioned during my presentation,
the analysis, the final analysis was made at the third quarter and we shouldn't expect any
relevant deviation from those estimates during fourth quarter or next year. And that's all
from my side.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Now we have more questions from Brazil. And this comes from Paz
Ojeda from Banco Sabadell. Day one in Brazil from 1st January 2019, could you elaborate
please? Does it mean day one in order to start executing restructuring and clean up
portfolio measures or day one to start bearing the fruits of the balance sheet clean up
made in 2018 so far?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

No. It means, day one, means that in January, we will have a proper organizational, a new
organizational chart, a new business model ready to be implemented. And also, through

Page 12 of 16

2019, we expect to see the fruits of some of the restructuring and cleaning up the
portfolio.

FINAL

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Now the next set of questions are regarding the reinsurance
business. Farquhar Murray at Autonomous has sent us the following questions. Is there any
risk of adverse loss development emerging on Hurricane Maria in the future? And what
are the reinsurance covers remaining against this? Also, Paco Riquel would like an
indication of the NatCat losses expected in the fourth quarter for the reinsurance
business.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

First of all, let me emphasize again the strength of our reinsurance protection, cat
reinsurance protection which is supported by top quality contract parties. And regarding
the covers remaining in Maria, for Hurricane Maria, we still have a significant and I will
repeat significant excess reinsurance capacity to cover any further potential deviation.

Bloomberg Transcript

And the net retained losses are not expected to change. And you see, it was quite a small
increase during the second quarter in our net loss and there has been a small release in
the third quarter. But also I would like to highlight as well, the MAPFRE's capacity to assess
five cat events like those that happened last year, and being one of the first insurers to
come out to the market with an estimate and quite a small variation from the initial
estimate to the final loss.
Also as we discussed in previous presentations, there has been a small increase in claims
in Puerto Rico but it wouldn't affect our net retention. And in summary, practically in Puerto
Rico, 95% of the claims have been settled and also another line of business that was a
little bit controversial, we have a low exposure to business interruption coverage.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Regarding the question from Paco Riquel, would you like to give us an indication of the
NatCat losses expected in the fourth quarter of this year from the reinsurance business?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Paco (00:53:02). Nobody knows what is going to happen in cat
exposure. But so far and we have disclosed this information in the management
discussion analysis in the caption of subsequent events, there has been another cat event
in Japan, Hurricane Trami and we disclosed that the impact is much smaller than the
Typhoon Jebi. Also Hurricane Michael that affected the U.S., the effect on our U.S.
operation is practically negligible. So, and other runoff of third quarter catastrophes, I
mean it's too early to say, but we shouldn't expect any relevant deviation from our current
or from our preliminary estimate of Typhoon Jebi in MAPFRE RE.

Thank you. Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America Merrill Lynch asks, can you please give us
an estimate for your losses from Hurricane Michael as your peers have done?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

FINAL

As I already mentioned is practically negligible.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Now, we are moving to MAPFRE USA. Paco Riquel from Alantra asks, can
you update on the restructuring plan in the U.S. and what states will you be looking to exit?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Paco. Our exit plan has been executed in line with expectations. I will say
that probably it was in quite short period. We expected to be quite long at the beginning,
but in the end we finished before schedule. And we're looking at strong improvement in
the non-Northeast region with a strong reduction in losses under €15 million compared to
€18 million last September and over three points in the combined ratio.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you know the final closing for the transaction in New York and New Jersey is expected
at year-end and we don't expect any major impact from now until then, I mean it's an
ongoing business but we must keep in mind that the New Jersey and also New York
businesses will remain on our balance sheet until then. Our best estimation is that we
expect to complete both transactions by year-end.
Regarding other states, there have been a few relevant states that have reported profits
over the last few months including California. I would like to mention that the California
combined ratio was approximately 113% if I am not wrong, with a reduction of almost 10
points in two years.
So we're quite happy with California, that it will be a key state for future development. On
the other hand, Florida is still underperforming, I mean it's a more complicated state. In
California, we are operating only in personal lines while in Florida we have homeowners
and also auto commercial lines which is more difficult. Tariffs are more challenging as well
and CAT reinsurance coverage costs are affecting as well our Florida exposure.
Regarding VERTI, the business plan and initial launch have both been conservative. VERTI
will play two different roles, quite similar to Spain, it will be a business unit, but it will be as
well as sort of business laboratory for MAPFRE and for instance technology, the new
insurance software we implemented in VERTI will help us to have a more efficient
technology platform probably in the future in the traditional business in the U.S. So we
have to look at VERTI with both views, I mean business unit and also the innovation of this
business insurance laboratory for MAPFRE.
Regarding further exits, we're constantly analyzing all the states, profitability in all markets,
and what we have seen is that we have enough flexibility to reduce exposures or to exit
other states, if necessary. But so far, and we are happy with the first wave of reduction of
Page 14 of 16

states. And I don't see any further reduction in the short term. Again, for us 2019 will be
the turning point, day one for Mapfre USA.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay, thank you very much Fernando. This is the last question. There are no more
questions, so the last one is from Paz Ojeda, Banco Sabadell. She asks net profit above
€700 million implies close to €180 million of recurrent net profit in Q4 adjusted for
inflationary impact in Argentina. This seems to be quite challenging taking into account the
current pace and the usual claim seasonality of this quarter. How confident are you on
reaching this level on what could be the driver supporting this level?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Paz. As I mentioned before, we're happy with the results we've seen even in a
very complex environment. We have to look at MAPFRE's capabilities and to look at the
good performance of MAPFRE Iberia, MAPFRE RE, LATAM North and LATAM South as well,
in order to have a proper projection for fourth quarter. And also MAPFRE's flexibility in
realizing gains in both the financial instruments and also real estate.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you know the third quarter was extremely difficult for market, for both, the bond
markets and also the stock market, but this flexibility allows us to sell a couple of units and
there are more units in the pipeline. This is part of the rotation, the schedule of unit
rotations and we will be able to come back to the normal pace of realizing capital gains.
We are confident to retain this level. We said €700 million it's because we're quite
confident that we can reach this, if not, we wouldn't have given this guidance. We did
mention that this target depends on our ordinary NatCat loss experience and so far only
Typhoon Trami was a relevant one, during the fourth quarter. But if we have a standard
loss experience for the fourth quarter, we're pretty sure, I'm pretty sure that's why we
have given this guidance and we will achieve €700 million even we said that we're trying
to improve, I mean last year's results – it means that we will achieve this number and also,
we will repeat dividend as we mentioned.

Thank you very much Fernando. And this is all from the side of the questions we have
received. So thank you very much to you all and thank you Fernando for your explanations.

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you for joining us today. We hope the information has been interesting. We'll
be back again next year when we release our full year results. And as we mention in every
presentation, there are plenty of financial information available both in CNMV and also our
web, which we expect to be of your interest. Thank you, and enjoy the long weekend.
Bye-bye.
