Thank you and welcome to Generali first half 2021 results conference call. I'm here with
our Group CEO and our Group CFO. Before opening the Q&A session, I would like to
kindly hand over to our Group CEO for some opening statement. Thank you very much.

Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Thank you, Giulia. Hello, everyone. Thank you to all of you for joining the call today. As you
saw this morning, we published our first half 2021 results, and these are very good results
in a very challenging environment. They are the proof that our current strategic plan
Generali 2021 was indeed and is still the right plan.

FINAL

I'm here today with our Group CFO, Christian Borean, and we look forward to taking your
questions over the next hour. But before then, let me quickly review some highlights from
the first six months of the year. First of all, we confirmed our strong business profitability.
Our operating result increased by over 10% from the first six months of 2020, arriving at
nearly EUR3 billion, while our net profit practically doubled reaching well over EUR1.5
billion.
Our life new business margin grew by 0.73 percentage points to 4.67% in the first half of
the year, and our new business value has been growing by almost 30%. On the P&C
business, our combined ratio stood at 89.7%, and aligning our technical excellence.
Our capital position was very solid, even considering the uncertain context with our
solvency ratio standing at 231%. We are continuing to work hard and with strong discipline
to complete Generali 2021, and to deliver on our targets that were announced nearly
three years ago, and that were confirmed in November last year. At the same time,
together with my team, we are defining our next strategic plan that we'll be presenting -that we will be presenting to the financial community on December 15, making a new
chapter of our Group's history.
So we look forward to illustrating this plan to you and in the meantime, now Cristiano and
myself are available to answer to your question. Thank you again.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Andrew Sinclair with Bank of America.
Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Thank you, and good afternoon everyone. Three from me as usual, if that's okay. Firstly, I
just wonder if you could give us any color on the cost of July, European floods and also
just some details around your reinsurance protections? That's question one.
Question two is just on asset management. I thought it was really impressive to keep
expenses flat for that level of revenue growth. But do you see any risk of an expense
catch-up? You're running really far in advance of your operating margin target. So just
really helpful to get some context on that. And thirdly was on unit-linked and great flows,
Page 2 of 21



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2021-08-03

but how much of that do you think it was just a catch-up from people who had been sitting
on their hands during COVID than putting some money to work or do you think you can
achieve similar flows in H2 and into 2022? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Hello, Andrew. So first of all, on the cost for the July European flood, the one more
concentrated in Germany. Please, I would like to remind you that the structure of our
reinsurance treaty for these kind of events do not allow retention for single event above
EUR100 million. So the net retention for the Group of such kind of events is EUR100
million. Clearly, then you have their installment premium as a normal reinsurance contract
one-day effect up. And so we are already above EUR100 million retention so it will be
EUR100 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

How our reinsurance protection works as a Group against all these kind of events related
to wind, wind chill, hail and all the like of NatCat this kind, we are protected up to EUR500
million impact as a maximum amount, but we can retain in the balance sheet some of
uncorrelated events because as you know, per single event, we do not retain more than
EUR100 million. So that would be the impact, the maximum impact modular, their
installment premium we can get. And this translated only without installment premiums
would be 2.4% of combined ratio maximum from those kind of events. We are already at
including this event of July summing the one-off end of June plus other happened, we are
at around EUR300 million NatCat impacting the balance sheet which is 1.5% as of the
year-end premium and the average over the last five years was 1.8%. This is for the first
question.
On the asset management performance, on the cost. You should not look at this figure of
45% as a basis to start the one, which is the ambition as we manage as a target is more
consistent to the expenses we will start doing in the second half of 2021 for the
distribution platform and 80 projects that are going to be implemented will be
progressively rolled out in order to increase our capacity to distribute. So you should not
look at this number, which is by the way also influenced by the performance fees effect
and more on what is the long-term including the expenses that we will do for the
distribution going forward, which is the one as a target.
And the third one on the unit performance. The growth, even if I compare it towards 2019,
which is the pre-COVID effect, it is endogenous and sustainable. It is not brought up by
external factor. It is really the strategy and I would mean that this is consistent to the
capacity of the Group to grow. I hand over to Philippe to further comment.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

This is a strategy that we started many, many years ago and we are very much in the
situation to manage the new business mix because of far strong proprietary distribution.
This makes the whole difference. Actually, our net inflow, which is a EUR6.3 billion after six
months, it's already very solid in volume, but it's even more solid in terms of quality,
because it's basically only protection in end unit-linked.

Page 3 of 21



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2021-08-03

Definitely, if we were less disciplined if we hadn't such a strong proprietary distribution,
we could have a higher net inflow but lower quality, and this is definitely not our choice.
Once again, the quality of our distribution makes the whole difference. So these numbers
regarding unit-linked are absolutely sustainable.

Next question, please.

Operator
Next question is from Peter Eliot with Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Three questions from me as well, please. The first one was on
investment income. I was just wondering, could you update us on your current
expectations on how investment income might develop from here both Life, Non-life
would be very helpful, please. And secondly, echo Andrew's comments on the asset
management, great numbers. I guess the only area where you're sort of slightly behind
target is the external clients and maybe that ties into your comment just now but I was just
wondering if -- how you think of that target at the current time and what's achievable?
And then finally, third one, wondering if you could just update us on what you're seeing in
Italian motors in particular in terms of sort of average premium trends -- pricing trends?
Thank you very much.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Hello, Peter. So investment income. Please let me profit to make an initial clarification
around this point because when you look at the investment income today, in the half year,
you are not seeing the full allocation of the investment potential of our books because of
the effect of the private equity, which we do report in the line holding another business,
but it is an asset class per se. It is a company that's why we report it as a company. But
then this pay dividend to the class share holder, which are the different insurance
companies among the Group.
So what you should consider as an investment income should also embed even if there is
a time shift between the allocation of result in the payment of the dividend of this extra
result, also this component. And please don't forget what I told you already many times.
But you should not consider the private equity as a one-off result. We are already, after
almost EUR7 billion allocation, harvesting at almost double-digit result on the investment.
Those money put at the service of both our shareholder and our policyholder. And this,
we will grow further for the normal increase of the real asset strategy we are deploying.
And this will support the investment income.

Page 4 of 21

FINAL

Having said that, the investment income will be affected by the natural dilution of the low
rate environment, and we are working and you see from our negative net collection in the
saving business, but we are trying also to re-steer the business towards protection unit
link, hence having less money to be reinvested. And in general, we are working on life, in
this direction as well in P&C, we are growing more. P&C, we are growing faster. So there
are more money to be invested.
If you look at this stake of money, less on life to be reinvested, more on P&C, we could
expect for the next year, a 10 to 15 bps yield dilution in the current income on average
book cost of our asset both life and P&C. Maybe skewed towards more the 10 in P&C
than in Life.
Asset Management. The target on the third-party client, as you know, I think that it is
difficult to achieve by year-end '21 as a percentage term. But I would like to emphasize
that in absolute numbers. So the numerator which was building out about 35, the current
level of the external [ph]use in that calculation was exactly coherent with the number of
the strategy, the numerator.

Bloomberg Transcript

Clearly the denominator increase more also because of the growth of the internal asset in
the evolution of the market, but for 2021 we don't think we can achieve it as a 35%
percent target. For the Italian motor average premium, what are the pricing trends? What
we observe is that so far we are observing in the motor TPL a 3.9% decrease in the
average premium collected which is sufficiently consistent with our strategy to at the
same time retain the client and grow as well with the fleet business.
As you know, we have a big agreement with the Fiat Chrysler Automobile in Italy, which is
doing extremely well also because of the MOD development which is growing extremely
fast. And by the way, I anticipate the question explained potentially also the increased
expense ratio you are observing because exactly the higher remuneration for the line
MOD we've seen within the motor.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

That's very clear. Thank you very much, Cristiano. Thank you.

A - Giulia Raffo

Next question, please.

Operator
The next question is from Farooq Hanif with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. Thanks very much. Just going back to Non-Life first. So I notice that you've
had an increase in reserve release, but it's still lower than what we've seen since 2016. So

Page 5 of 21



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2021-08-03

is there still some element of conservatism in this given the still low frequency that you're
experiencing?

FINAL

Secondly, can you talk a little bit about the capital implications of the Cattolica acquisition?
So, for example, what diversification benefits could actually help your capital position if
this deal went ahead to all the tender offer?
And then finally, could you also comment on given your capital position is very, very
strong, your leverage ratios have come down to good levels, going forward in your
strategic plan, what's the likelihood that you could move to a strategy of inorganic growth
versus buybacks to help -- yes. So a bit more formal kind of policy on buybacks versus
inorganic growth to help sort of use that sort of as capital? Thank you.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Farooq. So the first question in P&C. On the prior year, you have seen an
increase of 0.8% compared to the first half last year, but I would like to recall you that if I
look the reserve adequacy, so the excess of reserving above the best estimate we do on
the Solvency II view, it is broadly unchanged, which is explained by the fact that steel in the
first six months we observed a frequency, which is lower than the pre-COVID period in
almost all the geographies, and only in the month of June, we started to observe
frequency trending to the level of the 2019, so the pre-COVID one. For example, a
country which is still below is Germany where you see a positive benefit.
So my message is basically unchanged reserve adequacy. There is an increase in the prior
year because maybe you remember last year, I gave extreme prudence in the prior year
allocation due to the uncertainty of the evolution and the prudency in the reserving.
Second point related to the Cattolica acquisition. We stated something in the order of 8
percentage points, almost 8 percentage points of solvency percentage point reduction
from the diversification benefit, you would have an increase of the P&C contribution which
diversifies well away because as you know, the sources of profit in Italy are skewed
towards Life versus P&C, which is helping. Anyhow, you will have a counter element which
will come from the presence of the BTP which is present in the portfolio which so far is our
largest sensitivity risk which is counterbalancing the benefit. But from the cash flow
standpoint, and from the initial diversification within the line, we have a very positive
diversification from the P&C.
I hand over to Philippe regarding the inorganic versus buyback.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

So yes. Even after Cattolica, our capital position will remain very strong. We, as you know,
we don't have the opposition of M&A at any cost. We have been very disciplined in the
past years with M&A I remember that I told many of you a few years ago that the kind of
M&A we would prefer were small and medium M&A because I like the buildup strategy,
which is a safe one. It creates lower execution risks. We are very good at integrating the
company we buy. This is what we did successfully in Portugal. This is what we are doing
Page 6 of 21

FINAL

successfully in Greece. This is what we will do successfully in Malaysia and with the others
acquisition we made in Central and Eastern Europe.
We have another five months to go before the end of the plan, because the plan is
ending on December 31st at midnight. So we will stick to our strategy. We will stick to our
financial discipline. Our pipeline is not empty. So we are looking at interesting
opportunities, but we will remain very disciplined, very selective. What matters to us is to
create value for shareholders. If we believe that the many opportunities we are looking at
are the best one to create value for shareholders, we will go for it. If not, we will find a
better use for the excess capital.

The next question is from William Hawkins with KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hello, gentlemen. Thank you very much. First question, please. Cristiano, I fully understand
the concept of what you said about the private equity. Could you just help me clarify the
numbers, please, about what was the impact of private equity on the first half other
operating results, and what was the first half and second half figures last year? I get the
point but I'm just not quite clear on the numbers.
And then secondly, please. For the investment results, obviously the difficulty we've got is
that there are, in the first half of this year, offsetting factors. You've got lower yields but
then the markets have been better, so your investment result has actually gone up even
though we're talking about the yield compression.
And so I just wondered, again given that you're also re-risking the portfolio. And I'm not
sure how much of the Life business versus Non-life benefits from that. The short question
is you've got Slide 13 showing your investment result was EUR800 million in the first half
of this year. Can I just double that to get to the full year and then what am I assuming
about next year? Is it fading? Could it be going up because you're re-risking or do I keep it
flat?
And then the last question, please. And again, I'm sorry if this is disclosed somewhere but
in Slide 30 when you show the roll forward of your Solvency II ratio, given that you've been
raising debt on the rest of it, can you just remind me how the 47.7 breaks down by tier?
Please.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Yes, William. So, first point, numbers. Half year 2020 operating result contribution from
private equity EUR90 million. I recall you again these numbers then are paid as dividend

Page 7 of 21



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2021-08-03

on the investment portfolio. Half Year 2021, EUR300 million. Year-end 2020, EUR260
million operating results contribution from private equity. So this is the comparison.

FINAL

Going forward, as I told you, you should expect this kind of contribution trending as I told
you at almost double double-digit percentage contribution on the investment we have.
So, I hope I gave you the clarity on these first two free figures.
On the investment result, point taken on the lower yield versus the re-risking of the
portfolio. How much is Life? We increased our equity position both in Life and in Non-life.
Also thanks to a progressive increase of our private equity, and we are increased also the
private debt. This is more related to the capacity of finding the investments. So the speed
is more related on that and the willingness to get. So we are working towards the target.
I can think about the half year 2021 Life result should it be doubled. I think we are broadly
in line with this trend. For 2022, this will be also related to the capacity of the portfolio. On
one side, to start growing on the sizes because you have basically 3% increase of the
technical reserve year-on-year and the structure goes in that direction. So we are working
exactly, thanks to the re-risking, to use some points of solvency to pull up the investment
result and reduce the speed of the dilution.

Bloomberg Transcript

So let's make it pictorial, the battle is exactly pulling up, thanks to the real asset strategy
and is more re-risking the downward trend because the natural coupon of the maturing
bonds is closer on the 3% side than the reinvesting amount which is closer to the 1.3, 1.5.
Going to your last question on Solvency II, the breakdown of the 47.7 tiering is we have -for your information, since you were mentioning that we issued a subordinated debt, I
would like to recall you but since we treat these EUR500 million issued in the last week of
June as a refinancing or prefinancing of the 22 maturing, these are not included in the
own funds. We do not double count, let's say, at least in Generali, we do not double count
the pre-financing. So it is excluded from the tiering you see. So Tier 1 the 47.7 are in
EUR41.6 billion of Tier 1, of which 2.1 restricted EUR6 billion of Tier 2 and EUR0.2 billion of
different. This is the tiering of the EUR47.7 billion.

FINAL

Fantastic. Thank you so much. Just really easy questions and the first one is, I think you
mentioned in an interview on Bloomberg EUR800 million to EUR900 million kind of
budget left to do deals. And I just wondered is this after Cattolica or before Cattolica? I
mean how should I...
The second is on cash. Can you remind us with the figure of cash at the holding was at the
year-end and maybe tell us what it is now and what you expect it to -- where you expect it
to go?
And then on the the final question, and this, you're probably going to say this is
completely out of line, but is it right, you said at the Investor Day, so as you said almost
three years ago that there might be possibility or you against buy backs, et cetera, but is
it fair to assume that if you do a buyback you effectively change the structure of your
shareholders because some will accept buyback, some will not. And so those who do not
take the buyback effectively become more concentrated and gain a bigger voice and
that's where you would lose your independence? Thank you.

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

Michael, excuse me, can I ask you please to repeat your last question, as your line was
particularly troubled. So we --

Oh sorry. Yeah, yeah, sorry,

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

Yes. Yes, much better. Thank you.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

So, sorry about that. Yes. So it was a cheeky question, asking if the decision or the kind of
trend we've seen to do more deals than buybacks. Is the thinking behind it that if you do a
buyback, you would change the structure of your shareholders to the extent that some
would accept a buyback, some would not. And therefore, those who do not accept the
buyback would gain a bigger, bigger say in the company, and in that way you would kind
of, in a creeping way, lose your independence? Creeping not in negative way, what I
mean is kind of diluted way. There we go.

So, hello, Michael. On the first one, the EUR800 million, EUR900 million left for M&A is
after Cattolica and even after Malaysia. Cristiano will answer the second one. On the third
one, frankly speaking, we look at the value creation for all shareholders, and this is only
what matters, we do not entertain any other kind of consideration.

FINAL

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Thank you, Thanks.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Hi, Michael, to update you. So I would like to recall you that we issued, as I was mentioning
before with William, the pre-financing refinancing EUR500 million which is piling up
EUR500 million more, but I do not consider them as available because they are in a
certain sense already booked for the payment of next year of the subordinated maturing.
There are also the EUR720 million for the second tranche of the dividend. And there are
the money which are already there to cover the Cattolica deal, the Malaysia deal and
being left with EUR800 million to EUR900 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm not playing, I'm letting you adding pieces, and then you add the buffer of EUR1 billion,
the liquidity buffer, which we always keep. And this is the, let's say, cash you should
consider at the (inaudible). On top of that we have normal treasury cash, which is nonstable and you should not consider as an element for our strategy. It's just an optimization
of the internal uses of the resources. So you should start from those elements, which are
the one which count.
One thing I would like to add, I think it is worth to be aware of. But we completed 96% of
our 2021 remittance, and so basically we are almost there. We will do in the last quarter,
the last piece which is missing, and again as I gave you the guidance was 3 to 3.1
remittance received, and we are well on track to achieve the target. And don't recall but
going forward after dividend I also always say that there is an excess cash generation of
the order of EUR800 million per year.

Q - Michael Huttner

The next question is from Steven Haywood with HSBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Obviously, I've seen that you've taken the expected October
dividend payment out of shareholders' equity as obviously has been approved by the

Page 10 of 21



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity

shareholders. Does this show or does this imply that you are extremely confident in
paying this in the fourth quarter of this year?

FINAL

And the second question from me is on the solvency ratio. Just looking at the roll forward
in the first half, there is a negative 3 percentage points non-economic variance. Could you
provide some color around this? Sorry if I missed it in the disclosure.
And then thirdly from me on the P&C top-line premium growth. You say it's up about 9%
in the second quarter. Can you go into more detail about what lines, what countries,
whether Cattolica had an impact, the rebound from COVID and any impacts on pricing as
well? That would be very helpful. Thank you.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Hello, Steven. On the first one I confirm that so far, we are very confident that we will pay
as expected the second tranche of the 2019 dividends of the $0.46 per share because
the ECB has removed the ban on capital repatriation and dividend payment for banks
because the ESRB restriction is supposed to end by the end of September and the
regulators, particularly Italian regulators, have indicated they are quite confident that there
will be no reason to renew these ESRB restrictions. So, definitely we have tangible
reasons to be confident that we will finally pay this second tranche by October as decided
by the shareholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Stephen, if I can add from the accounting point of view, it is put at the debt because the
condition for the IAS 32 are met according to the accounting rule.
Second question on solvency around for other non-economic variances are mainly
explained by ACR impact of the re-risking for the vast majority and a small minor part of
non-recurring holding expenses. So clearly it is the re-risking of the portfolio which has
been put the different in the roll forward compared to what I've seen was the average
estimation made on the market.
On the P&C top-line premium growth. What are the second-quarter effect? You should
think about the second quarter 2020 was also a specific quarter because it was the most
impacted quarter for the COVID premium. I would like to stress that there is a very
healthy growth in the second quarter from our global corporate and commercial business
which, as you know, accounts for slightly more than 10% of the total premium, so which
grew 11%. The rest of the portfolio grew 8.9%.
Don't forget that there is also a growth stemming from the accepted premium where we
increased some accepted business. Thanks to our also strategy of underwriting. And in
general, there is a very healthy growth in Italy where premium are growing on the single
quarter-over-quarter 9.3%. In France, 11.4%. In Germany, 4.4% quarter-over-quarter. And
also, (inaudible) 7.7%. These are the four largest and the international area is growing also
10%. So it's quite a healthy growth we are observing in the quarter. But please take into

FINAL

account the fact that the second quarter 2020 was heavily impacted also due to the
COVID.
So 4.9% is more an expression of the potential. Regarding the impact from Cattolica,
there is some accepted reinsurance from Cattolica some tens of millions of euros which
are accounted in the Italian P&C premiums accepted which I was mentioning before our
reinsurance acceptation -- acceptance. And there is nothing else because as you know,
Cattolica is not consolidated because of the actual shareholding of 24.46 is an equity
method accounting where their premium do not affect our premium. The only premium
impact is in the reinsurance we accept from them.
Hope I gave you the picture.

Our next question is from Colm Kelly with UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Colm Kelly

{BIO 19140684 <GO>}

Thanks a lot. Two from me. The first on just on in-force action. So the business mix shift
has been very clear and consistent across the group. If we look at the capital life reserve
mix, it's at just shy of 65%, clearly a key reason for that mix shift to free up capital and
reallocate to higher returning businesses, but do you expect to take any actions to
accelerate the release of capital from those capital intensive businesses to accelerate
that mix shift further or given your strong excess capital position right now, are in-force
actions not seen as necessary or desirable from a timing perspective? That's the first
question.
The second question is just around capital allocation. You've done a great job in the last
few years. That's kind of keeping risk capital flat that you allocate in the business but
increasing the return you'll generate on that capital. Now with a solvency ratio at 231, you
clearly have a lot of scope to increase the amount of risk capital you deploy to accelerate
growth even further. Now the challenge we and I have is it's very hard to assess the
added growth potential that that excess capital brings in the future because a lot of the
talk has been around M&A and it's hard for us to analyze businesses you don't own yet.
And equally that emphasis on M&A, but less market focus on the opportunities you have
to allocate capital within your own existing business to accelerate growth beyond what
has been delivered today. So if we can shift the focus of capital allocation away from
buybacks and M&A and put it onto the existing group, can you articulate somewhat --

FINAL

specifically those businesses and geographies that can easily absorb the reinvestment of
more capital today, such that doing so would tangibly increase the growth rate those
businesses can generate? I know you're growing in P&C, health protection unit-linked, but
it's not clear and obvious of allocating more capital can enable you to grow share in those
markets or if they're already operating at capacity in terms of the capital that is deployed.
So that's question two. I would appreciate it if you can give some color there.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Thank you. I'll take the first one. First of all, we are acting as the leading group in the life
insurance business in Europe. So I think that we deeply understand this business probably
more than anyone. We were the early -- the first movers when shifting the business from
traditional savings to hybrid products unit-linked and capital-light products. This is for the
new business. I think that we were also the first mover in the in-force management when
we decided three or four years ago to sell EUR43 billion back book in Germany Generali
Leben. So definitely we know how to manage both the new business and both the back
book. And definitely, we are going to continue doing this.

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean, you've seen the numbers for the new business in the first half of the year, they
are very good. And we are obviously still working on the in-force management, we've
been making very granular analysis of all our life insurance portfolio. This has been done,
and definitely we will take decision, capital management decision, business decision,
financial decision when it will be the right timing. So this will definitely be part of our next
R&D expense. So we've been doing the biggest, and maybe it's a paradox, the easiest
part with Generali Leben because it was a big transaction of in-force management.
Now we have a smaller portfolio to deal with, and there are plenty of solution to free up
capital. We can use reinsurance. We can use run-off. We can sell portfolio or parts of
portfolio. We have plenty of solution. The analysis is done. We are ready to take the
appropriate decision.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

So Colm, I started the question on the capital allocation. You absolutely highlighted
correctly, but there is room for managing our solvency ratio in order to increase the
return, which is partially what we started to do when we were explaining before the rerisking. When we do this, we need to take into account two factors. Part of our allocation is
a tangible one where we can cover it with direct investment. Other is related to our future
value of what we have enforced.
And in general, increasing the expected future value is the classical re-risking example you
can extract as we did. Managing these two layer is exactly the, let's say, the optimal
between deciding where to grow and how to use the non-tangible component or the
valuing force at best to produce higher result. This is exactly what we were thinking of
doing in Life. For example, after having reduced the balance sheet risk from the point of
view, also the P&L last year reducing 40% of the equity impairment risk at Group level in
which you've seen this year, we have the room and the firepower both from the capital
side and the P&L side to manage this kind of capital allocation.

FINAL

Where we are allocating, we are growing. We are going (inaudible) exactly to diversify. We
are growing in protection and this growth is supported by our capacity to diversify out,
we've seen our capital contribution. Not only the growth stemming from internal
investment was also exogenous capital reallocation were done exactly in line, which are
differentiating the capital absorption because our preferred strategic line.
I make you a couple of example regarding the fact that it is not necessary to allocate
capital only for external growth but also for internal growth in the business. Three kind of
examples. The first one we started many years ago and we are progressively enlarging in
our units of the Group. But in France, we started for example to hedge the unit-linked
annual management fees in order to free up capital absorption, stabilize on fund volatility
and allow freeing up room to grow in this line without absorbing capital even though unitlinked itself self financing, but it is allocating some solvency capital requirement and hence
is supporting the capacity in a low rate environment for the saving business to support
growth in unit-linked without having an increase in the capital intensity of the business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second example, we created an internal reinsurance structure exactly to re-insure the
reserving risk in our P&C business which is quite heavy and intensive and is blocking in
some companies if you want to manage their remittance in the trade-off between growth
and the end result is has to be managed and we did internal re-insurance hub exactly to
optimize the capacity to grow and you've seen the countries which are growing also in PC
without being blocked and allowing us to manage our remittance.
So for us, there are a couple of big principle like the fact that optionality has a value as
well as flexibility. And so this is how we are managing going forward. The capital allocation
also in the -- our far East Asian business, think about China, we are not paying out one
hundred percent of our result because we are growing -- fast growing business where the
return on equity is higher than the return on equity of the Group. So this is the logic where
we are trying to push at the same time return on equity and reduce the capital intensity of
the business to free up growth capacity.

Q - Andrea Lisi

{BIO 20482284 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. First question is back on the private equity results. I understood that
there are no one-off component, but if you can just provide us more indication about
that? This is an idea of this business, and so what we should expect for the rest of the
year?
Page 14 of 21



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2021-08-03

And the second question is on the frequency in the P&C, in particular in the motor
business. You said that starting from June, you are observing trending -- frequency
trending into 2019 level sort of pre-COVID levels. So what are your expectation from here
to the end of the year?

FINAL

And my last question is if you can come back on the impact of flows in July that was not
really clear to me and the impact of reinsurance. Thank you.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Yes, Andrea. So I start with the first question. The private equity. It's not a business, it's an
asset class. I stress it again because we reported as other but then flows back into the
investment portfolio. So it's really an asset class strategy. So when I said that there is no
one-off, it is clear that private equity is per se a business when you realize the investment
value and you exit -- you realize the exit. But it is not one-off in the sense that we will have
-- we've seen our amount invested a certain regularity of within the classical J curve
approach of this kind of result achieved currently with the investment profile of our
liabilities.

Bloomberg Transcript

So expecting going forward, as I told you, I confirm that we are expecting a growing
contribution of this line, but again this is an asset class, which is a growing contribution to
the investment result, the relative weight of the private equity, we see in our investment
result in both Life, and P&C will increase coherently with the strategy. And this will increase
a little bit faster than what we were expecting in the previous plan. So clearly this is a
good proof of the quality of the business.
Regarding motor business. Frequency trend. Fair point to say that we have observed
positive effect compared to 2019 in the first half of the year, still few hundreds of million
euro less claims than what we had in first half 2019, and few hundred million euro more
than what we had in 2020 because it was a lower frequency environment compared to
now.
Going forward, we see a convergence country-by-country towards the pre-COVID level
with slightly below convergence to the pre-COVID level, still not at that level. We see this
trending faster in countries like France or Italy. And but still below the pre-COVID level and
still below, a little bit more below in Germany. And so we are observing the progressive
evolution. Going forward, we do think that this will let's say asymptotically go as slightly
below and that will be compensated by the slightly higher claim cost we are observing as
a net effect.
The impact on flood in the reinsurance. I stress it back, I think the question was related to
the July events, not the first half. The July event mainly affecting Germany but not only
Germany, is affecting as well other countries like Switzerland, France, Austria and Central
Eastern Europe, is per se already accounting for a total damage above EUR100 million. For
the non-Italian business, we have EUR100 million maximum retention of such kind of
natural catastrophe which does mean that if the damage is larger than EUR100 million for
us, we transfer the amount in excess of EUR100 million of the damage to our reinsurer,
the one which are part of the reinsurance treaty.
Page 15 of 21



FINAL

Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity

And this acts in a way that once this is closely accounted, you transfer it, and when you do
it you pay a reinstalment premium, which is normally in the usual reinsurance contract. So
you will see lower impact in the claims, and an amount of premium paid to the insurance
to reinstall the coverage after the event happened. This is how it works. And for the
Group, I recall you we have a maximum retention on some different uncorrelated events
up to EUR500 million on a yearly basis. So the impact from Nat Cat the one I described
like flood, wind, hail and the like cannot exceed the EUR500 million retention for the
Group and would mean five different uncorrelated events.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Thank you very, very much. And on private equity and I'm sorry to go [ph]uninvited. The -you said $7 billion. Can you say where it is, is it I looked at the equity pie charts and I just
wondered which of the buckets it's included in. And then maybe you can give an indication
of how much more this bucket will grow?
And then the other points related to that. So compared to consensus, I know this is not
your numbers, but still the consolidation line was bigger than reported and I'm just
wondering if that's effectively what we're seeing is the offset to the private equity
dividends.
And then my final question is, can you say something about the Cattolica contribution
year-to-date or I suppose quarter, I don't know. Thank you.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Yes. So, Michael. Where is the private equity is in the line so called alternative, okay? So
that you can find it in the -- I don't remember the page of the presentation expose. Okay.
They consolidate -- the consensus, the consolidation adjustment you correctly pointed out
is linked mainly for a very large part explained by the private equity dividends we are
paying for the mechanism I was mentioning before.

FINAL

Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA

We account the result in the private equity company called lion River. We pay to the
shareholder of the different equity shares of Lion River which are the investment portfolio
of our Life and P&C company and once this is paid, it is consolidated out because clearly it
has already been accounted as a result. So yes, the more the private equity business
increases, the higher will be the consolidation adjustment after having paid the dividend
to the other since you cannot account to twice the same result. What matters to me is
when I gave you the number of the private equity contribution, this is the number affecting
the operating result.
That's why if I have to comment as a CFO, when I look at the combination of the
investment portfolio in general at this half year, I do not see any special one-off effect
because this is nothing that the growing contribution of the private equity and in general
of the business flowing through the balance sheet. Hope I gave you, Michael, clarity on
this point.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

And you said the EUR7 billion. How much can this grow to?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

We are progressively increasing the amount with an asset allocation we should grow, and I
think we can get to few billions more, but clearly the capacity to deploy also depend on
the market. It is a really positive momentum for the private equity market, the 2021, but
clearly the capacity to deploy is also there. But you should expect a growing contribution
thanks to the growing amount of reserve and increased interest in the private equity
asset class.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Thank you. And on Cattolica?

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

The next question is a follow-up from Steven Haywood with HSBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Thank you again. On your Life new business margins particularly in the protection and the
unit-linked businesses, they are developing very well. And do you see any further room
for the new business margins to increase in the protection and unit-linked businesses?
And I suppose the overall Group's Life new business margin should continue to increase
going forward as your savings products reduce as a proportion of the total new business
sales. So in general, the direction of new business margin is positive over the next few
years?
And the second question, I saw a comment about the slate of candidates for the Board
renew in 2022. Can you give any -- I just wanted to make sure this is part of the normal
process and if -- any other comment?

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Hi, Steven. So Life new business margin. Yes, it is going well. What you should look for, we
will try to look for dimension growth. You have seen that we are growing fast in the unitlinked, and we are growing fast in protection and at that level of profitability what is -what matters is the volume, because that level of profitability is extremely good so we do
not want to jeopardize the net effect of the combination between volume and

Page 18 of 21



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2021-08-03

FINAL

profitability, which is the new business value contribution coming from unit-linked and
protection.
Yes, for sure. There will be further reduction of, let's say, capital absorption from the
saving business, because more and more we are selling, even when we sell the saving
business or the hybrid, but within the (inaudible) product, we sell with lower guarantees or
with no guarantees. For example, in Italy, already almost two-third of the production is
sold without any formal guarantee with no death benefit, which is really good from the
capital consumption point of view. So that would help in counterbalancing a low rate
environment, but I think you should more focus on the growth of new business value than
in the growth of new business margin because what matters now is the growth at this
level of profitability.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

On the second question, there is not that much to say at this stage except that yesterday

Q - Rotger Franz

{BIO 15872041 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. Just coming back to the flood losses in
Europe of the last month. You've given us a good indication about your net retention and
your reinsurance coverage. Can you give us a better indication of your estimated -preliminary estimate of a gross loss from Brent in Germany, Belgium, France and the
Netherlands? Or is there some market loss estimates around what is the -- could you give
us some more precise indication of your market share in the affected areas?
And also do you expect any significant additional demand surge due to COVID for
example because the shortages of building materials and so on? Thank you.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Yes. So what is important, I recall you regarding the flood, in Europe that the German one
you were referring since we have a net retention of EUR100 million, this is what will be the
impact for the Group. There are some areas still not accessible or where the claims
adjusted or the people which has to estimate the value of the damage still did not at the

FINAL

final view, so still numbers can flow up from the gross impact, but what I can tell you is
already the amount is above EUR100 million, hence this will be the stopping line for us and
the rest will be transfer. As a market share, Generali is almost 5% of market share in P&C
in Germany and I think this is sufficiently consistent to what you said. I recall you that we do
not have operation in Belgium since we sold the Belgium operation a few years ago, and
neither in Belgium nor in the Netherlands.
Further losses due to COVID, I recall maybe it was already mentioned in the press
release. There are EUR62 million impact from mortality morbidity effect related to Life
technical result in half year 2021 due to COVID. Could we have some further losses?
There could be some expectation of further negative development especially in the
countries which has been mostly affected and we're, fortunately for the business,
unfortunately for the people, we have a lower market share like Brazil or India and we can
expect a slightly further impact, but from the point of view or the number what has been
called so far was the large amount.

Q - Rotger Franz

{BIO 15872041 <GO>}

So just to clarify. My question regarding COVID losses was referring to additional demand
surge in the areas affected by floods?

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Sorry, Rotger, I didn't understand the question.

Q - Rotger Franz

Well do you expect any additional demand surge or claims inflation due to COVID induced
shortages, for example building materials and so on in the flood affected areas?

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Sorry. Now, I got it. No. So far, we are not expecting this. I think we are also in a situation
where in Germany, there is a huge also political focus on what happened and we are in a
period of elections. So I think there will be a strong monitoring from the authorities and in
general, the business development is not giving us those indications.
