Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks Keith. Good morning and thank you for joining today's call. I'll open the call with an
overview of our second quarter performance. Bob will then cover our financial results, and
finally I'll come back on to the call to speak about our segments and take your questions.
We released our second quarter earnings last night and I'm pleased to report that we had
a strong quarter. We reported annualized return on average common equity of 29%, and
annualized operating return on average common equity of 16.7%. We grew our book value
per share by 7.3% and tangible book value per common share plus accumulated dividends
by 8.2%. These increases to book value represent absolute quarter-to-quarter changes
and are not annualized. The strong results this quarter were driven by higher net earned
premiums as a result of growth across all business lines. A low level of catastrophe
activity, underwriting income from both our segments, the inclusion of the TMR portfolio
and increased net investment income.
I am pleased with the growth and profitability that we achieved, both in the second
quarter and overall this year, as our differentiated strategy has allowed us to grow
selectively into an improving market. Looking forward, I'm optimistic about the market and
about the sustainability of rate increases.
In the Casualty business, we saw positive momentum on underlying rates across multiple
lines of business and continued our strong engagement with clients and brokers. In our
Property business, we experienced strong midyear renewals. We were strategically
positioned to profit from rising rates and were able to deploy more capacity at better
pricing and preferential terms. I will discuss the renewals and sustainability rates in more
detail when I address our segments, but I'm confident that we constructed an attractive
portfolio, that will benefit us and our shareholders over the long term.
Moving to TMR; this was the first full quarter since our acquisition closed and the
integration of our people and portfolio is progressing extremely well. Bob will provide you
more with details. But from my perspective, having gone through our first major renewal
as a combined entity, we are now one company, speaking with one voice, operating one
unified underwriting system with a single view of risk and executing a consistent strategy.
We have increased our flexibility by adding new locations in Zurich and Sydney, and new

balance sheet in Switzerland called RenRe Europe. All of the TMR business is captured in
rents and represents our view of risk.

FINAL

We have been able to retain the business that we find attractive, which we expect to
continue, and by leveraging our integrated system, we're renewing it on the most
efficient balance sheets. In short, I couldn't be happier about how the TMR integration is
progressing, or more confident about its contribution to long-term shareholder value.
I'll update you at the end of the call on the recent midyear renewals, as well as
opportunities that we're seeing in 2019. But first, I'll turn it over to Bob for a look at our
financials. Bob?

Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Thanks Kevin and good morning everyone. We had a strong second quarter and today, I
would like to highlight a few of our key financial results. But first, I would like to update you
on the TMR integration and finally, I'll turn it back over to Kevin.

Bloomberg Transcript

So starting with TMR, we continue to make good progress on the TMR integration. Among
other important successes, we executed smoothly on the recent June 1st renewal as a
consolidated entity; advanced the process of vendor consolidation, completed the rebranding of the TMR entities and consolidated our London offices. We remain on track to
realize anticipated synergies on TMR's expense base.
During the quarter, we continued the wind down of the third party capital business,
transitioning several of its risk portfolios to highly rated reinsurance counterparties. These
portfolio transfers will help reduce operational complexity going forward, especially with
regard to collateral management. We continue to assume that income from this business
will be negligible.
We recorded $14.5 million of corporate expenses this quarter related to the TMR
acquisition, which breaks down into $1.9 million of transaction costs, $3.4 million of
integration costs, and $9.2 million of compensation costs. This is the first time that we've
reported a full quarter of consolidated results reflecting the TMR book. Our financial
reporting now fully reflects TMR's earnings.
Contributing to our results for the quarter, was approximately $90 million of net income
from TMR, the majority of which was driven by mark-to-market gains on investments and
foreign exchange gains, as we reposition the non-dollar portfolio. Taking these and other
factors into consideration, the ongoing contribution to operating income in the quarter
from TMR was consistent with our projected after tax run-rate contribution of $100 million,
which we remain on track to achieve.
The one aspect of the TMR transaction I would like to briefly address, is the mechanics
underlying the adverse development cover or ADC. As you recall, the ADC protects the
reserves we acquired from TMR, including unearned premiums. The ADC is an enterprise
cover, protecting us on paid losses above the attachment point of the ADC. However, we
Page 3 of 23

Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2019-07-24

FINAL

report our underwriting performance quarterly and by segment on an incurred basis.
Consequently, there can be some noise in our reporting. This quarter, there was no
impact to the ADC.
From an economic perspective, this results in three likely outcomes; if TMR results are as
anticipated, the ADC is not impacted and our shareholder received the originally targeted
return on the TMR acquisition. If TMR results are favorable, the ADC is not impacted, and
over-time, this favorable development enures to the benefit of our shareholders.
And finally if TMR results are unfavorable, we recover on the ADC up to the limit of the
contract and our shareholders' suffered no economic loss. To be clear, not recovering on
the ADC is positive; because it means we experienced overall favorable development on
TMR's reserves at the holding company level, which our shareholders keep, or results
were as anticipated.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now moving on to consolidated results; our annualized return on average common equity
was 29%. Our results this quarter benefit from significant mark-to-market gains in the
investment portfolio. We also had a strong quarter on an operating basis posting
annualized operating return on average common equity of 16.7%. We reported net
income for the quarter of $368 million or $8.35 per diluted common share.
Year-to-date, we have grown tangible book value per share plus a change in accumulated
dividends by 16%. Our operating income was $213 million or $4.78 per diluted common
share, which excludes $194 million of net realized and unrealized gains on investments, as
well as $14.5 million of transaction, integration and compensation expenses associated
with the TMR acquisition.
We had underwriting income for the quarter of $171 million and reported an overall
combined ratio of 81%. Net premiums earned for the quarter was $912 million, up $482
million or 112% from the comparable quarter last year. The considerable growth this
quarter is a combination of organic growth and the impact of the TMR transaction.
TMR had about $1.3 billion of net premiums earned in 2018. While we expect this number
to reduce as we re-underwrite the TMR business, this process will take about a year. In
addition, since this premium is protected by the ADC, it is largely retained net, as it is not
ceded into our retro program. As the TMR business runs off. We will have a diminished
impact on premiums earned.
We accrued $9.5 million of income taxes this quarter, mostly related to capital gains in our
investment portfolio. We now have multiple balance sheets located in taxable jurisdictions,
and as these businesses generate profit, including investment income under invested
assets, they will be subject to income tax.
Now, before moving on to our segment results, I would like to briefly update you on our
operational efficiency. Our direct expenses, which are the sum of our operational and
corporate expenses, totaled $84 million for the quarter, which is up from $46 million in the
same quarter last year or an increase of $38 million. $16 million of this increase was in
Page 4 of 23

FINAL

corporate expenses, and was primarily driven by the $14.5 million in expenses associated
with the TMR acquisition that I referred to earlier.
Adjusting for the impact of transactional TMR costs incurred during the quarter, direct
expenses would have been $69 million or an increase of $23 million or 49% from the
comparable quarter. This increase was driven by our expanded global platform following
the acquisition of TMR, as well as ongoing expenses that will support the continuing
growth of our business.
As I previously discussed, direct expenses have been increasing as we invest in the
business and integrate TMR. However, the ratio of direct expenses to net premiums
earned improved this quarter to 8% and reflects the significantly increased leverage the
TMR business has afforded us. As TMR's net premiums earned run-off, this ratio may tick
up somewhat.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now moving on to our segments and starting with our property segment, where gross
premiums written in the first quarter grew by $287 million or 52% over the comparative
quarter to $839 million. Of the growth, about $165 million was from Property cat and
about $122 million was from other property. Similar to last quarter, we retained about 40%
of the growth in Property cat gross premiums written or about $64 million. In total, our
Property segment reported underwriting income of $152 million and a combined ratio of
64% in the second quarter, with Property catastrophe printing a 45% combined ratio and
our other Property printing an 85% combined ratio.
Now moving on to the Casualty segment, where our gross premiums written are up $213
million or 50% in the second quarter of 2019 over the comparative quarter. The majority
of this increase is from the TMR business that was in force, as of the acquisition date and
is not reflective of new business this quarter. We reported underwriting income of $19
million and a combined ratio of 96% for the quarter. The current accident year loss ratio
for the Casualty segment was 65%, which was flat with the prior year quarter.
Now moving to fee income, where total fee income was $40 million for the quarter. We
are in $26 million in management fees and $14 million in performance fees. Relative to the
comparable quarter, our fee income grew 23%, which is due to the growth in the amount
of third party capital that we manage. We raised an additional $700 million in third party
capital in June, of which our participation was about 10%.
Now turning to investments; for the quarter, the return on our fixed maturity and shortterm investments was $106 million and overall net investment income was $116 million. Net
investment income was up $44 million from the comparable quarter, due to higher
invested assets and increased returns on private equity investment. Of our $116 million of
net investment income, $15 million was attributable to our various joint ventures and we
retained $101 million.
We posted total investment results of $310 million for the quarter, driven by mark-tomarket gains of $194 million, of which $143 million was from our fixed maturity
investments. We distinguish our investment results between our managed investment

FINAL

portfolio and our retained investment portfolio. Our retained investment portfolio is a
subset of our managed investment portfolio, and only includes those assets that
contribute to our net income. As a reminder, our managed and retained investment
portfolios include our fixed maturity and short-term investments, but exclude our equity
investments and other investments, as well as investments in other ventures.
In the second quarter, our managed investment portfolio reported a yield-to-maturity of
2.4% and duration of 2.7 years on assets of $15 billion, while our retained investment
portfolio reported yield-to-maturity of 2.5% and duration of 3.1 years on assets of almost
$11 billion. For the quarter, we grew our managed investment portfolio by almost $1.6
billion, this growth was driven mainly by $625 million of new third party capital, which is net
of our participation, $500 million of redeployed cash from the TMR portfolio and $310
million of total investment results.

Bloomberg Transcript

As a reminder, this was the first quarter that we incorporated the impact of TMR on our
net investment income and our total investment results. The TMR asset portfolio has
been successfully integrated into our overall investment portfolio, as we transition these
assets to new investment managers, converted non-US dollar assets to dollars and sold
TMR tax exempt municipal holdings.
Now I'll close with the comments on our capital management. We did not repurchase any
of our shares during the second quarter. Our priority has always been to deploy capital
into the business. The midyear renewals also provided us with ample opportunities to
grow organically. Moving forward, I anticipate additional opportunities to deploy capital
into the business, which is consistent with our previously stated preference. That said, we
are proud of our strong track record of being good stewards of capital and repurchasing
shares when it makes sense, and we will always keep all options on the table.
And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Kevin for more details on our segments.

Kevin O'Donnell
Thanks Bob. I will first provide comments on our Property segment and then follow up with
Casualty. Starting with our Property segment, we grew gross premiums written by 52%
over the comparable quarter last year. Property cat grew by 38%, while other property
grew by 106%. The growth in both lines was a combination of organic growth rate
increases and the addition of the TMR portfolio.
At the June 1 Florida renewal, the industry experienced rate increases on average of 15%
to 20%, with quite a spread around this. Overall demand in Florida was flat, with little
change in limits purchased, although there was some movement between programs due
to shifts in the cat fund participation. So any improvement in rate was due to recent loss
experience as well as capital charges and costs coming through, which ultimately resulted
in reduced supply. Several factors influenced these supply dynamics. The last two years
have seen record losses to global reinsurance markets, as well as Florida specific losses
from hurricanes Michael and Irma.

FINAL

There was materially less retro available to take Florida risk, especially on an aggregate
basis. In part due to third party capital experiencing elevated levels of trapped capital. In
addition, anxiety over social inflation and ongoing loss we've added to existing concerns
about providing capacity to this market. From our perspective, these rate increases were
necessary, but not sufficient. On a risk adjusted basis rates were up only high-single digits,
which needs to be evaluated in light of the substantial rate reductions Florida domestic
insurers have enjoyed over the last several years.
Consequently, we changed the way we take Southeast hurricane exposure. Once again,
reducing the proportion of the Florida domestic market we write. At the same time, we
increased our exposure to more diversified pools of Southeast hurricane risk, where we
could capture relatively better economics for the same exposure, such as retro. So while
we grew Southeast exposure on an absolute basis rates, rates did not improve enough
for us to take -- risk more equity to the terrible Southeast hurricane. And the percentage
terms against our increased equity base, our exposure remains about flat.

Bloomberg Transcript

So in summary, even though we are writing a smaller percentage of our Florida -- of our
book in the Florida domestic market and our absolute Southeast hurricane exposure is up,
with this peril as a percentage of our equity base remains about flat. The result is a
stronger portfolio producing higher returns, which is consistent with our history of taking
more risk when rates are better. Our experienced tools, access and underwriting uniquely
position us to shape our portfolio to capture the best risk in the best form, using the most
efficient capital, which is what I believe we did this quarter.
Additionally, we were able to deploy our newest balance sheet, Vermeer, in the various
(inaudible) renewals, including Florida midyear, and we are pleased with the portfolio that
we constructed for our investor in that vehicle.
Similar to last year, the biggest market losses continue to come from adverse
development, particularly on events like Jebi, Irma and Michael. In a case of deja vu, so far,
the largest event for the market in 2019 was adverse development on 2018's Typhoon
Jebi, just as a largest event in 2018, was adverse development on 2017's Hurricane Irma.
The industry estimate for Typhoon Jebi have increased materially since the third quarter
of 2018 and now we're above the high end of our estimates, which were more
conservative initially than the market.
Our gross loss has increased as well. Although Jebi's net negative impact to our property
book is essentially unchanged from the third quarter of 2018, when we first reported it.
We have successfully managed the volatility from this event, due to our superior
underwriting tools, integrated system and robust gross to net strategy. For the 2018 large
loss events overall, we did experience some adverse development in the quarter,
primarily from our aggregate contracts including retro. The net negative impact of this
charge was approximately $25 million and was offset by favorable development in other
years. As I discussed last quarter, we are paying particular attention to Typhoon Jebi and
its growing impact on the retro market and we'll continue to monitor it closely.

FINAL

An important component of our portfolio construction is using retro, to help us shape our
risk distributions. Due to the nature of the losses over the last several years, we have
made substantial recoveries from our retro programs. This is not surprising to either us or
our retro partners, as is evident from the fact that we were able to renew almost all of our
retro programs that expired at midyear. While the profile of our retro program is different,
and we have paid an increased risk adjusted rate, I am pleased with the result and believe
that our portfolio is more efficient because of these purchases.
Even though our retro renewal was successful, we are not reliant on any one type of
capital, including retro, but rather shift preferentially among available sources. Our strong
underwriting and consistent performance with long term partners gives us preferential
access, both to retro and to other potentially more efficient forms of capital, especially
when supply is constrained. This year we saw several areas of opportunity within our
broader portfolio to support our customers, including sellers in the retro market.
Consequently, we raised capital at June 1, in order to deploy an additional $700 million in
DaVinci, Vermeer, Upsilon and Medici at returns that were attractive.

Bloomberg Transcript

In general, our partners choose to trust us with their capital, given our long-term track
record, superior underwriting and modeling capabilities, aligned approach and their belief
that RenaissanceRe will be the best positioned to leverage improving market conditions.
An important concern of the market is the sustainability of recent rate increases. Rate
increases are often classified as being driven by either insurance changes or reinsurance
changes. In the Property market, I believe rates have strong support from both. Primary
carriers are simultaneously seeking to increase rates and reduce line sizes. In a similar
vein, due to a changing view of risk, reinsurers are seeking Re, and most importantly
willing to reduce limits, which is a dynamic that has not existed for quite some time.
This newfound willingness to reduce can be credited to two factors; the reduction of ILS
capacity and increased discipline resulting from the realization that risk returns have been
below long-term acceptable levels. Due to their losses over the last few years and
inability to raise funds to replace those losses, ILS managers have less capital and are
willing to write less business. So ILS managers are now aligned with the traditional market,
putting further upward pressure on rates. Because of this, I believe current rate trends will
be sustained moving forward. I also expect that the de facto regulators, such as Lloyd's
and the rating agencies will continue to maintain pressure on carriers, encouraging them
to improve results.
These pressures play to our strengths. We are a recognized market leader in
underwriting, modeling and managing partner capital. Our growth in premiums
demonstrate that teams want to do business with us, because we have developed longterm strong partnerships with them. Similarly, our growth in partner capital demonstrates
that capital allocators recognize our expertise and want us to manage their cat risk
portfolios. So when I look forward, I'm very excited about the future, as we are uniquely
qualified and preferentially poised to take advantage of the many opportunities that
should continue over the next few years.

FINAL

Moving to our Casualty segment. Gross written premiums were up $213 million or 50%
versus the comparable quarter. This growth came predominantly from traditional Casualty
business and to a somewhat lesser extent, our credit and other specialty portfolios. Of
the $213 million of top line growth, about two-thirds comes from the legacy TMR book,
and the remainder is organic.
We continue to experience satisfactory results within the Casualty segment, in terms of
overall profitability and the stability of the core business. In addition, we are seeing
positive momentum on underlying rates across multiple lines of business and an
increasingly favorable rate environment for our clients. Generally, we've done a bit from
an underlying rate increases, which are further enhanced by our focus on risk selection.
These rate increases appear to be outpacing loss trends in general, and similar to the
Property business, we believe that these premium trends are likely to persist going
forward. The casualty market is being positively impacted by reform efforts at Lloyd's, as
well as increased discipline from larger carriers. Falling interest rates should further
encourage discipline.

Bloomberg Transcript

Most of the rate sustainability in casualty is dependent on current underlying insurance
market trends. Similar to the Property market, we are seeing primary rates rising due to
capacity withdrawals and decreases in line size. As much of this market is placed on a
proportional basis, insurers rate improvements directly benefit reinsurers.
On the reinsurance side, we can improve our economics through better terms and
conditions, but that is not occurring as of yet. I believe the rate being sought by insurers is
needed, and that they are committed to improving rate adequacy. So I remain optimistic
that we have a degree of sustainability for rate in this market as well.
I am pleased with our market position in Casualty and Specialty lines. Both through organic
initiatives and acquisition, we have built a leading franchise in the business, with great
access to risk. With the recent addition of the TMR portfolio, we have increased scale and
added new capabilities, platforms and balance sheets that strongly position us to access
more risk in an improving environment. Moving forward, we are focused on developing
new products and markets, as well as sourcing new forms of efficient capital.
In conclusion, the diligent execution of our differentiated strategy resulted in back-to-back
strong quarter so far this year. I am pleased with our underwriting profits, increased net
investment income and significant gains in both our fixed income and equity positions.
The TMR integration continues to progress smoothly, and we remain on target for
realizing our run rate and synergy targets. We executed well at the midyear renewals,
raising considerable amounts of partner capital to provide needed capacity to constrained
markets. Both our Property and Casualty segment's realized rate increases that we
believe are sustainable.
Going forward, we remain optimistic regarding our opportunities, confident in our strategy
and focused on maximizing shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn it over to questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator

FINAL

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from
Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. First, a quick numbers question maybe or I guess that's what it is. If we
think about the TMR expenses that they added to your P&L in 2Q, are there any expenses
that you incurred immediately, not related to the integration that will not recur in the
quarters to follow?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Hi Josh, this is Bob. We had recorded basically a couple of different categories. We have
our ongoing run rate, which I talked about, is the increase in the $23 million, just under half
of that is helping out on the growth of the platform. The other non-recurring costs, in the
$14.5 million, there is a mixture of ongoing compensation costs and one-time costs. We'll
expect to see those going forward, but they are non-linear, but it will decline.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay. And can you talk a little bit about Vermeer and Medici and some of the newer
vehicles, what area of the market they are targeting and how that may be relates to some
of the -- a hole in the market that the CATCo situation left, and just could you give us an
idea of where you're playing and I know you don't want to give too much away, but can
you give us some details a little bit there?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Sure. So of the $700 million, about half of it was allocated to DB. That was based on
opportunities we're seeing from organic growth, also the pro forma roll-on of the TMR
portfolio. And if you remember, DB's appetite is very similar to RenRe's appetite, where
there is no business in DB, that is not in RenRe, but there is lots of business in RenRe,
that's not in DB.
The other vehicles we also -- we're seeing good opportunity, and just to remind you of
the strategies, Vermeer is writing high level US exposed risk. So we have top layer Re
which writes high level non-US exposed risk. We have Medici, which is more focused on
cat bonds, and then Upsilon, which is a worldwide vehicle, but that's also where -- when
we find retro opportunities that don't fit our balance sheet, we put it on the Upsilon
vehicle, and that is the one that probably has the most parallel to the CATCo. We are not
writing the CATCo product, but the CATCo withdrawal of capacity from the market has
allowed us to provide more traditional retro sessional products to some customers that
were using other forms of retro session previously. So, is that helpful?

Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td

Yeah, that's helpful. Let me get one more in, on the other Property segment, the growth
was significant. Can you divide that between TMR premium, the growth in the third-party
vehicles and RenRe just broadening appetite in that area?

FINAL

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Hey Josh, this is Bob. The growth in the other Property, about half would have come from
the acquisition of TMR, they brought in and the rest would be -- and that would be
generally what was in the in-force at the purchase date, the remainder would have been
organic growth year-over-year.

A - Kevin O'Donnell
And as far as the appetite here on the Property, I think it's always helpful to remind
everybody that within Property -- we think about the world within property cat and other
property; there is cat risk that's assumed in other property. But in other property, there's
also other hurdles that can come in, more attritional type Property losses as well. So just
as a reminder, there is cat risk in other Property. Our appetite hasn't changed, and we're
seeing opportunities, particularly as underlying rates are increasing, particularly in the
United States.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Thank you and congratulations.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Thanks.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Your
line is open.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning. The first question I have is actually on the Casualty book. On
the last conference call, you had talked about TMR's book being more Casualty than
Specialty, and running at a higher loss ratio. I was curious if there was a way to talk about
how we should think about -- I guess what's a good run rate for the blended book and
based on your comments regarding the underlying rate improvement, is it time to start
thinking about improving profitability in that book?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Let me take a stab at answering that, it's quite a bit in there. The TMR Casualty portfolio,
that will form part of our Casualty and Specialty segment, is more heavily weighted to
General Casualty than the in-force legacy RenRe book. And General Casualty has a higher
loss ratio than Credit and Specialty and some of the other lines that are in that segment.
So there will be an uptick. My belief is in that loss ratio. However, the book that we retain

Page 11 of 23



FINAL

Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2019-07-24

within the General Casualty section of the Casualty book of TMR will be re-underwritten,
and that's one of the reasons we're seeing the substantial reduction in premium that will
be kept on a run rate basis for RenRe Limited. We've talked before about the auto book
being a large component of the Casualty segment within the legacy TMR, that has been
the component of the book that is running at the highest loss ratio and it's not a book we
intend to materially renew. So I would look to say that, we will rationalize the Casualty
book against the book that we have in-force. We will grow where it makes sense, and
hopefully over time, we will begin to enjoy the better rates that we are beginning to
observe in that market.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. That's a fair comment. The only other question, and I will requeue is, in your
opening remarks you talked about optimism, sustainability, and you're talking about, you
know, the losses, the adverse development, et cetera. And what I was actually wondering
is, if you don't have an active hurricane season, doesn't a lot of these points become
moot at that point, as we head into 2020 renewals. Do you still have confidence that not
even having an active hurricane season will still predicate future improvement in the
marketplace?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin O'Donnell
So I think everything can change, depending on what happens in wind season. But in -and it being a normal wind season, I feel optimistic that the trends that are pushing rates,
lot of them coming from the primary insurance side, will persist. I think there is a general
realization within the reinsurance market, that particularly markets like Florida, it's been a
buyer's market for a long time. It's been a small shift tidally to rates improving, but that
needs to go further. And at 1-1, much of the business in late in the third and fourth quarter
-- much of the business, that was lost effective in prior years, either renewed after the
losses occurred -- sorry, before the losses occurred, or on a multi-year basis, so I think
there's still sustainability of rates coming through.

Q - Amit Kumar

Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. Kevin, when you're talking about the Casualty and Specialty segment, I think you
made a comment about pursuing other forms of capital, I think that means third party

Page 12 of 23

capital. I was hoping you could update us on where the investor appetite is for nonproperty or non-cat lines is?

FINAL

A - Kevin O'Donnell
I think the -- there is appetite for non-cat lines, and I think we talked last year, that we put
some third party capital to work in event based Casualty business in the third quarter of
last year. There are substantial issues with bringing third party capital to the market, which
have to do with the tail, and how to think about rolling the tail into either future vehicles or
truncating the tail through run-off. I believe that the appetite is further along than the
structures are there to support it, and what we've seen is more vertical integration of third
party capital, trying to get lower in the stack and closer to insurance risk, that is beginning
to gain some traction, and I remain optimistic that some lines of business, probably more
in the specialty area like cyber and others, may ultimately find a way to get more access
to third party capital. The one thing I'll say, many of these lines are not constrained from a
capital perspective and there is good reinsurance support available. So part of it is,
whether the customer needs it and whether it can be cheaper.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, that's very helpful. And then shifting gears, I guess last quarter you talked about -maybe paraphrase in a higher likely ratio of net to growth relative to the book in 2018.
Does that still hold following mid-year renewals?

A - Kevin O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

So reduced session rates, is that what you're asking?

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Yeah, particularly for tail losses.

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Yeah, I think -- when we think about structuring our portfolio, retro is a component of it
and we don't have specific targets. So I wanted to comment that we renewed our retro
program, because there was a lot of visibility to us purchasing it this year. But it is only a
single component of what we do, and not something that is a required element of the
portfolio. So I feel good about the risk that we put together from a portfolio perspective.
The one thing I think I would like to highlight on the retro that we purchased this year from
last year, is we purchased, ballpark, the same amount of limit. All that said, the portfolio is
bigger. But the change in the construction of the purchases are such that we have more
occurrence limit and less aggregate limit. And what that would mean is, if '17, which is in
which is an '18 actually, were a series of medium sized catastrophes, I think we would
recover less under the structure we built in 2019, than we did in 2017 and 2018. But if it's a
single shock loss, we should recover about the same in '19 as we would have in '17 and '18.
So again, it's not any one element of it that is changing at a point in time, it's how we
orchestrate all the elements of our portfolios together to come up, what we think is the
most beneficial net portfolio that we can construct.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, thank you. Good morning. My first question is going back to the conversation on Jebi.
Could you guys give us a sense, where you think the insured losses for the industry sits
today, and then the $25 million, Kevin, that you said you guys added in the quarter. I'm
assuming that's all for Jebi. I know you said it was aggregated in retro covers and that all
shows up in cat, right? So then if you could also give some color on what drove the other
property adverse development?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Okay. So Jebi -- actually Jebi has been an interesting event. If you go back to when it was
originally reported, I think the modeling firms and others were reporting it in the $2 billion
to $5 billion range, and we came out initially thinking it was in the $8 billion to $10 billion
range. I believe the loss is in the $15 billion range currently, and it's been a lot of reasons
for that growth, including slow reporting of the claims. But it's something that we continue
to monitor. We, as I mentioned on the previous call, we have more protections for our
reinsurance portfolio than we do for our retro portfolio, which is one of the reasons we
are so closely attuned to how this is flowing into the retro portfolios.
With regard to the $25 million that I -- I am actually going to turn it over to Bob to talk a
little bit about the geography, I don't know, provide any color that I can't.

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Yeah, Elyse, it's a good question. That $25 million that Kevin referred to was a net
negative impact, which is consistent on how we disclosed. You'll see that in the Q that we

number of events that came through in 2018.

Okay, thank you. And then my other question, you guys -- is obviously the first quarter with
TMR on your books, and I know you gave a couple of figures, kind of the net income
contribution and then would you view it as kind of the core ongoing and you did say I think
-- both of you, that you guys remain on track relative to that $100 million target. It does
feel like given the moving parts that, I would think -- it seems like you guys got more than
$25 million of earnings this quarter, is there a seasonality to that, am I missing something?
It seems like you guys already at that $100 million target?

A - Kevin O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks for the question, Elyse. Look, I did point out in my prepared comments, and you'll
see it in the Q, I think it's filed later today that we did have about $90 million that came in
from TMR. But again, TMR is a big company. The integration is going very well. And as I
pointed out in my prepared comments, a lot of that was mark-to-market gains that we
had on the acquired investment portfolio, and one-time foreign exchange gains that we
receive from the ongoing positioning of the portfolio. In our comments about giving sort
of commentary on the $100 million run rate, that was on an ongoing run rate, and would
have excluded the one-time items out there. And so going through the integration right
now, we've not seen any surprises and we still feel very comfortable with $100 million, and
we're hoping for more. So we'll keep you posted.

Good morning, everybody. Maybe another follow-up on TMR. So on the investment

somewhat attributable to the TMR assets coming on, and as you reallocate those, how

FINAL

We brought in just over $2 billion of assets. In my prepared comments, I did talk about the
repositioning, and you can see in the supplemental, just a number of different changes,
like selling down in municipals and moving out of the non dollar agencies that were out
there. So there was a lot of moving parts. But yes, yield came -- moved slightly. We
reported on a managed as well as at risk. No substantial change, I mean the new money
rate by came down, obviously that was reflected in the mark-to-market. So we did enure
that benefit to our shareholders through tangible book value.
The duration remained relatively unchanged. It was 3.0 last quarter, it's 3.1 this quarter.
And we're keeping an eye on it and the market is moving around, so we feel very
comfortable. I will point out, that I did make an additional disclosure in my prepared
comments about the amount of income on the investment portfolio of $115 million or $116
million, of which about $15 million is coming from our managed portfolio. So the core was
around $101 million, and that's driven largely by our fixed maturity. The short-term adds on
to that, but that's -- some of it's coming from the managed vehicles.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

And do you think that the yield on the core portfolio will improve from here as you
reallocate, or is the interest rate pressure such that we're not going to really see much
improvement?

We feel comfortable with the position -- where the portfolio is positioned right now, and

Hi, a couple of questions here. I'm just curious, Kevin, given what's going on with the
pricing environment, rating environment, do you think you are more likely to keep more of
the TMRe business than you'd originally anticipated?

FINAL

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

I don't think it'll change our perspective on the auto book. And then, remember it is about
$200 million of the premium ballpark, it was their fronted business, which is a business
that we said from the very beginning, we would provide an orderly exit for their partners
there. For the rest of it, I think we will underwrite each account individually, and yeah, if
there is an opportunity to keep it, we will. So I hope that we can do at least -- I feel
comfortable, we'll get this to $700 million, and I hope that as rates improve, we can do a
little bit better than that.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. And where is that fronting business coming through? Just the fee income and if
any premiums coming through?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

It comes through the Property side.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

So other property, so that's part of the big increase we saw this quarter in other property
coming from TMRe and we should assume that necessarily won't continue going forward?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

No. It comes to Property cat and it's on a run-off basis. So what you're seeing is, some
movements in the loss ratios, but those are all passed back and forth. So that's net
neutral to us --

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Well, it comes to us something -- well, one thing that comes to us, is the fees associated
with the business, which -- it's something that -- from an original estimate for $100 million,
we never included the fees, because it's not part of our run rate that we inject to run this
business. But we are earning the money in thinking about -- in our transition of that book
to others, willing to provide the fronting.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. Okay. And that you're seeing -- that's an offset to the loss ratios?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Loss ratio has been neutral, because it's passed right through, it comes in and out. So
there is no impact and you can see it right in the cash flow in the supplemental. You can

of growth?

The loss ratio, there was noise here or there, but nothing significant and sit out that would
be worthy of getting into. I mean there's going to be a little bit of movement. I did point
out in my prepared comments, that there was no activation of the ADC. So in other

exposure to cats relative to kind of your historical book?

FINAL

A - Kevin O'Donnell
So there's two elements of their cat book. One is which Bob talked about is, they have
the fronting business, we retain zero risk on the fronting business. So that is probably
more US focused, but it's not a business that we have retained any risk on. The second
piece is, they wrote a diversified portfolio and a diversified cat portfolio with the exclusion
of Japan, because as a subsidiary of Tokio Fire Marine, they didn't want to add to the risks
there. So it's a reasonably diversified portfolio, with a not uncommon spread for a
traditional cat book, with the exclusion of Japan.

Hey thanks. Not trying to beat the dead horse on this, but Bob, you said that $90 million
came in this quarter from TMR, in operating earnings?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

That's going -- potentially GAAP earnings. And a lot of that I pointed to the mark-tomarket in the FX, which would be outside of the GAAP earnings. And so, we remain
confident with $100 million run rate that we have out there, and we don't feel that we
have seen any surprises that would change that. And we're hoping for upside Ryan -- go
ahead.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

I'm just trying to understand, looking at the operating income line, how much of that might
have been obscured by some mark-to-market or the FX within TMR?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Actually, I was going to clarify that some of the FX did come through in the operating
income, which is consistent with how we record all of our FX. Again, those are one-time,
and we're really pulling it towards the core. In fact, the $90 million has -- is still -- it's
becoming more and more difficult as we go through time, as we consolidate these
entities, because they are reinsurance on reinsurance, and we will choose to reunderwrite on different balance sheets, which makes it difficult to track. So I wouldn't see
this is a continuing disclosure, but we'll continue to talk about.

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Understood. I'm just trying to understand how much more than the -- if you just -annualized $100 million, you are on pace -- so that's $25 million a quarter, how much more
than $25 million was in operating earnings this 2Q?

FINAL

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

It's not an easy question to answer, because we already started integrating people that
are running the business. So we've got a lot of movements in it. So it's a very difficult -the FX, income into operating earnings, but we did have some of the increase of the $23
million in costs I talked about. Some of that -- a large -- half of that increase was a result of
TMR that -- and a good chunk of it was booked outside of the AG, as we moved people
into our services unit.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Okay. And then my follow-up was just thinking about -- with the midyear renewals in a no
cat year is it -- should we be thinking about the profitability being kind of similar to the
magnitude of rate increases, the 15% to 20% up, or was there a lot of premium growth on
top of that, just in terms of new business that would make it more significant than that in
Property cat?

A - Kevin O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm not sure I fully understood your question. Can you repeat it for me?

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Yeah, I mean, I'm just trying to understand the -- obviously, you had the rate, but then
there is the comment about -- I was just a little bit confused on the comment about the
P&L versus the percentage of equity? And how you would expect -- taking all that
together, how you'd expect the profitability of your book to be this year relative to last
year, if you do not have an active wind season?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Okay. Let me try to clarify the first part of your question, which is kind of what happened
to our Southeast wind risk, which seems to be a component of it. So from a portfolio
perspective, we did not grow limit in the Florida domestic market year-over-year.
However, we are taking more Southeast hurricane risks, which includes Florida. So when
we think about building our portfolio, as we think about the peril and then how we're
constructing the portfolio, the peril Southeast hurricane, of which the Florida domestic is a
component, but it's a smaller component of the risk that we're taking, and that's because
we saw better opportunities to take that risk outside of the Florida domestic market. So
the Florida domestic market did not draw our capacity as much as other lines such as
retro.
And the final piece is, as a percentage of equity, at different points on our risk distribution,
we did not increase the percent of equity we are exposing. However, our equity is higher

Page 20 of 23



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2019-07-24

for the 2019 wind season than it was for the 2018 wind season, which again supports that
we're taking up more absolute risk in Florida. Is that more clear?

FINAL

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Yes, I know -- I think that's helpful. I guess my one follow up that would be on the regional
business, the domestic stuff, I think you said is up 15 to 20, what are the type of rate
increases that you're -- I guess that you're writing more broadly in the Southeast?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
So risk adjusted, we said, they were high-single digits in the domestic Florida. So we -that is netting out the change and the view of risk from what we learned about the
steepness of the social inflation curve. We are getting better rate adjusted (inaudible)
exposure in other lines such as retro than that. So we didn't disclose what the other
markets are producing. But it's higher than what we're getting in the domestic Florida
market. If it was higher in the domestic Florida market, we would have grown that as a
percentage of our book.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Carletti from JMP. Your line is open.

Q - Matthew Carletti

{BIO 5249827 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. Good morning. Kevin, I just want to circle back to your Jebi comments, I would
think that you guys in your position do a lot of work on this, and probably have a better
view the most. You mentioned a little bit on late reporting, but I was hoping that you could
just dive a little deeper and give us at least some of your thoughts on kind of why this one
missed the mark so much and has turned out to be kind of a tough one for the industry to
get its hands around?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Yes. So when I touched on before, is I think there's, I think is a couple of issues, in my early
comments were specific to the fact that it's a much bigger industry event, than what was
initially forecast. I think that has to do with -- this probably will be an optimistic
representation of Japanese wind within the models, which is certainly a component of it. I
think underwriters', over time, in regions without frequency or without severity even, they
have a tendency to underestimate the risk that they're taking. So I think there is a degree
of underwriting optimism in the market, and I think there has been all of that exasperated
by there being slow reporting. So in Japan, one tends to expect slow reporting this week

Page 21 of 23



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2019-07-24

FINAL

slower than usual, which probably added to this being something that has burned for
longer than what would have been expected. So, mischaracterization of the event from
time zero, optimism with underwriters representing the risk and slow reporting, all
contributed.
When I think about our book, what I said in my comments is our net negative impact has
not changed from when we first reported in Q3 2018. However, our gross is up. So as I
mentioned, we started at 8 to 10. We think it's now at least 15. That has also had some
growth in our gross loss. But because of the way we structured our portfolio, we have
managed to maintain the same ultimate impact to our shareholders, which is the net
negative impact. So when I look at our reserves, I feel good about where we are, with
about half our loss in either ACR or IBNR, but I do have concern that if this loss continues
to develop, that it can adversely affect us, particularly through retro and in retro
repurchase, fewer protections than we do on our reinsurance book. Hopefully, that is
helpful?

Q - Matthew Carletti

{BIO 5249827 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay and then -- yeah. Maybe just a couple of follow-ups. Specifically, I mean there's been
some talk in the market of the demand surge along the lines of a lot of World Cup
construction, a lot of Olympic construction. Do you see that contributing at all? There's
also been some talk of kind of, let's call it social inflation in the Osaka area, not to Florida
extremes, but kind of a little atypical for Japan. Have you seen any evidence of that? And
then lastly, what would your expectation be as we approach 4.1 next year, in terms of
follow through from the kind of series of revisions we've had?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Yeah. I've read all that stuff as well. I'm not -- to be perfectly honest, I'm not sure the guy
building Olympic Stadium is the same guy fixing somebody's garage door.

Q - Matthew Carletti

{BIO 5249827 <GO>}

Agreed.

A - Kevin O'Donnell
But there is probably some element of contractors being told on to do more marquee
jobs than doing the residential stuff. There probably is social inflation within the Osaka
area. I think it's one that I mentioned on the previous call, we are still learning about how
to improve this event, I tried to represent a few things that I think occurred. But we don't
have full transparency as what's driving this loss to be as substantial as it is. I think the rate
increases at 4.1 certainly were helpful. Japan has traditionally been great partners from a
reinsurance perspective. But as the loss has grown substantially even after the 4.1
renewal, I would hope that we go in with an expectation of rate increases in 2020.

One thing, this is Bob. I'd like to go back to Ryan's question on the $90 million, just clarify
