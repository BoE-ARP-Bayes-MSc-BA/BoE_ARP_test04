FINAL

I'm delighted to report we grew fully converted book value per share by 5.4% for the
fourth quarter, with an excellent combined ratio of 50.14%, (sic) [50.4%,] (00:51) our fullyear combined ratio is 68.7%, which again demonstrates the quality of the Lancashire
underwriting, [ph] writers' (01:04) specialty insurance business and efficient reinsurance
purchasing. So, I'm happy that we've achieved what we said we would do in 2014, and
we're in the right track as we enter 2015.
We are paid by our shareholders to take risk, which is commensurate to the return which
we – that we can generate in the market. So, you have seen us take down risk levels in line
with our view of the attractiveness of the opportunity. We have become more capital
efficient without destroying our ROE. And we feel that we have the best risk-adjusted
portfolio we have had in our history. You don't need to tell me that the market is
competitive, I don't need to tell you that the market is competitive, but that is the nature
of the beast.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our industry is purely about supply and demand, and currently we have too much supply.
But saying that, even in today's market, it's not impossible for us to grow, as we have
demonstrated with the success we have achieved expanding Cathedral Syndicate 3010.
This has gone from £30 million to £100 million stamp capacity in a little under 12 months.
As we have previously stated, if we can find the right high-quality underwriter to employ,
we will do that. And we actually believe that the current amounts of NII in our (02:20)
industry, we only see the opportunity to bring new underwriters into the group as growing.
There are still lots of things we can do of our (02:28) business with the breadth of talent
we have across the group. So, I'm comfortable we still have a business, which is relevant
in the classes of business we underwrite, and we're still able to produce our stated
returns of 13% above risk-free over the cycle.
I'll now hand over to Paul Gregory.

Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Thanks, Alex, quite a competitive market we faced in 2014, I'm delighted with what our
underwriting team across the group has delivered. It's been a successful year on many
fronts, positioning the group well for what looks to be a continuous competitive
environment in 2015.
We've delivered the plan growth of Syndicate 3010, with the addition of new marketleading underwriters and the expansion of the Lancashire core specialty lines. In less than
nine months, premiums of Syndicate has more than doubled and stamp capacity trebled
year-on-year. Kinesis has delivered excellent returns to its investors, whilst demonstrating
its claims' paying ability to its clients.
For the board or group, (03:24) the reinsurance protection we put in place with core
reinsurance partners, optimizes our portfolio to match the market we will face. It allows to
defend the high-quality underlying portfolio we've worked so hard to build since our

Page 2 of 21

FINAL

inception, that manage our volatility, when returns are naturally lower given the writing
environment.
It's also the most capital-efficient structure we've ever had, as evidenced by our ability to
pay another special dividend today. And what was relatively benign last year, the
combined ratio of 68.7%, it's been a fantastic performance. Especially, given our heavy
weighting towards non-cash specialty insurance lines. It's in fact this weighting to specialty
insurance lines that will help the group manage this competitive market environment.
Relevance for insurance clients does not correlate with balance sheet size. It correlates
with relative line size, leadership, servicing and clients' (04:20) paying ability and good
old-fashioned call-out (04:22) relationships. This is something we've been preaching for a
number of years, and today this message is more apt than ever. Relevance and scale
should not be confused.

Bloomberg Transcript

The outlook for 2015 is one of continued competition and pricing pressure. One which is
broadly in line with our expectations, and both Lancashire and Cathedral were able to
defend the vast majority of their portfolios, while affecting (04:47) some business that no
longer made underwriting sense and maximizing whatever new opportunities existed.
For Kinesis, we deployed broadly the same limit as last year, whilst increasing both the
investor and client base. Just like in other parts of the group, we did decline search and
renewals where the return metrics did not make sense, thereby, sticking to our mantra
that underwriting comes first. As Elaine will speak to, it's worth remembering that we're
being fortunate enough to tie up a number of risks on multi-year contracts, which would
likely impact top line in 2015, but will eat (05:22) bottom line, as we take benefits with
more favorable rating.
This is particularly important to Gulf of Mexico energy portfolio, where it's quite possible
the margin will be affected by the lower oil price, by having a number of multi-year
contracts that provides some level of protection from this, and any other further pricing
pressure we may see.
Our underwriting structure remains the same. We're continuing to do what we've always
done, and underwrite the market in front of us and adjust our portfolio with a combination
of disciplined front-end underwriting matched with an appropriate reinsurance volume
strategy. If market conditions change, then so will we.
I'll now pass over to Elaine.

Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Thanks, Paul. Hi, everyone. Our results are on our website, as usual. But before I could
enter results for the quarter, I just wanted to highlight that we've included return on
tangible equity in our press release and supplement this quarter. We've been getting
more questions on return on tangible recently, so we thought we'd just include that for
you. Our headline metrics remain the same.

FINAL

So, on that basis, it's just (06:26) an ROE for the quarter of 5.4%, bringing us to 13.9% for
the year. Cathedral contributed 1% to ROE for the quarter and a total of 1.6% into the year
after acquisition adjustments. Warrant exercises this year registered (06:42) ROE by 0.
8%. Our ROE for 2014 is less than last year's 18.9%. Other operating performances are
actually stronger this year. If you recall last year, included about 6.4% of ROE, the releases
to equity issuance and economic foreign exchange hedging in relation to acquisition of
Cathedral.
(07:05) course this year, and is often the case in our business, with no major reported
losses this quarter and some favorable development on prior asset new losses, (07:13)
we finished the year with the strong results. In a total prior year, we've had releases in the
quarter of $25 million, with $11.5 million from Lancashire, and $13.5 million from Cathedral.
With that, releases for the full year reflected $4.4 (07:30) million, and contributed about
2.2% to our ROE, that compares to $16.9 million and 1.1% of ROE for 2013.
On the premiums side, Lancashire's premiums are slightly behind the same quarter last
year. Largely driven by timing on some multi-year contracts in lines, (07:49) with a lot of
that reduction being offset by total Cathedral (07:52) and the new energy and terrorism
lines of business, plus contributions from the new aviation team.

Bloomberg Transcript

Paul has talked about the 1/1 renewals. As I said, last quarter, we don't provide (08:03)
guidance, but bear in mind, the multi-year is throughout in (08:05) 2014 and they're
forecasted 2015. While it's an obvious impact on the top line, we still get the benefits of
the air (08:13) coming through (08:14)
Ignoring the lines of business that tends to be characterized by non-annual contract, we
wrote about $120 million of multi-year deals across the property, power and energy lines.
While pricing pressure continues across much of the rest of the group, we do expect to
see some rule allowing (08:30) Syndicate 3010 in the new lines of business there.
Our net loss ratio was 12.2%, reflecting the last year's losses in the quarter and the
releases I've already mentioned. Our accident year loss ratio was 25.2%. As we said
previously, our business is lumpy and individual quarters are not representative of the
group. (08:51) Last quarter, we had a high accident year loss ratio, this quarter we have a
low accident year loss ratio. The accident year loss ratio for the through-year (08:59) is
35.9%, which reflects the fairly average year, nothing baked, a few bits and pieces here
and there, nothing exceptional.
We've talked about our expectations of attritional loss ratio over the last few quarters, I
think there's still some confusion when provisioning it (09:15) in the current market
environment. Lancashire's news (09:18) in the low-20s percent to a high-20s percent
attritional ratio, and Cathedral's ratio for a less volatile but lower attachment in the
business, add some more in the mid-30s percent (09:24) As and when the market
improves, I would expect attrition to stay volatile, but not if there was pressure via (09:31)
Cathedral. For 2015, subject to pricing a single city and mid-attritional ratio (09:38) would
be reasonable.

FINAL

On investments, including our currency hedge, the portfolio returned 0.2% to the quarter,
and then 4% (09:47) to the year. The fourth quarter, saw a return of volatile market and
while most of our asset classes (09:54) our bank loans portfolio was impacted by the
widening high-yield credit spreads.
As I said last quarter, our investment strategy is largely unchanged, and we continue to
focus on managing our interest rate risk. Our hedge fund allocation is now at $152 million.
(10:08) We may continue to add a little more stat growth for you, but we're broadly happy
with the (10:12) positioning for now. Although, we will remain that, (10:17) as we navigate
through the Fed (10:18) interest rate hike.
On KCM, we're in $6.2 million from underwriting fees for the year, with $1.9 million of that
followed in the fourth quarter. Remember that the fees annualizing with (10:28) underlying
exposure to each of this (10:31) portfolio, the majority there in Q3 and Q4. We expect to
receive profit commission of $5.8 million for the first quarter of 2015, which covers most
of the 2014 contract. KCM's expenses are reflected within Lancashire's other operating
expenses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net expenses in its first year, which doesn't include the profit commission, KCM
contributed 0.4% to group ROE. In terms of actual returns generated, Kinesis presented,
made (10:58) a mid-teens return from initial draws. The remaining other income is
managing agency fees and profit commissions to Cathedral, these tend to be higher in
the fourth quarter as years goes out, obviously depending on underlying performance;
$6.2 million was booked in the fourth quarter, mostly reflecting a good result on the 2014
(11:17) and $10.1 million for the year.
Our G&A includes $10.9 million of Cathedral cost, including $5.1 million of performance
related (11:28) given strong performance in the quarter. There is no further amortization of
the finite life intangible asset in the acquisition this quarter, that's fully amortized line, $8.4
million of amortization was included in other operating expenses this year.
Turning to cash flow, we got back a few more shares in the fourth quarter, have a stock
comp (11:47) award, $15.6 million total in the quarter, so just a small amount. Otherwise,
we're talking of last quarter's special dividend with the further $103 million.
I think, our assessment of the market last quarter was entirely accurate, have been (12:02)
a very profitable fourth quarter and we're also able to take advantage of the declining
(12:06) environment, by some exceptionally good reinsurance cover and further reduced
our exposure level. Because of that, we've ended up with more cash (12:13) than we
need, so we're actually giving that back (12:14) some more.
I anticipate our cash flow requirement for 2015 to be in the $1.4 billion to$1.45 billion range,
if nothing else in the market changes.
With that, I'll now hand over to the operator for questions.

Q&A
Operator

FINAL

Thank you. And there'll be a brief pause while questions are being registered. The first
question is from the line of Ben Cohen of Canaccord. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

Hi, there, thanks very much. Good afternoon. I have two questions please. Firstly, on the
sort of increased risk protection that you've bought. I just wonder, where we are going to
see that in your numbers. When I look at the P&Ls, it doesn't look like they have reduced
in the most recent disclosure or they haven't moved materially. And should we expect any
sort of improvement in the attritional because of those better protection? So, that's one
question.
And the second was, could you be a bit more specific about the impact of the increased
Cathedral's 3010 Syndicate capacity. How much of that do you think you will use? Can you
just remind us what you had in 2014, and how that's going to then affect gross written and
net earned premium for 2015? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay. Yeah, good question. I think on the reinsurance question, and Paul may come in on
this one as well. I think, yes, we bought more cover. You're in a great market when you're
the buyer, so that's why we've done it (14:21). There are some impacts on our P&Ls, but
equally, we've bought a lot more on our energy account and terror account. We've got
energy Gulf of Mexico wind. So pretty much across the board. Our reinsurance purchasing
on the Lancashire side's (14:40) much more comprehensive than what it used to be, which
makes perfect sense for us, because it's the cheapest time to buy reinsurance in 10 years.
It won't necessarily affect the sort of attrition because our account's not built for attrition,
but what it will do is if you get the losses, which we firmly believe you will at some point,
we think that the recent period's been very benign. When you get the losses, we can kind
of fully demonstrate what our net exposures are versus what they would have been
before we bought the reinsurance.
We're not expecting to get any credit for that until we can prove it and that's fine, but I
just think – we firmly believe it's absolutely the right thing to do. It's everything we said we
would do. We've always said we're taking a maximum amount of risk when the returns are
there and we're not afraid to cut back when the returns are not there. So that's, from
where I'm sitting, this is just the Lancashire strategy, the way it's always been, nothing
different.

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

I think as well – Ben, hi, it's Paul. If you look at the percentage of capital, the PMLs are
similar but actually, as we brought our capital down, when you look at the dollar PMLs,
they've actually come down quite dramatically. If you compared to 1/1/2014 versus 1/1/2015
Page 6 of 21



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2015-02-12

in dollar terms, there's been some quite significant reductions in both the cat and the
non-cat PMLs. And that's primarily driven by the new reinsurance structures we've put in
place throughout this year and the additional reinsurance protections we were able to
purchase at 1/1.

FINAL

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

So that's additional cover that we don't see in the latest disclosures, is that right? Just
remind me so that – because that's a 31st, is it? 31st this wealth (16:35) basis?

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Yeah. And the numbers that we have in our supplement are the round one (16:40)
numbers, so you should see it in there I believe (16:40).

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

Okay, okay. All right.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And just on the attritional ratio, I think – just mentioned in my narrative, I think financial
reinsurance cover doesn't really make a huge difference to our expectations in labor and
attrition, (16:58) I think given the pricing environment they're in, the gains you've had in the
past is still (17:02) quite relevant.

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Operator
We now go to the line Nick Johnson of Numis Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.

Q - Nick H. Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Hi, there. Afternoon all. It's just actually a follow-up from the reinsurance question. You say
you bought more reinsurance. I was wondering if you could be a bit more specific about
the dollar spend on reinsurance. Is that likely to go up or down versus 2014 or are you just
getting more cover for the same dollar spend?

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

So at the 1st of January, we – when we renew most of our cover, you kind of bear (17:37)
the option don't you. So you can just go to the brokers and say, I want a competitive price.
And in this market, you'll pretty much get a reduction on most things. Or you can do what
we've done, which is (17:51) we went to the brokers pretty much across the board and
said, what happens if we spend the same?

Page 7 of 21



FINAL

Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity

So all the reinsurers are struggling for revenue. So we think it's a buyout (18:01), if you
provide the same revenue, what do you get for that. And our view is that by spending the
same amount dollars in a falling (18:10) market, the value you get far outstrips the
reduction that you would get in cash. So for us, it was very much a case of, we know
(18:19) the market's declining, we would spend the same. That increases our relevance
with our reinsurers' partners. It keeps our brokerage spend with the brokers the same,
and all these are useful tools in the current market we're in. And as I said, more than
anything, it's the cheapest time to buy reinsurance in 10 years. So why wouldn't you buy.

Q - Nick H. Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Okay, so very clear. Thanks very much. Thank you.

Operator
We now move to the line of Kamran Hossain at RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, afternoon. Two quick questions. The first one, just coming back to Paul's comments
about kind of relevance in the current marketplace. Can you just give us an indication of
the level of business or the percentage of business that you lead across the group, and
how this might have moved year-on-year? And the second question, really helpful to have
the guidance from the attritional loss ratio. Just thinking about the admin expense ratio, is
this year's level or could you (19:19) kind of guide for 2015? Thanks.

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay. On the relevance point, I'll start. And then I think Paul's got some stuff to add. So I
think – relevance is a word that comes up a lot at the moment and we've been waiting for
the question. I think what people need to understand is that we – our customers, when
they think about who's relevant, it's not always just how big's your market cap and doesn't
(19:52) make you relevant.
There's a number of other factors that we always talk about and you can be relevant in
many different ways and quite frankly from our point of view, if we weren't relevant in
everything we do, we shouldn't be doing it. Because in this market, it'd be a waste of the
time. You couldn't make any returns.
So I think we're relevant in everything that we do. As I said, there is a number of factors. I
think even down to (20:19), if you think about – and I'm sure I'm going to get one of these
questions, you think about the M&A and what's happening now. If you think about it when
you're a reinsurance customer, M&A means there's going to be less reinsurance
customers. So every time a deal gets done, in my opinion, we become even more
relevant for the brokers and our standard in bear list of (20:41) relevance goes up. So I
think if anything, some of what's going on in the market actually really benefits us. And as I
said, I had clients and brokers – I even had one underwriter come to me or come to Paul
to say that we've lost a piece of business because we're not relevant and that just hasn't
happened.

FINAL

I think – and I'll come back Kamran on the leadership stats point, I think to that point as
well, if you look at some of our insurance portfolios, got $100 million of terror and political
risk premium, you don't have that unless you're relevant. We have, across the group now
including 3010, $270 million of energy premium, it's combined in the 50%s (21:28) since
inception (21:29), you don't have a portfolio like that unless you're relevant in that market.
To the leadership point, on the Lancashire portfolio, the stat is 73% of our business, we
currently lead or have agreement party status on. Our historical range, if you look, is
between 65% to 75%, but hopefully that gives you the guidance you need.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Yeah. No, that's a great kind of sign of your relevance. Thank you very much.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And I think your second question was on G&A, I missed the start of your question, it kind
of cut out a little bit, so if that's not great then let me know of it. And in the numbers for
this year, so you see that we're reporting, we have included in our G&A the amortization
of private (22:16) life intangible asset that was created in the acquisition, and that's $8.4
million for the year. So that was the way that that's done and that's to be (22:23)
amortized. There's also a little bit of extra cost in 2014, just in terms of moving offices and
(22:31) bits and pieces like that, so that's should trend, I know that (22:33) a little bit, you
can adjust slightly for that too.

We now go to the line of Paris Hadjiantonis of KBW. Please go ahead with your question,
Paris. Your line is open.
Yes, good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have two today.
One, going back to your insurance program. I think that pretty much, you are guiding to a
lower cat budget for the year. And if I take Alex's comments, then I assume that that cat
budget which will be down 10% to 15%. Can you kind of guide us whether this is the kind
of adjustments we should be making?
And then, can I ask a bit more about terms and conditions and what you have seen at 1/1.
So have you been asked to relax terms and conditions or have you seen, as a buyer of
reinsurance and retro, anyone offering more favorable T&C. And if so, what was that?
Was it hours clauses, was it the reinstatement premiums, et cetera? Thank you.

Well, okay, so I think I'll the leave numbers to Elaine and then Paul can your question about
(23:46)

FINAL

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Yeah. I think in terms of expectations on cat budget, we've been talking a lot about that
attritional ratio, and I think you leave that really with the (23:53) reinsurance side of things
and we hope to get some benefit of that. We have much more protection if it ever
happens a tax with lower guidance (24:00), I think it's up to you as how you (24:02) set
your numbers on that, if you want to move them very (24:04) slightly, then feel free. But
it's been (24:10)

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Paris, Hi. On the second point regards terms and conditions. I think you've got to split it
into two parts, and which is what's happening in the reinsurance world and then what's
happening in the reinsurance world.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the reinsurance side, there's definitely some push from both clients and brokers to
get some extended coverages, that may be in the form of extended hours clauses, some
kind of terror phrase into (24:42) some treaties and progress to (24:45) reinstatements. It
wasn't much beyond that, there were some other things that were tried but failed. We
obviously see that through the front end, but on the backend, we get the benefit of that
when we're buying retro. At the same time, we're also a very big buyer of marine treaty,
whether it be energy, marine. And there was some broadening of coverages there and
we obviously got the benefit of that.
On the insurance lines, to be honest, there hasn't yet been any push on terms and
conditions. It's all been about rating. I'm not saying that, that won't come in time. But at
the moment on the insurance lines, it's just rating pressure as opposed to terms of
conditions pressure.

Q - Operator
That is very clear. Thank you.
We now go to the line of Marcus Rivaldi at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Couple questions from me please. First of all, given what you have
been doing on retro reinsurance buying, I'm just wondering why you wouldn't have
thought you may need even less capital than you're guiding for to run the business than
the $1.4 billion or $1.45 billion you're talking about.
Secondly, on the protections that you're buying, if you were to sell (26:01) second loss
event on the 1/100 year, 1/250-year type of basis, would we see these numbers move up
very materially? Thank you.

That first question for Elaine in terms of (26:16)

FINAL

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Yeah. I guess there's a balance between having too much and having too little capital, and
we want to make sure that we've got enough capital to be able to absorb a reasonable
sized loss and be able to access the market after that.
And also – but we don't have any great view (26:37) of opportunities at the moment, but
they always start to come up, so we always have this kind of headroom (26:40) for that as
well. So there is a bit of a buffer built into our capital and you can always adjust it (26:47)
(26:48) we think that we'd rather have a little bit more cushion there, just so we can make
sure that we can run our business properly.

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

So does that mean that – I mean obviously I think this extra special today was a bit of a
surprise. Do you think you generally (27:02) have reset the capital base now to a sort of
level – was that the big (27:06) buffer that you don't really want go below?

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Well, probably a year, year and a half ago, we were seeing that we needed it at $1.6 billion
in capital, but a year ago, we were seeing we needed $1.5 billion in capital. Now we're
seeing we need $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion capital. So – and we've been bringing that down
and some of that is a reflection of outlook and some of that is a reflection of the
reinsurance program we saw (27:27) I think we're pretty comfortable at the level that
we're at. But as always, we will adjust our capital as we need to.

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Marcus, hi. On the second question, we changed the structure of our main retro program
this year and the main way we changed that was turned a lot more of it into reinstatable
limits. Last year, we had an aggregate product, which is very good. But what we were able
to do this year and, as Alex said, there are no more spend at both reduce or (27:59)
retention of that and get a vast majority of that limit reinstatable to give us that protection
for the second loss obviously helps from a capital point of view as well.
It does remain an element of aggregate coverage there. But the vast majority of it is
reinstatable. And on the marine coverages, we were able to secure additional – we
already had sideway but we were able to secure additional sideways in some of the
layers. And Pete, do you want to talk about Cathedral?

In terms of – as you know, we're more serial reinsurance buyers. Going back to Alex's
previous answer and picking up the question, we have effectively made savings on our
two property programs which are the larger 1/1s, the savings are larger than any rates
degradation on the inward book. To the extent there's been any terms and conditions
pushed, which in our world has largely been – small bit on the hours clauses which (29:01)
again, if you bear in mind our U.S. cat book is entirely regional, tends to play tornado and
therefore the hours clauses don't pick us up (29:09) too badly because it's through pretty
quickly.
We have in both cases bought more cover. But the more cover is lower and slotted (29:19)
underneath and we have more frequency cover down the bottom end of it. So again, it's
just buttoning the thing up within the benefit of the savings we've been able to make and
still leaves some residual savings.

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

So maybe just to sum up (29:33), and if I was looking at the Gulf of Mexico scenario, $235
million net first loss, where would that be on a second loss basis? Sounds like it would be
very similar, is that you're saying?

A - Peter David Scales

{BIO 15393236 <GO>}

Sorry. We lost you there.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Sorry. So just looking on the disclosure, so the 1/100 year Gulf of Mexico scenario, you say
$235 million (29:58) on the first loss. The second loss, would it be very similar, is that what
you're saying, ultimately something like that?

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Sorry, it won't be entirely similar, because some of that is on an aggregate basis but, as
Paul said, the majority of that is reinstatable, and that's the big difference year-on-year.

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Okay. And so I just wanted to follow up, and again, maybe this is the comments you've
been saying about being able to buy more effective reinsurance. Obviously, there have
been a lot of talk now (30:21) about offshore energy being very competitive and yet your
your worldwide book, anyway (30:25) you were able to grow that. Well, certainly, it's more
than what (30:29) we were thinking. Could you maybe give us some color on that please?

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Yeah. I think that's a pretty good (30:34) example of relevance. I mean, we are delighted
with the way we could grow that book. And how we could grow that book in Lloyd's. We
had massive support from clients and brokers. And in a number of cases, we had some
against the tide. We have got bigger lines on the programs we won, when others there's
not. And I think what you're going to see in the energy world increasingly is the sort of gap

Page 12 of 21

FINAL

between the people that can add value and those who can't is going to get bigger and
bigger.
So we still feel we can add value, we still think we can get sort of a better deal than some
others in the market. And we will leverage everything that we can, including reinsurance
spend, to get what we want. But that still doesn't exclude us from – the energy space will
be competitive this year and obviously, you've got the oil price factor as well. So I think in
terms of putting (31:34) example of us doing stuff in a very, very difficult market. And as I
said, you can only do that if you are important, relevant, whatever you want to call it,
reversing (31:45) clients and we've demonstrated that.

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

And just sort of follow-on there (31:49), would you say therefore if you look in that book,
the fact you've been able to grow hasn't resulted in, I guess, expectations of net
profitability changing – I mean growing, have you added in (32:01) top line (32:01) expense
or bottom line?

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

No. I mean look, we're not a top line underwriter, we never had been and there's no
willingness here just to write business for the sake of it, that's just not what we do. So if
the opportunity arrived now, we just wouldn't mind the business, that's the way we think.

Hi, guys, just two questions. The first one's on the Cathedral reserve release, can we just
get an understating, is that just a usual sort of quarterly good news type of release, or is
there any method changed within there that's fully aligned to Cathedral's reserving
(32:46) process to the Lancashire process?
And the second question relates to, I'll try not to use the world relevant, but given the
recent state of consolidation – the state of consolidation, could you give your thoughts on
what you expect the net outcome to be for Lancashire, i.e., on certain lines of business. Is
there any lines of business that you actually expect to see intensified competition within
as a result, or like Alex you mentioned in terms of the reinsurance opportunities, any good
benefits to arise?

FINAL

Sure, okay. So I'll take that one first and Peter will pick up more aligned with the next one
(33:19). So I think on the M&A front. We do see that that as an opportunity, if you think
about the guys that we bought into, Cathedral, from the H1 (33:32) Syndicate, an element
of that was they had a new owner, and they were looking for new owner. So I think M&A is
going to create opportunities for us.
There's going to be people available that maybe, we kind of got in the past and we're
definitely having some of those conversations as we speak. I think what's interesting, if
you look at some of these big deals, and if you look at cat in XLs a good (33:57) example.
There's kind of lots off lines of business, where they are quite big already. So let's just pick
energy as an example. In my view and I'm not the client, but it's unlikely the client is going
to give XL and cat then – (34:11) be combined amount of dollars that they currently get.
So one plus one doesn't always make two. So I don't believe that the stakes have been
raised massively in something like energy is a good example, because I just don't think
the clients are going to give one counterparty that amount of aggregate dollars. So I don't
think it changes a lot for us on our ability to trade. Every line of business we have at
Lancashire, we have capacity that sort of puts us in the top five, if you like, and I can't
really see that changing.

Bloomberg Transcript

But as I said from M&A, we actually see opportunity. And as you said, if we can get quality
underwriters in, the sort of checkbook is always open as long as it's business that we can
understand, and we've demonstrated we can grow. So if we can do more of that, we will.
And if we can't get the people, we won't.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

On the reserve release question, there's been no change in methodology, we still use the
(35:14) best estimate and there is going to be a lot of adjustment involved in that. (35:15)
There's enormous legal exercise that's (35:18) carried out in the fourth quarter, but with
the more sort of (35:21) Cathedral events (35:22) than at Lancashire just in terms of is it a
client (35:25) closing out. Well, if you're competing against the prior year, thinking that it
looks a bit chunky compared to prior year, just remember that you really picked up a
(35:32) couple months worth of Cathedral's performance in the prior year?

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Good afternoon. I've got three questions. Two for Alex, one for Peter. The two question
for Alex will be more I would say helicopter and strategical questions. The first one, Alex,
do you feel any pressure to adapt further the Lancashire business model to the
environment. We see you've been undertaking some changings over the past quarters. I
Page 14 of 21



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2015-02-12

mean is there anything you would like to adapt further. And connected to that, having in
mind the evolution of the cycle, I mean, do you feel any pressure to restate at some
stage the targets of producing a certain percent return on equity over – risk-free?

FINAL

And the question for Peter is that, could you comment a bit more on the ongoing
pressure on the Cathedral book as Air PI provided in the press patches (36:39) mainly
related to the Lancashire book? Thank you.

A - Peter David Scales

{BIO 15393236 <GO>}

(36:49)

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

On your first question, I think you just – you always have to adapt and evolve, and I think
that if you don't, you will be left behind. So I think we've demonstrated that. I think one of
the sort of funny things actually about M&A is that we've done M&A sometime ago, and
that was after that into (37:10) the market. I think us buying more reinsurance is adapting
to the market. So, yeah, I think you would have to adapt and evolve.

Bloomberg Transcript

We see ourselves as a purely specialty underwriting company. We would like to evolve
and have more specialty underwriting things. So we definitely like to do that. And as I said
again, getting back to Cathedral, the second you got Lloyd's platform, it opens you up to
more opportunity and it even opens you up to a bigger talent pool in underwriters that
maybe you can attract (37:44) to a structure outside of Lloyd's.
So if you look at that, if you look at sort of our capital page (37:51), we're pretty much
covered across what we want to be to attract the right talent. And as I said, you just have
to adapt to the market, and everything that we do every day is adapting to the market
that's changing really quickly.
And again, I think that's quite interesting. We – I personally don't believe there's anything
new this time, I still believe in the cycle. What is different is how quick things have
changed, but that might not necessarily be a bad thing. But then when it comes to returns,
we're comfortable with our stated return over the cycle. We sure think we can achieve
that and we're still outstripping that. If that changes, we'll, obviously come and tell
everyone where we are at the moment, and we're comfortable with that.

A - Peter David Scales

{BIO 15393236 <GO>}

On our part of the world, there's lots of similarities across Cathedral and Lancashire,
pretty much every line of business, there is rating pressure per se. So far as our renewals
that are heavily 1/1, the property treaty book, you probably take 10% off (39:02) as a rough
example if you blended the international book and the U.S. regional cat book. In terms of
T&C, some, given the hours clause, there's not much on the international. In terms of
aggregates, flat or down. In terms of savings on both sides of the book, the reinsurance
would outstrip the fall on the RPI people (39:30) coming in was outstripped to the
outwards much the same as last year. So from a net trading respective, manageable.

Page 15 of 21

Date: 2015-02-12

FINAL

The deal flow is great, no issues at all in signings. And that's because, again, we have very
long standing relationships with clients and fundamentally, we're underwriters. We
understand that we have good years and so do they, win-win (39:54) fundamentally a high
margin business. We -it's not like writing motor or something where it's small base your
very RPI functional (40:02). And so therefore, if there's a run of claim returns into the
market, then your clients – we fully expect to give them some money (40:13) and equally,
if we pay their client's losses, we fully expect them to pay us over a period of time.
So that just ebbs and flows the market on a consistent basis. And we think the biggest
value of being a leader in somewhere, where the clients would come to see you time and
time again, and you retain your business, is because you have that consistency. You're not
playing around a metric of you write it, you don't write it (40:35).

Bloomberg Transcript

On the direct property side, again you – funny enough I was (40:44) going through 1/1, the
prices on the binder delegation authority book are actually holding, if not creeping up a
little. So we've adjusted the portfolio, to see a little (40:53) more of that. The open
market is not much, goes through 1/1, and that will be very competitive. Again, we tend to
bounce out of the way from the big Fortune 500 stuff, which tends to be the more
commoditized stuff, where there will be bigger rate pressures built through the year.
Again, we bought lower – again, the savings we made on the outwards far outstripped
anything on the inwards. So again the story of net's pretty sensible.
If you want to go through the smaller classes, we can do and you can perhaps take this up
at the analyst presentation, but one question over time (41:30) . But that's basically (41:32)
the flavor of it. In terms of net trading position where we were, less of the same
exposure, better cover for it and again, we're not top line underwriters either. But net
book's in pretty good condition because we have a good solid consistent client base.

open.

Q - Olivia S. Brindle

{BIO 17273762 <GO>}

Hi, guys. I had two areas that I wanted to probe a bit further, I guess, expanding on things
you guys already mentioned. So, the first one is on the ROE and the second is on the
capital, so that's business-related. (42:08) On the ROE, you said you're comfortable with
the target across the cycle. But Alex, last quarter you also said that 15% is probably the
top end of what you'd expect in this current market, and I was wondering whether you
consider to expand on how you're thinking about that now bearing in mind that you have
reduced the capital base little bit? So, actually if you're still sort of in the same ROE range,
does that mean actually you're up to do earnings probably should trend down from what
you previously expected? And I know 1 percentage point of ROE seems cool, (42:43) but

Page 16 of 21



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2015-02-12

FINAL

it could be 10% of your earnings, so it's quite material. So, I guess, help (42:47) me
understand, how you're thinking about that?
And then on the capital itself, I appreciate that you're buying more reinsurance, et cetera,
but you did tell us at the third quarter, that you think the requirement would be $1.5 billion.
So, I mean, what really has changed that much between November and now, that would
reduce that by as much as a $100 million? And it seems like most of the market conditions
are actually fairly similar to what they were then. And sort of a final point, sort of related to
the capital requirement, again, at the third quarter you sort of said that you probably can't
go much below the $1.5 billion even if you bought more protection, because that's sort of
absolute sales requirement. So, I just wanted to understand how that makes sense with
what you're saying now about, if this is $1.4 billion or even less possibly?

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Fine. Okay. Obviously, all of that comments were a moment in time and things changed. I
think, we don't give out guidance. But for us to achieve 15% in this market is probably the
absolute top-end is probably 14%. But as I said, that would mean we'll have a very good
year, and that I think that'd be exceptional in this market. I think on the capital side, that's –
I'd love to leave that to Elaine. But I think, comps have emphasized enough, when you buy
a lot more capital efficient reinsurance what that does to your book. And remember that
our capital needs are just effectively about how much risk, how much net retained risk we
have on our books. So, if that changes dramatically as it has done at 1/1, that's why you're
seeing the capital needs change.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Yeah. (44:33) and we were able to decide the more capital efficient reinsurance, so we're
changing guidance from Q3 from $1.5 billion to $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion, so it's not a huge
drop. And it's nice to be able to buy something that was capital efficient, that allows to
just manage that data a little bit and reduce our exposure level.

Q - Olivia S. Brindle

{BIO 17273762 <GO>}

And to your comments that you made previously that there is some kind of absolute size
requirement you can't just keep going down and down and down, does that still hold, or
can you conceivably get much below even $1.4 billion?

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

You could possibly get lower than $1.4 billion. I think, we target into the $1 billion to $1.2
billion size range, then it's probably running (45:15) into issues with the rating agencies,
and again, it depends very much on market outlook.

A - Alexander Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Yeah, but on that, though, Olivia, so obviously, you've got the rating agency requirement,
but that's one requirement, that even if you didn't have to worry about that. We live in a
very gray world, where lot of issues can be strange and things can happen, and running
with too little cuts though would be a disaster. So, for us, there's always going to be a
Page 17 of 21



FINAL

buffer, there's always going to be a head room, obviously, that does create a slight drag
on your ROE. But at Lancashire, we do numbers on the kind of drag you get, so some
pretty substantial – sort of, once the capital, it's not really massive. It's not like we could
not cost $200 million and it really boosts our ROE. So, it's just wide enough that, how
much capital do you want to keep, how much you want to have in the bank. If something
does happen and if there's right opportunity, and like what we've always said, particularly
in this kind of environment, if opportunities come along you've got to move really quickly,
because that probably won't be here for long. So, there's no point sitting there with no
capital supply, when you really need it. And then it's just a debate about, how much
additional capital you want to hold versus the drag on your ROE.

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

Hi, there. Two things, firstly, could you just answer the question that I posed to begin with,
in terms of the impact of the increased line size for Cathedral's 3010 on gross written on
premium in 2015? Sorry, If I missed that. And secondly, also on Cathedral, in terms of the
profit commission that it earns, it looks like 2013 was a better combined ratio year than
2012, would that mean that mechanically, that number should go up when we go to the
end of 2015? Thank you.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

In terms of the impact on premium, we obviously did quite a lot in terms of the energy
and the terror book this year, so you'll see some incremental growth in those lines of
businesses with the (47:50) market growth there. And the aviation team joined us in the
later part of the year, so I think we'll be able to see (47:55) a much more significant
increase in there. And that new team can earn about $7 million, $7.5 million worth of
premiums in the fourth quarter. So, (48:06) and a fair bit that we can do with that. And in
terms of the PC, a lot of PC you see coming through that is off of the 2012 year, but also
add some recognition of 2013 in there, and we'll need to wait and see how the rest of
that year plays out. And (48:23) commissions you can recognize there, but 2012 was a

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. Just a very quick one on – out with reinsurance
spend. I mean, it's been a feature of the last few renewal periods, where a lot of the
inward pressure can be offset by further reinsurance buying at little cost or buying the
same, spending the same and getting more. I was just wondering, I mean, given current
rating trajectory, how much longer can that go on for? And I guess, linked to that is how
deep, how much deeper can the reinsurance get?

A - Alexander Maloney

Yeah. I think, if I knew the answer to that question, I probably won't be sitting here, quite
frankly. I don't know. I mean, people have a view that there's a floor in the market, I'm not
really sure if I also have (49:21) that view. ,So it will be interesting to see, how much further
reinsurance can go. I think, it sort of depends on the class of business as well. You have, I
mean, even on the long-range (49:33) side, you have seen some funds in particular, not
right capital and kind of do the right thing, we would think. So, I don't really know the
answer to that question. I think, it very much depends on the carrier. But as I said earlier, if
you think about the M&A that's going on, the M&A means, probably less reinsurance
spend, for the reinsurance companies. So, I don't know, I mean, I think it's going to be
competitive, and usually in our market, nothing changes until people have big losses.

A - Paul Gregory

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

I think, the one thing I'll just add to that, Jonny, is, and I agree with Alex, is it's almost how
long with a piece of string, (50:15) we don't really know. But while sit here relatively
comfortably, is we've got a book of business that's come as a combined ratio, 68%. So,
that does put in a far nicer position than a lot of others. It does continue to go down for a
period of time. And I think, if it does continue to go down, it will be those markets, with
those good underlying books of business with good combined ratios, obviously, going to
be better-positioned to ride it out.

Hello. Well, congratulations, all, on an another really excellent quarter. Having gotten some
of the amortization and other expenses associated with the Cathedral acquisition and
some drag on some claims from the big (51:11) for you. It's good to see Lancashire kind of
back in the saddle there. But I would like to ask a couple of things, it seems like there's a
lot of latent value that may not be obvious, potentially, just there's (51:27) some major
catastrophe loss, a big super cat of some sort. Could you explain a little bit more about
how Kinesis might be able to access alternative sources of capital, and perhaps, write an
enormously greater amount of that coverage, compared to what's written now?

Page 19 of 21

And then, the other question has to do with this dormant syndicate at Cathedral that has
grown it's stamp capacity quite substantially over the period after the acquisition. It seems
that, that might not show up on the book value, but might in fact, if we were to have a
market value, you can see much more valuable than when it was acquired?

FINAL

A - Darren Redhead

{BIO 17995744 <GO>}

Yup. Good morning, Frank. (52:28) Thanks very much for the question. Just got a link to
that, yes, if there was a, if you like, a sizeable dislocation within the market, we'd have
three patterns within the group of the Kinesis, Cathedral and mother ship, to grow and
take the advantage of, but we feel we could, with our existing partners, grow Kinesis
dramatically, say to $1 billion that would then, if you like, treble the existing fees. And more
so, Lancashire will be an investor in that, so the whole point of Kinesis is to build up a
stable portfolio track record. But then, have the ability to grow as and when the market it
takes, so, yes, though. (53:05) But in no time soon do we see that happening, but we'll
still continue the organic growth at Kinesis in the difficult market.

{BIO 15393236 <GO>}

Hi, Frank, (53:16) Peter. On the 3010 part of the world is the only difference between 3010
and 2010 is that Lancashire Group owned 58% of the capacity in the business of 2010 and
100% of 3010. All of the underwriters and all the business lines are managed in exactly
the same way. And all of the traders' need to (53:40) the lines basically play what they
see in front of them, that's always been the business, all (53:45) in terms of calling where
we go in the market. The Syndicate 2010, to the extent it has 42% out, does have a
trading price that people wishing to participate within the lowest market and 3010 doesn't
trade. So, arguably, if one day it did or third-parties will access it, I'm sure some of them
will pay (54:06) the premiums to be on it, or if one day you end up putting the two
together. Again, it would have some sort of market trading price, there's no doubt about
that. But it is what it is, and fundamentally, we as a group, don't see whether you work for
2010 or 3010, any difference between it, it's another line of business managed in the
same way and the exposures are all brought together in the same way. So, it's just a
maths exercise between it, Frank.

I think, as well, Frank, while we're delighted with Cathedral, the purchase of Cathedral is
that, it backs up our view that the price we pay for Cathedral was worth paying. Because
when you got a quality franchise in Lloyd's, you can grow and you can do what we've
done. If we had bought a syndicate in Lloyd's that didn't have the track record that
Cathedral has, it'd be very hard to grow, because Lloyd's would put a lot of restrictions on
you. So, I think, it just reinforces the price we paid for Cathedral, and the kind of things we
can do with that business, and obviously, if we can grow it even more organically, we will,
and that would just add to the value even more.
