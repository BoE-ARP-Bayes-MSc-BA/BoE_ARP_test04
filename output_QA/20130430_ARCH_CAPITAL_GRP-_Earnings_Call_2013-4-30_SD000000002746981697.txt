Thank you, Allison. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We began
the year with an excellent First Quarter from just about every perspective. Earnings was
solid, connectivity was benign [ph], as they say, thank you God. And premium growth
occurring lines where we can produce attractive ROEs. On an operating basis, we earned
$1.17 per share, which produced an annualized 13.9 return on equity for the First Quarter.
On a net income basis, we earned $1.85 per share, which corresponds to a 20.4%
annualized ROE. This trend of net ROE exceeding operating ROE has changed for Arch
since '08 when we began allocating more of our investable assets to alternative
investments that in many cases need to be accounted under the equity map. If we had
made these investments directly and not through third-party fund managers, the yield
from these fixed asset high yield income assets would've been accounted as investment
income.
Over the past four years, our annual operating ROE has trailed our net ROE by an
average of 5.2%. By comparison, for the '02 to '08 period, operating ROE on average
exceeded net ROE by 1.9%. Of course, I want to remind you net income remains more
volatile than operating income as foreign exchange equity markets and interest rate
movements affect market valuations -- market values. However, our shift alternative
investments over the past few years has enabled Arch to enhance total return and book
value in our accretion. Our reported results in the First Quarter were excellent, aided by
the lack of CAT activity, favorable result developments, and accident year improvements
as reflected by a combined ratio of 84.6%. Our investment performance was also good
as we achieved a total return of 50 basis points, including the effects of foreign
exchange, despite a slight upward movement of interest rates during the quarter. Our
operating cash flow for the quarter was $205 million, an increase of $61 million over a year
ago.
The book value per common share increased 4.1% to $37.66 at March 31, and increased by
13% relative to the First Quarter of a year ago. The insurance market continues to recover
with noticeable improvements in rates from last quarter. In our insurance operations,
which gives us a good indication because we have more granular data. We experienced
rate increases in the quarter over 300 basis points in excess of lost rent, exceeding last
quarter's weaker [ph] margin improvement by 100 bips. These improvements on a lineby-line basis range from minus 100 basis points, some line still get rate reductions, to as
high as a positive 1600 basis points.

The movement of business from the admitted market back to the ENS market is ongoing.
This provides us with additional opportunities, and in March of this year we expanded our
underwriting platform in the excess and surplus lines market by starting binding authority
with insurance facility that caters to small accounts written through the wholesale
distribution channel. This platform extension has been in our plans for some time now, but
the right combination of available talent and a favorable market environment led us to act
now. In our view on an absolute basis, most long-term casualty business, based on current
interest rate environment, still requires more rate improvement to meet our return
requirements.
Regarding new versus renewal pricing, our monitoring systems indicate details of two
cities. In certain lines, new business pricing is stronger than renewal pricing. For our book
of business, this is true for approximately one third of our product lines. Unfortunately, two
thirds of them, which is the remaining of the book, still showing weaker new business
pricing relative to renewal pricing. As a general rule, the long-tail product lines have new
business pricing that is weaker than renewal pricing. On a consolidated basis, gross
premiums were up 9.1%, and net premium were up 10.3% for the First Quarter this year.
Looking at growth by segment, the Insurance Group global premium was flat on a gross
basis and rose 3% on a net basis as we reduce our participation in our UK professional
facility due to the lack of positive rate movement in the European markets. The
reinsurance group's premium volume was up 25% on a gross basis and 20% on net.
These increases primarily resulted from several opportunities, generally emanating from
the same sector as we mentioned in our call last quarter.
Groupwide, on an expected basis, we believe the ROE on the business we wrote this
year we will produce an underwriting year ROE in the range of 11% to 13%. The
underwriting margin improvements that I mentioned earlier will affect expected ROE
positively as they will more than offset the reduction in expected investment of yield
reductions. During the First Quarter, we repurchased 931,000 shares at a cost of $41
million. We remain in excess capital position, and our position has been and continues to
be to return excess capital to shareholders unless we can deploy it effectively in our
business. As we have discussed before, we always take several factors into consideration,
including where our stock is trading relative to our expectations of forward ROE.
Before I turn it over to Mark, let me update you on our agreement to purchase assets or
PMI and CMG and also provide an update on our PMLs. Earlier this year, we announced
that Arch is seeking to purchase masses of PMI and CMG. We are in the process of
attempting to obtain the required approvals from various regulators. The Arizona
receivership court and the GSE's, this process takes time. If the approvals are obtained,
we will not expect the transaction to close until at least the latter part of this year. The
current hearing date with the Arizona receivership court is set for May 20th, but this date
is subject to change. We also cannot predict the timing of any decision by the court since
that will be driven by the court process.
Now, let me update you on our CAD PML aggregates. As of April 1st, 2013, our largest
250-year PMLs for a single event were basically unchanged. With $886 million in the
Northeast or 18% of common shareholders equity, with $798 million in the gulf where our
Florida Tri-County PML now stands at $582 million. Early indications, and we're still doing a

lot of work in this area for RMS version 13 suggests that the model will reduce wind PMLs
ranging from zero to down 10% in peak zones compared to our proprietary view.
Northeast and Tri-County PMLs would decline by approximately 5%, where the Gulf of
Mexico exporters will be roughly flat. Other areas will be reduced by approximately 10%.
With that, let me turn it over to Mark to comment further on our financial results. Mark?

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Great. Thank you, Dinos. And good morning, everyone. The consolidated combined ratio
for this quarter, as Dinos has mentioned, is 84.6% with 1.5 points of current accident year
CAT related events that are net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums compared to
the 2012 First Quarter combined ratio of 90.1%, which reflected 3.4 points of CAT related
events. Net losses from 2003 [ph] First Quarter catastrophic events totaled $11.2 million,
primarily emanating from Australian tropical storm Oswald. As for 2012 super storm Sandy,
our current estimate remains consistent with our view last quarter. The 2013 First Quarter
consolidated combined ratio also reflected 7.1 points of prior year net favorable
development, net of reinsurance of related acquisition expenses compared to an
identical 7.1 points of prior period development on the same basis in the 2012 First
Quarter. This results in a 90.2% current accident year combined ratio excluding CAT for
the First Quarter 2013 compared to 93.8% accident year combined ratio in the First
Quarter of 2012.
Approximately 90% of the net favorable development in the 2013 First Quarter was in the
reinsurance segment with approximately 70% of that due to net favorable development
on short tailed lines concentrated in the more recent underwriting years, despite further
upper development in 2012 crop losses, which amounted to 3.3 points on the reinsurance
segment First Quarter loss ratio. Furthermore, roughly 12% of the reinsurance segments
net favorable development was attributable to median tailed lines spaced throughout
many underwriting years and about 18% due to net favorable development on longer
tailed lines primarily from the 2002 to 2005 underwriting years. The remaining net
favorable development in the 2013 First Quarter was attributable to the insurance
segment and was mainly driven by shorter tailed lines. Similar to prior periods,
approximately 68% of our $7 billion of total net reserves for loss and loss adjustment
expenses are IVR, additional case reserves, which is fairly consistent ratio across both the
reinsurance and insurance segments.
On a consolidated basis, the First Quarter of 2013 expense ratio was 50 points lower
relative to the prior year comparable quarter, wholly due to a lower net acquisition
expense ratio. The net reduction of 50 points was due to an amalgam of forces, such as
the overall insurance reinsurance mixture, the excess of loss for pro-rata blend in the
reinsurance segment, the wholesale versus retail versus managing general agent mix in
the insurance segment, along with the insurance segments changing net to gross ratio.
Premium tax shift between admitted and non-admitted, and the ongoing commented
upon every quarter, strategic shift towards smaller account business which carries a higher
commission ratio.
The other operating expense ratio was flat relative to the First Quarter of 2012 but
improved 80 basis points relative to the Fourth Quarter of 2012 on a sequential basis. This

improvement occurred despite the incremental addition to expense due to select
platform expansion in both our reinsurance and insurance businesses. The ratio of net
premium to gross premium in the quarter on a consolidated basis was 81.9% versus 81%
even a year ago. The reinsurance segment, the net to gross was 94.1% in the 2013 First
Quarter compared to 98.1% a year ago, reflecting more retro purchases, protecting their
property book. The insurance segment added 73.2% ratio compared to 71.3% a year
earlier as a result of their ongoing strategy to grow the less volatile, smaller account
businesses and reduced exposure in higher severity businesses. Overall, on a
consolidated basis, the First Quarter of 2013, as Dinos has mention, saw a 9.1% gross
written premium growth, and 10% growth on the net written basis. The reinsurance
segment grew by 20% where as the insurance segment grew by approximately 3%.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the reinsurance segment, the 2013 accident quarter are combined ratio, excluding CAT,
was 79.2% compared to 82.8% in the 2012 First Quarter. The reinsurance segments results
this quarter reflect changes in the mix of business, on a written basis, with a higher
contribution for more reinsurance, multiline, and life businesses than in the First Quarter of
2012. Net premium growth of approximately 20% was seen throughout both the treaty
and the facultative units. The 2013 First Quarter results for the reinsurance group has
been true since the 2012 Second Quarter includes the effect of the April 2012 acquisition
of the international credit maturity operations, the variable rate out of Switzerland. Net
premiums earned for this acquisition for the 2013 First Quarter were approximately $12
million with the remaining on the premium reserve as of March 31st of $24 million. I will
likely not comment on this during the next call as both year Second Quarter's will have had
the acquisition reflected.
In the insurance segment, the 2013 accident quarter combined ratio excluding CAT, was
97.9% compared to an accident quarter combined ratio of 99.7% a year ago. This
improvement is primarily due to poor margin expansion on an earned basis and mix of
business changes. Margin expansion in our core U.S. insurance operations continued this
quarter with a weighted average 330 basis point improvement over the First Quarter of
2012.
As Dinos has mentioned, this average ranged from having margin contraction in some
units, such as healthcare, up to 1000 to 1600 basis point core margin improvements in
construction, excess comp, and some specialty casualty lines. Even lines of businesses
experiencing margin contraction still achieve positive effective rate increases this quarter.
These figures represent the excess of written effective rate increases over estimated lost
trend and provide continuing evidence of improving market conditions. As always, we
make mix of business decisions based on our view of the absolute returns and not
relative improvements alone.
The insurance segment had net written premium growth predominately emanating from
the U.S. operations was represents approximately 70% of the worldwide volume. The U.S.
operations grew net written premium by 11.4% with partially offsetting reductions
elsewhere around the world, as Dinos has noted. The U.S. growth came predominantly
from programs, construction, national accounts, and A&H businesses with a continued
reduction in U.S. casualty lines and declines in tech risk across geographies. The program
unit saw growth primarily from underlying quote-unquote same store rate of exposure

increases, reflecting improvements in economic conditions, compounded by an
improvement -- improving level of rate increase. Additionally, some newer and regain
programs have experienced ramp up traction compared to a year ago.
Construction and national account businesses had exceptional renewal retentions, strong
new business, rateable exposure growth, and favorable audit premiums. The total return
on our investment portfolio was 50 bips in the 2013 First Quarter, reflecting strong return
on equities in alternatives and flat to negative returns on fixed income investments.
Excluding foreign exchange, total return was 101 bips in the 2013 First Quarter. Our
embedded pre-tax book yield, before expenses, was 2.45% as of March 31st compared
to 2.6% at December 31st, 2012, while the duration of the portfolio shortened slightly to
2.94 years, reflecting our conservative view and position on duration and the current yield
environment. Our exposure to Euro-zone countries is listed in the supplement with
continued minimal exposure at countries undergoing severe economic hardship.
Reported net investment income in the 2013 First Quarter was $66 million or $0.48 per
share versus approximately $74 million or $0.53 per share in both the 2012 Fourth Quarter
and the First Quarter of 2012. The $8 million decline in net investment income relative in
this quarter -- in this quarter, relative to 2012 Fourth Quarter has resulted from several
factors. First, $2.2 million increase in investment expenses, that includes $1.3 million of cost
on a certain alternative investment fund where some expenses were recognized
disproportionately to actual funding contributions and should not be considered an
ongoing run rate effect. Secondly, a $1.9 million reduction occurred relative to the Fourth
Quarter of 2012 associated with inflation adjustments on U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities or TIPS. These adjustments are lumpy, due to fluctuations in the unseasonably
adjusted monthly consumer price index as evidenced by last quarter's $1 million
contribution to income and this quarter's $900,000 reduction to income.
Thirdly, there was a reduction in gross income related to TALF assets, which contributed $1
million to income in the 2012 Fourth Quarter partially offset by $200,000 of interest
expense and were sold prior to year end. Lastly, the balance is due to the effects of the
reduction in the embedded yield on the fixed income portfolio, smaller investable base
for income producing assets due to the decreased allocation to the alternative and equity
asset classes and the impact of our share repurchases totaling $213 million over the last
two quarters. Our effective tax rate on pretax operating income for the First Quarter of
2013 was an expense of 1.7% compared to a benefit of 1% even in the First Quarter of
2012. This estimate -- sorry, this rate is an estimate of the full year effective tax rate that is
based on one quarter of actual results and three-quarter forecasted results. Fluctuation
from the effective tax rate can result from variability in the relative mix of income or loss,
reported by jurisdiction along with forecast variance for the last nine months of the 2013
year.
Current quarter preferred dividend expense of $5.5 million was identical to the third and
Fourth Quarters of 2012 but approximately $1 million less than the preferred dividend
expense occurring in the 2012 First Quarter. As discussed on last quarter's call, this
reduction relative to the 2012 First Quarter is due to the refinancing of our preferred
shares by retiring our series A and B classes and replacing them with a more effective
series C class. The $5.5 million is the true quarterly run rate. Our total capital was $5.74

billion at the end of the 2013 First Quarter, up 3% relative to year end 2012 and up 9.5%
relative to the First Quarter of 2012.
During this quarter, we repurchased $41 million of our common stock at an average 1.19
multiple to book value which had a 4% impact on book value per share. Our debt to
capital ratio remains low at 7% and debt plus hybrids represents only 12.6% of our total
capital giving us significant financial flexibility. We continue to escalate having capital in
excess of our targeted capital position. Book value per share was $37.66, as Dinos also
noted, which represents a 4.1% increase versus year-end 2012 and 13% gain relative to
March 31st of last year. This growth in book value per share primarily reflects the
Company's strong operating results. With these introductory comments, we are now
pleased to take your questions.

(Operator Instructions)
Please stand by for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Michael
Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Hi, thank you. Hi. Dinos, I was wondering if you could elaborate a bit on your comment
about the new versus renewal business. What would drive a company or carrier to give a
business that has adequate margin? It doesn't seem like we are seeing capital stream to
any meaningful degree in any segment of the market. I'm just curious.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

For many -- I think we introduce a system which I described in detail about five years ago.
We went through these elaborate exercise not only on class-rated classes that the
insurance service offerings [ph] will give us exposure times rate type of statistics so we
can compare things. Everything that is in specialty lines we created. Systems that monitor
us on an exposure basis the rate we get for like exposures independent if it's new
business or renewal. And we monitor that across the enterprise.
We have our pricing actuaries, independent of the underwriters, do that. We do it
electronically. This way, there's no playing with the numbers. You know the old story.
Figures never lie but liars figure. We are consistent with that approach. So what I reported
is what is happening in the marketplace.

FINAL

Now, for one-third of our business, that means there is more distress or at least
perception of distress in those classes by -- predominantly is by the admitted markets.
They are throwing that business into the ENS market, because this phenomenon is
happening mostly in the E&S market. So in certain sectors, even though there is ample
capacity in general, there is not enough capacity.
I will give you the most acute example. If you have contractors in New York because of the
tough labor laws, et cetera, it's almost impossible to place today. Clearly, the renewed
books, which most carriers have and they have better relationships with customers, get a
certain price and new business that is trying to find a place, for whatever reason, because
they've been expelled or non-renewal by others, they are paying a much higher price. I'm
just reporting what we are monitoring.
I wish 100% of the business, you would've been behaving like that. Then we really have a
hard market. But we don't. Two-thirds, as I said in my prepared remarks, still indicate
highly competitive market conditions with new business pricing lower on a comparison to
the same exposure to renewal business. So that's the facts. Do I have a complete
explanation as to why it's happening? No, but it's good to measure and it's good to have
a view into the marketplace because you can direct your underwriters as to where to step
on the break versus step on the accelerator.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Very thoughtful, thank you so much. I guess to dovetail on that with your E&S, moving from
admitted to E&NS markets, I'm trying to square that with the fact that we are still seen
admitted carriers talk about on the spectrum the highest rate gains versus much more
mixed in specialty and E&S lines. How does all that kind of fit into the way you are
perceiving the market right now?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well the admitted market, is predominantly a market of class rated business to a great
extent. There is file rate and exposure times rate. It is measurable, et cetera. The E&S
market is more aligned to freedom not only on terms and conditions but rate. Sometimes
it's not just premium going up, it's the effective change because of more restrictive terms
that have to be interpolated into pricing increases.
So the two separate markets -- let me give you an example to make the point. When you
look in the property lines, our E&S is showing new business being priced at or better
renewal, where on global accounts, which is more on an admitted basis, we showed the
exact opposite, and both lines are property lines.
Not always a great explanation why it's happening, but -- if a standard carrier is not willing
to write a property line because it used to be an old package policy that he had section
one, section two, and they don't like the property anymore and they throw it into the E&S,
that would be all new pricing. It has nothing to do with file rate. Mark, do you want to
elaborate?

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

FINAL

Just one piece of color to add. To contrast, a property piece of business being thrown
over back to the surplus [ph] markets versus casualty, I think you find the property units
are recognizing that exposure difference more so than where it came from and more
pricing adjustments and terms and conditions adjustments are happening.
On the casually site, it's a little more irrational. It's a longer-duration business. There is, I
think, more of not quite a feeding frenzy, but I think there's a lot more competitors going
after that, and it may be ameliorating some of the increases that you are seeing on the
casualty side.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Great. Mark, just one quick follow-up, if I could. It looks like the portfolio turnover is pretty
high. I'm guessing there's a subset of the investment portfolio that's turning over more
rapidly than the rest. Could you just give a little bit of color on that and kind of how that
dovetails with your investment strategy? Thanks.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think you mostly you'd see the turnover in treasuries. We look to take advantage of
some -- well, generally most of the options that occur. Also, to take advantage of the
different points on the curve, when you may have a 7-year bond and then you hold it for a
while and you could resell it as a two-year -- a five-year bond and differentials that you can
take on those. There hasn't been a lot of turn on the municipal side, for example.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

So you have one segment of the portfolio that's turning over may be several times?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yes, I think that's right.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thank you.

Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse.
Please go ahead.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

My first question is on the margins. If I exclude the Costa Concordia and oil rig losses from
1Q last year, and maybe you don't think that's a fair adjustment, but if I do that, it looks like
the accident year ex-CAT loss ratio deteriorated just a little bit. I'm curious why we aren't
seeing some improvement there given the pricing environment.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

FINAL

I don't know what numbers you are referring to, but that's not accurate. Let me give you
the specifics on the margin improvement. When we look on a written basis, comparison to
our entire portfolio, we had an improvement over the loss trend of 3.3%. When you look
at it on an earned basis, it was approximately 1.9%. This is on an entire portfolio. So if you
pick one or two losses, it won't tell you very much.
What you've got to look is you have to look at the book of business and where is the -you know, where is the pricing and how that compares to the prior underwriting year. We
do all of our calculations on an underwriting year basis. What we are writing this year
versus what we wrote a year ago. But if you want more granular information, I will turn it
over to Mark, who is usually a lot more up-to-date to the granularity of that exercise.
Mark?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Dinos is right. The earned affect is really a consequence of the individual decisions you
make on the written basis. You know, Dinos's point, your earn will lag the improvement
associated with the written change. If things stay constant for the next three quarters and
we maintain a 330-basis-point spread, then that's what you should see on an earn basis,
assuming annual policies as it bleeds through.

Bloomberg Transcript

Mix is always a big issue here. On both sides, insurance and reinsurance side. So I think by
controlling for line of business and business type mix and things like that is the real
difference that we look at that doesn't jump out at you from the summarized results.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

You know, and to emphasize that, if you don't get into the mix, you will get to totally a
different conclusion. I will give you an example. If you are writing a short-tail property
business that basically you need to write to 80 combined, meaning 50 loss ratio and 30
expense ratio, and then you are writing casualty business that you can write to 90
combined, 60 loss ratio and 30, both of them economically equivalent. If you change that
mix, you might show an aggregate accident year, lower or higher, but you draw the wrong
conclusions by not looking at what changes in the mix.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

And the 330 basis points on the written basis, I think that's higher than last quarter. Is
there any particular lines you can point to where the rate momentum is coming from?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes. I will turn it over to Mark.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yes, certainly. Dinos commented on some. Let me explain it into two pieces. We are
seeing still some fairly significant margin expansion and lines of business that are

Page 10 of 25

FINAL

improving but still not making the cut. So some of the longer-tailed lines Dinos referenced
in his comments, they are improving, we're glad to see that. They are not quite there to
turn it to green-light status.
However, some other profit centers such as our loss-sensitive profit centers, in
construction and national accounts, where the pricing has not fallen anywhere near as
much as some other lines of business, we are seeing some very good recovery there to
the point that they are into the green category where they may have been in yellow in the
past. I could do others, but I think they're probably the two best pockets of example.

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

You have to understand about their strategy. Berkshire Hathaway has been in the E&S
market in many different ways, either through insurance transactions or directly writing it. I
don't know what their plans are. I think they hired four excellent executives. Talent always
is hard to find, and they found four talented executives to join them, so I think it's a
positive for them. Beyond that, Berkshire was always in the E&S market, and will continue
to be.

Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Two quick questions. First of all, can you
share your thoughts on the upcoming June 1st renewals? How do you expect that to play
out for the marketplace?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It's a bit early as of yet, because there is a war between brokers' request versus
underwriter's offerings. Not a lot of firm orders have been placed. Our expectation

FINAL

though should be around 5% to 10% reduction. That's what we are expecting. But there is
-- there is changes. In different parts of the country and if it's in a nationwide program
versus Florida-only program or Northeast.
Let me give you an example. In the Northeast, we got anywhere from plus 2 to 3 to as
high as plus 10 on layers that they had in effect from Sandy. On high access layers that
Sandy didn't effect, the reduction was anywhere from minus 2 to minus 10, depending on
programs.
Likewise, we have renewal nationwide programs and significant ones that we have from
orders already at only minus 5%. Some people expected much worse than that. For most
of the Florida business, it's happening as we speak, so I don't have a lot of flavor -- Mark,
do you have any more color to that? We will know in a few weeks. Our expectation is
somewhere between 5% and 10% rate reduction.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. That's helpful. I guess the only other question, I'm not sure if I missed this in the
opening remarks, can we revisit the discussion on capital management for the remainder
of the year just based on the current multiple and how the stock is trading?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I mean, we usually look at three different factors. Where can we deploy capital in our
operations? Where are we trading in the multiple that the market is giving us, and then
what is our projected ROE? Our ROE, we are getting more optimistic that is going up. I
don't know if we do a lot more of share repurchases at the time being unless share price
movements propel us to do that because we can get our shares cheaper than we can get
them today.
On the basis that we still have this transaction that we need to close on and we have to
re-estimate as to how much capital we can deploy in that. Plus, there is a few other things
we're looking at in any market. You see opportunities. Nothing that is imminent, but you
never know. So we will take all of that into consideration, and then we will make decisions.
Our principal of returning excess capital to shareholders hasn't changed. We will find a
way to do it. We think a special dividend is appropriate, we might even do that.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

As a follow-up to Dinos, if you think back to our thinking, you heard us say before that we
were guided by that matrix that we have on the website but we are not bound by it. If you
go back and look at what we have traded at over the quarter, it's pretty close to an everincreasing sequence from 122 book up to about 148 Fourth Quarter book value. It was
really about mid-February that we crossed off say the 133 line, which you can kind of rough
yeoman's way say 10% returns times three is really that ballast point. So we weren't in any
hurry really to go in excess of that at that point.
Now, with the increase in book value, we are trading as of yesterday probably a little
south of 14. To echo Dinos's comments, we have to look at things relative to where it's

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. With the shifts in reinsurance pricing through April and June,
what is your sense of modeled return on equity for that business, for property CAT?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It's still very, very good. You know, it's high double-digit ROE. You need to write it at that
level, otherwise you shouldn't. You are talking about purely CAT XOL, right?

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes. It is a highly volatile line, at the end of the day, you have to be north of the 15% to
write that business on an expected basis, you know. That's our attitude.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

So when you say high double digits, that means high teens ROE?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

On the reinsurance business, I know that the way the premium comes in, it can be lumpy.
It has been running at well over 20% for at least five quarters. I would just like to get a
sense for modeling purposes when that may lap each other and when that rate of growth
may slow, or would that continue for all of 2013 just based on the contracts you currently
have in place?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well contracts are annual. They either get renewed or not. What guides us in making
decisions is the profitability of the book of business that we would like to reinsure. As we
said in prior quarters, a lot of that growth came from the UK. It came from a couple of
Page 13 of 25



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2013-04-30

FINAL

contracts we wrote on the mortgage base. If those get renewed, you will have the
growth. If they don't, you won't.
You know, it's lumpy business, reinsurance. We take contract by contract. We look at the
opportunity. We have plenty of capital to support those contracts. If we are given
opportunity by the clients to continue to provide the capacity for them, we will do it. If not,
we won't. You know, it's based on, is it a profitable opportunity for us or not? That's when
we make the decision to continue or not.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Jay, I would just add, what are the other takeaways, especially in the UK motor. You
shouldn't look at that as the book of business. You should look at it as a few large
contracts. Hence, Dinos's point about rebinding them or renewing them or not. It's what is
driving it. Because it's not a big book of business.

Q - Jay Gelb

Thank you. And your next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.
Please proceed.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. The first question is on growth in the primary insurance. Within the US,
that seems to have picked up. Could you help me understand if you are getting more
positive on that business, because you also mentioned that you're starting a new E&S
business.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I will let Mark give you the breakdowns. You are looking at the overall growth. Actually in
the US, we have grown. We have shrunk in Europe, including Australia. That was a
proactive action on our part because on a certain segment of business, we weren't
getting enough rate improvement to overcome trend.
You can't stay at the same rates and be happy continuing to renew what's expiring when
trend is going to continue to move up. At some point in time, you say, is this going to be
an acceptable ROE business or not? That's what happened. Mark, do you want to give any
of the details there?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Sure, sure. I think what you'll see, some of that you can deduce from our prepared
comments, but in the US, the growth in the loss-sensitive areas, which is construction and
national accounts, we have growth in programs as we also commented on. We have
some growth in surety, which is really a new team coming in and putting their view on
Page 14 of 25

things and expanding that into commercial surety, not just contract surety. Our A&H
business is really ramping up, and so it's large percentage increase compared to prior.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

On a small base.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

On a small base. And property on a net basis saw some traction in the Insurance Group.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

So what did you (inaudible) in the US?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

The US grew 11%.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Offset by reduction in Europe.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Great. And you expect Europe to continue to decline, or do you expect that to flatten out
in the future?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well we expect for the balance of this year to probably see relative to Second Quarter
2012, Third Quarter 2012 probably some additional reductions like we saw in this quarter.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

The same level reductions in comparison. You know, we reduced program participation,
so in essence until it laps over to one year, you are going to have the comparables, and
we've got two more quarters to go.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. Okay, that's helpful. Secondly, on the net investment, that fell pretty meaningfully
this quarter. Just wanted to get the run rate normally for that. To the existing numbers to
add back to $1.3 million higher expense, should we also add back the $1.9 million of the
TIPS, or is that not such a high --

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well if you do that, you are basically saying that we should see zero on TIPS on a goforward basis.

Page 15 of 25

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

FINAL

It can reemerge entirely or it can be -- the side might switch entirely. I would say for -- and
this is a rough guess on my part -- probably half the reduction is nonrecurring and the
other half is probably the effect of lower interest. To me if this quarter was normal, we
probably would've seen investment income going from approximately $74 million or $73
million. Don't forget, $1 million of the $74 million was under our officially high last quarter to
come down to about $70 million.
But like I said, we don't pay tremendous -- I know you've got to do your models and all of
that. That's why it went through this whole explanation between net income ROE versus
operating ROE. We are not changing our definition, but also we are not going to change
our strategy that we're going to try to maximize total return on an investable asset.
Independent if we are going to take some investment income hits for total return
because of accounting and structure issues.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

One other comment that perhaps helped you. I think that was probably a good view that
Dinos just provided you, but you got to think of it, we are kind of in a point of inflection
with regards to net investment income. A lot of the alternative investments, as Dinos has
mentioned, wind up showing their returns below lines instead of above the line, but there
are a handful that will show some above the line benefit, but those are just ramping up.
So for the balance of 2013, that kind of average Dinos talked about is probably
reasonable. But there is positive forces that could push that higher than that level in either
the very end of 2013 or end of 2014.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

What Mark is telling you, Vinay, is we try to, even with outside managers, to structure
transactions, especially on the high-yield fixed income kind of strategies that we have that
we can recognize the investment income as such and not account it under the equity
method as realized gains. But accounting is not that simple anymore. They've got 42,000
rules that I have to take three Advil every time I sit with the accountant to discuss it.
Sometimes they're nonsensical to begin with.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

But to Dinos's key point about we are driven by the economics, not the accounting. The
analogy on the business side is worker's compensation. If the industry was bound by how
that is booked on excess worker's compensation, there would be no market.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Bank. Please proceed.

FINAL

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. First of all, given the growth in programs, I assume one or two
programs over the last few quarters that have been contributing to that. Do we expect
that to slow down starting in 3Q?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

No. We don't. We are getting more traction on, as I said, regained programs or pieces of
programs, but in the core same-store, we are seeing some, I think, level of increasing
ratable exposures. And the flip-flop of having audit premiums be positive, not negative
like they've been in the past.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

So that means the economy is improving so the exposure base on some of our clients is
going up so they generate more premiums. Also, there has been rate increases and
significant. Don't forget, that's the area we complete a lot with the standard markets,
even though these are specialty programs. We still issue a lot of (inaudible) paper. We
have fire rates, et cetera, and you compete with the likes of Traveler's and Chubb and
CNA. These carriers, you are listening to their calls, et cetera and we've seen in the
market. They are pushing for rate. They are getting it. In essence, our agents that they
produce the business for our MGUs, they're getting rate increases. I think that will
continue.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

As the market improves, does that mean there will be more competition for programs
that you guys have or others have, or that actually would want to be bidding on more
programs?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I think you are going to see that would be more programs make the cut for us because of
rate improvements and they are looking for a better home. Don't forget, we are a good
home for programs. We're an A plus company, we have great systems. Our service is very
good and we have that kind of reputation.
As a matter of fact, the MGUs that we have, a dozen or so of these that we have, we had
them for 10 years, and they are all been with us for a long period of time, so we are
welcoming new programs as long as they can make the profitability goals that we have.
But a lot of our growth is coming from our existing programs, because they are gaining
them both. Additional exposure units, as the economy is starting to improve on same
customers that they have and also new customers coming into the program on existing
business.

Okay. That works. And in terms of thinking about -- everyone complains, I've complained
about the insurance combined ratio. A lot of your peers have better combined ratios than
you have, and they are showing that again right now. To what extent do you think that the
current booking is aggressive by the marketplace today and to what extent you think you
are being conservative right now in your insurance segment?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I have a hard time trying to get mine as accurate as I can because that's the only
statements I sign, so I'm not going to worry about the rest of the market. I can tell you, we
feel comfortable when we are booking things. We do a lot of analysis. Like I said many
times before, for the first two or three years, four years or so, the accident year is the
self-grading exam. The real exam comes when the books mature.
Without knowing exactly what others write and what processes they are going and
estimating with the current accident year should or shouldn't be, I can't comment on that,
but I can comment on ours and I feel very comfortable where we are.

Sure, sorry. Dinos, I just wanted to get your opinion on the upcoming TRIA renewal and
what opportunities and challenges it presents for the market and Arch.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well -- listen, I don't have to mention the Boston event again, but I think that the insurance
business is willing and able and capable to take a lot of risks, but it's not able to take
infinite or unlimited risks. At some point in time, there is there has got to be some
backstop at a pretty high level. And if you look at TRIA, we are talking about the backstop
is provided so companies, they don't face ruin on a horrific event. So I'm expecting that
we will make the point to our regulators and to our legislators in Washington and they will
see the light that there is a role that the federal government can play, especially when
they mandate coverage.
They require us to provide or offer terrorism coverage to customers which we would like
to do, but, on the other hand, we don't want the risk of ruin to be within books of
business. Then on certain coverages like worker's compensation, we have exclusive
remedy. You can't exclude whatever incident happens. If you are injured at work, you need
to get paid. That's the exclusive remedy of comp. We need some sort of catastrophic
protection. The only person who has the unlimited ability to do it is the taxing authorities.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

My first thing is I want to follow up on the Berkshire's raid of Lexington. You guys write a
lot of E&S, can you help us understand to the extent they are successful at taking a fair
amount of Lexington business, how would that affect -- can you give us maybe some
sense of how much excess of AIG you might write across your portfolio or some sort of
idea the large account E&S versus small account or some kind of way to understand what
the potential impact is?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

I think it begins with the recognition of behavior. What's the new behavior going to be with
these? It's a set of customers written by one entity versus another entity. It's whether they
are more aggressive or less aggressive. Time will tell that. We don't know what that's
going to be. I don't think it's appropriate for us to comment on relative adequacy of AIG
business versus other carriers' business. We don't write just excess. We have a lot of
primary business we write also on an E&S basis. So we won't necessarily just be looking at
business on a lead excess basis or something like that over AIG.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It depends on their business plan,, which they haven't disclosed to anybody yet. To write a
lot of E&S business, you can't do it just with four people. You've got to build infrastructure.
You have to build underwriting teams, and you've got to distribute them around country.
Especially if you are going to write small, medium-sized accounts. If they are going to
shoot elephants, then they can do it with a half a dozen people sitting in one location. But
there's so much of that business and the usual suspects compete with them, meaning
people that they have significant capacity to do it.
So in my -- not knowing what will happen, it might be a battle between two behemoths,
the Berkshire and AIG, fighting for the large -- or it might be more of a systematic creation
of an E&S unit that it will take some time to build because they have to build infrastructure
and hire the underwriters, et cetera. I think this question you need to ask (inaudible), he

Page 20 of 25

would know more as to what he wants to do with his team. They are all capable
executives. I will give him a lot of credit for that. I think he hire some very good guys.

FINAL

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

And don't underestimate Dinos's comment about infrastructure. Think of it this way. On
the retail side, the customer really is the guy cutting the check at the end of the day. On
the wholesale side, it's really the wholesale producer because of the aggregation aspect.
And you need to be -- the proximity needs to be there to really maximize things with the
wholesale producer, so the infrastructure is important.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Understood. Make sense. Then I just had a few follow-ups on trends and line of business. I
guess, first mortgage insurance on the reinsurance side, it looks like there was about $20
million of growth versus what you been writing this second half. I would assume that was a
new contract, but is that sort of the rate we should expect to have that contract going
forward, or was that all booked upfront for the year?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Don't forget, we had the original contract and then we have the renewal. You might be
seeing that.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right, but is that renewal sort of book?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Year-end I think, the '13 year. You got '12 and '13 and maybe a little overlap of that. But on
mortgage insurance, it's not annual. It comes over four or five years, maybe even six
years.

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Certainly, over the next few quarters you will continue to have a good stream of business
associated with those in-force contracts.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

That's what I was trying to get it. Can you give us a rough sense of what kind of combined
ratio is booked at? I'm assuming that helps the mix on the combined ratio, but I want to
get some kind of sense of that.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well we've got to get reports from our seasons. Usually we don't disagree significantly

No. I was just curious if that should, if you would expect that to continue --

We buy retro to balance our books sometimes or when we think we are getting a
reasonable rate for the coverage. We are always out to see what the retro market might
offer to us, but it's hit or miss. Sometimes if it gets very expensive, we don't buy it. We
think that it's a reasonable price, we buy it.

Just one last one. Have you talked at all, Dinos, about the amount of capital you expect
you'll be putting into the mortgage business once the CMG transaction closes? Do we
know how much capital is there?

FINAL

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

No. You are asking for a dynamic kind of an approach to it. It depends on how that
business flows in. The more business we write, we are going to support with additional
capital. If the business doesn't flow, then it won't require as much capital. So as we
mentioned, I think the GSC is looking to a 20 to 1 coverage ratio. Right now, I think some
of the competitors, and I haven't on the latest statistics, they are operating at 25 to 1 or
some even at 30 to 1. Eventually it is going to gravitate further down into the 20 to 1.
Without knowing how much flow you are going to get, you don't know how much capital
you need to provide.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

You are talking about risk to capital?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes.

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. We now have Mr. Gutterman back online of Adage Capitol.

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

He did pay his telephone bill.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Can you hear me now?

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

If you pay your bills, they won't cut you off.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

I was able to hear you, I think the problem was you sit in the back of the class, you have to
shout to be heard sometimes. I was just going to ask on the construction growth,
especially the improvement in the expected margin. I guess I always thought of
construction as being a competitive class. So why aren't we seeing that, or is this sort of
the special class construction like New York or something that has been troubled?

FINAL

New York has been a troubled market for a long, long period of time. California is nothing
to write home about either. A lot of what we do in construction is more like national
accounts. Streamlined retrospectively rated. This is for medium and large contractors that
predominantly they are buying a lot of services and some buffer cover from us. They will
take the first $250,000 or $500,000 of risk on their own and then they expect us to
provide good services on the claim side.
There are not many competitors in the space. You know, Travelers is a very good
company who does that. Zurich does it. We do it, Ace is a company. Of course, AIG is
there. And it depends on how good your underwriting units are. In that area, we are
seeing positive movement. And it's not just workers comp you are getting rate increases. I
think all three lines on the non-subject [ph] barrier, which is the risk area, we are seeing
good rate increases. And also, we see improvements in the collateral.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

Okay, got it.

I would just add that we make those comments about margin expansion. It doesn't always
translate to $1 of premium. There has been upward movement in the large deductibles
associated with that. $250,000 deductible might be a $400,000 deductible now. So you
get some proof-rate price increase. You get some exposure movement to give you more
premium, and then you get the beneficial trade-off of more premium with a higher
attachment point.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

I guess I was wondering, was there a bad actor in the class before who was underpricing
the business has now gotten rational? Is that why we're seeing such big movements?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

First off, remember what we said. Dinos, I think, nailed it. This is on a loss-sensitive
perspective. These are large, self-ratable contractors. This isn't the one-off guy of the ENS
market that has no audited financials.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 3106649 <GO>}

That's why I thought -- (multiple speakers)

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well there was some, Ian, that they were written are guaranteed cost basis, then they
thrown back.

Okay, okay. Now I'm with you.

FINAL

A - Dinos Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Now as a guaranteed course carrier says, no, if you want that same program, I've got to
charge you X more. They say, no, let me move it into the loss-sensitive area. I am willing
to eat my own cooking, pay the losses through a big deductible and buy the buffer before
I get into the excess market. So there is both.
Like I said I am not sitting with the underwriters every single day. I just monitor what they
do. But these are real numbers, because we have -- one thing we are very confident in is
our monitoring systems. You know they're true because there is an independence. I don't
let the underwriters write their own report cards. They are all going to get As. I hate that.
