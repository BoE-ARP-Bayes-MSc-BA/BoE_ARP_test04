{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. This is Gianandrea Roberti. I am Head of Investor Relations for
Tryg. We published our results -- Q4 results earlier on this morning and I have here with
me Morten Hubbe, Group CEO; and Barbara Plucnar Jensen, Group CFO, to present the
ﬁgures.
Over to you, Morten.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Gian, and good morning from my side as well. We report this morning Tryg's
Q4 numbers with the technical result of DKK762 million, up 16% versus Q4 last year
excluding Alka. This is driven by a proﬁtable growth in the private segment, the inclusion
of Alka and related synergies. And at the same time, a continuous improvement in the
underlying claims ratio. Bear in mind, the comparison year-on-year will be easier from Q1
and onwards, where Alka has been 100% included in both sets of numbers. At the same
time a good development in equity markets has helped investment income, resulting in
the pre-tax result of DKK940 million.

We're paying an ordinary dividend of DKK1.7 per share completely in line as with previous
courses and then we announced an extraordinary dividend of DKK1.65 per share in a total
of roughly DKK500 million, leading the solvency margin at 162% after the deduction of
both the ordinary and extraordinary dividend. The technical result of DKK762 million is
impacted by relatively low large weather claims, but bear in mind that also the runoﬀ
result was lower compared to other quarters. It's quite important to highlight that the full
year technical result of DKK3,237 million was helped by some DKK250 million lower than
normal level of large and weather claims.
In Q4, the underlying claims ratio improved some 50 basis points both for private
segment and for the group in total, in line with recent development. As I mentioned,
equity market has helped investments, reaching DKK198 million for the quarter compared
to minus DKK330 million in the same quarter last year. And equities alone has shifted
from a negative of 15% in Q4 last year to a positive of 7% in Q4 '19. I've already talked
about the ordinary and extraordinary dividend, but perhaps we should just add that we
have submitted to the FSA an application with an updated partial internal model,
including Sweden and some other smaller changes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Continuing on Page 4 where we talk about customer development. We're quite pleased
to see a continued improvement in the customer targets. We see a strong link between
customer loyalty and retention, and thereby our earnings. The improvement in the TNPS
is from 67 to 68. Underlying, there are actually larger movements, where we see
particularly the claims area improving signiﬁcantly. We also see a strong development for
private lines, taking the total satisfaction in private Norway to 75. We see the highest
score, private lines Denmark scoring close to 80%. And then, we see a substantially lower
TNPS in our online scoring, which is included for the ﬁrst time in 2019.
You see that the number of products is roughly unchanged. Underlying, we see a
continued increase in a number of products customer and our core private businesses in
Denmark and Norway. But then we also see '19 a higher growth in the car dealer channel,
which results in more single product customers in that channel. In the quarter, we are
particularly pleased to see that the retention rate continues to increase from an already
very high level. And then we're pleased to see that the non-Danish customers' awareness
of the customer bonus improved 27% in the quarter.
On Slide 5, we show the split of technical result across the main business lines. As
mentioned, group technical result of DKK762 million was up, 16% versus Q4 last year,
excluding Alka. Quite important to remember that the one-oﬀs in Q4 last year were
booked only on a group level and not on the business segments. And additionally, you
may notice that the runoﬀ results this quarter are slightly more volatile than previously. So
when you look at comparing technical results by division, bear that in mind.
And on Slide 6, we elaborate on the Alka business. 2019 was the ﬁrst full year together
with Alka, and it was a strong ﬁrst year, which showed a lot of positive development. Total
synergies were DKK24 million for the quarter, reaching DKK90 million for the full year,
exceeding the targeted DKK75 million. In the ﬁrst year, roughly half of the synergies
comes from costs, while looking at '21, we expect the run rate of claims related synergies
will play a bigger role, and that is already starting to happen. If we look at Alka standPage 2 of 22

FINAL

alone, top line growth in Alka is actually the highest growth in more than 22 years, while at
the same time, showing a strong development in both customer development and
earnings.
On Slide 7, we are pleased to show an increased dividend for the eighth year in a row.
And we are pleased that we are able to announce an extraordinary dividend, as
mentioned, of DKK1.65 per share, reaching DKK500 million. Our business remains highly
proﬁtable. And we are pleased to see that most of the top line growth comes from private
and commercial segment where proﬁtability is the highest and capital requirement is the
lowest, which will help ensuring good returns for shareholders also in the future. Bear in
mind that we've also announced a number of organizational initiatives in our corporate
segment and also in Sweden, along with various investments to secure even stronger
underwriting capability in the corporate segment in order to strengthen the ability to
improve ﬁnancial results in corporate and Sweden going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

On Slide 8, we show the four strategic themes and clearly, the strategic initiatives
supporting the ﬁnancial targets are of paramount importance. And here, we described in
each of the four categories, the main progress. Claims excellence clearly being the largest
of the initiatives, and we have achieved roughly DKK350 million in 2018 and '19 in total.
You should be aware that part of the realized gains impacts prior year claims and thus
supports positive development in one-oﬀ results.
In digital empowerment of customers, we have reached DKK60 million for the 2 years,
and we're well on track to reach DKK100 million for the full 3-year period. And we see
that, that improves customer loyalty, and customer expects more and more speedy
processes. And number 3, products and services have had a strong development as well,
reaching now a portfolio of some DKK650 million. And then ﬁnally, distribution eﬃciency,
we have improved some DKK90 million over the 2 years, both by using the more eﬃcient
channel, but also by improving eﬃciency of each channel. And clearly, this is one of the
important sources to fund our increasing IT investments.
On Slide 10, we elaborate on the growth, which, for the quarter, excluding Alka, was 5.6%,
and then for the full year, 6.1%, excluding Alka. We are pleased to see growth in all areas,
particularly private being the most proﬁtable area also providing the highest growth of
7.6%, excluding Alka. Commercial was also helped by Alka and have had a growth
excluding Alka of 4.8%, driven both by the increase in retention rates, some net inﬂow of
customers, but also price initiatives, particularly in Commercial Norway to improve
proﬁtability.
Corporate showed a growth of 1.1%, clearly impacted by the price hikes in Corporate
Norway and also a reduction in that portfolio, while the Danish corporate portfolio was
helped by good renewal 1st January '19, the TryghedsGruppen membership bonus, but
also bear in mind that we're pushing through signiﬁcant price increases also in Corporate
Denmark, but actually across the Nordics 1st of January 2020. Sweden shows a relatively
high growth, primarily driven by pet insurance and accident insurance, but we are
pushing through a number of price initiatives to further enhance proﬁtability, and that will
probably reduce growth in Sweden somewhat.

On Slide 11, we elaborate on average price development. And clearly, adjusting prices in
accordance with claims inﬂation is very important and a key focus area that we monitor
closer and closer. Proﬁtability improvement is always a combination of claims initiatives
and price adjustments. Bear in mind when you look at the numbers that when we have a
relatively high-growth as we saw in 2019, that may have a slightly negative impact on
some of the average price levels. For instance, we see a higher than normal growth in the
car dealer channel in Norway, where for instance, introductory discounts are used. So,
when that channel grows a bit more, that has a slight impact.
On Slide 12, we show the retention rates. And clearly, high customer retention rates is
extremely important for Tryg's business model. And the customers' view of Tryg is best
monitored through, namely, the retention rate. Very pleased to see improved retention
rates in Q4 for all areas. And clearly, working with the claims experience and also working
with the customer experience in Private Norway are some of the main drivers we see
currently, as well as a continuation in Denmark by the help of the customer bonus model.
And then we also see the fact that we work with our digital solutions makes it easier and
more convenient to be a customer.
Over to you, Barbara.

Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Thank you very much. If you turn to Slide 14, you will see the development in our
underlying claims ratio. In Q4 2019, as Morten mentioned, both the group underlying
claims ratio improved by 50%, as was the case for our private business. Please note that in
this chart, all quarterly ﬁgures for 2018 have been adjusted to include Alka. Price
adjustments and the claims excellence program, including claims synergies related to
Alka, are the main drivers behind the improvement. But for the group overall, the
rebalancing of the portfolio towards more private business supports the overall
improvement. The last comment to add to the development in Q4 is that we saw the high
growth in the private business had a modest negative impact on the underlying claims
ratio, as new customers, in general, will have a slightly higher claims ratio compared to
the existing customers.
Please turn to Slide 15. This is a new slide. We have added this to show you a tangible
example of how we work to -- in our -- team in order to support a more sustainable
approach in our claims handling. The claims department has been working on this
speciﬁc project, aiming at the repair of motor vehicles by introducing recycling or used
spare parts in the process. Hence, the outcome of the project is a positive impact on the
environment as well as reducing overall claims expenses and also create more volumes
for our repair network. We expect the initiative to generate savings of approximately DKK7
million in 2020 and higher than DKK10 million in 2021.
Please turn to Slide 16 where we will speciﬁcally look at the large claims, the weather
claims and the run-oﬀ. As Morten also mentioned, Q4 '19 was impacted by a slightly
higher level of large and weather claims compared to Q4 of 2018. But given the usual
seasonality, this was still well below our expectation for the fourth quarter of the year. For
the full year, you can also see that the impact of large and weather claims was signiﬁcantly
Page 4 of 22

FINAL

lower than a normal year, creating a nice tailwind in the 2019 numbers. Moving to the
discounting and the claims reserves. The impact in this quarter was somewhat lower than
the same time last year due to generally lower level of interest rates. Finally, the runoﬀ
result was slightly higher in Q4, with 4.7% of the combined ratio compared to 4.1% last
year. Again, for the full year 2019, I want to highlight that the runoﬀ was 1% less than last
year.
Please turn to Slide 17. Here, you can see that the expense ratio for Q4 '19 was 14.6%,
which results in a full year expense ratio of 14.2%. The somewhat higher level in this
quarter could be ascribed to higher costs related to the high sales levels in private,
generating higher bonus and rebates, as well as investments in the platforms created to
support the partnerships that we have entered into.

Bloomberg Transcript

For 2020, we keep the target of around 14%, unchanged. As you can see in the chart in
the lower right corner, we have experienced an increase in the number of FTEs during
2019, an increase of 124, primarily reﬂecting continued in-sourcing of claims handling
related to health insurance in Denmark and continued expansions of the guarantee
business in Germany, Austria and Holland. Finally, I want to remind you that the jump in
the number of employees from 2017 to '18 was, of course, driven by the inclusion of Alka
from November 2018. From claims, we move to a review of our investments.
On Slide '19, we have further details on our investments, but there is nothing -- there is not
much news in this quarter. As always, you can see an overview of our total investments
between the match portfolio of DKK28 billion and what we have named the free portfolio
of DKK11 billion. We do this as the risk proﬁle of the two parts diﬀer somewhat. Overall,
the asset mix has remained broadly unchanged.
If you turn to Slide 20, you will see a further review of the performance in the quarter. In
2019, we saw a signiﬁcantly stronger performance compared to last year in Q4. Today, we
reported an overall investment result for Q4 of DKK198 million compared to the minus
DKK330 million in the same quarter last year, which, amongst other things, was driven by
a very robust performance in the equity markets.
When breaking down the components of our investments, it's in particular the noticeable
stronger return of the free portfolio, which, as mentioned, was supported by stronger
equity markets. The return on equities was approximately 7% in this quarter versus minus
15% in the same quarter last year. And if you multiply that for approximately DKK2 billion,
which we have invested in equities, you will obtain an impact on the investment result of
approximately DKK440 million, or more than 80% of the diﬀerence between the 2
quarters. Furthermore, the revaluation of properties had a positive impact of DKK65
million. On the negative side, most ﬁxed income asset classes generated negative returns
in the quarter due to higher interest rates. The match portfolio contributed with a small
positive result in Q4. And ﬁnally, other ﬁnancial income and expenses was slightly better
than usual given some one-oﬀ items, meaning less negative than normal.
On Slide 21, you can see an overview of the development in our solvency ratio, which was
reported to be 162 at year-end after a deduction of the dividends. The development in

Page 5 of 22



FINAL

Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2020-01-22

our own funds is primarily impacted by the proﬁts delivered and dividends. The main
driver for the slight increase in the SCR was movements in the capital markets. As we have
mentioned before, we have ﬁled an application for an improved partially internal model
with the FSA, and we expect an answer around half year this year. In this context, it's
important to point out that a potential reduction of the SCR will also impact our own
funds, as a higher proportion of our Tier 2 capital will not be counted in our own funds. To
give you an example, if the SCR is hypothetically reduced by DKK500 million, own funds
will be reduced by DKK250 million.
On Slide 22, you can see the development on the solvency ratio by Q4 2019 compared to
previous quarters. Today, we have already used our capacity to issue Tier 2 debt, but now
the capacity for Tier 1 is also fully utilized. The payment of the extraordinary dividend has
reduced the core equity Tier 1 at year-end, thereby reducing the Tier 1 potential.
On Slide 23, we show you the impact of movements in items stemming from our
investments on our solvency ratio. The sensitivities to movements in the capital markets
are unchanged compared to what we have shown before. The biggest sensitivity is the
spread risk, which is due to the fact that our biggest asset class is covered bonds. Again,
this is unchanged from previous quarters.
I hereby conclude our update on the Q4 2019 numbers. But before we open up for Q&A, I
would like to hand over to Morten for an update on our targets and outlook for 2020.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Barbara. And on Slide 24, we ﬁrmly maintain our ﬁnancial targets for 2020. So
it targets a technical result of DKK3.3 billion for 2020; combined ratio at or below 86; an
expense ratio of around 14%; an ROE after-tax at or above 21%. Then we'll move towards
the end of 2020 host a new Capital Markets Day, launching a new strategy and setting
new ﬁnancial targets. And then we conclude on Page 25 with our favorite quote from
John D. Rockefeller, which seems particularly relevant on a day where we announced both
an ordinary dividend and an extraordinary dividend, totaling dividend for the quarter in
excess of DKK1 billion.
And with that, we'll hand over to your questions.

FINAL

Good morning, everyone. I've got 2 questions, please. And the ﬁrst one is on growth, on
premium growth. It stayed strong at almost 6% excluding Alka in the fourth quarter. So,
can you remind us why this level is sustainable in the near term? And if you could just split
that between volume and price increases, that would be very helpful.
And then secondly on the underlying loss ratio, I think you've been guiding for modest
improvement for 2 to 3 years now. So, I was wondering whether we should see an
acceleration in 2020 considering there is a step-up in your own eﬃciency measures.
You're also expecting higher synergies from Alka, and it seems that the Corporate
segment is ﬁnally turning around in terms of proﬁtability.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Youdish, I think that when we look at growth, we're pleased to see that the ordinary
growth is almost 6% for the quarter, excluding Alka. And we're particularly pleased to see
the composition of that growth, with Private lines delivering some 7.6% of that growth
organically, excluding Alka. And then, of course, we are pleased to see that Alka
continues a strong and proﬁtable growth in a segment where capital requirement is low
and earnings margin is high. I think when we move into 2020, the expectation is that
private lines Denmark and Norway will continue at a high-growth level. And clearly, that is
supported both by volumes and price, but also by actually growing the market through
our new products.
I don't think we've ever published the exact composition of that, but it's clear in Denmark
that there is a strong trend of both pricing and broadening of the market, covering a big
component of the total growth. That is, to a slightly lesser extent, the case for Private lines
Norway, where it is mainly pricing and volume. So, there's a task there to further improve
cross-sales in Private Norway.
If we look at expectations again, for 2020, we believe that Commercial lines will continue
its quite high growth, but expecting some deterioration in Commercial Norway because
we are doing substantial price hikes in Commercial Norway. And then the big -- is how
much reduction in portfolio we will see from Corporate lines.
We've done price increases 1st of January. They're not fully ﬁnal yet. But around 12% in
Corporate Norway, around 10% in Corporate Denmark and around 8% in Corporate
Sweden. And we are seeing some reduction in the Corporate portfolio as a result of that.
But so far, the reduction of portfolio is actually slightly lower than we expected. And then
to your second question, should you expect an acceleration in the underlying
improvement in 2020? I think the overall answer is no. We expect more of a continuous
development, and we ﬁrmly reiterate our targets for the full year, but we don't expect an
acceleration of the improvement as such.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Bear in mind what we mentioned today that, that growth actually has an impact as new
customers have a somewhat higher claims ratio. So with the growth that we're

Page 7 of 22

experiencing now, obviously that puts slightly pressure on the development that we've
seen.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay, understood. Thank you very much for your details. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Asbjorn Mork from Danske Bank.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Yes, good morning from my side. From my side, a couple of questions. First, relating to
your 2020 guidance and in connection with the Slide 8 that you showed today. So, if you
look at sort of the Slide 8, if you need -- if you're going to meet your 2020 targets, we
should see DKK350 million of boost to your technical proﬁts in 2020 versus 2019. And
then I guess we could expect Alka synergies on top, DKK75 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then I agree with you of course that, all things equal, weather and large claims will
give you a pretty substantial headwind in 2020. But all that together still gives me DKK150
million of tailwinds on technical proﬁts, and that's even before growth. So my point is -that now you're guiding not even DKK70 million growth to your technical proﬁts this year,
should we expect a substantial decline in runoﬀ gains in 2020 versus 2019?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, good morning to you as well as Asbjorn. No, we are not guiding on runoﬀs for the
coming year. I don't think we ever guide on one year's runoﬀ. But no, we're not expecting
substantial changes in the pattern of runoﬀs. It is a more gradual development. Clearly, if
we can order the same amount of tailwind on weather claims and large claims again for
2020, that would be great. It would be DKK250 million in the bank. But I guess we plan
for a normal year as we always do. And then bear in mind that some of the initiatives that
we have and the impact from Page 8, our gross initiatives and gross impacts, and then you
have a ton of moving parts underneath. And as we've described before, we always need
these initiatives to overshoot the actual improvement needed, because you always see
adverse development in a number of areas.
And then bear in mind, as you mentioned in your statement, this does not include growth.
But if you take a year 1 customer -- and in several channels, we have cost of sales
somewhere between 30% and 40%. So that means that we have a portfolio cost ratio of
14%, but a year 1 customer can have a cost ratio as high as 40%. And then there's always a
lot of empirical data showing that a year 1 customer also uses their insurances more than
the average portfolio customer. Therefore, on year 1 and 2, typically, their claims ratio is
higher than a portfolio customer, taking the year 1 and 2 combined ratio for new customer
is substantially higher than the portfolio.

Page 8 of 22

FINAL

Now longer term that makes perfect sense because they become portfolio customers in a
couple of years. But it means that, actually, higher growth in isolation is a worsening of the
combined ratio. So you should keep that into your equation as well. But the biggest driver
is, of course, the weather and large claims and the DKK250 million of tailwind we had in
2019.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Yes. But I mean, still, if you meet your 2020 ambitions for on Slide 8, we need to see some
sort of headwind elsewhere, right? I mean I get your point with the growth. But I mean
versus your entire premium stock, it's a rather small number anyway. Or am I missing
something?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, no. You're not missing anything. And I think if you do the math almost for every single
year, you would have always found that, every year, we target that there is an
improvement in earnings. We are also delivering that. But almost every year, that
improvement in earnings is smaller than the sum of the initiatives. That has been the case
for every single year. And the reality is if we can get a year with 0 adverse development,
we'd like all that. But in the past, that has not been the case.
So, I think I understand the math and the logic, Asbjorn. But in many ways, it's a
continuation of the methodology where the initiatives target a much higher improvement
of earnings than the actual target. And that we're able to count our adverse development
because that always happens in diﬀerent shapes and forms. And then in addition, we
have the higher growth resulting in the higher combined ratio for new customers.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

All right. Fair enough. On Alka, so you're delivering 20% higher synergies in 2019 than
your original target. How should we look at the potential DKK300 million in '21? Is that -- I
mean, are you ahead of plan? Or is the total synergy potential substantially higher than
you thought back when you did the acquisition?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I think it's fair to say that we are slightly ahead on the run rate impact from Alka, given that
we have beneﬁted, let's say, from adding Alka to our Tryg procurement, and thereby, the
impact on the claims handling and so forth. That is a relatively fast thing to implement. But
some of the other things that we're working on, so getting synergies from other areas in
the Alka business, take somewhat longer. So I think our assumption and what we see right
now is still that the potential will be the DKK300 million on a yearly run rate, but the
things that we are working on now just takes a little longer to beneﬁt from.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay. Fair enough. Norway, if I may. One of your peers' out saying that they were not too
conﬁdent or too happy with the proﬁtability in Private Norway at the moment. How do you
see the repricing potential in 2020 from this market?

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, actually, we see a lot of variation between the Norwegian segments. I think, as I
mentioned, if you look at 2019, our price increases in Corporate Norway was 14%. 1st of
January '20, Corporate Norway looks like 12%. Then clearly, in our view, 2019, our pricing
in the higher end of Commercial Norway was too low, so we've been increasing prices
quite substantially in the higher end of the Commercial segment, almost sort of in parallel
with Corporate Norway. And then we are seeing a development where the price
development in Private Norway is moving along as planned.
I think we've had the debate on the more heavy horsepower electrical cars in Norway.
And in general, electrical cars -- and I think there's always an observation on car insurance
in Norway given the imported spare parts and the currency inﬂation through that. So
that's clearly a point to be observant about. Also, there's more utilization of the Private
health insurances. That's also a point to be observant about. But in general, we see
pricing in Private Norway moving along as planned.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

And Corporate renewal in January has been good?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, it's -- Corporate renewal in Norway has been good in the sense that the lapse or the
loss of customers is lower than we expected, but there is a net-net reduction in customers
and there is a net-net reduction in portfolio. So of course, it's always a negative when the
portfolio reduces, but the reduction has been less than we thought it would be, and that
is a positive.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay. Then the ﬁnal question from my side, on the bonus and rebate that you gave in Q4,
the negative impact on your top line. Is there an ongoing future risk on your pricing in
these kind of agreements since you seem to be making more and more money on this,
especially versus, I guess, what your expectations were when you made the agreements?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, I think that the partner business has always been a big part of Tryg's business. And
in a number of cases, some of these agreements with bigger unions, both in Denmark
and Norway, is more than 75 years old. So these are very stable, very long lasting
relationships, giving a lot of beneﬁts, both to the unions and the members and to us. I
think that the fact that earnings are higher than the year before and then we share some
of that earnings with a partner, I think, to be honest that is actually strengthening the glue
to the partner and it's strengthening the longer-term lifetime.
I think that it's not a challenge for us. We have good dialogue on these things with the
partner. I think some of the challenges have been more practical that, sometimes, we've
closed the year underestimating the earnings, setting aside too little for bonus and
rebates. But we've become better and better at doing that. But in total, our proﬁtability

Our next question comes from the line of Mads Thinggaard of ABG. Please go ahead.
Your line is now open.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Hi, this is Mads from ABG. The ﬁrst one I have is a bit of a nitty-gritty one. On the free
portfolio investment return, I think it's stated as 2.7%. But on your web page for Tryg
Invest now, it's -- I got something a bit below 1.6%. I don't know if you can explain the
diﬀerence. I think that was supposed to be the same.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yeah and it's a good point, Mads. It comes down to a technicality. As you know, we
started reporting the results of our free portfolio in the summer of last year. What is the
diﬀerence between what you see on the website and the actual numbers reported is a
revaluation of the property investments in our free portfolio, which does not go into the
website as of yet. We are working to get that included, of course, so you'll have the full
overview. But that's the one asset class that hasn't been included in the reporting that you
see online. And bear in mind, for the full year -- or for Q4, it was DKK65 million.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. Okay. Okay. But going ahead, you will include the revaluation on the web
page?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Working on that, yes. We're working on that.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Yes. Okay. Great. Yes. And then another one. I think we are talking a bit about the -- I
mean some pressure on the drop in underlying claims before due to the growth. Could -and I guess it's a 50 basis point run rate we have seen for a long time. Could you help us
a bit on what to expect here on a drop -- continuing drop in underlying claims looking
ahead?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think that's -- we will see a little bit of volatility in that number going forward. But I think,
generally, I would expect something along the lines of what we're showing now. That is

Page 11 of 22

the broad comment. Of course, it's a lot of moving parts, so you can move a little bit away
from that, but broadly in line with what you see this quarter.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

FINAL

In particular for Group, you might see a diﬀerent composition underneath in the business
segments. But for the Group, I think that would be a good guidance.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes. It's a fair point, Barbara, that clearly, Private lines has been the main driver of the
improvements, and we're seeing that we're putting more emphasis into securing
underlying improvements also in the Commercial business and the rest of the business.
And clearly, Private lines has the highest growth, with the year 1 customers having a higher
combined ratio. So you're right, Barbara, that underneath the Group number, it could be
a little bit less Private, a little bit more the rest of the business. But overall, on the Group
level, expect something like what you saw in Q4.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot. Okay. And then just a shorter ﬁnal question on the extraordinary
dividend. I mean that you're also planning to do some model improvements ahead, and
of course, you considered that already. But is that extraordinary dividend, is that a kind of
end-of-year thing only? Or could there be one during 2020?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I think let's keep it at the yearly review. As you know, we pay out a quarterly ordinary
dividend. And by the end of the year, we have an assessment of how has the business
performed, what is the overall drivers and how do we look on the solvency in order to
make sure that we have capacity for the payments. So I wouldn't expect that we change
anything related to that methodology.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jakob Brink of Nordea. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Thank you. I have 4 questions, I think. The ﬁrst one, just coming back to the capital
question and your solvency ratio of 162 in Q4. So should we see this as sort of the new
level where you are comfortable at running towards the end of the year?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I think, ﬁrstly, I would just like to correct. It's 162, not 164 at the end of the year.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Oh sorry 162, okay.

FINAL

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yes. And as you know, we don't give any guidance on any levels on solvency ratio. What
we have done is, of course, to assess where are we comfortable related to the special
dividends, and we'll leave it at that.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Sorry, but just have to challenge one thing. Because in Q3, you said -- I think, Morten, you
said that it was not sort of a standstill picture in time, it was also looking ahead and what
might come in and support or weaken the solvency ratio. So basically, could we argue
that the 162 is -- you're willing to go that far down because you think there is certainly
you'll get the model approvals from Sweden? Or is the model approvals from Sweden
something that we'll get on top basically next year of the proﬁt generation?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, I think, Jakob, that it's a fair question. But it's also fair to say that it is not that -- our
decision-making on this point is not that mechanical. I think for us, the priority of the
ordinary dividend is clearly #1. So in that light, the actual solvency ratio is much less of a
priority. And then it is a priority fairly frequently to be able to pay extraordinary dividends,
so we are quite focused on looking at that.
And then we do not only look at this year's solvency ratio, we do an extensive amount of
solvency and capital modeling looking several years into the future, trying to make sure
that we have a healthy and sound development in this area, and not just a mechanical
year 1 decision-making based on a speciﬁc solvency number. That is not how we make the
decision. So it is taking a longer time span into the equation, and it's also looking at all of
the parameters and all of the risks, and not just single mechanical decisions.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay. Fair enough. And then my second question comes back to also a question that has
been discussed about your DKK3.3 billion guidance for 2020 of technical result. I think
last quarter, you mentioned that -- when we talked about this and the DKK3.3 billion, you
mentioned the very strong headwind you've had from lower discounting. Now this
quarter or in Q4, the discounting rate was up some 30, 40 basis points, which should give
you DKK70 million, DKK80 million. So I guess if that was the reason to be closer to DKK3.3
billion last quarter, shouldn't it be a reason to be closer to DKK3.4 billion now or?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Again, when we give our guidance and when we give our targets, we don't go in and
adjust that for, you can say, movements in interest rates quarter-on-quarter. It is something
that we deal with in the underlying performance of our business. So obviously, we are
doing everything we can in order to meet the target that we have set out, but it's not
something that we go in and adjust for on a quarter-by-quarter basis like this.

FINAL

And it's fair to say that since we announced our targets in 2017, interest rates have
dropped dramatically. So if this was a more mathematical exercise, we should have
reduced our targets quite substantially since 2017, which we haven't done. So for us, we
believe that trust and predictability is extremely important, and that's why we keep our
DKK3.3 billion target regardless the fact that interest rates have moved all over the place
since we set the target in 2017.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. And then the last question I think on -- you're still guiding in your report
that an annual results -- or ﬁnancial result on properties should be around 5%. And I just
checked, and for the 4 of the past 5 years at least, you have had very strong Q4
performance due to revaluation and sales gains on properties. So could you maybe give
us a bit more details on your property portfolio and whether we should expect this
basically going forward as well?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I think if you look at the property market in general, that is what we lean towards when
we're looking at the guidance we give. It's the same when you look at the overall
guidance we give for the investment portfolio. We also look at market benchmarks. So I
think that's where it's predominantly stemming from.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Okay. It's extremely diﬃcult, Jakob, because, on the one hand, we can see a historical
average return on our real estate portfolio, and that's what gives the basis for the
guidance we give. In general, most of our real estate is commercial real estate, where it's
not buying and selling that drives the result, it's actually the running of the business and
the yield from that.
Having said that, when the price of commercial real estates go up, then from time to time
we have to adjust our valuation to mirror the market pricing. And of course, when interest
rates move down as dramatically as they have, then the prices of commercial real estate
moves up, and moves up more than in a -- on a historical average. But to be honest,
predicting that into the future is almost impossible. And that's why our guidance is based
on more historical average returns on this commercial real estate portfolio.

Morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to follow-up on that capital question. I'll try
and ask it a diﬀerent way to get a diﬀerent answer, but well worth the try. Would you have
done the special if you didn't have this model approval application going in? So if that
wasn't a factor, then you just -- the sales ratio, you would have been without that, would
you still have done the special? And then secondly, just on the claims inﬂation front. I
wonder, are you seeing anything on liability claims inﬂation? We obviously see a lot of
news ﬂow on this coming out of the U.S. given social inﬂation. But I've heard from a few of
the larger European composites that there is some adverse trends in Europe as well. So
are you seeing anything in the Nordic region?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Well, I'll start by answering on the special dividends. And as Morten also said, this is a
combination of a number of parameters. We look at where we are. We look at what we are
having ahead of us based on a number of diﬀerent things. So yes, I wouldn't say that it's
speciﬁcally given the model is ahead of us or not. We still don't know what the FSA will
approve, so we just have to wait and see.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So, I think it's fair to say, Jonny that, of course, when we line up the positive impacts and
the negative impacts, then, clearly, the fact that we have a model application is part of the
potentially positive impact. But we have a long list of potential positives and potential
negatives, and we look at a number of nuances on the composition of the business, the
development of volatility, the development of reinsurance, the development of all sorts of
things in a very, very detailed manner. So, the application is just one of many parameters
in that process.
I think when it comes to claims inﬂation and liability, this is an issue. I think where we've
seen it most strongly is clearly in our Nordic Corporate business that is on behalf of
customers that do business in the U.S. We have actually stopped as much as possible
writing -- particularly there's a lot of Swedish companies that has exports to the U.S. and
has liabilities as a result of that. We have stopped writing that business almost entirely
because we have had way too many liability claims with a growth in average claims and
clearly a negative total earnings proﬁle.
We've seen also in some of the professional liability areas, like engineers, architects,
bigger building projects, where we've also seen liability claims increase and social
proﬁtability being under pressure. So there is a tendency for liabilities to creep up. This is
not a massive part of our business. So in the bigger scheme of things, a fairly small
component. But in isolation, we can recognize a negative pattern.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. What's the average duration for that business?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, it depends a little bit on -- it's -- the composition is very varied. You have a lot of
building projects that are typically either 3 or 5 years. So I would say that -- and then you
Page 15 of 22

have the more complicated liabilities related to pharmaceutical industry or something
hitting more personal injury stuﬀ which has a very long duration typically. I would say you
could get as high as 4, 5 years in duration on that portfolio.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Per Gronborg of SEB. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. A couple of questions from my side. First, a quick one. You've
increased your equity allocation in the fourth quarter. Is this temporary? Or should we
expect that to be persistent?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

That's a minor adjustment. It's -- you can say, we always go in and look at the asset
allocation across the portfolio. In general, you shouldn't expect any major changes, but
you can see adjustments from time to time.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. Then on the pretty high rebate level you have in the fourth quarter, it seems like a
lot of that is proﬁt sharing, reﬂecting more year-to-date performance than necessarily Q4
proﬁt. Is there any impact on Q4 proﬁt? And if not, where is the oﬀsetting factor in your
P&L?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, there's no doubt that it is a process where some of these proﬁt-sharing agreements
are quite complicated, and it's not something -- I guess, ideally, we would know on a daily
basis what is the proﬁt sharing, and then they would hit exactly the right week and exactly
the right month and exactly the right quarter. To be honest, the model is not as
sophisticated as that. We see that the bonus and the rebates was roughly DKK89 million
in Q4 '18 and it was roughly DKK195 million in Q4 '19. And there is a tendency for that to
be a Q4 settling of the full year, and therefore, it is, to some extent, mixing up the
proﬁtability of Q4 in isolation and the full year. I think that is the reality.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

So it's fair to say that the increase in rebates in the fourth quarter basically have been
almost a similar drain on the net proﬁt in Q4?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I'm not sure I fully understand your question. Could you rephrase that, Per?

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

So if we take the rebate run rate the ﬁrst 3 quarters, it was approximately DKK150 million.
Now it's DDK 224 million in the ﬁnal quarter. The delta of those DKK75 million, that's
something you have deducted from your income in the fourth quarter.

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Correct, correct.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

But I assume it has nothing really to do with your claims in the fourth quarter.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Correct.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Meaning if you had been better at accruing these rebates during the year -- and I fully
understand this is, of course, diﬃcult, then your Q4 [ proﬁt in principle ] have been DKK75
million, approximately better.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think that's a fair point. So the increase is taking as a negative hit entirely in Q4. To a
large extent, it relates to the full year. So ideally, you would have distributed that
throughout the quarters. Completely correct.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes. Perfect. Finally, last one -- maybe a last one on solvency. This year, you are
comfortable with 162%. A year from now, you have internal models likely to be enforced.
Is 162 still the level that you will feel comfortable with? Or are you not really looking at the
headline solvency ratio but looking at some underlying numbers which we cannot see?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Well, I don't know how to say this in a diﬀerent way, other than, as Morten already said
and I've said before, this is a combination of a number of parameters. Bear in mind, the
capital requirement stems from a lot of areas within our business, and therefore, we
spend a lot of time at looking ahead, what do we expect in terms of requirements and
movements in our business. So again, it's part of the analysis. It's part of the foundation
for our decision. But as mentioned, there is a lot of diﬀerent consideration that goes into
our ﬁnal decision.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And then, I guess, we know that there's a legal minimum. And then we know on top of
that, if the solvency ratio was 125%, the FSA parks their bus in our yard and starts running - or about our business or were asking a lot of questions. So we don't want to go
Page 17 of 22



Company Name: Tryg A/S

Date: 2020-01-22

FINAL

anywhere near that. But at the same time, I think, historically, we've learned that if we put
a ﬁxed target on the solvency ratio, then we start to put buﬀers on buﬀers in relations to
that ﬁxed target. And then all of a sudden, we start to make the stability of the solvency
ratio priority #1. And we're quite certain that for our shareholders, the stability and
predictability of the dividend is far more important than the stability of our solvency ratio.
And that's why I understand that from a planning, a predictability point of view, perhaps it
would be nice to know a ﬁxed solvency ratio target. But from a decision-making point of
view, our view is that we would screw up our priorities relating to dividends if we made
the solvency ratio stability a higher priority than the payout. And that is why, for us, we
don't have a ﬁxed target and we don't even have an internally ﬁxed target.
And then we try to make sure that our planning of capital becomes more and more
sophisticated and takes more and more future years and future strategies into play. And it
does also need to do that. So for instance, if we do larger IT investments, how does that
impact the balance sheet? How does that impact the solvency, et cetera, et cetera? So we
try to have a very holistic view on that. And then fundamentally, we try to make the payout
priority number 1 and not the solvency rate.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Denim of Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Thanks very much for taking my questions. Just coming back to your comments on
Norway. How are you pricing versus claim inﬂation in Private property in Norway? And
how happy are you with your proﬁtability level of this book? I know we've had this chat
before, in claims inﬂation that could be fairly constant that one of your competitors is
continuing to ﬂag the need to raise rates there. And then secondly, just how you're doing
in sharing your best practices from Private Denmark across the group versus your own
expectations? And maybe if you could give us any examples of initiatives you're
implementing which could move the dial over the next year or two. Thanks.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, I think that house insurance in Norway, it's been quite a long time since that was a
main concern of ours. I think if you take house insurance in total, that has mainly been a
concern in Denmark, to be honest, where, for longer periods, our combined ratio of
house insurance in Denmark was dangerously close to 100%. We've moved that needle a
lot closer to 90%. So, we have improved that signiﬁcantly.
House insurance in Norway has always been more proﬁtable than the house insurance in
Denmark, and we haven't seen dramatic inﬂation there. If you go back 3 or 4 years, salary

Company Name: Tryg A/S

FINAL

inﬂation in Norway was a lot higher than salary inﬂation in Denmark. And therefore, the
repair of houses had a higher inﬂation than Denmark. Therefore, our price increases were
higher. But that is stabilizing both because it's declined somewhat in Norway and it has
increased somewhat in Denmark. So that is becoming more of a neutral space.
So, we don't see a strong development in the house product in Norway at the moment.
So mainly, when we look at Norway, our main concern is always on private lines where
there is much more development and replacement of the types of cars in Norway. So
that's always a concern. And then, of course, as we've mentioned, Corporate lines and the
higher-end Commercial lines is where we spend most of our time.
But I think if you compare, for instance, Gjensidige's portfolio in Norway to our portfolio,
they are not very similar. We are very diﬀerent in exposure in terms of the geographical
mix of our exposure, and through that also the mix of assets, the mix of properties and the
mix of cars. So I'm not surprised that there are diﬀerent observations there.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

And is it fair to say that your home in Norway is close to or lower than the kind of 90%
number you just gave for Denmark?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes. I think that's a fair statement. And then it's a fair statement that we are a lot stronger
in the western parts of Norway and a lot weaker around the Oslo region, which also
means that the houses we ensure on average are slightly cheaper than you would ﬁnd in a
more expensive area like Oslo, for instance. So those are some of the diﬀerences as well.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Brilliant. And then just on best practice from Private Denmark?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, I think what we've done is that -- there is no doubt that Private Denmark has come a
lot further on product development and a lot further on cross-selling. I think we see
progress in the sense that product development -- if you, for instance, look at some of the
new partner agreements we've done in Norway. If you look at NITO, for instance, the
engineers in Norway, we've done 14 new products alone isolated for this one partner
agreement, where we've taken a lot of inspiration from product development in Denmark,
but also added a lot of new ideas and thoughts from the Norwegian organization that we
can reuse in Denmark.
So, I think for a number of our partners in Norway, both the products and the digital
development is being shared. I think, actually, on the digital straight-through processing,
Norway is somewhat ahead of Denmark. So, the best practice sharing goes the other way.
I think if you look at -- the focus for the coming year is that the cross-selling for the
average customer in Private lines Norway is still a lot weaker than in Denmark. So, we want
to progress that further during 2020. We know from Denmark, that, that is not a sort of
Page 19 of 22

easy-peasy project, but we also know that it's worthwhile. So that will be one of the focus
areas for the coming year.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Ryan of Bloomberg
Intelligence. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Kevin Ryan

{BIO 1814771 <GO>}

Thank you. I just have one question which is, you mentioned that your investment in
digital will hold back some of the expense savings. And I was wondering whether you
could quantify that. And also, talk a little bit about when you see digital investment
normalizing and what a normalized number looks like.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I think what does a normal investment in digital look like is a diﬃcult answer because the
requirements we see in terms of having technical solutions for our customers is of great
importance. We want to be where our customers are, and that means that we need to be
able to interact with them both on digital means but also through personal contact
depending on what the issue is. So, therefore, I think, in general, being eﬃcient, being
able to meet the customers where they are with solutions that work for them is super
important. So I think setting a number on what is a normalized level is diﬃcult.
Right now, of course, we have some investments, as we've said, in our claims system and
so forth, which is a little bit more extraordinary. But we can also see that we invest in
digital solution with our partners when we start partnerships, and then the general level of
investments is, you can say, going to continue as I see it. But I would not sort of put out a
number on what would be a normalized level.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think that the most tangible we've ever said is that the IT strategy as such would build up
an intangible asset on the balance sheet of around DKK500 million in addition to what
has been normal. So that has been said and that is a tangible number. I think, if anything,
that number might actually be higher, but that is the most tangible number we've given.
The tricky part, as Barbara mentioned, is actually the business IT development, because
whenever we make a new agreement with a new partner or a new distribution channel,
then that always involves more and more IT investments. I think we've done the math that
says that, on an average day, 900 people work on our IT systems, developing our IT
solutions. That is a massive number. I think we're quite pleased that the majority of those
resources are Indian resources, so the average price is quite manageable and low.

FINAL

But on the other hand, I think when you look across the whole ﬁnancial sector, not only in
Tryg and not only in the Nordics, but globally, the dependency on digital solution is just
increasing and increasing and increasing. So I think I would clearly hesitate to promise a
normalization or a reduction at any point. I think the anchor you can look at is that we
want to keep the expense ratio stable at around 14% because that requires us to create
enough of eﬃciency measures to ﬁnance the added IT investments. But to be honest, I

Thanks very muchJust one question from me. Just on the new customers having higher
claims ratios than the existing customers. Can you conﬁrm or give a bit more detail, this is
mainly due to discounting of new business rather than any kind of change in risk selection
at the start? Thank you.

Well, there is no doubt that if you put them in line of priority, year 1 customer, the main
challenge is actually the cost of sale. So that the cost ratio is -- can be as high as 40% as
opposed to 14%. So that's challenge number 1. Then on the claims ratio, where you ask
your question, challenge number 1 is often introductory discount depending on the
channel. But I actually believe that all of our empirical data show that when you've just
acquired your insurance, your awareness of that insurance is substantially higher. So for
the ﬁrst couple of years, then you clearly use that insurance more than when it is year
three, four, ﬁve, six, seven, et cetera. It's not a massive diﬀerence, but there is a diﬀerence,
and that is not a deterioration.
So what we do is that we make one comparison, which is year one customer versus the
total portfolio, and then we'll make other comparisons where we look at year one
customers today versus year one customers a year ago and 2 years ago and 3 years ago
to monitor that the year one, the customers of today are preferably slightly better than the
year one customers from a year ago. But there is this mix of higher cost of sales,
introductory discounts playing a role and then the higher awareness of using the
insurance you just purchased. Those are sort of the 3 main parameters.
