{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Sampo Group's full year 2011 results conference call.
I'm Jarmo Salonen, Head of Investor Relations. And with me at this call, I have our Group
CEO and President, Kari Stadigh, Head of P&C Insurance, Torbjorn Magnusson. And
Group CFO, Peter Johansson.
We will start, as always, with a few words from Kari on the developments in 2011. But
before handing over to Kari, let me remind you that you can follow this call directly on our
website, Sampo.com/result. And a recorded version of the call will be later available at
the same address. And I think that's all from me. I now hand over to Kari. Kari, please.

Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thank you, Jarmo. Welcome to the conference call on my behalf, as well. Sampo reports
an EPS of EUR0.50 for the Fourth Quarter. It is worth noticing the strong mark to market

EPS in Q4 of EUR0.94, which was up EUR0.12 from the corresponding quarter a year
earlier.

FINAL

All three areas of our operations rebounded nicely in Q4. This combined ratio of 90.2%
was an excellent achievement. And as gross written premiums grew in all business areas
with an overall growth of 4%, the big picture is actually very good.
Nordea ﬁnished the year with a strong quarter as well -- volume wise, their best quarter
ever. Our proﬁt share of EUR161 million was up 6% from the corresponding quarter in
2010.
In Life Insurance, we saw volumes come down in line with the market in general. However,
as a sign of good performance, Mandatum Life's market share in the quarter was as high
as 28%.
The proﬁt before taxes was down to EUR30 million for the quarter. However, this is in line
with our long-term expectations.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you all are well aware, we sold equities in the beginning of 2010 and increased our
equity rate back to neutral during the year. This was too early. However, in Q4, we gained
back some of the momentum. Our total mark to market return for all of our insurances'
investments was up 1.9% for the quarter, bringing our total return into black ﬁgures for the
year, at 0.8%.
In the month of January, we have seen a strong recovery in Nordic equities, as well as in
Nordea. I think our NAV has increased signiﬁcantly. I don't have an exact number. But if
we look at Nordea's share price, roughly -- probably our NAV has increased by around
EUR2.00 per share or something.
The strong Q4 development in our operations brings the result to over EUR1.2 billion for
2011. Based on this. And given our strong capital position, the Board proposes an
increased dividend of EUR1.2 per share. We continue as a dividend stock, as always.
Our outlook for 2012 is very stable. Combined ratio in non-Life below our long-term target
of 95%, Nordea's strong volume development and cost initiatives give comfort that their
contribution to our proﬁts will be signiﬁcant.
Mandatum Life's result is more dependent on the investment income overall. We are
conﬁdent and ready to meet the challenges of 2012.

Jarmo Salonen

Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And the ﬁrst question comes from the line of Matti
Ahokas. Please go ahead, announcing your company.

FINAL

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Matti Ahokas, Handelsbanken, here. Two questions on the non-Life
side, if I may. Firstly, on the EUR53 million reserve increase that you did regarding the
Finnish mortality model change, that was quite a lot higher than what some of your
competitors have done. Why was it as big as EUR53 million? Did you increase it even
further?
And the second question is more of a general nature, also on the non-Life side. I'm a bit
puzzled, because it seems like the normal weather-related variation is not holding. And if I
look at your combined ratio. And exclude the EUR53 million, get to kind of EUR85 million.
And that's a very, very strong ﬁgure for a Q4. What am I missing? Has the normal variation
disappeared, or is it just that -- a very, very favorable frequency quarter for you guys? And
what should we expect going forward? Thanks.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

All right. On the EUR53 million mortality change, you need some acuity, actually. We
started increasing the mortality reserves last year by EUR29 million. And then added
EUR53 million or EUR54 million this year. POILA did a change of -- in excess of EUR30
million last year. And then another change this year.
If you go back and look at market shares over a very long period, from the '90s, you
would expect their increase to be to the tune of 80% of ours. And that is actually roughly
what it is, if you add the two numbers from 2010 and 2011 together.
Secondly, on weather, the weather in Q4. The weather in Q4, with the exception of one
day, was very favorable to non-Life insurers. We had a windstorm, as is rather well known,
at the end of December. But we actually didn't get any snow in the Nordic region until
very late this year. So you wouldn't expect a high degree of losses in Q4, which we didn't
have. And also, if you go back in history, our Q4s haven't really had a strong degree of
weather or seasonality in them.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

If I may just continue on that note, Torbjorn, how much was the -- excluding the one day,
the weather related claims, better than a so-called normal Q4?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

That's -- I can't give you the number for that, Matti, because that is really impossible to say.
We've had very good weather. What you're going to compare to, what is a weather
related loss? Is it a car crash? How do you know whether that's weather related or not? It's
impossible.

Our next question comes from the line of Blair Stewart. Please go ahead, announcing your
company.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. It's Blair Stewart from BofA Merrill's. I've
got two questions. The ﬁrst is with regards to the dividend. You say it's -- you aim to be a
dividend stock, Kari. And I think you've shown that today. But just looking forward, with
arguably lower dividends from Nordea, perhaps some volatility around dividends from
your own Life subsidiary, could you perhaps comment on your ability to maintain this
strong dividend growth track that you want to stay on?
And secondly, with regards of the shape of the balance sheet, I just wonder if you can
comment on how comfortable you are with the balance sheet shape at the moment. I
noticed you've got a senior bond up for maturity in the next few weeks. I just wonder if
you could comment on that. And your plans around that. Thanks very much.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yes, we are deﬁnitely committed to being a dividend stock. And we have already received
some questions about what will Nordea's dividend aﬀect our dividend going forward. We
received last year EUR250 million in dividends from Nordea. This year, we will receive
EUR225 million. So, doesn't really aﬀect our future plans for dividend, the change is so
marginal.
Then if we look at the P&C business, we have, over the last, I think, seven years, received
dividends, almost EUR500 million per year from If. I have no such information that If's
cash ﬂow would be any diﬀerent this year from all those previous years.
In Life, you are quite right, that it has been more volatile. And we are all waiting to see
what will happen with Solvency II. The latest information we now have is that it's
postponed once again, we really don't know for how long. I still think that Mandatum has
a good capacity to distribute a dividend of EUR50 million to EUR100 million per year. So
no big change there either.

FINAL

On the long-term track, I would love to see our dividend inch upward slowly year after
year. That is, of course, something I can't promise. But that's my wish. Let's see how this
year goes. Maybe that's all I want to comment on the dividend at this moment.
I think that on the balance sheet, we have a bond maturing in April. The outstanding
amount is a little bit over EUR600 million at this moment. I think Patrick will start roadshowing in the next few days for a new 5 year bond to replace that. We have also other
backup facilities. So we feel very comfortable on the cash position.
Long-term, I think at this moment, I think we have the view that we would like to have a
net debt level of EUR1.7 billion roughly, after dividend has been distributed.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thanks, Kari. If I can just follow up, the bond that's maturing, the senior bond, will you be
replacing like with like, or would you like something that could possibly give you more
capital credit?

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

I think that we are looking for a ﬁve year bond in the same volume, roughly what that we
have now.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So a senior bond.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Hans Pluijgers. Please go ahead, announcing
your company.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Hans Pluijgers, Cheuvreux. Three questions, if I may. First of all, with
respect to Life results, you said that the EUR30 million in Q4 was in line with long-term
expectations. Is it a little bit of guidance for the long-term quarterly normalized, let's say,
income you are looking for, the EUR30 million? Could you elaborate on what you see
there as a normalized level?

Page 5 of 18



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2012-02-09

FINAL

Secondly, on impairments, did you take any impairments in Q4 on equities? And could
you maybe, if so, also stipulate by operation? So, by in the Life and non-Life. And thirdly,
of course, the question on the outlook of the pricing on the non-Life. Could you a little bit
elaborate what you're seeing there? One of your competitors is saying that maybe for
next year still, some additional price hikes. But on the longer time, they see more in line
with inﬂation. What are you seeing in the market?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thank you. I don't really think it's a guidance on Life, because we only have one guidance.
And that is the one we give, that Life results are dependent on the investment climate.
Maybe it's worthwhile to look a little bit closer to it anyhow. We have two, three, four
components of -- forming the results, which are of interest. One is the risk result. And the
risk result in the Life company this year was high, it was above EUR20 million. I think that
our actuaries feel comfortable with a result between EUR15 million to EUR20 million long
term, with the portfolio we have today.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the cost side, we have been looking for a cost result of EUR10 million. The
management should be able, going forward, to improve it. Then we have a wealth
management business which has broken even at the end of the year. And the rest is
coming from the investment income.
So, if you were to take this EUR30 million per quarter as a guidance, then that would
mean that roughly EUR20 million, EUR30 million would come from the insurance results.
And EUR90 million from the investment income in the with-proﬁt portfolio. And that
would mean that it would be a little bit less than a 2% margin on those assets.
These are very rough numbers. But they are no guidance. But I just wanted to open it up
for you a little bit on the earnings model of the business.
The management is, of course, focusing on increasing the risk result and cost result. And
margin on the wealth management. And as we all know, the with-proﬁt business is in
semi-runoﬀ. So we can't expect any higher investment income going forward. And that's
the volatile part.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

And on the impairment side, it's roughly EUR15 million, both in Life and P&C. And all the
additional impairments we did in Q4, they were on stocks and equity funds that already
had been impaired previously. So none of them were because of being over 20%
negative additional -- or, new equities being over 20% negative.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Just -- sorry, could you please repeat the number? Because you were a little bit far away.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}
Page 6 of 18



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity

So it was EUR15 million, both in Life and P&C.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Okay, thank you very much. And last question, pricing?

FINAL

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

On rate hikes, by and large, we're able to -- or, we're seeing price increases in line with
claims inﬂation. So they're, on average, maybe 3% in the Nordic region. The exception
would be Denmark, which has been better. And we've seen some improvements on the
large corporate side lately.
The -- Norway has had lower inﬂation than expectations. So therefore, our price increases
have been in excess of claims inﬂation. And then there's a small disappointment on SMEs
in Sweden, which is not a big line for us, where we don't see our competitors increasing
pricing as much as is necessary. And is stated by them in the various contacts we meet
them.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Mika Koskinen. Please go ahead, announcing
your company.

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

Ah, afternoon. It's Mika Koskinen from SEB Enskilda. I'd just like to ask, the -- could you
just explain a bit more in detail the high ﬁnancing cost that you had in the holding
company? I know that you refer it both foreign exchange and interest rate hedges that
you mark to market. But clearly, the cost level or the proﬁt level was clearly lower than, I
guess, the consensus was looking for.
How much was this kind of one-oﬀ. And what should be a normalized -- if we can talk of
anything normalized in this world -- level going forward?

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Mika, the biggest item is the SEK 4 billion Swedish loan that we had. So that's unhedged,
because on the asset side, we get fairly big value gains in the other comprehensive
income if Swedish krona appreciates. So that impacted EUR70 million. And then there was
a marginal, negative losses on the swap side. So this is basically a one-oﬀ that causes
some volatility.
Going forward, I think that the -- because the spreads have moved up somewhat. So the
ﬁnance cost from -- previously, we have talked about EUR15 million now. It's pretty much
Page 7 of 18



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2012-02-09

closing up to -- or, EUR15 million to EUR20 million per quarter. Now it's probably closer to
EUR20 million per quarter.

FINAL

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

Okay. And then, just a -- to double check if I got you right, the investment income in the
P&C portfolio was, I guess, a bit lower than people were expecting. Did you say that you
had EUR15 million, 1-5 million of writedowns in the Fourth Quarter, which basically
dragged the reported investment income?

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Correct. 1-5.

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

1-5, okay. And otherwise, it was basically plain sailing?

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Exactly, yes.

Q - Mika Koskinen

{BIO 1557965 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Gianandrea Roberti. Please go ahead,
announcing your company.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. It's Gianandrea from Carnegie. A couple of quick questions from me
as well. One, it's on non-Life, I guess for Torbjorn. In Norway, two quarters in a row where
your combined ratio, it's spectacularly low. And it's even more striking in the last quarter
of '11, I guess, when I look at the numbers from -- again, Citi and (inaudible) reported
yesterday and today. And I appreciate your comments on the weather. I'm just trying to
ﬁgure out if large claims experience was much better than expected, or why did you
come out so strongly?
The second question, it's more nitty gritty, probably for Peter. I was expecting, when I look
at your fair value to share moments, Q4 versus Q3, I was expecting some positive on the
ﬁxed income part of it, which really didn't come out. It's basically stable. I guess interest
rates should have -- I mean, they have come down slightly also in Q4. But perhaps there's
something else that pulled it in a diﬀerent direction. Thanks.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Page 8 of 18



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2012-02-09

Gianandrea, on Norway, actually, let me take this opportunity to give you a little bit more
information than you asked for, for once.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

FINAL

For once, great.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

We have a number of reserving changes this quarter. And as you are well aware, we have
the mortality change in Finland of EUR54 million. We also have a change of discount rates
that aﬀects the annuities in Sweden of EUR60 million.
On the other hand, we have been more or less pushed by our auditors to release some
reserves in Norway, which helps the combined ratio that you've noticed. And that was in
workers' comp and personal accident, very long tail lines, very old years. And that was
about EUR30 million. At the same time, we have also released very old year reserves on
workers' comp in Finland, round about EUR20 million. And also, as many companies in
Sweden, we have seen the frequencies of Swedish traﬃc losses, Swedish motor third
party losses decreasing for a period now. And we have released round about EUR60
million.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, quite big reserve changes that would aﬀect normalized calculations. And not least in
Norway, the combination of low inﬂation, low claims inﬂation, decent price increases. And
this reserve release produced the very good combined ratio that you commented.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

This is Peter. So, on the ﬁxed income, actually, both in If and Life, the ﬁxed income
unrealized gains were ﬂat. And the explanation is really the short duration in the
portfolios. So basically, the unrealized gains that we have are gradually running oﬀ. So
even if the credit spreads came down somewhat, it didn't impact the unrealized gain.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot.

of reserve releases that Torbjorn just mentioned, that's in the Fourth Quarter? And in the

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, there. This is Thomas Seidl from Sanford C. Bernstein. Two questions, please, one on
capital. And one on the Life business.
On capital, I wonder if you could give us a bit more detail on the sensitivity of the
movements on page 18 of the supplement. I think the available capital moved by 10%.
And they required. And I just want to understand, what is the driver of this?
And the second question is around unit links. I noted that there is, let's say, mark to
market losses of some EUR300 million. And typically, I would expect them to show up
later on the reserves as a unit link. But it doesn't play to the full extent right. And so the
question is, to what extent are the EUR300 million borne by policyholders versus
shareholders? Thank you.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Did you say slide number 18? I don't have numbers on my slides. Is that the sensitivity
table or the capital --

Which one is the -- what is the title of the slide, Thomas?

Q - Thomas Seidl

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yes.

FINAL

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Yes, okay. But if it -- actually, for you, the best way for you to look at the sensitivity on the
capital is, is if you look at -- on the investment side. We have a slide, Sensitivity of Sampo
Group Investment. So basically, the biggest sensitivity on the Group capital comes from
the investment side. So mark to market changes on equities.
And there, basically, you see that the biggest item is plus/minus 10% in equities, is
plus/minus EUR250 million. And we have close to EUR1.9 billion of buﬀers. The -- and
that's on the Solvency I. And the consolidated Solvency capital number.
One item that has aﬀected on the consolidated capital is, if you look at the Nordea slides.
So basically, Nordea, the risk weighted assets, actually due to Basel 2.5 rules, increased
by EUR4.5 billion. And when we calculate our consolidated capital number, we have to
use the transition rule. So we didn't get any -- more or less, any beneﬁt from the impact
that Nordea has done on their more eﬃcient capital use.
So basically, we're halfway into Basel 3. And we're still also stuck with the transition rules.
That's one of the main reasons that the Solvency capital actually didn't improve in Q4.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Okay. So you expect a better position once the transition period is over?

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Yes, after the transition period, the capital requirement on Nordea will be signiﬁcantly
lower.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Then there was a question on unit link.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Sorry, I missed the unit link.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

There was a question on unit link, that there is a loss in the P&L of EUR300 million. And
the question was, who bears the burden for it?

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

That's the investors. So basically, in the -- on the unit link side, we don't have any
guarantees.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

FINAL

Policyholders, yes.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

(inaudible), on the -- in the statement, you typically show the liabilities. And they change
only by EUR17 million. So I didn't -- let's say, I didn't -- I won't be able to reconcile. That
was too --

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

So basically, on the unit link side, you can see that if you look at the amount of premiums
coming in to unit link. And then you have to include the value chains. And that goes to the
policyholder also.

Hi, thank you very much. It's Giulia Raﬀo from Autonomous. Just have a few questions,
one ﬁrstly for Kari. It's a follow up on the statement you made before in answering Blair's
question. You said that you see the net debt position for the Group to be okay at EUR1.7
billion after the dividend is paid. If I look correctly on page 15, you disclose a net debt
position of EUR1.2 billion at the end of 2011. And that is before the dividend payment,
which then would suggest that post-dividend, you were close to EUR1.9 billion.
If that's correct, then you will ideally like to have EUR200 million less in the debt, or the
two numbers should not be linked.

Okay, ﬁne. So basically, you are pro forma at EUR1.7 billion?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Exactly.

Q - Giulia Raﬀo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Okay, thank you very much. My other question is on the Life side. If I am reading page 11
correctly, seems that you have taken further prudent strengthening on the provision to
reﬂect that interest rates have fallen further. Can you quantify what has been the impact
on the Q4 Life proﬁts from the lowering the discount rate. And preparing for low rates?
And do I read it correctly that basically, your breakeven point for 2012 is 2.75. So to the
extent that your assets are backing out with proﬁt yield in excess of 2.75, you will be able
to make proﬁts?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then, my ﬁnal question. I was surprised to see that the run yield in P&C went up in
Q4. So, I was wondering whether you can give some sort of sense of what did you do -you know. And if you can give us a sense of what are -- so where new money is invested?

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Giulia, the -- you are correct, 2.75, that's the breakeven for the three coming quarters on -if we make money in Life insurance. So the 25 basis -- 2.75, did I say?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Four quarters.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

No, three. Three.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

This one and three --

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

No, no, because we have reserved down to -- no, sorry, four quarters.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Four quarters.

Four quarters. Thanks, guys Yes. So basically, because we reserved EUR10 million, we
reserved EUR10 million, we already -- yes. So four quarters. So basically, we're down at
2.75. And from the beginning of next year, we will go back to 3.5.
And on the running yield in P&C, that actually surprised us also. But it's more a technical
one, because If paid the dividend in Q4. So there was a fairly big reduction of SEK 3.7
billion on the money market side.

Q - Giulia Raﬀo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Okay. And -- sorry. So, am I right in thinking on the Life side that your proﬁt in Q4 suﬀered
from EUR10 million? So it would have been EUR40 million without that (multiple
speakers)?

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Exactly. So EUR10 million --

2012.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Giulia Raﬀo

-- in a way.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Yes. Yes, correct.

Q - Giulia Raﬀo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Can you give us a sense -- sorry, why you are investing new money in both Life and P&C
still, Norwegian ﬁnancial paper, covered bonds, on the ﬁxed income side, if that is the
case?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Corporate credit covered bonds. There has been a -- not so much available corporate
credit. But luckily, there has been some bank senior papers coming to the market.

Our next question comes from the line of Robin Buckley. Please go ahead, announcing
your company.

Q - Robin Buckley

{BIO 3596512 <GO>}

Yes, hello, it's Robin Buckley from Deutsche Bank here. Just a couple of questions on
capital, please. If I go to slide 20, which is the Group Economic Capital and Solvency
slide, you detail, I think for the ﬁrst time, EUR428 million coming from Finnish equalization
provisions.

Bloomberg Transcript

Is this just new disclosure that you're giving related to this. And has it always previously
been included in the available capital? And can you just talk around that?
And then secondly, just picking up your point on the required capital for Nordea that you
disclosed, of EUR2.5 billion. I mean, your comments about it will come down in the future.
On my numbers, I think I'm working that out at around -- about a 5% of risk weighted
assets as your minimum requirement. Can you just talk around whether -- why you see
that as a suitable minimum requirement in the context of regulators pushing for higher
levels of capital within the banks? Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

If we take the equalization provision, the plus EUR400 million. So that's simply the -- in
Solvency I, we have to deduct that from Group -- adjusted -- Group -- consolidated capital,
because it's so-called non-transferrable capital.
If Solvency II comes into force, that means that the regulator. And also the Ministry of
Finance in Finland, has said that it will be Tier 1 capital. And it can also be used to the
Solvency capital requirement on a Group level. This equalization provision is purely in the
Finnish -- If P&C Finland.
On the economic capital calculation, the EUR2.5 billion, that is -- that comes directly from
Nordea's economic capital model. They use a 99.9% conﬁdence level. And they have
actually scaled that to Basel 2 and Basel 3 levels. Basically, we simply adjust that back to a
99.5% conﬁdence level, which will be the conﬁdence level on Solvency II.

Q - Robin Buckley

{BIO 3596512 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. So, just coming back to the equalization provision, that was a regulatory
-- or, clariﬁcation of a regulatory change that is now included in your economic capital that
wasn't previously? Is that the way to interpret it?

FINAL

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

That's correct. So we -- under present rules, we cannot include that into our Solvency
capital, with present rules. But whenever Solvency II comes into force, then it can be
included in the Group Solvency as Tier 1 capital.

Q - Robin Buckley

{BIO 3596512 <GO>}

Okay, fantastic. Thank you, very much.

(Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from the line of James Shuck. Please
go ahead, announcing your company.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hello. Good afternoon. It's James Shuck from Jeﬀeries here. I just had one question left.
And it was on capital once again. Just on the Life business. So the economic capital is
slightly below 100. And in the past, you used to give market consistent embedded value,
or -- actually, you didn't give MCV, you gave EV. And that gave us some quite useful
sensitivities for the lower interest rates risk free, or equity markets. And I was hoping you'd
be able to give some sensitivities on the economic capital for, say, a 50 basis point
reduction in risk free rates. And say, a 20% fall in equity markets.
And associated with that question, I'm also interested in at what stage would you sort of
be required to recapitalize the Life division? It's obviously very volatile in terms of its
economic capital. And what I'm wondering is, if it sort of gets down to -- at what level
would you actually yourselves want to recapitalize it? Because as it stands, you can just
wait until Solvency II comes in without having to take any action. But obviously, below a
certain level, you'd want to do something about it. Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yes, capitalizing the Life company, there is -- with present rules, there is no need to
capitalize, because we have 5 times Solvency I capital. And actually, Mandatum Life has
probably the strongest Solvency capital in the Finnish Life market.
Then, if and when the Solvency II rules come into place, basically, we would use hybrid
capital. Now we have pretty much used maximum hybrid capital under Solvency I rules.
We can put in EUR110 million. We have already EUR100 million. But under Solvency II
rules, we could increase the amount of hybrid. And that would be simply done from the
parent company level.

FINAL

Then, the sensitivity on -- the biggest sensitivity, actually, on the Solvency level, comes
again from the equity sensitivities in the Solvency calculation. Our intention was actually to
put in exact the sensitivity also on the economic capital. But you can use as a proxy the
Life insurance company sensitivity to equities. So that keeps the biggest volatility also on
the Solvency capital.
Then, the discount rate factor, interest rate yield curve is already so low. So it's unlikely to
assume -- or, I don't know if anything is unlikely in this world. But it's unlikely to see any
massive movements on -- to a lower yield curve that would further put pressure on the
adjusted Solvency capital. So the biggest hit has already been taken.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

If I could just return on that quickly? You have a very big duration mismatch in the Life
business. And you have quite onerous guarantees. So, 2%, 3%, 4% that have a long
duration themselves. So I'm starting to see why equities would be the biggest impact. I
realize equities is about 25% of the portfolio now. But if you just have a 50 basis point
reduction, albeit we're at low levels anyway. But if you have a 50 basis point reduction in
risk free, though, I would have thought that would have a very strong impact on your
economic capital.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

But it's pretty much already priced in. So it has the yield curve shift, which has been much
bigger than 50 basis points, has already wiped out the adjusted buﬀer that we had from
discounting the liabilities.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Yes. But -- yes. But we could still move down another 50 basis points?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yes. Then if we move another 50 basis points down, actually, then on the other hand,
actually, equities have moved up quite signiﬁcantly in the beginning of the year. So that
has, again, given us additional capital.
But still -- still, under Solvency I rules, this is a non-issue.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, very much.
