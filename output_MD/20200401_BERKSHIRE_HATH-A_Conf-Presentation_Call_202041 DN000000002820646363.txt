Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Bloomberg Intelligence briefing explaining
business interruption insurance in a COVID-19 world. This call is being recorded. There will
be a replay available on the Bloomberg Terminal.
Just briefly what is Bloomberg Intelligence. We provide in-depth research and data on
industries and companies. We cover over 135 industries and over 1,900 companies. The
disclaimer, there is no actual slides for this call.

Bloomberg Transcript

These are the speakers today. You can access our research on BI INSUR that's property
casualty insurance research, BI COVID is all of the COVID related research and VRUS GO
is the hub on Bloomberg for kind of all COVID information.
So clearly, we are in unprecedented times. Businesses around the world, big and small are
being disrupted by the coronavirus. These businesses have insurance. But how and in
some cases, if that insurance will respond is a huge question? Since the virus started to
spread in US, our initial read has been that insurers may be able to avoid large scale
claims based on communicable disease exclusions and property damage requirements,
but risk seems to be growing. Lot will depend on court interpretations, secondary effects
and other insurance lines and even actions by the state and federal government.
Also in the financial analysis side of things, we are often not experts in the legal
interpretation of insurance contracts, so we've asked some experts in the legal
interpretation of the contracts to join us. We have Finley Harckham from Anderson Kill and
William Wagner and Lauren Lonergan from Taft. They are, I believe all attorneys on the
side of recovering insurance from insurance companies on behalf of insureds.
So I am just going to dive in with first question on business interruption insurance in
property policy. So Finley, can you just talk about some ways business interruption is
triggered in property policies.

Sure. The -- in fact business interruption coverage is the spot to look forward is in
commercial property policies, and the trigger or the business interruption coverage in
their various kinds, which we're all going to talk about is property damage. So you got to
have property damage somewhere to trigger one of these coverages. The typical
situation is you have damage to your own property, a fire, a flood, whatever it may be
here in this case, the question is, if there was a presence of coronavirus would that be
property damage to your premises. And then if there is property damage, you get
essentially lost profits coverage, business interruption coverage or the time period that it
would take to restore or repair the damage property. So that -- excuse me -- that's the
basic property damage and business interruption coverage.
Then there are -- but there are various extensions to the business interruption coverage.
I'm going to touch on one, and then pass it over to Bill and that is contingent business
interruption. And contingent business interruption provides coverage for your loss, if
you're the policyholder that results from property damage to property of a supplier or a
customer.

Bloomberg Transcript

And so this is a -- this is a supply chain related loss. Let's say you -- your business is
dependent upon suppliers in China, and they suffered property damage there or even
through the means of transportation that gets the goods or supplies to you from a place
like China, they can be considered a supplier as well, like a port or in airport or a shipping
company. So if they suffer property damage and that results in the loss [ph] you -- that can
be covered.
And then another category of contingent business interruption coverage is called leader
property coverage is loss that you suffer because of damage to a property that attracts
business to your business. And a classic example is, if Disney World -- when Disney World
was shutdown in Florida, if you have a hotel nearby that's a leader property, an attraction
property you get business because Disney World is there. And if Disney world is closed
because of property damage that would trigger and you suffer a loss that would trigger
your contingent business interruption coverage.

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

Okay. So Finley before I jump to Lauren and Bill on that, is contingent coverage is that an
add-on or is that -- would an insured pay more for that or is just that -- that standard.

Finley T. Harckham

{BIO 3046626 <GO>}

It's a fairly standard coverage, but there are different versions of the coverage that can
be found in various policies. But most commercial property policies will have some form of
contingent business interruption coverage. If you look at the policy carefully to see how
broad that coverage is.

Okay. That makes sense. So for Bill and/or Lauren, maybe can you talk about obviously
we're having federal governments mandating shutdowns and stay in home orders, how
does a civil authority trigger a play into that?

FINAL

Lauren E. Lonergan

{BIO 20184195 <GO>}

(Multiple Speakers). Yeah. The civil authority coverage is triggered when you have a
governmental order prohibiting access to property typically the insureds property and it is
due to the property damage or physical injury to either the insureds premises or some
third parties premises. And the key issues really are the -- whether there is the type of
property damage the physical injury that I think we're going to talk about in a minute, but
also there has to be -- there has to be a nexus between the governmental order and
prohibition and access and the property damage. And it's -- we've been looking at the
orders, some of them are helpful. We have some ideas about how government could
potentially expand on those and help insureds, but that's the basics of how the coverage
works. And what you get for that coverage is the same thing as you get typically for
ordinary business interruption coverage lost profit extra expense [ph].

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

Okay. Great. So how about Bill you could tackle this one. So it seems like obviously the
multi-billion dollar question in all of this is going to be can the virus or the presence of the
virus or in some way the virus just be construed as property damage?

Bloomberg Transcript

William C. Wagner

{BIO 20253176 <GO>}

Well, so that is a million dollar question, and it really depends on the case law state-bystate basis, when you start looking at it at a high level. There is unfortunately a case in
Ohio that had started out with someone, who had mold or mildew on the side of their
building and brought a property damage claim under their insurance policy. And the ruling
essentially said that it's something that could be washed off a bleach, it was a temporary
condition, it didn't affect the structure or integrity of the house, it wasn't destroying the
wood, therefore, there is no property damage. And that sort of predicated in the line of
cases, including in Michigan.
And there is one key line in that case, though, it says that the only time that it would be
necessary to replace the signing would be on recommendation of a certified hygienists or
a physician for health concerns. I think that's where a lot of the case law turned, a lot of
the cases that have taken the opposite approach has focused on -- does the presence of
contaminant render the property contaminated, uninhabitable or unfit for its intended use.
And then a string of cases that have looked at asbestos dust, fumes from spilled
ammonia, fumes from gasoline, spills inside of a premises, mold, off-gas and from
Chinese drywall, all these instances could result in damage to property -- physical damage
to property, and it's really turns on again case by case basis. And when you look at that,
these policies are going to be interpreted from the point of what would an average
insured understand the policy to cover.

Page 3 of 15

FINAL

And I think that will be some arguments that could be made to say that yes this is
property damage. The -- one of the questions that comes in is, how are you going to
prove that you have property damage. We are talking to certified industrial hygienists that
are now able to take swab samples of surfaces to determine whether or not the COVID
virus is present.
And there are some studies that have shown in fact go into the original SAARs, the
original virus began this in 2003. There is a study that shows that particular virus was able
to stay viable on a stainless steel surface at a low temperature for up to 28 days. And I
think there is a recent study by the CDC that looked at some of the cruise lines that also
concluded that a virus was able to be found 17 days after passengers debarked from one
of the cruise lines.
So as a result of the present of the virus, you're going to have health department,
medical experts, certified industrial hygienists, others testify that the premier -- presence
of the virus renders the property either uninhabitable, unfit for its intended use or
contaminated, so that it requires a robust disinfection. So that's how we get over the
hurdle of proving that, yes, it is physical damage to property.

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So two follow-ups on that. First one is, so you mentioned, I guess, there is some
previous case law is, how does that compare to perhaps coverage issues or other things
in the past, meaning, is there a lot of precedent to go back on this and is there much
related to viruses and do they differ from other contaminants?

William C. Wagner

{BIO 20253176 <GO>}

So the case law that deals with bacteria and other pathogens goes back, I want to say to
the 2000 time frame at least some of the case law that I'm aware of. And I think that case
law looks at whether or not it requires some sort of a remedy, some sort of a direct action
to make the property habitable. One of the things that I'm hearing from certified industrial
hygienists is that this bacteria if you left it alone, it would essentially die on its own within a
month. But that's just not practical in a business setting, right. We have to get in there and
clean the surfaces to make sure that the containment won't spread. So I think that is going
to sort of make this case different than some of the others.
In the asbestos setting, asbestos is a contaminant that is going to be present until it's
cleaned up. There are some cases that have looked at mold and mildew and other
bacteria, Legionella, Legionnaires' disease, et cetera, and they have focused on, is there
a standard that requires a clean up versus just having a presence. There is some cases,
where mold was present. And the court held if it's not required to be cleaned up because
it's not at that level, then it doesn't amount to property damage. But I think all these cases
are going to sort of be markers on how a court will eventually interpret this decision on a
state-by-state basis.

Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc

Okay. Are there any states that you would view as more policyholder friendly on this -- on
these issues?

FINAL

William C. Wagner

{BIO 20253176 <GO>}

Well, I think, Illinois, Colorado, New Jersey, Oregon, New Hampshire. New Hampshire just
had a Supreme Court case, where they deferred the issue of whether cat urine odor
resulted in permanent property damage. So again, it's going to be on a case-by-case
basis. Some of the cases that would be more in favor of the policyholder, would be
possibly Ohio, likely Michigan. But I think some of these other cases or other states would
be more favorable to a policyholder.

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

Okay. So we move back to Finley. So really how do -- we're hearing is that, that viruses
maybe excluded or they are not a covered peril. How does that square with let's say it is
property damage, how do those two things interact?

Finley T. Harckham

{BIO 3046626 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So first let me just start by pointing out that some -- there are -- there are buyers
exclusions in many policies, but there are some policies that expressly cover
communicable diseases, whether it would be disinfecting cause or prohibition of access
are as a result of communicable disease. So the mere fact that, if there are exclusion in
some policies doesn't mean they exist everywhere.
You got to check your policy to see you may actually have coverage, it's not -- it's not
standard, but especially some of the bigger programs may have some specific coverage.
But with respect to the exclusions, you really got to look carefully at what the exclusion
covers. Now, many policies do have exclusions that are -- that are covered viruses and
that covers viruses with respect to all of the different coverages in the policy, and -- and
those policyholders may just be out of luck.
But that is not the case in many policies, some policies have a communicable disease
exclusion or a virus exclusion that may apply to some or not all coverages that may be
found in a pollution or contamination exclusion. The word virus may appear in there. And
again, sometimes those will apply to some, but not all coverages. I was looking at a -- at a
client's policy, the other day that had a definition of pollution and contamination for an
exclusion, it included the word virus, but it was prefaced with the language that said this
exclusion is limited to land, air and water.
So what's not included in land, air and water, well indoor contamination may not be
included in land, air and water. In fact, in New York, there is a line of cases or at least a few
cases, including a case by the highest court in New York, some years back, which said that
asbestos particle inside a building did not constitute contamination of the atmosphere
and we're not -- did not fall within a pollution exclusion. And there is a more recent case,
federal court case in New York that has also held that more recent pollution exclusions do

Page 5 of 15

Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2020-04-01

FINAL

not apply to indoor contamination. So if you can build an argument for your direct bottle of
property damage and business interruption to your own premises, based upon indoor
contamination, if that's where your virus exclusion exist, you may very well have coverage.
As Bill said, this is going to be a state-by-state analysis because that's the way insurance
policies are interpreted. Every state comes up with its own law on interpreting these
policies even though many of the policies are the same. But the takeaway on these
exclusions is, you have to look carefully to see how broadly applied they are, and where
they appear in the policy because if they're in a pollution and contamination exclusion, it
might not apply across the board, it might not apply to indoor contamination that may
trigger your own property damage coverage and may trigger contingent business
interruption coverage and it may trigger civil authority coverage.

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

Okay. Fin, let me just stay with you. I think you had brought up China suppliers and
potentially falling under contingent, how does that work internationally. So if a Chinese
company was shutdown due to the virus, and that was your supplier, how does that work
with a New York State company or interpreting that policy?

Bloomberg Transcript

William C. Wagner

{BIO 20253176 <GO>}

Yeah. It can get complicated because the contingent business interruption coverage can
be extended to include orders of civil authority, so let's say, you've got -- you're getting
your supply of widgets from China. If their plant is shut down either because of the
presence of coronavirus at the plant or in some cases, if there is an order of civil authority
in China because coronavirus is present assuming it's considered property damage, it's
present near that factory and that shuts down your supply, under most policies that would
trigger your own contingent business interruption loss. You would be entitled, if you have
to go find another supplier at a higher cost, you loose sales that would be covered
contingent business interruption loss.
And also, many of these policies provide coverage for different tiers of suppliers, so it
could be a supplier of a supplier, who suffers the loss. So if one of your suppliers is getting
component parts, whether it's from China or whether it's from Ohio and they are
shutdown and therefore your supplier, because the sub supplier is shutdown, your
supplier can't deliver, you might get contingent business interruption coverage for that
loss.
And then finally, as I mentioned before and there is a case on this about shippers or
entities that facilitate transportation and if they suffer damage that can be contingent
business interruption loss as well. There was a flooding in the Mississippi River some years
back and the Army Corps of Engineers ran a number of facilities that directly traffic and
govern traffic on the Mississippi River.
And when Archer Daniels Midland's couldn't get it -- its crops that it was purchasing from
farmers to its processing facilities down the river because of damage to those Army

Page 6 of 15



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2020-04-01

Corps of Engineer facilities that was considered contingent business interruption and it
triggered coverage for ADM. So there are various scenarios and some are going to be
covered and some are not. But again, you want to look very closely at your contingent
business interruption coverage to see -- to see how far it goes.

FINAL

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

Okay. So this is -- for anyone, who wants to answer. We wouldn't mention specific
companies, but if anyone was comfortable, I know that you're focused on kind of mid to
smaller companies, but I think a lot of the pain maybe experienced by mid -- can you just
focus on mid to large companies, I think a lot of the pain might be focused on smaller
companies. Is there any -- from what we hear from public insurers that on these smaller
companies, the limits are somewhat low, would you have any comment on limit size,
maybe in smaller companies.
And secondary to that I've read some insurers were saying maybe they could limit
coverage to the amount of time that it might have taken a premises to clean or
remediate, which in their view would have been a short period of time. So could anyone
speak on any of those?

Bloomberg Transcript

Finley T. Harckham

{BIO 3046626 <GO>}

This is Finely. Maybe I'll just take the first point. The -- that oftentimes the coverage is
limited depending on the coverage by dollar amount or by a time period. And yes, you
would think you could disinfect rather quickly. But there is an additional coverage that's
found in many policies call extended period of interruption coverage, which often
provides up to a year, maybe less, a business interruption coverage for the time it takes
your business to restore its volume of business and restore its profit level after the
business interruption and the property damage have been remedied.
So again, a client for example, that's a museum in New York and they had property
damage when these orders are lifted, the question will be whether they get this
extended period of interruption coverage because we can well imagine that people are
not going to be flocking back to crowded spaces like museums right after these orders
are lifted. And so that extended period of business interruption coverage may be very
important to little companies as well as large companies because it extends that business
interruption coverage out even after the property has been repaired.

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

Okay. (Multiple Speakers).

William C. Wagner

{BIO 20253176 <GO>}

Yeah. This is Bill. I just had a couple of thoughts based on what Finley said. There are also
a certain buckets of coverage that many people would gloss over, for example, there's
maybe crisis management response. So after you had your contingent business
interruption that extends out past the time you're backup and doors are open and
Page 7 of 15



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2020-04-01

FINAL

customers coming in, but your -- your number of -- your amount of income is less than
what you -- it was previously. There might be coverage to pay for additional advertising
and other marketing efforts to help get your business backup and running.
There is also loss assessment coverage. For example, there maybe a bucket of -- for
small policies, I think $10,000, $25,000 to hire either a council and/or forensic accounts to
come in and do a loss assessment to help a company determine how much income its
lost.
And I think one of the challenges, one of the things that we're telling our clients is, even if
you aren't sure whether your policy has this coverage, and you don't want to spend any -the money to have an attorney to look at it. There is no harm in submitting a notice of
loss. If you don't submit a notice of loss promptly, you could end up leaving your client. So
absolutely submit a notice of loss and have that processed timely by the insurance
company, it will preserve the statute [ph] limitation, should you have to file a lawsuit later
and that's it.

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So let me, you mentioned the civil authority, let me jump back to that. You had
mentioned it requiring property damage as well, and we've kind of been over whether or
not the virus could be construed. Is that -- I guess, one question coming in is, are the civil
authority issues they are being raised to reduce the spread of the virus, not necessarily
because of property damages spurned on by the virus. Does that weakened the case for
civil authority claim? Maybe Finley, if you want to answer that one.

Finley T. Harckham

{BIO 3046626 <GO>}

Sure. Yeah, that -- that is a -- an issue that is hotly debated now and it really depends on -could depend on the geographic location and the timing. So in other words, when they
enter these orders in New York City, I think we would all argue the presence of the
coronavirus there was the motivating factor. It was -- it's -- sure a fear of spread was also
a consideration, but it was there. And there is no doubt that it was there, and it's going to
be pretty easy in some areas to establish that when these orders were entered, the virus
was present within the distance. It's usually one mile or five miles of the insured premises
that where you need to find the property damage to trigger that coverage.
In other areas, it was a prophylactic measure initially to say we don't want this to spread to
your areas, so we're going to shut you down as well. But as we're finding now the virus is
pervasive, it's everywhere or it seems like soon it's going to be everywhere certainly a lot
more places, and I think policyholders will have a good argument again, assuming they
can overcome this hurdle, the property damage to say, well there may have been a time
when this was a purely prophylactic measure, but it transformed into a concern about
actual property damage because the property damage actually arrived.
We had this with Hurricane Katrina claims when they abandoned the City of New Orleans,
evacuated the City before the hurricane hit and insurance companies argued well, that

Page 8 of 15

Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2020-04-01

FINAL

was a prophylactic measure. There was no damage in New Orleans or right nearby at the
time that -- that those orders were entered, the evacuation order was entered. But
shortly thereafter, of course, the City got cleaned and I think policyholders will have a
good argument as long as the virus ends up being physically present at some point in
their area that the civil authority will be triggered at some point, even if it started out as a
purely preventative measure, which would not be covered.

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

Okay. Go ahead.

William C. Wagner

{BIO 20253176 <GO>}

And I think just -- just to -- and just to piggyback on that comment. I think there are a lot of
state and local health departments that are now reporting the present -- the local present
of people, who are diagnosed with coronavirus. And you also have a complicating factor is
that of the people, who are diagnosed with coronavirus, half of them, I believe are
showing no symptoms. They are completely asymptomatic.

Bloomberg Transcript

So you could have people coming into your place of business, employees, customers,
suppliers, who look fine, feel fine, but yet are spreading the virus. And I think on the basis
of that, if you know you're going to have a client, you may want to have some testing
done, so that you could prove that the coronavirus was present in your place of business
down the road, when you make your loss claim.

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

So you're saying businesses now should act -- if they plan to file a claim should act now to
have that tested because I guess, as we were saying earlier, the virus lives a finite amount
of time on surfaces. So is that something you're advising clients to do now is to actually
have people coming in testing the premises?

William C. Wagner

{BIO 20253176 <GO>}

No, testing the premises and also keeping records. For example, if you're a hotel, are you
getting any phone calls from guests, who were saying, yeah, I just got diagnosed with
coronavirus. I was in your hotel last week on my way down to wherever the destination is
or if you're a restaurant, do you have a customer, who calls and he suggests I was at your
restaurant yesterday, I just got diagnosed with coronavirus. I want to let you know.
I mean those are the type of things that business owners have to keep diligent records
now because if you're not making -- keeping a journal for example, on a daily basis, you're
going to forget about these type of events years from now, should your case end up
going into litigation, right. So if you can -- if there is grounds to have your property tested,
I think you should. If you have secondary evidence of customers, employees, anyone who
has been into property, who has been diagnosed with coronavirus, I think you should keep
that information.

FINAL

I think we're getting estimates now that just to have the swabs tested, I think is about
$200 per sample, not including the collection costs in the five to seven day turnaround
period. So given those circumstances and given that do we know that this loss is going to
be for 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, do you want to take some samples on a regular basis
to see you can prove your claim, the later point in time. These are all questions that are
brand new that we're all sort of feeling our way through the dark, as we go forward, so.

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

Okay. So -- go ahead.

Lauren E. Lonergan

{BIO 20184195 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Just -- I just want to piggyback one thing that Finley said. So on the civil authority,
one of the questions I think that's out there is whether the insured has to prove the
presence of the virus in the adjacent property, the property within five miles. My own view
would be that if the governmental agency in its order says it's present in property in the
vicinity needed to trigger the coverage that -- that alone might be enough, so that
especially when we're talking about smaller insureds like restaurants and things like that.
That might be a way to make it a bit easier for them.
And so, for instance, one of the things, it would be helpful here is that the governmental
orders actually said that. Some of them come very close, but or if they were to make
findings, I'm sure that in some cases we know that health authorities are in fact out there
testing. For instance, Dr. Birx has been talking about the presence of the virus on the
surfaces in the New York subway things like that could be very helpful to especially smaller
insureds. So it's something for all of us to think about and consider asking our local
authorities to do.

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

Okay. So you're saying right now, the local authority orders are, I guess, somewhat light on
cause for trigger of claims?

Lauren E. Lonergan

{BIO 20184195 <GO>}

I think it's going to be. So if they say nothing, then I think the insured will be in a position to
present evidence that the reason that they did it was -- was the presence of the virus. If
they say was issuing the order because people in our community have COVID-19 that
maybe -- maybe more challenging. It might have to be -- it might be necessary to show
that there was -- that the presence of people were the contaminants, and also means
there's contaminants on the surfaces of the property that is needed to trigger the
coverage, but they can make those findings.
And I think we've been looking at the orders, many of them are -- they are very helpful
especially for smaller insureds, but they could go a bit further. And I think make those
findings in the actual orders, which would and they could do it now. I mean even if -- as
Finley certainly suggested, it was initially intended to be preventative because they didn't
Page 10 of 15



Company N ame: Berkshire H athaway I nc
Company Ticker: BRK /A US Equity
Date: 2020-04-01

know. I think they probably know better now, whether it's present on surfaces within the
community, and I think that if they were to reissue orders now with specific findings that
would be extremely helpful.

FINAL

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

Okay. So let me just jump to some questions from the webinar. For anyone, is there a
comment on the jurisdiction over BI claims. Is it the location of the insured premises or the
state of the insurer?

Finley T. Harckham

{BIO 3046626 <GO>}

This is Finley. That's an excellent question. Because as I think we've all alluded to, these
issues are going to be decided in each state, and it's not uncommon that you get
different results from courts in different states on interpreting the exact same policy
language. It's happened on lots of important issues in insurance coverage. So you have
that you have -- what you have that you call a choice of law issue.

Bloomberg Transcript

If you're a small business, and you've got one location in one state, it's probably pretty
clear that unless there is a choice of law provision in the policy, which says the different
state law applies, it's probably going to be the law or [ph] the state, where your business
is. But if you're a company with operations throughout the country, maybe throughout the
world, there maybe a choice of law provision in the policy, often times a default is to
either the place of your headquarters or to a place, where the damage was sound, but
there are various legal tests for that and different courts use different tests for that.
So if the courts end up all over the math in terms of whether there is coverage for this
type of situation, we lawyers are going to engage in a lot of analysis of figuring out where
we want to file for our clients, where they've got the best chance of getting a favorable
law applied and sometimes that's a complicated question. But if you're a little business,
you're located in one state chances are that state law is going to be applied unless there
is a choice of law provision specifically in the policy.

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

Okay. Great. One more from the webinar maybe Bill or Lauren can take this. Do most
policies include an aggregate limit that may come into play.

William C. Wagner

{BIO 20253176 <GO>}

Yeah. (Multiple Speakers). Yeah, most policies have a policy limit that they will pay out
either on the business interruption, contingent business interruption or if that a
subcategory it's limited by time, as Finley said earlier, 60 days one year on the contingent
business interruption up to the policy limit. So I don't think I'll ever pay out more than the
policy limit.

Okay. And but there are -- a total aggregate limit, so if one piece of the BI perhaps could
that chew up the entire aggregate limit on the policy or would a sub-limit (Multiple
Speakers).

FINAL

William C. Wagner

{BIO 20253176 <GO>}

It depends. It depends, if there is a sub-limit or if it just applies against the actual limit for
the policy. That's going to be again, on a policy-by-policy basis well, you would just have to
look at policy.

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

Okay. How about this one. So we've talked about property lines of business in BI pretty
exclusively here. What do you think exposure is in casualty lines, so general liability,
directors and officers, and even you probably don't get into workers comp, but do you
think -- how do you think the size -- the magnitude of that. I guess, I'd call it risk to insurers
measures up against this property side? How about Finley?

Bloomberg Transcript

Finley T. Harckham

{BIO 3046626 <GO>}

I think that's the next wave and so we're going to have to see what happens. There is no
doubt it seems that there are going to be suits against companies for allegedly
mishandling this coronavirus situation either with their employees, and there are actually
well, maybe some interesting issues in terms of workers comp or their workers comp
applies or not, where you're sending your workers to work at home and they can attract
the disease.
So there could be some workers comp related issues, general liability related issues of
people saying, I was injured because you mishandled the response to this situation. And
then directors and officers, the policies maybe implicated if shareholders may well bring
suits down the road to say company's Board mishandled the situation or was unprepared
for the situation. But I think -- I think that's kind of the next wave that we -- at least I haven't
seen much of that type of allegation thus far. But I think lots of policyholders are
concerned that -- that maybe coming down the road.

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

Okay. So Bill as a follow-up --

William C. Wagner

{BIO 20253176 <GO>}

This is Bill. Just to -- yeah, just -- just to piggyback off what Finley just said. So there are
some lawsuits that are being filed and the ones to watch the cruise line industry. So there,
the CDC has actually done studies of the crew members and the passengers and found
that, for example, there was a CDC study and it's morbidity and mortality weekly report
of March 23 that said that on the Diamond Princess, for example, there were crew
members that were asymptomatic and during cruise A and then by the time of cruise B,
they became symptomatic and then passed on the virus to passengers.

So there is a lawsuit that's already been found, I believe, in relation to that where it's
pretty easy to prove that, yes, my virus occurred while I was at cruise -- a passenger on a
cruise line in the middle of the ocean. Now the more difficult problem is going to be, if you
claim that you contracted coronavirus from going to a restaurant or going to a hotel that is
going to be a much higher difficult, much more difficult burden to prove because then
you're going to have to prove that you actually did contracted that the virus was present
at the restaurant, for example, at the time that you were there that there was a greater
chance that they almost occurred from that location and your damage is related to that as
opposed to catching up from somewhere else.
Another issue on the directors and officers cases that we've seen, there have been some
lawsuits had been filed, where investors have sued corporations and management on the
basis of shareholder lawsuit saying that the management downplayed the threat of the
coronavirus, they downplayed the risk. And as a result of that investors continued to invest
good money after bad [ph] into these companies. And so there are shareholder lawsuit
saying that as a result of that fraudulent statement or misrepresentation that they have
been harmed. And I think with the market bottoming out, I think you're going to find those
suits much more prevalent as time goes on.

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. That makes a lot of sense. So follow-up question from the webinar. What do you
think about companies, who may not have coverage turning around and perhaps suing
their Insurance agents and brokers for not properly covering them? How about Finley take
that one?

Finley T. Harckham

{BIO 3046626 <GO>}

It's -- again may depend upon the jurisdiction that they're in, in New York, where [ph] I
practice. The insurance broker generally has no duty to tell or advise the policyholder
about what types of coverage, they need or should get. They are really an order taker.
But if you sign a client services contract in which you agree to provide advice as to what
type of coverage to get then that could open the door to sue against the broker for
failing to properly advise the client.
So if you have a -- at least in New York, you need that type of client services relationship,
in some other states, you don't need to have that if you're the broker of record then that
can impose duties upon you without even having a broad and specific agreement to
advise the client. But it really varies from -- from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and depending
on whether or not, you have an actual client services agreement with your broker or it's
been there is -- the other issue of whether or not it's -- this was something that the broker
should have anticipated and whether there was any negligence in any event. But the
threshold issue of whether or not you can go after them may depend on state law and
the nature of your contract with the broker.

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

Okay. So Bill, go ahead.

FINAL

William C. Wagner

{BIO 20253176 <GO>}

Yeah. One more point. I've seen some lawsuits, where restaurants are filing lawsuits
against their broker saying, for example, a virus or bacterial or micro organism
contaminant that is the highest risk that I have as a restaurant owner next to a slip and fall,
right, is that something is going to be passed on from my restaurant and injure the patron
and is that something I expected my broker to look at and procure insurance for at least
make the recommendation. So I could make a conscious decision on whether or not to
buy that insurance. That's one thing.
I also encourage people don't -- right now be discouraged that there is no insurance
coverage because we talked about this in the pre-call, but there are some states that are
advancing legislation to try to read these type of virus exclusions out of the policy. Ohio,
Massachusetts have a new law. New Jersey proposed a law, it was tabled. But there were
some states that are considering whether for small businesses, I think Ohio is 150
employees or less.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think, Massachusetts, maybe 100 employees or less. If you bought a commercial
property policy that had business interruption coverage that there is some legislation to
propose that you won't have to worry about, was there a direct physical property
damage, that is what is it, there is business interruption coverage. They will treat the virus
as resulting in property damage and also that they will read some of these exclusions,
some of these virus exclusions out of the policies. So I would again, make a claim whole
tight [ph] and it may be a long -- a long road ahead. But I wouldn't abandon any claims at
this point.

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

Okay. That was going to be my last topic. So maybe Finley, if you don't mind weighing in
on that proposed legislation. I think I would assume insurers would fight pretty hard again
something like that. What do you think the -- if you could handicap at the odds of
something like that happening actually even or?

Finley T. Harckham

{BIO 3046626 <GO>}

Well, there were a couple of different ways it can be done. One is to try and legislate a
change in the terms of the policies. And I think, of course, the insurance companies are
going to fight that. There are constitutional problems with that because you have the right
to contract, people have the right to contract. And it seems to me the insurance industry
will have a pretty good argument that the states cannot pass laws to change existing
contracts.
Having said that there is another way that some of these states that Bill mentioned are
going about it which, for example, the New Jersey bill, which says, we're going to read
the -- the virus exclusion out of these policies or any problem of property damage, we're
going to have the Insurance company adjust the claim and then we're going and pay the
claim and then they'll be reimbursed by the state, where they will adjust the claim and the
state will pay the claim.

FINAL

I think if states are really willing to incur that kind of a cost, that's a much more realistic way
of trying to do it. If -- the insurance companies, I think it's probably still opposed because
they don't want to be spending a lot of time adjusting claims and incurring expense. But at
least that's a plausible way of getting around the legal challenges, if the state -- if the
state is willing to ultimately foot the bill for the damage and maybe reimburse the
insurance companies, who are having to adjust the losses, then you get around this
problem of we've got a contract and we're entitled to enforce it.

Matthew Palazola

{BIO 20969450 <GO>}

Okay. So we're kind of coming on time. We got a couple of questions left in the queue,
but I think we'll try to follow-up with them offline. I really want to thank everyone that this is
really an informative call. I think this is going to be an issue. It's going to be with us for a
long time. So you can stay tuned on BI INSUR GO on the Bloomberg Terminal, and really
thanks a lot to all of our call participants. Thank you.
