MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the AXA Conference Call for the release of the NineMonth Activity Indicators. I will now hand over to Andrew Wallace-Barnett. Sir, please go
ahead.

Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the AXA conference call on our
activity indicators for the nine months of 2015. Gérald Harlin, our Group CFO, would like
to give you a quick overview of the main ﬁgures included in the press release, which we
issued last night, and which I know many of you have found that it's on our website.
Following that, Gérald would be happy to answer your questions.
Gérald, I hand over to you.

Gérald Harlin
Hello. Good morning and thank you, Andrew. Indeed, before moving to the Q&A session,
let me give you an overview of the main ﬁgures for these nine months. We have
continued to see growth across all business lines with total revenues up 2% on a

comparable basis and 9% on a reported basis to €76 billion. The higher level of reported
numbers is coming from the strengthening of all major currencies versus the euro. The
reported growth in the period illustrates the beneﬁts of the geographical diversiﬁcation of
the group.
Let's start with Life & Savings. On Life & Savings, growth momentum continued with 8%
APE growth. We continued to see strong top line performance in South-East Asia, India,
China region, plus 21%; France, plus 11%; and the rest of Continental Europe, mainly as a
result of our success in hybrid and pure Unit-Linked products; and the U.S., plus 5%.
We also had a very good performance in the UK with high sales of corporate pension
schemes underlining the strength of our UK Life business. This growth more than oﬀsets
the negative impact of the regulatory changes in Hong Kong, minus 10%, which are
impacting our Unit-Linked business. The repositioning of the Group Life product mix in
Switzerland, minus 14%, and the continued strategy of curtailing General Account Savings
business.
Overall, the NBV margin remained strong at 32%, a decrease of 2 points year-on-year. The
impacts were a less favorable mix, mainly due to the high sales of the UK corporate
pension scheme and the negative impact of lower interest rates in the U.S. VA products
which more than oﬀset an improvement in margin in other countries.

Bloomberg Transcript

Life & Savings net ﬂows for the quarter were fully up at €9.1 billion versus €2.8 billion in the
nine months last year. We saw strong inﬂows in both Protection & Health and Unit-Linked
businesses and outﬂows in General Account Savings totally in line with our strategy.
P&C revenues grew at 1%. In fact, it's 1.4%, to be more detailed, versus last year. Price
increases were 2.3% on average. In a competitive market, we remain committed to selling
proﬁtable business as was the case at the half year. In mature markets, we continued to
increase prices, mainly in France, the UK, and Ireland, and Germany, while at the same
time, focusing on more selective underwriting, notably in Spain and in construction in
France.
High growth markets revenues increased by 4% as we continued to improve the business
mix, notably in Turkey and Mexico, and increased prices. Direct revenues were up 7%,
mostly driven by strong volume growth mainly in the UK, France and Japan, and tariﬀ
increases, mainly in the UK, France and South Korea.
International Insurance revenues increased by 9%, reﬂecting the strong growth of AXA
Assistance with third-party clients, notably new large accounts won recently in the UK,
Italy and France. Asset Management business had strong net inﬂows at €32 billion with
€27 billion net inﬂows at AXA IM and €5 billion at AB. Economic solvency ratio was
estimated at around 212%, down 3% versus June 30, 2015 as the negative impact of
ﬁnancial market exposure was partially oﬀset by operating return contribution.
I would like to take the opportunity to remind you that we plan to share with you our
capital management framework at the beginning of December this year. It could be on

the 3rd of December. We have ﬁxed this date, and the presentation will be held in the late
afternoon at our London oﬃces.
I'm now happy to answer any questions.

FINAL

Q&A
Operator
The ﬁrst question is from Paul De'Ath, RBC.

Q - Paul C. De'Ath
Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I've got a couple of questions, if I may. Firstly, on the P&C
business. Obviously, things were a bit oﬀ on the price increases. There seemed to be
quite signiﬁcant price increases in the quarter. How much of that is, would you say, is kind
of AXA-speciﬁc and how much is any market hardening in any of those markets that
you've been raising the prices in? And that's question one.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second point is just on the UK Corporate and health institutional pension sales that
have come through in the quarter and they're obviously much lower margin than a lot of
the other stuﬀ you have in the Life business. And I just wanted to get some clariﬁcation on
this. So are these essentially asset management mandates? And if so, where do the
earnings come through? Do they come through in the Life business, or do they go into
the Asset Management business? Thanks.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. As far as the price increases are concerned, you can see on the press release on
page 15 the tariﬀ increases by country and business line, and you can notice that on
personal lines, we are 2.5%, on commercial lines 2.1%. And there is we started it out
hardening in the UK with 4.8% on personal lines and in Ireland, as you know. We could
say also that there are some countries, some speciﬁc countries we have some price
increases, which on a relative basis have increased. The prices increased in the third
quarter, and that's Turkey, for example, and Mexico. So, that's mostly what I can tell you
about these price increases. You can see that we still have a capacity to increase prices,
which is quite strong, which is a good news in line with our strategy to keep a strong
proﬁtability.
On your second question, about UK Corporate proﬁtability, I could say that, from an
accounting point of view, it's not accounted for the revenues, meaning that it's considered
as a deposit, so it's considered as a – I would say just like an asset management, but that's
not asset management because it's a real insurance contract, but of course, it's an
insurance contract with a low capital requirement which makes a diﬀerence with most
other contracts, but it's clearly an insurance contract. But you know that that's what we call
the deposit accounting under the IFRS rules. That means that contracts which are
considered mobile deposit also being real insurance contracts are accounted for direct
deposit.

FINAL

Thank you. The next question is from Nick Holmes, Société Générale.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Hi, Gérald. Nick Holmes of SocGen here. Just a couple of questions. First is wondered if
you could give us updates on the French ﬂoods in south of France, what your exposure
might be. Also, Hurricane Patricia, I know last year Odile cost you quite a lot in Mexico
and I guess Patricia is going to be quite a lot less than that, but your explanation there will
be great.
And then, ﬁnally, on commercial P&C, I think you've been fairly cautious in your guidance
on pricing and yet tariﬀ increases were up 2% and that seems pretty good, and I just
wondered whether you're becoming more optimistic about commercial pricing. Thanks
very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay, Nick. Starting ﬁrst with your ﬁrst question, the global cost of ﬂoods in France is
roughly €600 million gross, but we have a market share which is roughly 15% and we have
a reinsurance, which is a quota share on 50%, which means that the net cost for AXA, let's
say, would be €40 million to €50 million net, €100 million gross and roughly 40% to 50%
net before tax.
As far as Patricia is concerned, it's quite early to give you an update on this. But what I
could send, as you noticed, and hopefully it's been less dramatic than what we feared on –
much less dramatic than what we feared on Friday night. So that means that we don't
expect it to be quite signiﬁcant. It won't be zero but not at all signiﬁcant, nothing to do
with Odile at all.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Okay. That's very clear. Just out of interest, Gérald, have you increased your reinsurance
covers in Mexico, just in case we get more hurricanes?

A - Gérald Harlin
Yes, we did.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Gérald Harlin
Page 4 of 14



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2015-10-27

Yes, we did because you remember that – and I mentioned it in previous presentations
and calls that we considered that we were not suﬃciently protected, so it's done now.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. That's clear.

A - Gérald Harlin
Which, in fact, is good news. On commercial P&C, yes, I would say you're right. On
commercial P&C, what I can say is that we had – we made a lot of pruning in diﬀerent
countries, like it was the case in France, it was the case in Spain. It's been the case also in
diﬀerent countries, in emerging countries and especially in MedLA. So that means that at
the cost of a decrease of the top line, we indeed increased our prices, which again is a
good news, which means that we have this capacity, for example, the evolution up to now,
the evolution of construction in France is quite good.
So, let's wait, but this is the trend, and these trends conﬁrm our capacity. At the same
time, you can notice that on commercial line, we still were slightly positive, which means
that we had the capacity to increase our prices in these commercial lines. So, so far so
good. Again, it's a strong focus on proﬁtability.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. That's very clear. Just one quick follow-up, where in commercial lines would you be
most concerned? Which geography would you say?

A - Gérald Harlin
There is nothing speciﬁc, I would say. Nothing speciﬁc because I believe that now, after all
the changes that we have implemented and the price increases that we have
implemented, Nick, this year, I consider that most of the negative situation has been
restored. It doesn't mean that there won't be any areas where we could do better. But I
believe that most have been done, which bodes quite well for next year. And – so that's
mostly.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Very clear.

Operator
Thank you. The next question is from James Shuck, UBS.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Three quick ones from my side, please. Firstly, on Asset Management.
I was surprised to see Q3, you had €3 billion of outﬂows, €2 billion AllianceBernstein and
€1 billion at AXA IM. Could you just shed some light on what's happening there? I mean
previous quarters had turned to inﬂows, so I was a bit surprised to see the outﬂows in Q3.

FINAL

Secondly on the Hong Kong APE, I understand there's been regulatory changes mainly
around the disclosure of certain fees. I'm not seeing the same kind of declines at peers
though. A lot of peers are seeing improved eﬃciency and strong sales of products into
Mainland China. So, could you just explain a little bit why your numbers don't compare
with certain peers?
And then my third question is just a quick update on the Department of Labor proposal,
so the 10% to 30% decline in sales that you guided to early this year. Is that still – do you
still feel comfortable with that kind of level? Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. Let's start ﬁrst with your question on net inﬂows. So net outﬂows, that's true, we had
€3 billion of net outﬂows in Q3 after a strong start of the year. So that means that on a
cumulative basis at Q3 we have a strong net inﬂows. Let's say that in – at AB, I would say
the consequence of the turmoil that we had during the summer coming from China with
some outﬂows of institutional and retail.

Bloomberg Transcript

On AXA IM, minus €1 billion was partly due to – it's not on Asia. It's mostly coming on
other countries, of which we have Friends Life as you know, which represent part of it, and
with the merger of Aviva, Aviva is reintegrating part of their business. So, that's mostly it.
On the second question on Hong Kong APE, you should – that's a good question, and you
should take into account the fact that most of our peers – we have been quite successful
in the past year in selling and developing a lot of Unit-Linked business in Hong Kong. And
as you mentioned, due to change in regulation, our new business in Unit-Linked in Hong
Kong went down quite sharply, roughly more than 55% in Q3.
Why? Because there had been a change of regulation due to this disclosure of
commissions. But most of our peers were not on Unit-Linked business, they were on
traditional G/A business. And we checked, claims-wise they are still positive. So, as far as
we are concerned, sure, we foresee the minus 10% APE for the ﬁrst nine months. We are
working on new products that is actually part of them being Unit-Linked that is diﬀerent
design. And others – with other products that could be General Account product also but
with a low risk and without any large economic capital consumption, I could say. So that's
what I can tell you, and we are preparing ourselves to rebound in the future months and
especially in 2016.
An update on DOL, unfortunately, I cannot tell you more than what we said at the
beginning of August, meaning that we most probably will get news now mostly at the
beginning of 2016. As you know, there are a lot of lobbying coming from congressmen
and so on because there are – the Life – taking the example of the UK products, it's not in
the best interest of policyholders, especially it's not the case for high net worth, but for
the other one, it's not a good news. So let's wait. That's what I can say. And I cannot be
more precise, unfortunately, on what we said last time, i.e., minus 10% to minus 30%. So
let's wait.

FINAL

The next question is from Niccolo Dalla Palma, Exane BNP Paribas.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everyone. I had a couple of questions on P&C. The ﬁrst one, if
you can give us an indication on whether you're seeing some impact on churn in France
from the new Hamon Law? And the second one is concerning the reduction in net new
contracts in Spain and Turkey, which has clearly been quite substantial. Could you give us
at all the total number of contracts in Turkey and Spain to get a better feel on how big in
percentage the 558,000 would be in Turkey and the 279,000 reduction in Spain? Thank
you.

A - Gérald Harlin

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Let's start with the Loi Hamon. We can consider that today, roughly speaking, we
have 10% of our surrenders which are due to Loi Hamon for Motor. And for Household, it's
roughly 9% of surrenders. So, it's a bit early because it's a bit early to judge what will be
the global impact, but there is an impact. At the same time, keep in mind that there is
obviously a negative impact because that means that the duration of our policyholders
will go down, but an opportunity as well because we will have the opportunity to write
new business.
At the same time, keep in mind that the direct business, it's an opportunity for us as well
to write much more direct business. And you can see that we have been globally, we have
been a plus 7% in Direct business. And for – let me check, for France, Direct was at plus
7.9%. So let's say, plus 8% for the ﬁrst half, which in fact is a good news. So, yeah, plus and
minuses. That's exactly my point.
About Spain and Turkey, we could say that in Turkey, we had at the beginning of 2015,
let's say 4 million contracts and we had net outﬂows, I would say, of 558,000 contracts for
the ﬁrst 9 months, which means 14% down. So that mostly came from Motor, for the
reason we have already explained to you. That means that due to bodily injury, we
increased our prices in Turkey by 70% this year. So, you can see that it's – and we can
expect that now, we are at the highest level of proﬁtability. This concerned only TPL only.
It doesn't concern our capital because the capital was proﬁtable and we didn't have to
change the ﬁgures.
Your last question was about Spain. Do you have this ﬁgure? I'm sorry. I have to come
back to you because I don't have the Spanish ﬁgure. I have the global ﬁgure for MedLA,
but not for Spain. We'll come back to you. I'm sorry for that.

The next question is from Blair Stewart, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. A couple of questions left. Could you talk about the increase in – the 17%
increase in UK Personal Motor volumes? What's going on there? Secondly, could you talk
about the incidence of claims inﬂation? You've talked a little bit about higher price
increases, but what's happening to the situation net of claims inﬂation? Is that getting
better or worse?

Bloomberg Transcript

And thirdly, just coming back to the UK, I just wonder what's the point in writing huge
volumes of practically zero-margin business? In Q3, the margin dropped about 1%, I think
at this rate. So, I just wonder what's the beneﬁt of writing that business, Gérald?

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. Your question was about the increase of UK Motor. As you know, most of the UK
Motor we had an increase of 17%, and we had on average 10% price increase in Motor in
UK and Ireland. And on top of this, we had an increase in volumes in the UK of 7% and
minus 1% in Ireland. So that's the combination of those, which makes that we have a
strong performance.
And this is on top, we have Direct and in Direct, we have a very strong performance as
well because in Direct, we had an increase in the UK of 12.2%. So you can see that we are
performing quite well in the UK on both additional and Direct mainly due to price
increases and also volumes, which is in itself good news.
About the claims inﬂation, I would say that we – I don't believe that we have no speciﬁc
news compared to what I've told you for the ﬁrst half. That means that we don't see any
real claims inﬂation starting. Where we have claims inﬂation are the UK and Ireland, and
for the other countries, nothing new and nothing speciﬁc over the last payments.
And your last question is about UK. I would say that we cannot – there are products, of
course, which are less proﬁtable, but when you have opportunities to write large contracts
and when it contributes to your proﬁtability, i.e., covering some part of your ﬁxed cost
then you do it. That's the ﬁrst point. Second point, I repeat what I've said at the beginning,

Page 8 of 14



Company Name: AXA SA

Date: 2015-10-27

which is, Blair, that it doesn't consume any capital almost. So that means that on a capital
return basis, it's quite good.

FINAL

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

So just going back on a couple, Gérald, do you expect to revise your unit cost
assumptions in the UK given you've taken on that volume, or has that already come
through, ﬁrstly? And secondly, coming back to UK Motor, and it's such a competitive
market, how can you get a 10% price increase plus 7% volume? It just seems incredible.

A - Gérald Harlin
Please pay attention. Pay attention. Most of the capital increase was coming from Ireland.
And as you know, Ireland is a very speciﬁc situation where prices increased a lot. And your
other question was about the costs in the UK. Costs are adjusted, so that means that costs
are already adjusted. Take this already into account in the NBV margin. So that's it. For
Spain, we have 3.4 million contracts at the end of 2015.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Gérald Harlin
2014. At the end of 2014, beginning of 2015. Okay, Blair?

Thank you. The next question is from Michael Huttner, JPMorgan.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks very much. I just wondered, could you possibly give us a walk-through of the
change in the Solvency from 215% to 212%? It's a lovely number but a little bit of detail
would be really, really helpful. Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. We could say – and that's what I said. As you know, roughly speaking and
remember what I presented for the ﬁrst half, the operational return represents roughly 10
points for half year. So let's say that this half is 5%, 5% to 6% for the quarter, and we had a
negative impact of lower equity markets, lower interest rates. And that's the reason why
we are moving from 215% to 212%. So nothing new, relatively predictable, so that's what I
can tell you. Nothing speciﬁc more to say.

Excellent. And would there be – with the economic solvencies and on the 3rd of
December and the economic solvency in London, you talked about Solvency II. Are there
diﬀerences we should think about?

FINAL

A - Gérald Harlin
We said that – yeah. If your question is what about the ﬁnal regulatory solvency, that we
will share with you on the 3rd of December, I cannot say more than what we, Denis and
myself, we told you that means that it could be plus-minus 10%. So that's the points. So
nothing new on that side, but let's wait a few more weeks, and you will have the ﬁnal
ﬁgures.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Good enough. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Ralph Hebgen, KBW.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Hi. Good morning, guys. Just two things. One is on the solvency ratio again. We
know that you are neutralizing the sensitivity to corporate credit spreads by implementing
the liquidity premium. I wonder whether you could share with us what the impact of that
was. In other words, where would your solvency ratio have been had you not
implemented the liquidity premiums and neutralized spread sensitivity?
And second, just two details on P&C rate increases. One is in personal lines in
Switzerland. We see in the third quarter an acceleration of negative trends, if that makes
sense. And I was wondering whether you could comment on that. And in commercial
lines in Asia, the third quarter was the ﬁrst time that we see a notable swing from
increases to rate decreases. I would just welcome perhaps some commentary on these
dynamics. Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. First of all, relative to your ﬁrst question, spreads didn't move so much in the ﬁrst
quarter, so – in the third quarter between half year and nine months. So, Ralph, I can tell
you that the impact of the liquidity premium is very minor. It's really, what I said, it's really
the impact of interest rates that went down quite signiﬁcantly and equity markets. But as
far as the spreads are concerned, nothing speciﬁc to mention.
About the P&C market and the negative trends that we highlight on the personal in
Switzerland, you know that – I would say that and as you know, it's an extremely proﬁtable
market, and you cannot understand these moves as a softening of the market. Not at all.
Nothing speciﬁc to mention. We had a slight decrease but it's – look, inﬂation in
Switzerland is negative so rates are negative and so on and so forth, so nothing speciﬁc
and it remains an excellent and very proﬁtable market.

Can you repeat your question, Ralph, on this one?

FINAL

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Oh, yeah. It was just that I noticed that the premium rates in commercial lines in Asia have
become negative for the ﬁrst time in recent history. I was just wondering what was going
on there.

A - Gérald Harlin
No speciﬁc – we should go into a bit more detail but I have nothing in mind that would be
a matter of worry on that side. So we should have a more granular – I believe that it's more
to a more granular detailed analysis that I could – that we could give explanation, but it's a
lot of plus and minuses and I don't see any speciﬁc and real trends that you could
extrapolate for the future as far as this is concerned.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. The next question is from Jon Hocking, Morgan Stanley.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Morning, everybody. I've just got some – two questions please. I wanted to get your
comments on reinvestment yields and how that's trended over the quarter and what your
current view is given what's happened with spreads over the summer period and also the
fallback in yields? And the second, just to clarify, on the 3rd of December, are we going to
get full appraisal Solvency II numbers based on the nine months balance sheet? Is that the
intention? Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. On the investment yields, as you know, I mentioned to you last time in – for the ﬁrst
half, I told you that we have been reinvesting at an average at 2%. And indeed at the end
of, let's say – yeah, at the end of September, we should be maybe slightly above but it's a
matter of basis points. That means that – so, in other words, we will beneﬁt but it will be
small. We will beneﬁt from higher spreads because you know that spreads went up. But
spreads went up quite recently in October mostly, but it is oﬀset by lower rates.
So I believe I'm quite conscious, I'm quite conﬁdent in the fact that we won't be lower
than 2%. Maybe we could be somewhere between 2% and 2.1%, but something around
this, you see. So credit in line, so that means that nothing – I'm not worried at all because

Page 11 of 14



Company Name: AXA SA

Date: 2015-10-27

we planned and we assumed that we would be on this level. But for the time being, I
cannot say that we'll be much above this level.

FINAL

About Solvency II, yes, we will update you on the 3rd. We will update you on the levels
and on the level of Solvency, including at the end of September for sure.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Thank you. Can I just come back on the investment yields? Has your risk appetite changed
in any way given what we've seen in high yields because obviously there's been some
high-proﬁle spread-wide deals on single names in Europe? Have you changed your
approach? Recently, you've been quite short-duration high yields. I just wondered
whether you've changed that view at all?

A - Gérald Harlin

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. We have invested in short-duration high yield. As I told you last time, we consider
that it's a good risk. Does it mean that globally our risk appetite increased? I wouldn't say
so. I would say that the big diﬀerence is that whereas in the ﬁrst half of the year, we were
quite keen on investing in liquid assets. And we are still doing it. But now, the opportunity
for corporate bonds is more positive due to the slight increase. You notice that, for
example, we had an increase of roughly, over the last weeks, of roughly 30 basis points
on the senior lending, which indeed is a good news in that it makes the return, taking into
account the cost of equity, the return is better than it was before, and we are investing in
such class of assets.

Okay. That's excellent. Thank you very much.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay.

Thank you. The next question is from Andrew Crean, Autonomous Research.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Good morning, Gérald. I had a question along the longer-term side. Just looking back to
2007, I think your revenues ex-exchange are growing by only 1% from 2007 to 2015. And
over that period, I think on my numbers your underlying earnings was growing at 13%
although most of that, I think, is probably post the exchange. And so here's the point I'm
making is that over the long term, your proﬁts grow in line with your revenues.
Now, just wondering as you look forward to the next sort of Ambition AXA, whether in
order to grow proﬁt to sort of 5% to 10%, you need to accelerate the revenues or whether
you think that in the digital world, this is possible to grow proﬁts meaningfully faster than
revenues.

FINAL

It's both. That means that, ﬁrst of all, we should say that over the period that you
described, we had been hit by ﬁnancial conditions, which have been quite diﬃcult. Over
the long term, it's both, with or without still an increase in the proﬁtability, and we have
still levels in order to increase our proﬁtability, both on P&C side and on Life side, of
which, without any doubt, I would mention the technical side of mix products, especially
Life and some sort of expense savings and, at the same time, in the top line.
That means that we can expect that over the next years, we will have opportunities. And I
would like to mention the fact that we will have some opportunity to cross-sell, and that's
all what we are expecting. And you know that we have been investing a lot in digital, €950
million, over the last three years, €450 million this year. So we are expecting a lot on that
side. So that's why I'm telling you that it will come from both sides.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask a little bit about margins from an
IFRS point of view, earnings point of view in the Unit-Linked business. So, obviously,
you've had this big growth in the UK, which is very kind of low margin unit-linked to
market. And if you look at 2014, 2013 kind of numbers for the margin that you make on
average unit-linked liability, you're in the kind of 65 basis point to 70 basis point level
versus – close to, I would have thought, closer to zero in UK in the corporate pensions
business. I was wondering, are you conﬁdent, generally speaking, that you can maintain
that level of high margin in Unit-Linked going forward, given growth potentially in the UK
in particular, or do you see that margin coming down. Thanks.

A - Gérald Harlin
Well, for the time being, I don't expect on average that the traditional Unit-Linked
business, especially the individual Unit-Linked business because here we are speaking
from a very speciﬁc corporate line, corporate think that we will keep the same level of
margin. I would not say that it's forever, but at least we could say that in the foreseeable
future, I don't expect it to go down.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks so much.
