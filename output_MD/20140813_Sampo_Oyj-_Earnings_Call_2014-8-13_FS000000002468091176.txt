Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Sampo Group's Second Quarter 2014 Conference
Call. I'm Jarmo Salonen, Head of Investor Relations at Sampo. And with me at this call, I've
got our Group CEO and President, Kari Stadigh; Head of P&C Insurance, Torbjörn
Magnusson; and our Group CFO, Peter Johansson.
You can follow this call on our website, sampo.com/result, and a recorded version will be
available later at that same address. And as our normal practices, Kari will start with an
introduction to the Q2 development. Kari, please.

Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thanks. Welcome to the conference call on my behalf as well. Sampo Group had an
excellent performance throughout the ﬁrst six months. All three business areas had good
results. Our ﬁrst half year mark-to-market EPS was €1.41, up 36% from last year and Q2
NAV at €23 was an all-time high Q2 number.
Non-life operations report excellent results and the best ever ﬁrst half year combined ratio
at 88.3%. Focus on underwriting paid oﬀ, and claims development in the ﬁrst six months
was generally benign. Nordea, our associate, contributed over €300 million to our ﬁrst
half year result. Given the fact that this number contains our part of a restructuring charge
of €190 million; it's a very good result indeed.

Nordea's cost eﬃciency program, as such, is progressing as planned.

FINAL

Client intake and cash generation are strong. Focus on initiatives to regulate the risk
exposure amount, the divestment on Nordea Bank Polska; all these together decreased
the risk exposure amount signiﬁcantly. Following all these increased Nordea's fully loaded
Basel III Common equity tier 1 capital ratio to a healthy 15.2%.
Mandatum Life continued to increase volumes and its proﬁtability. The unit-linked
reserves reached an all-time high at about €5 billion. And we were able to lower the
discount rates for 2014, 2015 and 2016. The consent for the €1.3 billion group pension
portfolio transfer from Suomi Mutual to Mandatum Life was also received during the
second quarter and the transfer is scheduled to take place by year-end.
Good overall investment result for the ﬁrst six months as well. In If, the mark-to-market
return was 3.1% and in Mandatum Life, 3.9%. As I have stated already for a few quarters,
our main headache in investments is the declining running yield.

Bloomberg Transcript

I must admit that the decision by Riksbanken (03:34) to lower the spread in Sweden by 50
basis points was a surprise to me. So there are no free launches (03:42) left in the Nordic
area when trying to protect the running yield in our ﬁxed income portfolio. It is evident
that the cash portion of our portfolio will continue to grow.
You have all seen our guidance for the rest of the year and in fact, I don't have anything
else to add but my general feeling. We are well prepared and are in a very good position
for the future challenges that our group will face.

Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Thank you, Kari. And operator, we are now ready for questions.

Q&A
Operator
We have the ﬁrst question from Mr. Gianandrea Roberti from Carnegie. Please go ahead,
sir.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon from me. I have a couple of questions mostly referred to non-Life to
be honest. Can you describe in your view there's been a change in your reserve position
in the second quarter versus the ﬁrst one. I suspect I know the answer but it would be very
useful to just hear it from yourself?
And the second question on the reserve is that I've noticed last week one of the Nordic
competitor has booked a £19 million (05:12) reserve strengthening in the Nordic bulk

justifying it with an upcoming Swedish motor review, industry review, which I wasn't aware
of. And I'm just wondering if this is detected by the FSC or what? If you have any
comments on this, as well, that would be very helpful. Thanks.

FINAL

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
Change in the reserving position, Gianandrea, no we haven't changed the reserving
position. This quarter we took a charge of SEK 130 million against the Swedish annuity
reserves as they change continuously with the interest rates in the market. So, without that
we would have had a run-oﬀ gain as usual, I almost said. Like we don't have a policy and
that we should have gained some, we haven't changed the reserving strength at all in the
group.
Then RSA took a charge for longevity changes and again, as usual, we don't do it that
way. We reserve continuously for the projected changes in longevity that we see every
quarter, which is a diﬀerent way of doing it but we have already taken the same charges
gradually and continuously.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Just hold on. Just on that one. This industry review, is it dictated by the FSA or what?

A - Torbjörn Magnusson

Bloomberg Transcript

It's normally done by a body in the insurance federation but I haven't seen that that
there's a ﬁrm share – a ﬁrm time that that will happen. But it was some time since it was
done that is prudent to increase the reserves if you haven't done that but we have.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Super. Thanks a lot.

Operator
The next question comes from Mr. Vinit Malhotra from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead,
sir.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. Just two things I want to clarify from
some earlier comments going out (07:16) on the team. One is if you could just clarify, you
seem to indicate that you're not happy with the provision (07:24) in Sweden and again
they could be translation of other issues I just want to clarify, what has happened? We
know this Swedish energy charge (07:33) is reviewed every quarterly and even the last
what it seem to be in line. So, I'm wondering why you mentioned this if you just point
context there please.
And second thing is if you could just clarify, again a clariﬁcation, if you just clarify the exact
– the current status on this 33% cut oﬀ for Topdanmark? And what exactly is the regulatory
view that you understand today? Thank you very much.

FINAL

On Sweden, on the contrary, I'm quite pleased with the Swedish development. But it's
been commented in various reports that development is not good. But the underlying
development in Sweden, I'm quite pleased with the rate increases that we have had to
carry out in the past 12 months, more so on private lines than industrial lines.
I think there's still some room for improvement on the industrial lines, but the problem is
much smaller now than 12 months ago. So good development and then now and then
you have a large loss and that's as it is.
And as we just mentioned, the interest rates have come down. The annuities had to be
increased somewhat, but that will, in the end, come up again.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Sure. Thanks. (08:52)

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
And then on Topdanmark, the 33% cut-oﬀ point, I think you called it, is only valid if you
buy shares, not if that is surpassed by repurchasing of shares by the company.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank you very much, Torbjörn (09:12).

Operator
Next question comes from Mr. Daniel Do-Thoi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. Daniel Do-Thoi here. Just wanted to follow up on Torbjörn's (09:23)
comment on the Swedish Danske business, particularly if I look at the premium
development in your supplementary pack on slide 31. Swedish premiums tend to go very
strongly. Are you continuing to scale back in industrial line? Am I correct in understanding
that premium growth in Swedish private lines has accelerated quite a bit? And if so, can
you perhaps comment as to what is driving this? Whether it's purely the rate increases
that you alluded to earlier or whether there is any market share gains, et cetera. And also,
on the combined ratio of 94.1% in the quarter in Sweden, if I take your comment on the
Swedish annuity reserve, €130 million that you mentioned, I guess that's around 4%, 5% of
the combined ratios. So, if I adjust the combined ratios, then I'll get to around 88%, 89%.
And then I'll take your comment also in your report that large assets were certainly higher
in the Swedish business. So, am I correct in, sort of, thinking that things have improved
quite a bit in the Swedish business? I mean, is that a fair comment? And also, if you have
any favorable oﬀsetting eﬀect that may have occurred in the second quarter. Thank you.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson

Premium increases in Sweden were, yes, they were mainly in the Private (10:52) lines.
Some rate increases, notably in car insurance, new channels contributed, there's Nordea,
that's another new alliance agreement and also the Internet. And, yes, mainly Private
(11:10) lines.

FINAL

Car sales are up.
Car sales. Thank you. Yes, car sales are up in Sweden by 17%, which beneﬁts us as the
main car insurer. And then like, what like your expression, yes, combined ratios improved
quite a bit in Sweden. But of course, there are a number of things you have to adjust for.
So, for instance, the weather also in Q2 was quite good in Sweden. But, yes, they
improved quite a bit, which you can also see from some of the competitors' results.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. But your comment that the weather was good in 2Q could equally apply to all the
other regions as well or was it particularly good in Sweden?

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
It was probably more so in Sweden and Finland than Norway but now I think it is; we're
speculating a bit.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Great. Thanks very much.

Operator
Next question comes from Mr. Jakob Brink from ABG. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Yeah. I just have a, I guess, a follow up on sort of the normalized long-term combined
ratio, even though I know you don't like to work with that, but now I also know we
discussed that at the Capital Market Day but now I guess it's the fourth quarter in a row
where you write something like this. This is the best quarter ever or best half year ever,
best year ever on the combined ratio. Sweden seems to be progressing well, which has
been doing this sort of key problem area for – if I may. Could you maybe give us some
details on why should we expect it to go up signiﬁcantly for the next year apart from, I
mean, I agree that weather has been good, but are you seeing any sort of negative
trends? That's the ﬁrst question, please.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
No, I haven't seen any substantial negative trends so I don't know what to say. But may I
remind you then that the challenge that we see is that the Norwegian market is diﬀerent
than three years ago with much more distribution power and more insurance companies
there than before. The companies are behaving rationally, so this is not a pricing problem
but there's more distribution capacity.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

And then just a ﬁnal one. I don't know if you have anything to say on that one either. But
the Swedish virus, have you got any closer to know how big of a problem that could be?

FINAL

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
Yeah. It depends on whether it's ﬁnally put out or not. But as it looks today, it may be a
loss that could go into our reinsurance program, may or may not. But it's not going to be
as it looks today, one of our top 10 losses in the past decade.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay. But still it could reach the SEK 250 million. Is that what you said?

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
That may happen and SEK 250 million is 0.6% on the combined ratio.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Sure. Okay. Thanks a lot.

Next question comes from Mr. Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Two questions. The ﬁrst one is just looking at the
entire P&C business for the ﬁrst half of the year. I think you've said that reserve releases
were very small. You said that large claims experience was broadly in line. But I wonder if
you could comment, Torbjörn, on how favorable claims frequency has been for you in the
period. I guess it's been quite favorable.
And secondly, for Kari, I guess, you've talked about the challenges on the investment
income site. Interest rates are remaining stubbornly low probably for longer than most
people expected. You talked about the cash building up in the group. I wonder what's the
response from the company there? Is the quite happy to let cash build up? Eventually,
that's going to be a drag on your returns. And do you think you've got enough ﬂexibility
and power, I guess, to start to increase prices to reﬂect a lower investment income over
the longer term there? Thank you.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
How favorable claims experience? Well, Norway continued as it has done for the past
almost two years now. I think favorable applies mainly to Finland this quarter where we
didn't plan to have a combined ratio of 84%. And I suspect that Pohjola didn't either
having seen the results. So the claims experience in Finland was more favorable than –
somewhat more favorable than expected.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Is it possible to talk about the entire business and how much more favorable, if at all,
lower frequency has been over the half year period, Torbjörn, or is that just too diﬃcult?

FINAL

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
Then you got the weather in the ﬁrst quarter that was much better than last year, et cetera,
and that's going to be diﬃcult.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

On cash piling up, I think that you have been following us such a long time that you know
that we have been in situations like this earlier when cash is piling up and we can stand
that situation. We will not lose our nerve. However, it's evident that given the low interest
rate environment, it's quite evident that the ﬁxed income running yield will continue to
come down.
On the other hand, we have a very high risk exposure in Mandatum Life. We have now, if
you count together, equities and alternatives and all that riskier assets. They are roughly
40% of our investment portfolio. If the situation continues like this, we have a little bit of a
room to increase equity weights in If, but not signiﬁcantly from a group perspective. So, I
would assume that when Europe's military conﬂicts, geopolitical conﬂicts settle, we will
see value in riskier assets. I think that it has become clear that in these interest rate levels –
with these interest rate levels, certain assets are not correctly priced, for instance, some
ﬁnancial share equities but also others. They should be revalued given that we have no
geopolitical risks around.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

And maybe if I can ask another one, how should we think about the fair value adjustment
reserves? A throwback (18:30) number is 1.1 billion equally split between bonds and
equities. In the event that perhaps rates have trough and start moving up at some point,
would you be tempted to start to crystallize some of that into the earnings. How do you
feel about the equity portion as well?

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
I think with that we do that gradually. We always take in something from our fair value
reserves to the results. And it depends on our market for you. We are, of course, diﬀerent
from many, many other ﬁnancial institution that our duration is so short that if interest rates
go up, we would not be hit there. That would open us – for us an opportunity to grow a
longer duration gradually.
On equities, you have seen our changes in our equity rates. They are not that signiﬁcant.
But certainly in a very strong market, we would probably take home some of the goodies

that are created there.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah, yeah. Just wondering if you thought that rates are more likely to go up and down if
you might think about your salary, think some of the gains in the ﬁxed income part of the
fair value adjustment reserve, you take proﬁt essentially?

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
I really don't have anything to say to that.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Our next question comes from Mr. Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good afternoon. It's Matti Ahokas from Dankse. Two questions, if I may. Firstly, on the
discount rates. Obviously, in Sweden, it's automatic process that the discount rate is
lowered but Q2 last year took a fairly big charge on the Finnish annuity discount rate, and
now yields have fallen even further. How big do you see a risk that you might have to
actually cut the Finnish discount rate in the third quarter or fourth quarter?
Second question is regarding the Swedish plans outlook. Torbjörn, you mentioned that
the underlying development was actually pretty good. We've heard some of your
competitors, especially in the Swedish press talk about the storm claims in general and
not the forest ﬁre itself, and saying that the claims frequency has been extremely high. Is
this something that you have seen or is this more of a factor of your competitors? Thanks.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
I just can't rate for annuities and Finland is an interest rate that should be valid for more
than 10 years, so it'll be a careful process to change it and it's often also in lawsuit, the
authorities here in Finland. And then I was slightly surprised to see the comment in
Sweden in fact, but we have very diﬀerent books, of course. The comment from (21:17)
reﬂects their high exposure to forestry, agriculture business and the like.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

I may just to follow up also on the running yield. We saw a quite signiﬁcant decline on the
running yields even though the Swedish rate got and the Swedish declining into states
(21:36) came on in the third quarter. Was this a reﬂection of redemption of higher yielding
bonds or why was the jump so much higher than in previous quarters?

Our next question comes from Mr. Paris Hadjiantonis from KBW. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. I just have one general one. I
would be interested to know your approach and views regarding the Norwegian FSA's
opinion to such as the non-inclusion of the (22:26) in the available capital under the
Solvency II regime. How much for an issue (22:32) that will be for your available capital in
If P&C? So, that's my only question.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
Well, if it's not regarded as tier 1 capital, which we don't know yet then it would mean
roughly SEK 3.2 billion. So, around – worst case would be the €350 million approximately.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Do you have a view whether this should be allowed or not because some of your peers
actually have very strong use about that?

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
Well actually, so far, it's a proposal from the Norwegian FSA. But we don't know what the
ﬁnal outcome will be from the ministry (23:12) – because the decision making and the law
comes from the Ministry of Finance.
