Hello, everyone. It is a pleasure to be here with you for the presentation of our third
quarter results. Looking at the key figures for the period. Our top line is growing at a good
pace. Revenue is up 6.5%, mainly due to the rising premiums and higher financial income
on the back of the rally in financial markets as well as positive change rate differences.
Overall, premiums are up 2.5% with Non-Life growing nearly 4%, and Life premiums down
around 1%. Our combined ratio has improved 170 basis points. The net result of almost
EUR463 million has fallen 12.5%, largely driven by goodwill write-downs at MAPFRE
ASISTENCIA. Excluding these write downs, the net result is in line with last September.
Before we move on, I would like to take a few minutes to comment on what we are doing
in the Assistence business. As a result of the performance in our units in the U.K. affected
by the current socioeconomic context in this country and the business restructuring in the
U.S., we wrote-off close to EUR66 million of goodwill from companies in both countries. In
addition, we will be restructuring our operations in six countries and these expenses have
also been fully booked this quarter with a negative impact on attributable result of EUR11
million.
Shareholders equity is up 12%, mainly as a result of the falling interest rates as well as
currency appreciation. The ROE, excluding the goodwill write downs, will have been
slightly over 8%. And our capital position continues to be strong with the Solvency II ratio
at 198% at the close of June in line with our target. Just as a reminder, the goodwill writedowns booked this quarter will have no impact on our cash position nor on regulatory
solvency ratios maintaining our strong capacity to pay dividends.

On the next slide, we will take a look at the key figures by unit. On the right side, you can
see the main figures regarding attributable result. I would like to highlight the contribution
from our insurance units, that reached EUR568 million, up nearly 8%. Iberia continues to
be the largest profit contributor with a net result of close to EUR350 million, very much in
line with last year's results.
There were strong improvements in Brazil, up EUR31 million with the implementation of
our new business model and the absence of extraordinary impacts. In North America,
profit is up nearly EUR44 million on the back of improved underlying performance after
the exit from five states. LATAM North and South continue contributing to results, which is
reflected in their combined ratios and all countries contributing positively to the group's
results.

Bloomberg Transcript

Lastly, EURASIA continues facing profitability challenges in Turkey, where we are managing
the business with a defensive approach. MAPFRE RE continues to be an important profit
contributor with a net result of EUR102 million. Results have been affected by Typhoon
Faxai and the drought in Brazil as well as two industrial planes, which had a large impact on
the global reach segment, while the insurance business has been proven resilient. In the
Assistance business excluding extraordinary items, there was a net loss of EUR9 million.
Regarding premiums, growth is very strong in Brazil and LATAM North; the latter fueled by
a large multi-year policy in Mexico, which we already mentioned in last quarter's
presentation. In Iberia, premiums are slightly up with strong performance in Non-Life
offsetting the fall in the Life business. In addition, appreciation of the U.S. dollar and other
Latin American currencies have also supported premium growth while the Brazilian real is
still a drag on premiums but to a much lesser extent than previously.
On slide 4, we will look at the adjusted attributable result. Let's look at the extraordinary
events. Regarding weather-related and NatCat claims this quarter, Iberia was affected by
the heavy rain and storms in Spain with a net impact of around EUR10 million, while the
insurance business was affected by Typhoon Faxai with an attributable impact of EUR30
million. There have been few -- a few other large events both in MAPFRE RE as well as the
impact of the drought in Brazil, but we consider these events business as usual.
The reorganization of our U.S. Operations has had a positive net impact of EUR5 million
this year compared to a EUR7 million loss in 2018. And there were two important real
estate transactions last year for approximately EUR30 million, but we have not completed
any transaction this year, but some units are currently in the final stage of sales. As for the
actively managed portfolios in Europe, gains have been quite stable. The adjusted
attributable result, excluding all these impacts is up by around EUR4 million.
Regarding the Life business, we've seen a strong performance in Iberia. The result is up
over EUR21 million, stemming from Life Savings due to higher realized gains driven by
asset sales from surrenders. Life Protection premiums are up 8% with improving
combined ratios.

As we already commented in June, we have been gradually provisioning for the new
actuarial table for longevity based on an estimated impact of around EUR50 million.
Excluding prudence margin at the end of September, the outstanding provision is
negligible. Nevertheless, the Spanish supervisory body is currently carrying out an impact
study based on more prudent actuarial tables. The result of this study and the decision
regarding the final tables to be enforced and the transitional period, if any, will be
announced by year-end. The fall in Brazil is explained by the nonrecurring reversal of a
provision in 2018. There has also been an increase in acquisition expenses this year in the
bancassurance channel in order to boost sales.
And in LatAm South, the fall is mainly driven by the gains realized in September 2018 from
the sale of our property in Chile with a EUR 10 million pretax gain. There were negative
adjustment in Colombia affecting annuity runoff portfolios, which were offset by the
strong performance in Peru and Uruguay. Please turn to the next slide.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the left, you can see the breakdown of the capital structure, which amounted to
EUR13.3 billion. Our credit metrics remain quite strong with leverage around 22%, which
we feel comfortable with. Interest coverage is around 18x earnings before interest and
tax, quite stable as well. And on the next slide, we'll take a look at our equity position.
Shareholders' equity is up over 12%, reaching nearly EUR9 billion. The most relevant
changes are, first an almost EUR891 million increase of unrealized gains on available-forsale portfolio net of shadow accounting driven by the sharp fall in rates in Europe. Second,
the appreciation of the U.S. dollar and to a lesser extent, the Mexican peso, which have
helped offset the fall in the Brazilian real. And finally, the decrease of EUR447 million
corresponds to the 2018 final dividend already paid in June as well as the 2019 interim
dividend to be paid in December.
On the bottom right, you can see the details of the available-for-sale portfolio in Iberia,
which represents 3/4 of MAPFRE's total available-for-sale portfolio. There are currently
EUR4 billion of unrealized gains in these portfolios, practically the entire amount at group
level. The largest share of unrealized gains are in immunized portfolios, which with a EUR2
billion, followed by the actively managed and conditioned portfolios, which are mainly
products with profit-sharing elements. Net of shadow accounting adjustments and after
taking into account policy holder's participation, there are EUR1 billion of net unrealized
gains and the majority are in actively managed and free portfolios. This is new information
and we -- hopefully, we --that you consider quite interesting.
Please turn to the next slide to take a look at the investment portfolio. On the right side,
you can see that assets under management are up over 10%, driven by improvements in
stock and debt markets after important correction at the end of 2018 as well as currency
effects. The breakdown of the investment portfolio is on the left. Asset allocation has
been relatively stable throughout the year and exposure to government and corporate
debt remains mostly unchanged.
Our cash position is up to EUR2.7 billion and includes short-term investments and
temporary cash balances. The largest exposures correspond to the Spanish sovereign

debt, which, with nearly EUR19 billion and Italian debt with EUR2.9 billion. And we have
mentioned in the past the majority of these investments are in immunized portfolios.
On the next slide, we will look at our actively managed investments portfolios. Gifts are
still relatively high given the current market context, 1.9% in Non-Life and 3.6% in Life.
Nevertheless, the downward trend continues hurting our financial income. We are
mitigating this trend by allocating part of reinvestment to alternative assets as well as
keeping duration around 8 years. Realized gains in the euro area reached nearly EUR84
million during the first nine months of the year, around EUR7 million less than previous
year. The fall in Iberia is explained by the real estate gains in Portugal last year, which were
around EUR11 million pretax.
We have been cautious with asset sales as we prefer, as we mentioned last presentation,
to protect the recurring yield of our fixed income portfolio. Regarding our portfolios in
other geographies, which is as well new information on the right, you can see
diversification is playing an important role in protecting recurring financial income, with
accounting yields well above those in Europe. On the following slides, we will look at
divisional performance in more detail.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's start with Iberia, on Page 10. In Spain, Non-Life premium growth has been excellent
and we are outperforming the market in our main lines of business. On the other hand,
the low interest rate environment has been a drag on growth of the Life business. In
Motor premiums are up 1.7% with a 1.4% growth in retail lines and 4% in fleets. They're
small and medium-sized fleets. General P&C growth was mostly driven by homeowners
and condominiums, which were up by around 5% and 9%, respectively.
Regarding profitability in Motor, the combined ratio is 93% - an excellent ratio in a very
competitive market. We've seen rising claims cost affecting property damage and slightly
rising frequency trends in full coverage products but both in line with our expectations. In
General P&C, we have seen two percentage points improvement, thanks to homeowners
and commercial lines. There was a negative impact on the quarter as a result of the
severe rains and storms in the Mediterranean area. was the worst for the last 8 years, the
last heavy rains in Spain was in 2012. But these losses was partially offset by the excellent
performance in other regions.
Regarding other business activities. Our asset management business, MAPFRE INVERSIN,
continues as a strong contributor with a net result of over EUR30 million, helping offset
expenses from the launch of our digital health initiative. The strong reduction in the
combined ratio in Portugal is also worth highlighting, mainly in workers' compensations.
Let's take a look now at Brazil.
Premiums grew 5% in local currency, especially in the Life Protection, agricultural and multirisk segments. There was a fall in Motor premiums as a result of greater underwriting
discipline and cancellation of loss making policies. The attributable results amounting to
EUR70 million, up over EUR30 million. And then Non-Life result is up EUR52 million due to
the absence of extraordinary negative adjustments, but also the underlying result is
improving.

FINAL

The largest profit contributor was General P&C. Losses in Motor are down with 14
percentage point reduction in combined ratio, thanks to stricter claims management,
greater underwriting discipline and new pricing tools. We are now on track to meet our
105% Motor combined ratio target for year-end. Financial income is up mainly in the Life
business, due to opportunistic realized gains mainly during the first quarter as well as
resilient portfolio yields. We already discussed the main drivers of the result of the Life
business earlier in the presentation, so please turn to next page.
LATAM North, I would first like to comment on the solid local currency growth trends and
the extraordinary combined ratio, which stands at 95.8% in a better currency environment.
Excluding the multi-year PEMEX policy, Mexico has had strong local currency growth of
12%, driven by Motor and Life segments. The Motor combined ratio improved over 7
percentage points to below 94%, thanks to tariff and risk solution measures. Central
America continues to contribute significantly to results in the region.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Panama, we are applying stricter underwriting guidelines and tariff increases to correct
recent negative trends. The loss ratio in health is improving, which mitigates the uptick in
Motor and General P&C. Technical measures are underway in Motor as well. And
Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador all -- are all seeing solid growth and profitability
trends. In the Dominican Republic, premiums are up over 15% in local currency and the
combined ratio continues improving.
Please turn to next slide. Regarding LATAM South, we have seen excellent local currency
trends, but with some volatility. Average exchange rates for the Argentine, Chilean and
Colombian pesos are down year-on-year while the Peruvian sol is up over 4%. Local
currency growth is good in most of our main markets and we continue developing
bancassurance operations across the region as well as our agreements with car makers.
Peru shows excellent premium growth and ratios, maintaining the same positive trends as
the last 5, 6 years.
In Colombia, the result has been impacted by negative adjustments in the annuity runoff
portfolios as a result of updating long-term financial assumptions. The investment
portfolio was restructured in July, improving ALM significantly, and we don't expect further
negative adjustment in the fourth quarter. Chile saw local currency growth of 8%, and the
falling results is explained by the 2018 real estate gains. Excluding this impact, underlying
results have been rather stable despite a higher combined ratio in Motor. Argentina saw a
decline in premiums driven by currency depreciation, and the following results is due to
hyperinflation adjustments in 2019, which were applied only in December last year.
Let's move to North America. The appreciation of the dollar has positively impacted both
premiums and results. Premiums are down around 9% in local currency as a result of the
exit from 5 states in 2018 as well as the cancellation of nonperforming business. The
attributable results is up over EUR39 million in the U.S. and last year was affected by
extraordinary winter weather as well as the cost of the exit of 5 states. Excluding
extraordinary items, underlying results have improved significantly over EUR15 million.
Further, 2019 results are also benefiting from a EUR5 million net positive adjustment
already discussed last quarter.

We continue reducing exposure to unprofitable business segments. And as we
announced last quarter, we have stopped commercial line renewals in all states, but
Massachusetts. This business represented around USD44 million in premiums in 2018 and
had a combined ratio of 128%. Going forward, this move will help profitability. Outside the
Northeast, we've seen a reduction in losses and combined ratios across the regions.
Finally, positive profitability trends continue in Puerto Rico, and this unit is contributing
EUR15 million to the group's results, up over EUR 4 million compared to last year and a
combined -- an excellent combined ratio below 92%.
Please turn to next slide. Italy experienced a strong premium performance driven by the
dealership channel and a strong improvement in the combined ratio, down over 5
percentage points. It is also important to mention that Italy is already delivering profit at
EUR0 2.3 million on a standalone basis, which by which I mean excluding consolidation
adjustments. As we announced last quarter, we are working on the process of
transforming our Italian entity into a VERTI Spain branch under EU regulations. The plan is
moving forward behind schedule unfortunately and year-end is going to be a very
challenging deadline.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Turkey, we are still seeing a drag from exchange rates and we continue with a
defensive business model in this market with premiums up around 9% in local currency
below current inflation and we continue reducing our MTPL exposures in a defensive
strategy, as I mentioned. The attributable result has moved back into positive territory in
September, EUR0.6 million compared to over EUR20 million last year. There are several
drivers behind the fall in results.
First, inflation and currency depreciation is having a negative impact on spare parts and
other claims costs, partially offset by investments in euros. And second, MAPFRE's
participation in the compulsory high risk MTPL pool has had a negative impact of EUR5.1
million, mainly booked in the second quarter. In Germany, premium trends continue to be
positive with an improving attributable result and resilient combined ratio. Please turn to
the next slide to discuss MAPFRE RE.
Premiums are up over 7%, fueled by the reinsurance unit and the Non-Life business.
Growth is also benefiting from currency movements, especially the U.S. dollar. On the
other hand, we continue working on the nonrenewal of unprofitable business in the
GLOBAL RISKS segment, which explained the fall in premiums. We also recently
announced the discontinuation of facultative underwriting business in our London office. In
2018, this business represented EUR115 million and EUR39 million gross and net
premiums, respectively.
As for the Life business, the fall is due to timing difference of the policy issuance. The
combined ratio has proven resilient, especially in the reinsurance segment at 95%, in line
with historical average. Year-on-year, we have seen an increase in large losses, which
affected especially the global risk segment. Particularly, there were two large industrial
claims, one in Asia in the first quarter and another this quarter. The total net impact was
EUR29 million of which, EUR21 million in the GLOBAL RISKS segment.

FINAL

Typhoon Faxai had an over EUR32 million net impact based on preliminary estimates.
Regarding Hagibis, it is still too soon to have an estimate, but we don't expect the
combined impact of both cat losses to be higher than Jebi and Trami last year. Finally, the
impact of the Brazilian drought had a EUR10 million net impact.
Please turn to next slide where we cover MAPFRE ASISTENCIA . On this slide, you can see
results from MAPFRE ASISTENCIA as well as the breakdown of extraordinary items and
underlying results by business region product line. This is new information as well. We
have been monitoring the ASISTENCIA business very closely and have exited 7 countries
since 2015 with relevant restructuring expenses in 2016 and 2017. As a result of that, the
majority of countries in LATAM and EURASIA are currently contributing with profits. On the
other hand, the U.K., France and roadside assistance in the U.S. are still running losses as
the first round of restructuring was carried out in a different context and also with a
different expected outcome.

Bloomberg Transcript

Margins have been going down in these businesses and products have been gaining in
complexity, which has made us more selective. Furthermore, the complex socioeconomic
context in the U.K. with uncertainties surrounding Brexit on our business scenario in the
U.S. with the' lack of scale in roadside assistance and the streamlining of operation in this
country were about lower expectations of future profits in both countries. Following
MAPFRE's prudent approach, we wrote-down goodwill amounting to EUR66 million. A full
disclosure by company is on that slide. In addition, we will continue streamlining the
organizational structure in six additional countries. We have already fully booked a
provision for restructuring with a negative impact on our attributable result of EUR11
million. Going forward, the assistance business will be sure simpler.
Please turn to next slide. The Solvency II ratio increased to 198% at June 30 in line with our
200% target an evidence of our strong solvency position. 87% of eligible own funds are
high quality and restricted Tier 1 capital and the remainder is Tier 2. On the right, you have
a breakdown of the variation of the different components of Eligible Own Funds. And
more detailed information regarding Solvency II figures can be found in our financial
report.
Please turn to the next slide for closing remarks. In conclusion, we have had a good start
to a new strategic plan, which is being temporarily eclipsed by; first, the assistance unit
restructuring; second, the unexpected increase in GLOBAL RISKS losses; and third, the
unusual frequency of typhoons in Japan. Nevertheless, business fundamentals are
stronger with a clear turnaround in the U.S. and Brazil, where improvements should gain
momentum in the coming quarters.
In Iberia, both premium and profitability performance have been excellent and in line with
our expectations even in a very competitive market. MAPFRE RE has had resilient results
and continues to be an important contributor to our earnings. Right now, the focus is on
reducing exposures in the GLOBAL RISKS business in order to lower P&L volatility. Growth
trends are very good in Latin America with all 17 countries contributing profits -- all 17
means also Venezuela and Argentina -- and outstanding performance in Mexico and Peru.
MAPFRE continues to boast a solid capital position and a high degree of financial flexibility,

which should guarantee dividend stability and allow us to continue to meet our
commitments with our shareholders.
And now, we will hand the call back to Natalia to begin the Q&A session.

FINAL

(Question And Answer)

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much Fernando. Now, we can start with one of the main -- our main
regions, Brazil. Sofa Barallat at CaixaBank BPI, Ivan Bokhmat of Barclays, and Rahul Parekh
at JPMorgan have the following question.
Could you elaborate on the drivers of the combined ratio in Brazil in the quarter? The
combined ratio in Motor insurance, stands at 107% in the nine months '19. Do you reiterate
the 105% guidance for the full year 2019?

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, everyone. As you may remember, measures were implemented, starting just
when we finished updating our agreement with Banco do Brazil last year. And we started
first with stricter measures for claims management. It's the first thing we had to do to
trying to reduce average costs. And this year, we're focusing on underwriting, also new
coverage, new policies, and also new tariff tools.
Obviously, I mean these changes requires a longer period in order to deliver
performance, but we're quite satisfied with the measures already implemented. Has
been a slight uptick during the quarter, but it is down over 14 percentage points year-onyear And it's down to the technical measures, portfolio cleanup as well and the cost
containment.
We're happy with our new business model and management team, that as I told you, we
changed practically every position at the organizational chart, and Brazil is clearly on the
right path to reach the Motor cut target of 105% combined ratio for year end.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Also Rahul Parekh at JP Morgan has the following question. The
combined ratio overall for
Non-Life was 91.1% for the nine months, which is substantially better than the full year '21
expected target of below 96% Could you please comment on this?

Fernando Mata Verdejo

Page 8 of 19



Company N ame: M apfre SA

FINAL

Yes. This 91.1% is supported by the reduction in Motor, obviously, reduced by 14% as we
already mentioned. But also by the General P&C, which has improved by 7 points to
75.5%. I mean, this is an extraordinary combined ratio - 75%.
And frankly, we would like to have it sustainable in the future, but we consider it extremely
difficult to keep this low level. I mean, whenever we set our overall targets, we do it with a
long-term view, the main non-Motor lines basically include agricultural and industrial rigs,
which can be more volatile, due to climate change and obviously depending on the
occurrence of weather-related or large claims.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Next set of questions are regarding MAPFRE RE. Rahul Parekh at
JPMorgan would like to know, if we have any indication about the impact of Typhoon
Hagibis?

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Thank you again. Hagibis, as we disclosed at our financial report, in the caption of
subsequent events, there is no estimate right now. I mean, it's too soon to say and we are
expecting -- we're waiting still for communication from certain entities and we will have
not any indication it very soon. But so far, we have no indication of cost there regarding
Hagibis.
We know there are damages caused by winds, although less than previous events, but
also by unprecedented heavy rains and floods. This current event in that sense has very
special characteristics, so more rain than winds. But as I mentioned, we expect the
combined impact of Faxai and Hagibis to be lower than the combined ratio -- sorry, the
combined effect of Jebi and Trami happened last year.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Also, Ivan Bokhmat, at JP -- sorry at Barclays, asked, what industry loss
does the EUR30 million loss from Typhoon Faxai correspond to? It's early days, but do you
believe the impact from the two Japanese typhoons might exceed the EUR87 million
you've booked for Japanese losses in 2018?

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Ivan. The estimation made, and it is very well disclosed in our financial report,
for Faxai was a top-down approach, and based on our estimation and also, the portfolio
data, and information. But let me tell you that we estimated this amount just for the
closing of the financial statement at the third quarter. But the communication we're
receiving currently in October from the ceding entities, they are quite similar to this
estimation. So, whether we were lack or we were very well experienced in the treatment
of these cat losses, but the estimation, the top-down estimation is quite similar to the
current communication from the deciding entities. And as I said, we expect the combined
ratio of both typhoons to be in a similar or lower than they reported in 2018.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you. Also, Alfredo Alonso at BBVA would like to know, what measures are you
taking to reduce net negative impact from GLOBAL RISKS?

FINAL

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks Alfredo. I mean, this is GLOBAL RISKS a bad experience, I mean, it's a
worldwide trend, it's a global trend, it's not affecting, I mean MAPFRE, but the entire
business segment. For the last two years, we are cancelling non-performing business and
focus on those that are more profitable. But the best example is that, as we unveil at this
presentation, the discontinuation of the facultative business written through the -- our
London office. Because we believe that this segment, which is a loss-making portfolio,
doesn't feed our current risk appetite, nor our business strategy.
On the other hand, the proportional 3D reinsurance business in London remains
unchanged and we will continue providing comprehensive solutions, insurance solutions,
for our clients in aviation, oil-gas and other risk segments in London as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

In general, we are confident that the measure we've taken and we're in the right path,
and this is -- what we're doing is what we had to do. And also with the integration of the
reinsurance and GLOBAL RISKS business will be positive and performance will be better in
coming quarters.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Now, there's a question regarding investment portfolio and assets under
management. It comes from Rahul Parekh, JPMorgan and is the follow-on question.
Realized gains came in EUR62 million for the first nine months of 2019 and you mentioned
that MAPFRE would aim for roughly EUR100 million for the full year. Does the target still
hold?

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes. The EUR100 million target, I mean, is basically the average for the last periods as well
and it's a target in a quite standard economic scenario. I mean, it's been challenging, but
we have a prudent approach, as we mentioned, to gains and prefer not to touch our fixed
income portfolio in Europe to protect our ordinary yields. As I mentioned in the
presentation, our unrealized gains are exceeding EUR1 billion, but if we use capital gains I
mean, we will have a worse performance financial income performance in the coming
year.
So in any case, our investment team continues working hard to meet the EUR100 million
target in capital gains that has been budgeted for this year. It is important to keep in mind,
that we have not completed any real estate transactions in 2019, but there are several
units in the market to a medium-sized and other smaller, which they are currently in the
final stage of sales. And hopefully, we will really surprise if this transaction were -- some of
these transactions - were not completed in the last quarter.

FINAL

Okay. Thank you very much. Now, regarding North America, Ivan Bokhmat Barclays has a
follow-on question.
U.S. Motor profitability appears to have deteriorated for many of your larger U.S. peers,
including both commercial and personal auto. Can you talk about the market trends and
whether this can become a headwind to the improvements you are seeing in the
business? What are the trends like in Massachusetts?

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Ivan. A couple of things. First, I mean, this trend of deteriorating the
combined ratio in auto lines in -- on the U.S is not new. And we had been discussing for
many, many presentations that there --and there is a combination of risks affecting auto
business in the U.S., and they are still valid.

Bloomberg Transcript

But in any case, our performance in Motor and the evolution has been excellent. And the
underwriting measures have been implemented, including tariff increases. And I don't
remember, but we discussed in previous presentations, nearly 20 increases in tariff across
the U.S., and also a cancellation of non-profitable business and agents. And also the exit
of five states.
Regarding market as a whole, as I mentioned, the same main trends with higher
frequency and severity as a result as I mentioned, disrupting -- driving, the cost of
technological and sophisticated spare parts, and also higher mileage and gas
consumption, which point to higher frequency. So, in conclusion, tariff increases will
continue to be necessary to keep up with the cost of risk, or decrease of cost of risk.
Overall, we're happy with the execution of our strategy so far. The decision to leave
commercial lines outside of Massachusetts where profitability has been challenging, will
also be a positive driver going forward, in that case for commercial auto.

Thank you very much. And the next question -- next set of questions are regarding
ASISTENCIA business. Rahul Parekh at JPMorgan and Ivan Bokhmat at Barclays, Alfredo
Alonso at BBVA have the following questions. Goodwill write-down: could you please let
us know the goodwill left on the ASISTENCIA books, mainly the goodwill amount is left in
the U.K. ASISTENCIA unit? What are your comments on the likelihood of any further writedowns, provisions at ASISTENCIA?

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. First of all, the units that had goodwill write-downs this quarter have no remaining
goodwill as they were write-offs. It means, that we wrote off the entire goodwill booked in
our accounts. But there are two other units in ASISTENCIA with remaining goodwill.

FINAL

Roughly talking, we wrote-down approximately two-thirds of the goodwill at the opening
balance at the beginning of the year.
The two other units in ASISTENCIA that will remain in goodwill is warranty and Century,
one in Italy and Century in the U.S. with around EUR32 million. And also, we have projected
business plans for the future and so far we do not expect any additional write-downs in
the following quarters. So, we're quite satisfied and confident with these two goodwills
that remain in our balance sheet.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Also, Rahul Parekh regarding this unit wants to know, in your
presentation, you mentioned, on Slide 17, updating of business forecast for the assistance
and special risks business. Could you please elaborate on your outlook for the business
going forward? If you could provide any numbers guidance? Also, have you considered
disposal of the U.K. ASISTENCIA unit?

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Thank you, Rahul. Over the last five years, we've been monitoring the assistance
business very closely, even exiting, so far, seven countries with relevant restructuring
expenses in 2016 and 2017. I mean, the accumulated losses for the last five years, they're
huge, and we had to recognize that our strategy wasn't the proper one, I mean, in this
business. We grew quite quickly, quite rapidly and then we had to streamline our
operations in order to keep the pace of profitable growth.
As I explained in the presentation, most countries in Latin America and across EURASIA,
are currently delivering profits. That means that the first way of restructuring was, for
these countries, successfully. But -- and there is also -- there is always a but The U.K.,
France and roadside assistance in the U.S., they are still currently running losses. There
had been profitability challenges and this. MAPFRE assistance has had difficulties due to
lack of scale and strong restructuring measures have already been taken. But after the
current macroeconomic and geopolitical situation in Europe, and especially in the U.K., we
have realized that further measures will be necessary, in line with the strategic plan of
profitable growth, where profitability particularly in the U.K. is not predictable so far.
So, further restructuring could be either natural and gradual reduction of our exposure,
closing offices, or sale of business. I mean, when I said restructuring, it means perhaps
reduction of exposure, because we're selling, as we did in the U.S., renewal -- selling right
renewals or just selling portfolios. But also could mean the shutdown of countries or even
the sale of business. So, let's say the restructuring is a quite comprehensive concept and
any decision could be taken in the future. So all options are on the table, and also this
measure will affect operation in six countries.
This is still under analysis. There is only two countries that the processes has already
started, mainly in France. But for now, I mean, we can't provide any further details on other

Page 12 of 19

countries since the restructuring has been -- not been unveiled and could deteriorate our
position.

FINAL

Regarding InsureandGO in the U.K., I mean, this is a strategic segment of business from
MAPFRE., It has a strong market position in the U.K.. And what we have to analyze is really
in deep, I mean, the both business -- I mean the B2C and the B2B2C a segment of
business in order to get profitability in both.
Let me tell you that also InsureandGo is quite profitable in other countries such as Ireland
or Australia. So, my conclusion is that the business model is good, the operational
structure is good as well, the way we reach our clients works well. But we have a problem
in the U.K. and we have to solve it.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Also, Ivan Bokhmat wanted to know, if we can remind him of
the breakdown in goodwill by business units.
I can tell you Ivan that regarding the breakdown in goodwill units, you can find it in our
annual accounts in Page 148. If you need further assistance or you have further comments,
we can talk later on, but we have understood that you wanted to know this disclosure. So,
it's on annual our annual accounts 2018.

Bloomberg Transcript

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. But the largest is the U.S. and also Life operations in Spain. But we're quite
comfortable with the goodwill that we currently keep in our books.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Right. Thank you. Also, Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America Merrill Lynch asks, Even after
stripping out the ASISTENCIA write-downs, results from other activities is a much bigger
loss than would typically be expected in Q3. Why has this line jumped so much?

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. I expected this question. This is a very smart question. And
basically what we're unveiling is the net effect of the restructuring impact in our profit and
loss account, which is EUR11 million. If we split into gross and net, the gross figure is much
bigger, it amounts approximately to EUR13 million. But since we have some tax relief
because we didn't book deferred tax assets from previous losses in this country. So if we
sell this operation,we shut down operations, it will be a tax, a big tax relief that they will
somehow lower the gross figure, which is, I mean, higher than EUR11 million, obviously.

Okay. Thank you. So, now we are going to talk about Iberia. Sofa Barallat at CaixaBank BPI
has a follow-on question. Could you elaborate on the evolution of Motor insurance
premiums in the 3Q? What are your expectations on Motor insurance premium growth in
Iberia going forward? The Motor insurance combined ratio reached the top of the
92%-94% combined ratio guidance. Do you maintain this guidance or foresee further
deterioration going forward? In this sense, Alfredo Alonso at BBVA has also asked about
the Motor combined ratio going forward, and if we have seen much pressure in Motor
business in Iberia?

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, everyone. Regarding Motor premiums, we're seeing good trends both
in retail with a 1.4% increase, and in small and medium fleets which grows 4%. Insured
units are also growing 3%, it means I mean that if you do the numbers, that the average
premium is decreasing. This is a change of trend from previous year in which we keep our
average premium well above the market. It was basically due to our different strategy, I
mean, to focus on more experienced drivers and leaving down drivers, and which,
obviously, the average premium is smaller.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's say that the overall going forward, Motor premiums should continue to be
supported by economic growth in the Spanish economy, but assuming that there is a
slowdown of economy, and also the profitable growth strategy has been a decrease in
the growing trend of insured units, which is currently up. September is like a 1.8% increase,
I mean, much smaller than previous quarter.
Smaller combined ratio of MAPFRE is slightly above 93% in an excellent figure, which is the
midpoint of our guidance. And as we run a combined ratio of below 90%, we mentioned
that it wasn't sustainable. And our guidance for combined ratio we feel very comfortable
in a range between 92% and 94%. What else? Let's say that the MAPFRE again, and we
outperformed in the market and we maintain 1 -- more or less 1.5% gap with the industry
figure. Recent trends, both claims inflation, particularly in garage, because the increase of
salary in Spain, and higher frequency as well, because more gas consumption, more
temporary than structural, and is now something that we shouldn't worry about.
UpStick has been offset in Auto by improvements in other general P&C lines of business
that we already mentioned in previous presentation, particularly condominiums and
homeowners. We run in the past combined ratios well above 95% and there were
relevant reductions in -- for both line of business. So, overall, let's say that both things
were somehow predicted - a slight deterioration of automobile combined ratio, and a
relevant improvement in combined ratio for both condominiums and homeowners.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Now, from Caixabank BPI, Sofa Barallat asked about the revision of
the DGS of the biometric tables. Could you also update us on the revision of the mortality
tables, expected to impact on the amount booked so far. Also, Carlos Peixoto from
Caixabank BPI, would like to have more color on the sensitivity on the impacts from the

Page 14 of 19

Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2019-10-31

change in mortality table. For instance, what would be the impact from a one year
increase in the mortality tables across segments/genders?

FINAL

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, both. First of all, a couple of things before going through your two
questions. What we -- what MAPFRE is doing is what we did with the Baremo topic. And
what we're trying is to anticipate the effect of this updated, or this expense, that was
already scheduled, I mean for this year. So, practically, I mean, the amount to be
expensed this year is fully booked -- was fully booked, practically, at June, and also at the
third quarter. I mean, the outstanding balance to be booked practically is negligible.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second thing, for MAPFRE, this exercise is just the best example of the MAPFRE
commitment to transparency in this market. Probably, maybe wrong, but as far as I know
MAPFRE is the only entity unveiling this effect to the market. And it is our commitment to
our stakeholders - particularly two groups, policyholders and investors. Correct me if I'm
wrong, but the other leading entities in saving -- in Life Savings in Spain, they haven't
published, so far, any impact, and only MAPFRE, again, is leading this transparency in
Spain.
Having said that, let's say that MAPFRE is actively participating at a technical level and with
UNESPA, is the association of Insurance in Spain, in the discussion between the sector and
the DGS, the supervisory body. The Spanish supervisory body is currently carrying out a
quantitative impact study based on more prudent actuarial tables. I mean, the
fundamentals for the tables are the same, but the amount we book was on pure vanilla
tables, while the impact study is being carried out on more prudent actuarial tables. It
means that is a margin prudent, buffer, cushion, whatever you name is there.
The result of these studies is still unknown, and the decision regarding the final tables to
be enforced and the transitional period, if any, we don't know yet. And hopefully, we
expect the DGS to be announced by the year end. Our view is that the regulatory -- if the
DGS decides to say in the end that there is an additional margin to be booked, to be
applied, then the most likely scenario will be that the transitional period -- the thing is
nobody know the number of years -- will be introduced in order to mitigate the impact for
the sector. But meanwhile, I mean MAPFRE is, I mean, fulfilling our commitment with our
policyholders, and we fully booked the best estimation in our third quarter accounts. We
are comfortable with our current assessment and the majority of the industry is in the
same position with MAPFRE. And In any case, we will keep you updated with any further
developments.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Now, there is another question regarding Motor in Iberia from Ivan
Bokhmat at Barclays. It is about the Iberia Motor combined ratio, which continue to move
up EBIT from 93% to 94% in 3Q. Is this level it should stabilize on? Policy growth -- yes,
policy growth of 3% year-on-year appears ahead of premium growth of 1.7% year-onyear?

FINAL

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes. I've mentioned, we consider the range 92% to 94% a quite reasonable and
sustainable range for the future. In addition, this year, we sold more policies to most
experienced drivers and less to young people. So in the end and also, as well, we're
growing in fleets, which only has -- fleets only have a TPL cover, so a lower average
premium. So in the end, the final mixed results in a lower premium due to both factors, I
mean, average premium is for fleets and also average premiums lower for most
experienced drivers.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Also, Ivan regarding Iberia asks, you have had a strong improving result
in Iberia health and accident, but we have also heard that MAPFRE has launched a new
large scale promotional campaign in health insurance in 3Q '19. Do you think the 95%
combined ratio will be sustainable in this segment?

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Thank you, Ivan. You're right. I mean, we were launching a new health campaign
focused on digital breakthroughs and also more features in order to keep even more
satisfied clients. And -- but let's say that this campaign is the traditional one, quite
seasonal, and focused on renewals and new business for next year. If you should remain
that in Spain, I mean, have policies, like in Germany, I mean, it is from the entire calendar
year. So, it means that total renewals are from January 1st. And regarding the -- your
combined ratio, we do not expect any significant impact in the mid-front.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Alfredo Alonso from BBVA has sent the following question.
How much do you expect lower interest rates to affect life business?

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Alfredo, I don't have a crystal ball. Sorry. And I guess nobody, even the most experienced
seniors in these financial markets are able to predict future performance of yields -- not in
Europe nor in the -- neither the rest of the world. But what we know is that this low
interest environment is taking longer than the other guys could expect. And as we
mentioned and I remember, Jos Luis, our CIO, saying in some of these presentations and
talking about the Japanization of Europe I'm also that the low dealer scenario is here to
stay for longer. So, let's say that we prepare, and our combined -- sorry, our portfolio is,
we consider it to be very privileged, and we increase duration a little bit in order to keep
deals.
And also it is important, we mention as well in the past, another EUR500 million were
allocated to alternative investment to keep deals. And we're encouraging the sale of life
protection products, which is showing strong profitability, volume growth, growing and
also combined ratio is improving. We focus on our asset management business as well as
Page 16 of 19

a new way to boost the profits. And we're quite happy, as I we mentioned, with the recent
agreement with Abante that we will give -- put MAPFRE in a different position.

FINAL

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Now, let's talk about dividends. There are several questions
about dividends. First of all, Ivan Bokhmat at Barclays asked, how should we think about
this year? Last year the $14.5 dividend was both the 50%-65% target range and with the
nine months results profit run rate a flat dividend will also exceed that range. Would you
consider reducing your dividend for 2019?

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, everyone. We --MAPFRE has shown in the past that we're flexible when
we have to do -- when we have to have in the past, overall regarding impacts in our P&L,
that they are noncash items, particularly deterioration of goodwill. So, let's say that we will
keep, in the future, this flexibility.
And regarding our main policy, our main target of stable and growing dividends remain
unaltered. And as I said, the charges at ASISTENCIA this year have been largely non-cash
items. Regarding our financial position and liquidity of capital numbers, they remain quite
strong, so therefore the dividend-paying capacity is fully maintained.

Bloomberg Transcript

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. So, I guess this answers also the question from Farquhar Murray at Autonomous
that wanted to know if whether or not the goodwill write off will have an impact on the
dividends for full year '19, you've already answered.

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. But I don't like to repeat it. And -- I mean, the deterioration of the impairment of
goodwill wouldn't affect the 50% to 65% payout ratio.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. And also Andrew Sinclair, at Bank of America Merrill Lynch
asked, you mentioned guaranteed stable dividends. Are you ruling out a dividend
increase at full year 2019 results?

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

It's too early to comment on. And so far, the Board has approved the interim dividend. We
have to wait the first quarter to deliver results, and as usual, the final dividend will be
approved at the AGM next year.

Thank you very much. Farquhar has one question regarding taxes. Were there any one-off
elements to the tax line this quarter, since the tax rates seem to be higher than the norm?
But equally could be just distorted by the goodwill write-down?

FINAL

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

If I remember well, the only let's say extraordinary impacts on tax is, the one I mentioned,
regarding the ASISTENCIA restructuring. And the -- and also has been a reduction in Brazil
for agricultural business; is a reduction in the rate from 20% to 15%. But frankly, I don't
remember any additional tax impact rather than those commented.

Natalia Nunez

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. Now, the next set of questions. No, we don't have
more. Okay. We don't have more questions.
