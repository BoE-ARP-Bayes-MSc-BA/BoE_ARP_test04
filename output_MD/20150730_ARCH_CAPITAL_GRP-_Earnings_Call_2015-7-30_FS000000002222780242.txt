Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Krystal. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our
second quarter earnings were driven by solid reporter underwriting results, while
investment returns were impact by the recent rise in interest rates. On a group-wide
basis, our gross written premium declined by 8% in the quarter while our net written
premium decreased by 10.5% as underwriting actions and rate decreases in our insurance
and reinsurance businesses offset growth in our mortgage business.
Changes in foreign exchange rates also reduced our net written premium on a U.S. dollar
basis by $22 million or approximately 2.4% of our volume in the quarter. On an operating
basis, we earned $146 – $146 million, or $1.16 per share for the second quarter which
produced an annualized return on equity of 9.9% for the 2015 second quarter versus 11.2%
returned in the second quarter of 2014. On a net income basis, Arch earned $0.88 per
share this quarter which was lower than operating income, primarily due to foreign
exchange and realized investment losses. On a trailing 12-month basis, net income
produced a 10% return on equity. Net income movements on a quarterly basis can be
more volatile as these earnings are influenced by change in foreign exchange rates and
gains and losses in our investment portfolio.
Our reported underwriting results remain solid as reflected in our combined ratio of 87.9%
and were aided by a low level of catastrophe losses and continue favorable loss reserve
development. Net investment income per share for the quarter was $0.53 per share,
down $0.02 sequentially from the first quarter 2015 due to the short-term effects of share
repurchases on investable assets during the quarter. Our operating cash flow was $232
million in the second quarter as compared to $254 million in the same period last year
primarily reflecting reduced net premiums writings over the past six months. Our book
value per common share at June 30, 2015 was $47.49 per share, a slight decrease from
March 31, 2015 and an increase of 8.6% from the $43.73 per share at June 30, 2014.
With respect to capital management, we continue to have capital in excess of our target
levels, and in the second quarter we repurchased 3.2 million shares for an aggregate
purchase price of $199 million. I would like to take this opportunity to review our
philosophy on capital management. As always, our preference is to deploy capital in our
businesses. However, if business conditions don't allow us to earn our target returns, we
will look to return excess capital to our shareholders either through share repurchases or
special dividends. Generally, we prefer share repurchases which benefit shareholders
over the long-term by increasing earnings per share. However, when our shares trade at a
premium to book as they have for some time now, we have to be prudent in those
decisions.

You have seen the grid on our website, but the essence of this chart is that when we
repurchase our shares at a premium to book value, our objective is to earn back that
premium for our shareholders over a reasonable period based on the expected returns
that we can achieve on equity. Now, whether we can earn that premium back or not is
dependent on how quickly the company generates earnings. One can have a different
point of view on this, but in the current environment we think that after three years, our
crystal ball becomes very foggy. Current competitive conditions make profitable growth in
our traditional lines of insurance and reinsurance difficult to achieve and not surprisingly,
the industry is experiencing an elevated level of M&A activity.
In anticipation of your questions, I would like to take a moment to reiterate our thinking
with respect to acquisitions. We like to investigate opportunities presented by the
marketplace, but our preference is to invest first in the recruitment of people and teams
with specialty expertise that will complement our product platform. Our second choice
would be renewal rights transactions, and last, are acquisitions of business units. We
consider acquisitions of business to be the most difficult because by their nature, they
involve greater uncertainty.
The criteria that we use in evaluating potential acquisitions have not changed. First and
foremost, the business should be complementary to our long-term strategic goals.
Second, there needs to be a cultural fit, does management have similar DNA to Arch?
That's very critical and very important to us. And third, is the balance sheet transparent
and we can get our arms around it? When all those three conditions are met, then we
look at price last. As respects to price, similar to our approach on share repurchases, we
consider, among other things, the length of time and the relative certainty it will take to
recover any premium to book value paid.
With respect to overall market conditions, it is starting to feel like the late 1990s where
reinsurance is available at attractive prices, and where favorable terms to the buyer are
easily obtained. We have not yet seen significant erosion in the insurance business, with
the exception of certain lines which I will discuss in a moment. We believe however, that
the ability to buy reinsurance on favorable terms will eventually lead to more competitive
conditions across the insurance business.
As I indicated, there are several areas in the insurance sectors that are experiencing
increasingly severe price competition. They are E&S and large global property markets,
professional liability lines including D&O especially in foreign markets, as well as marine
aviation and energy. In all these business lines, we have significantly reduced our
exposure.
At Arch, underwriting discipline has always been the foundation of our success, and it will
continue to be the number one priority and focus of our management team. Over our
history, we have built underwriting systems and controls which allow us to monitor not only
changes in premium rates, but also changes in terms and conditions. We believe that our
culture and systems, in combination should allow us to better navigate phases of the
property casualty cycle.

FINAL

Turning back to our quarterly results. The insurance segment gross and net written
premiums on a constant dollar basis fell 11.1% and 10.7% in the quarter, compared to over
the same quarter in 2014, partially due to the timing of certain renewal businesses
obtained in a renewal write transaction in our alternative markets business that we have
discussed in previous calls.
In addition, volume was affected by underwriting actions in our international and program
units. Mark will comment further on premium volume in a few minutes. In our reinsurance
segment, softening pricing and continued pressures on terms and conditions led us to
reduce on a constant dollar basis net written premium by 8.3%. In addition, purchases of
retro protection reduced net premiums volume in the quarter.
Our mortgage segment includes primary mortgage insurance written through Arch M.I. in
the U.S., reinsurance treaties covering mortgage risk written globally, as well as other risksharing transactions. Gross written premium in the mortgage segment were $68.6 million
in the second quarter 2015 or nearly 24% higher than in the same quarter of 2014. Net
written premium grew 22% over the same period to $61.7 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our U.S. mortgage insurance operations acquired in late 2014 produced approximately
half of the segment's net written premium in the second quarter with $24 million of net
premium written in the credit union channel, where the bank channel produced $7 million
of premiums written for the quarter.
We continue to make good progress in the expansion of the bank channel, and have
approved more than 748 master policy applications from banks, and more than 264 of
these banks have already submitted loans for our approval. Of these master policies, 40
represent national accounts and the balance are regional banks.
We also continue to see opportunities in GSE risk sharing transactions which produced
$3.7 million of other underwriting income for the 2015 second quarter versus $1.2 million in
the same quarter of 2014. No premium was reported for these transactions as current
accounting treatment requires us to continue to use derivative accounting. We fully expect
that future transactions involving Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will receive insurance
accounting treatment. Although competitive pricing conditions have intensified a bit,
Arch's strong balance sheet, diversified mix of business, and our willingness to exercise
underwriting discipline should allow us to continue to generate acceptable returns. Groupwide on an expected basis, we believe the present value ROE on the business we wrote
this year for six months will produce an underwriting year return on equity in the range of
10% to 12%.
Now, before I turn it over to Mark, I would like to discuss our cat PMLs. As usual, I would
like to point out that our cat PML aggregates reflect business bound through July 1, while
the premium numbers included in our financial statements are through June 30, and that
the PMLs are reflected net of reinsurance purchases and retrocessions. As of July 1, 2015
our largest 250-year single event PML was essentially flat, and is in the Northeast at $541
million or approximately 9% of common shareholders' equity. Our Gulf of Mexico PML

increased slightly to $522 million at July 1, and our Florida Tri-County PML stands at $445
million, a slight increase.

FINAL

I will now turn it over to Mark to comment further on our financial results, and when Mark
concludes his prepared remarks, we will come back and take your questions. Mark?

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Great. Thank you, Dinos and good morning to all. As was true on last quarter's call, my
comments that follow today are on a pure Arch basis which excludes the other segment,
that being Watford Re, unless otherwise noted. As in previous calls, I will be using the
term core to denote results without Watford Re, and the term consolidated when
discussing results including Watford Re.

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, now with that said, the core combined ratio for this quarter was 87.9% with 1.9
points of current accident-year cat-related events, net of reinsurance and reinstatement
premiums compared to the 2014 second quarter combined ratio of 86.2% which reflected
1.8 points of cat-related events. Losses recorded in the second quarter from these cat
events, net of recoverables and reinstatement premiums totaled $15.9 million versus $16.5
million in the corresponding quarter last year. This quarter's cats primarily emanated from
U.S. spring tornado and thunderstorm events and some Australian weather activity.
The 2015 second quarter core combined ratio reflected 9.2 points of prior year net
favorable development, net of reinsurance and related acquisition expenses compared to
9.4 points of prior period favorable development on the same basis in 2014's
corresponding quarter. This results in a core accident quarter combined ratio, excluding
cats with the second quarter of 2015 of 95.2% compared to the 93.8% accident quarter
combined ratio in the second quarter of 2014.
In the insurance segment, the 2015 accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats was
97.6% compared to an accident quarter combined ratio of 95.9% a year ago. This 170
basis point increase was driven by 120 bps in the loss ratio and 50 bps in the expense
ratio, with the loss ratio increase reflecting higher large-loss attritional activity than in the
second quarter of 2014 emanating primarily from aviation more and offshore energy
claims. Taking this increase into account, the insurance segment accident quarter loss
ratios were nearly identical this quarter versus the second quarter of 2014. The
reinsurance segment 2015 accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats was 94% even
compared to 92.1% in the corresponding quarter of 2014. As noted in prior quarters, the
reinsurance segment's results reflect changes in the mix of premiums earned, including a
lower contribution from property cat and other property businesses. One should also
note that this quarter, we did receive regulatory approval for the acquisition of Gulf Re
and accordingly, have consolidated Gulf Re's results as a subset of the reinsurance
segment, whereas previously, it was accounted for under the equity method as a single
line entry, although its impact was immaterial this quarter. This reclassified business falls
within the "property other, a property excluding, a property cat line" in our financial
supplement.

FINAL

The mortgage segment 2015 accident quarter combined ratio was 77.4% compared to
84.9% for the second quarter of 2014. This decrease is predominantly driven by continued
low levels of reported delinquencies benefiting the loss ratio associated with the CMG
business we acquired in 2014, along with better underlying credit risk on business written
since the acquisition.
The insurance segment accounted for roughly 24% of the total net favorable
development this quarter, excluding the associative impact on acquisition expenses, and
this was primarily driven by shorter-tailed lines from the 2011 to 2014 accident years, with
some contributions from longer-tailed lines spread primarily across older accident years.
The reinsurance segment accounted for approximately 75% of the total net favorable
development in the quarter, with approximately 37% of that due to net favorable
development on short-tailed lines concentrated in the more recent accident years, and
the balance due to net favorable development on longer-tailed line primarily from the
2003 through 2009 underwriting years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Similar to the past, approximately two-thirds of our core $7.3 billion of total net reserves
per losses loss adjustment expense are IBNR in additional case reserves, which continues
to remain fairly consistent across both Reinsurance and Insurance segments.
The core expense ratio for the second quarter of 2015 was 35.1% versus the prior year's
comparative quarter expense ratio of 32.8%, driven by an increase in the operating
expense ratio of 210 bps, along with an increase in the acquisition expense ratio of 20
bps. The increase in the operating expense ratio component reflects a 6.5% decrease in
net earned premiums, a 5.7% increase in operating expenses, which also continues to
reflect the addition of our U.S. Mortgage Issuance operations, which, as we said in the
past, is operating at a higher expense ratio until that business reaches steady state.
However, as I will get into shortly, it is best to look at the expense ratio in totality rather
than by each component separately due to accounting for reinsurance ceding
commissions.
The Insurance segment expense ratio increased 50 basis points to 32.5% for the quarter
compared to 32% even a year-ago. The net acquisition ratio decreased 10% whereas the
operating expense ratio increased 60 basis points. This separation, as mentioned earlier,
is artificial since reinsurance ceding commission reimburse ceding companies not just for
frontend acquisition expenses but also for the overhead associated with running the
primary business, plus in most cases an overwrite in addition to these reimbursements.
It has been the convention to categorize the entirety of reinsurance ceding commissions
in the net acquisition line, whereas a portion of these commissions contemplate operating
and unallocated loss adjustment expense reimbursements but are not classified there.
So, the increased ceding commission actually provide offset to the operating expense
ratio, which is why I said initially, looking at things in totality, deal with those issues as
opposed to swapping it for one place to another.

FINAL

The Insurance segment net acquisition ratio reduction primarily reflects material improved
treaty ceding commissions on an earned basis associated with quota share contract
ceded. It's important to note though that on a written basis, the frontend gross
commission ratio worldwide actually increased 40 basis points whereas the average cede
commission ratio improved substantially by 260 basis points.
Taken together, this increased treaty commission benefit overcame the increase in the
gross commission, resulting in a 60 basis points net commission improvement. Again, on
a written basis.
Lastly, one has to reflect the premium tax component, which is a part of the net
acquisition expense but is not considered to be commission expense. That increased
approximately 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter. That's mostly a function of mix. This
reflects traditional premium taxes, second injury funds, guarantee funds cost, et cetera,
which also, though, signals some shift from non-admitted paper to admitted forms as the
market softens.
These overall net acquisition improvements, however, will continue to be felt as these
ceded written premiums are earned over the next few quarters.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Reinsurance segment's expense ratio increased from 30.9% in the second quarter of
2014 to 35.5% this quarter, primarily due to the lower level of net earned premium, a
higher level of treaty cede commission associated with bound contracts, and a slight
increase in operating expenses.
The net acquisition ratio increased to 160 basis points due to market forces, whereas the
300 basis point increased in the operating expense ratio is almost exclusively driven by
the 18.4% reduction in net premiums earned.
The ratio of net premiums to gross premiums for our core operations in the quarter was
71.3% versus 73.2% a year ago. The Insurance segment had a 68.3% ratio, which was very
comparable to the 67.9% a year earlier, whereas the Reinsurance segment had a net-togross ratio of 73.9% this quarter compared to 83.1% a year ago, primarily reflecting
increased property and property cat retrocessions and increased sessions to Watford Re
as a reinsurer.
Shifting now towards the market, our U.S. insurance operation saw an 80 basis point
effective rate decrease this quarter, net of reinsurance. As commented on the last couple
of quarters, the pricing environment is quite different for short-tailed versus longer-tailed
lines. Our short-tailed first party lines of business had an effective 6.5% rate decrease for
the quarter compared to a 1% effective rate increase for the longer-tailed third party lines,
both on a net-of-reinsurance basis.
Rate increases on longer-tailed lines in the aggregate have now dropped below our view
of weighted loss cost trends.

FINAL

Looking more deeply, some lines incurred rate reductions such as the 10.5% decrease in
property and a 5% decrease in high-capacity D&O lines while others enjoyed healthy
increases such as plus 6.5% in our lower capacity D&O line, 5.5% in loss sensitive
construction, and 3% in our program business. Also, as I've mentioned on prior calls, our
lower capacity D&O business lines have now achieved 16 consecutive quarters of rate
increases.
Now, turning to our continuing market cycle management, the Insurance group worldwide
reduced net written premiums in the volatile line of E&S Casualty, E&S Property, Global
Property and Professional Liability in excess of 20% quarter-over-quarter. By contrast,
lower volatility lines of contract binding, travel and surety expanded north of 15%, partially
offset by a decline in program business due to underwriting actions.
Professional liability is down due to our continuing reduction of the European exposures,
plus a subset of SME professional business changed its common ex-date, or expiration
date, from June into July.

Bloomberg Transcript

One anomaly to be aware of is in the U.S. alternative markets business, as Dinos alluded
to, which on the surface appears to have had a 25% reduction in net written premium but
in reality, back in the second quarter of 2014, when a previously discussed renewal rates
agreement was completed, most risk wanted to attain Arch's A+ paper as soon as
possible and we're bound with odd time policy terms that are now naturally renewing
throughout the balance of the year.
The Reinsurance group only had 8.9% of its net earned premium, represented by
property cat this quarter. And property cat net written premiums were reduced by
another 15% quarter-over-quarter. Property other than property cat or excluding property
cat had a net written premium increase of just shy of 4% this quarter. However, this was
driven by our property facultative unit.
Additionally, the Reinsurance group reduced net volume in motor quota share, trade
credit and crop hail by at least is 20% in response to the market conditions.
The Mortgage segment posted a 75.3% combined ratio for the calendar quarter. The
expense ratio, as expected and as denoted earlier, continues to be high as the operating
ratio related to our U.S. primary operation will remain elevated until that proper scale is
achieved.
The net written premiums of $61.7 million in the quarter was driven by $30.6 million from
our U.S. primary operation, as Dinos mentioned, and $31.1 million of net written premiums
through our reinsurance mortgage operations.
This segment also had $3.7 million of other underwriting income in the quarter versus
approximately $1.2 million in the second quarter of 2014 due to risk-sharing transactions
which were treated as derivatives and mark-to-market each quarter. You may recall that
that type of income in last quarter sequentially was around a little north of $7.5 million,
which incorporated some catch-up premiums that aren't reflected in this quarter.

FINAL

At June 30, 2015, our risk-in-force of $10.7 billion includes $6.1 billion from our U.S.
mortgage insurance operation, $3.9 billion through worldwide reinsurance operations and
$684 million through risk-sharing transactions. Our primary U.S. mortgage insurance
operation bound $2.7 billion of new insurance written during the quarter, which was
approximately evenly split between bank and credit union clients and which statistically
represents the aggregate of original principal balances of all loans receiving new
coverage during the quarter.
The weighted average FICO score for the U.S. primary portfolio remains strong at 735
and the weighted average loan-to-value ratio held steady at 93.2%. Those states risk-inforce represents more than 10% of the portfolio, and our U.S. primary mortgage insurance
company is operating at an estimated 9.7:1 risk-to-capital ratio as of June 30, 2015.
The other segment, which is still as of now is exclusively Watford Re, reported 103.8%
combined ratio for the quarter on $120.2 million of net written premiums and $107.2 million
of net earned premiums. As a reminder, these premiums reflect 100% of the business
assumed rather than simply Arch's approximate 11% common share interest.

Bloomberg Transcript

As for business sourcing, approximately 40% of the $128 million in gross written premiums
this quarter was written directly on Watford paper, with the remainder ceded by Arch
affiliates. It should be noted, however, that this sourcing mix can vary materially quarter-toquarter.
The total return on our portfolio was reported negative 4 basis points on a U.S. dollar
basis in the quarter, primarily reflecting declines in our investment grade fixed income
portfolio driven by rising yields and widening spreads, partially offset by positive returns in
our alternative investment, equity and non-investment grade sectors.
Total return also benefited from the weakening U.S. dollar on most of our foreigndenominated investments. Excluding foreign exchange, total return was a negative 38
bps in the quarter. Our embedded pre-tax book yield before expenses was 2.07% as of
the end of the quarter compared to 2.18% at December 31, 2014, while the duration of
the portfolio shortened to 3.05 years.
The current duration continues to reflect our conservative position on interest rates in the
current yield environment. However, movements in duration are not necessarily indicative
of longer-term strategy or of the insurance/reinsurance portfolio composition due to this
duration statistic being reported on a single day balance sheet view.
Reported net investment income in the quarter was $0.53 per share or $67.2 million
versus an identical $0.53 per share in the 2014 second quarter or $72.5 million. As always,
we evaluate investment performance on a total return basis and, as such, invest in asset
sectors which may not generate net investment income.
Cash flow from operations for the quarter on a core basis excluding the other segment
was approximately $232 million compared to $254 million in the second quarter of 2014.

Page 9 of 30



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity

This was caused primarily by reduced premium inflows net of commissions and net of
reinsurance sessions.

FINAL

Interest expense for the quarter was $4 million even, which is a significant reduction from
the last two quarters and from the corresponding second quarter of 2014. This reduction
is due to a favorable adjustment involving a certain loss portfolio transfer entered into
effective January of 2013.
This deposit accounting transaction had a downward re-evaluation in the quarter of the
underlying ultimate loss, which resulted in an $8.4 million reduction in interest expense. As
you may recall, there was a similar adjustment for this in the third quarter of 2014.
However, the run rate interest expense which includes approximately $12 million from
Arch's senior notes and a variable amount of Arch's revolving credit borrowings and some
other items is expected to be under $13 million per quarter for the foreseeable future.
However, re-evaluations of the underlying ultimate loss attributable to this loss portfolio
transfer will occur periodically and could potentially produce significant further
adjustments.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income available to Arch shareholders for this
quarter was an expense of 3.9% compared to an expense of 3.6% in the second quarter
of last year. There was no tax catch-up this quarter as the tax rates on pre-tax operating
income were identical for both quarters of 2015. As always, fluctuation in the effective tax
rate can result from variability in the relative mix of income or loss projected by
jurisdiction.
Our total capital was $7.03 billion at the end of the quarter, which is virtually flat with total
capital at prior year-end but down 2.1% relative to total capital as of March 31 of 2015.
During this quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares, as Dinos mentioned, at an
aggregate cost of approximately $199 million. These repurchases represented a multiple
of 1.32x of the quarter's average book value and had the effect of reducing quarterending book value per share by $0.39. Additionally, approximately $525 million remained
under our existing buyback authorization as of the end of the quarter.
The effect of foreign exchange on book value was a loss of approximately $0.22 per
share as the negative impact of restating insurance and reinsurance liabilities outstripped
the gain in non-U.S. denominated investments.
Our debt-to-capital ratio remains low at 12.7% and debt plus hybrids represent only 17.3%
of our total capital, which continues to give us significant financial flexibility. And we also
continue to estimate having capital in excess of our targeted position.
Book value per share was $47.49 at the end of the quarter, down 0.6% versus the prior
quarter and up 8.6% relative to one year ago. This change in book value per share this
quarter primarily reflects unrealized losses and foreign exchange impacts from fixed
income securities, which exceeded the company's continued strong underwriting results.

Although there was a lot of activity this quarter affecting book value, we shouldn't lose
sight of the fact that the $0.31 per share drop in book value can be totally explained by
the $0.39 per share impact of our share buyback this quarter.

FINAL

With that and these introductory comments, we're now pleased to take your questions.

Q&A
Operator
Our first question will come from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Please
proceed.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. Hey, Mark, just one question I had on the Watford premiums, maybe you
alluded to this in your comments, was the premiums there were higher than the ceded
premiums out of the Reinsurance business. Did business come from somewhere else or
was there some accounting there just to be aware of ?

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, no. I mean we did say that 40% of that was natively on their paper, so it wouldn't
have been ceded from any Arch affiliate. And there was a slightly higher contribution from
the Insurance group this quarter than the Reinsurance group. I think that answers your
question.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Yeah, got it. Great. Thanks. And then in terms of the expenses, I mean you talked about
the G&A ratio coming up just from a denominator effect of premiums being lower. I mean
is there a level where you want that to be or you're comfortable kind of letting the
business pulling back and taking appropriate underwriting actions and holding on to your
infrastructure just for the potential for conditions to change and being able to leverage
that infrastructure again down the road?

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well, Dinos and I both have an opinion on that. I'll go first on it. It's a balance beam.
There's things that you need to be mindful of and be efficient and make the right tough
decisions, and there's other areas you have to recognize you might be going into bone
and muscle. I mean as Dinos says, our business is to make decisions. You don't want to
lose that decision-making ability. So there's some level of carrying intellectual property
we're willing to have irrespective of what it does to the expense ratio.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

No company went bankrupt or had significant problems because of expense ratio. Most
of the companies, they have difficulty with results is due to loss ratio. So in echoing what

FINAL

Mark said, anything that is dear to us, and dear to us is our underwriting capability we have
as a corporation, we will protect that. Of course, we will be prudent managers and try to
manage expense with that parameter.
So at the end of the day, if it comes to what we call muscle, which is underwriting
capability and knowledge, that it might not be fully usable at this point in time, we will
retain that because we make decisions for the long term, not the short term. And when
things we can eliminate and they don't have a long-term or short-term effect to what we
do, we'll be prudent managers, too, and do so so we can get a more reasonable
expense ratio. So, that's our philosophy and that's what we're going to practice as a
management team.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. I mean as far as reinsurance is concerned and the view there, still at this point the
changes that are taking place in the market are cyclical so you'll make that sort of
bone/muscle decision according to that as sort of a baseline?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Absolutely, absolutely. Because at the end of the day, there is wonderful things you can
do in a good market in reinsurance but you need to have the capability. And I think we
have proven that our reinsurance team is one of the best in the industry over the last 12
years, 13 years. All you got to do is look at their performance.

But the U.S. operation continues to improve, per our comments with the good
improvement in delinquencies. The reinsurance was lower still, and a lot of that is due to a
calendar quarter effect of recognizing favorable results on reinsurance treaties issued a

Got it.

On the mortgage insurance business, you showed some nice growth in the quarter in
terms of the U.S. risk-in-force. And now that you have all the key bank approvals, do you
expect a positive inflection point in the risk-in-force in the second half of the year? Or
could you just talk about how we should think about the trajectory on the growth?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, it will be a steady improvement. Not only you have to get to – to sign up the banks,
but eventually you got to make sure that from a IT point of view, all the pipes, they're
open and we're starting to receive that.
So, I wouldn't say you're going to see an abrupt change in that trajectory. But as you know
with the mortgage business, every quarter adds, and we're pretty happy with the
progress that our sales force is doing and also the business that we're receiving. We have
received from 200-some, 270 banks applications to write the business. And we're still
working. We're not at optimum pace yet. But I'll be happy when I'm receiving from all 700
or so. And I don't know how long that will take because these projects, they get into the IT
departments and sometimes they take six weeks, sometimes they take six months. So, I
can't predict that.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

Okay, great. And then just from a high level in U.S. mortgage insurance, how are you
winning? What do you view as your competitive advantage there?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, we're one of the highest-rated MI paper. So, like, from a credit point of view, we
should be. And we have a terrific reputation on service. With everybody that we have
done business so far, we're getting very, very, very good comments about our
responsiveness and our service capability. So, the combination of those two, I think, it
fares well for us for the long term.

Bloomberg Transcript

As far as your baseball question, I have no clue. I don't see how – they come out of the
blue and there is lot of dating and lot of marriages and all that. But I don't know.
From on an effect point of view, let me give you our view. Our view is that by consolidating
on the primary side, you have less buyers or more concentrated buyers for reinsurance.
So, I think that will put some pressure, probably further pressure on the reinsurance
purchasing. Because the bigger the buyer, the more they buy, the more the leverage they
have. And also, they can use even alternative structures, as we have seen with some.
On the insurance side, I view it as opportunities for the simple reason that history tells us
that never in a consolidation of insurance operations one plus one equals two plus. It's
usually one-and-a-half to one-and-three-quarters, and there is things that fall off the table.
It could be people who want to make a change in their careers. It could be over-lining of
lines and depending on coverages and the clients says, I don't want to put all my eggs in
a bigger basket now. So, we're ready and willing and we have instructed our underwriting
units to be a participant in that activity when it occurs and some of that will occur.

FINAL

Good morning.

Q - Charles J. Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

I wanted to just talk about the ROE profile on a consolidated basis for you guys and how
that plays into if more capital needs to be returned. I guess, Dinos, you've talked about
for some quarters now that the current business return profile has been in the 10% to 12%
range. And we have a period like this and I realized it's only basis points below that
double-digit level, but at the low-end of that range in a period that's relatively light on cats
and relatively strong and favorable development. How should we think about how you
guys manage to the consolidated ROE profile and how much capital you need to hold and
whether there's capital in MI that's kind of affecting that? That would help.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, let me take you back a little bit, because I think based on your question, I think you
might be confusing underwriting ROE versus calendar reporting. We don't pay any
attention to calendar reporting, because that's an accounting, and underwriters love
accountants but they don't pay a lot of attention to it, right.
The ROE that we calculate is on underwriting basis, meaning how much capital I need to
support this business and what is the return when I write a new piece of business. That's
the way we base those numbers. So, prior-year reserve releases or additions will not
affect that, et cetera.
The 10% to 12%, we calculate based on our pricing model that comes from pricing
actuaries, the mix of business we have. And just to give you a little flavor is that we're very
happy with our insurance business, especially on the small- to medium-sized accounts that
are producing good ROEs. We're not so happy but you can eliminate all or some of our
larger accounts for ROEs.
On the reinsurance sector, the ROEs, they've been very good for many years but they're
coming down as the pressure continues, including – a big component of good ROE was
the cat business but that now is not producing what we (49:00) expected for a high
volatility line in ROEs. And then, we're very, very happy with the ROEs on the mortgage
insurance.
So, we put that all in a hamper. Our actuaries go through that, and that's how we estimate
the underwriting ROE. I'm not telling you that every single thing that we do has a doubledigit ROE component. If that was the case, we would have better than the 10% to 12%. We
got businesses that they're earning maybe 5%, 6% or 7%, and the question is should we
get out of it or not. That's not an easy question. But usually, we'll look at what the
prospects are over a longer period of time. And sometimes, you got to stay in those
Page 16 of 30



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2015-07-30

accounts and in those classes for a while at a lesser return in order for you to be a player
when things to get better. So, that's the way we think about it. And it's all underwriting
ROE calculations, not calendar year ROE.

FINAL

Q - Charles J. Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Okay. No, I appreciate – I just was thinking, and I realize you guys look at it that way, I
guess I was thinking of it in the view of if the underwriting ROE profile is 10% to 12% over a
three- or four-year basis, it kind of ends up mirroring up with the calendar year. I mean if
you're always writing 10% to 12%, over time the calendar year and the underwriting year
should mirror each other, I guess. But I do appreciate the color.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

If it was a steady 10% to 12% for all times, but I can tell you the underwriting ROEs in the
2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 years, they were in the 20%s plus, and that helped us to have
mid-teen ROEs for some years when actually the underwriting ROE was in the low-teen.
So, we look at it both ways. But I can tell you, from underwriting decision-making and
viewing the healthiness of our business, we're religiously looking at underwriting ROE. We
allocate capital to our treaties. We allocate capital to our primary business by sector. And
then, we have an expectation of return out of that based on our pricing, and then we
calculate the ROE on that basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Charles J. Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

And I guess just one additional, and into the business, you mentioned that a couple of the
programs were terminated this quarter. I'm just wondering what programs and how many
programs are left, and what was going on that kind of said – was it an ROE? Was it just
people? What happened? Because that has been one of the growth drivers for the
insurance business and a couple of quarters where it's kind of slowed down a little bit?
Thanks.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, with anything that we do, everything goes to an underwriting review once a year. I
don't care if it's programs or D&O division or E&O division, et cetera. At that point in time,
there is an actuarial indication as to what rates we're charging, what is the profitability of
that book of business. And then, there is what we will call the rate indication. Then, there
is a discussion with our partners. Our approach with our program business is that we want
to be a profitable, but also we want our MGUs to be profitable. You don't have a
partnership if one makes money and the other one doesn't, and vice-versa. We want all of
our MGAs, MGUs, to be profitable and we want ourselves to be profitable.
And then, there is the discussion, this is the market, this is what we believe we should be
charging, and sometimes there is disagreements. If the disagreement is large enough
and we don't believe we can achieve that partnership going forward that both of us will
make money, then we'll make the hard decisions and then we decide to part companies.
And unfortunately, it did happened for two of our programs, that our rate indications and

Page 17 of 30



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2015-07-30

what we wanted to file and price that business in the marketplace was not in agreement
with our partners, and they chose to go elsewhere.

Q - Charles J. Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

FINAL

Can you let us know what – yeah, please.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yeah, Chuck, just for a little extra color. Those two programs annualized for about $45
million of gross written premium. We keep high nets on that, so it's not far from a net
written premium number, firstly. Secondly – and they were pretty much even in terms of –
they're both north of 20, 20 each.
One thing to keep in mind though is that this quarter, one of those programs is very heavy
in the second quarter. So, it was to the tune of 50% to a total program. So, the loss of that
program is going to be more felt in this quarter than any other quarter for the balance of
the year from that program.

Our next question will come from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please proceed.

Q - Jay H. Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thank you. On the M&A front, Dinos, you're very clear about focusing on adding teams of
people and renewal rights transactions. And then, seemingly, third – way third down the
list is acquisitions of businesses. Going back to even the recap of Arch in 2001, I don't
think the company has ever issued shares for acquisitions. Is there any circumstances
where you could see that occurring in the future given the massive phase of M&A in the
industry?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. We care a lot about our shares. It's our shareholders' value. But if the transaction is
large enough and our cash capability, even though there is not significant leverage on the
balance sheet. So, we do have borrowing ability to a certain degree. Depends on how big
the transaction is, we will consider issuing shares. But that's the last consideration; not the
first. We try, with all of our decisions, not to dilute our common shareholders. We don't like
a lot of dilution.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

And as a follow-up to that, the way – targeting back to Dinos' comments, think of it this
way, that the recruitment of any goodwill or any excess premium you pay relative to what
we do in share buybacks. So, if we're looking for three-year paybacks in share buybacks,
where we know our operations, it's us. We know what's going on versus something that
Dinos mentioned, with a lot more uncertainty, the three-year payback is in upper bound
for recruitment of tangible book value hit towards an acquisition. So, we're very mindful of
that.

Q - Jay H. Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Okay. That's in line with what I would have thought. Mark, with regard to that buyback
comment, I mean you're in an enviable position of having a high multiple. The stock today,
I think, is right around 1.5 times book, and I think that's starting to bump up against your
tipping point on whether Arch does buybacks as opposed to special dividend. Can you
give us your perspective on that?

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

That's exactly Dinos' comment about us being prudent in how we do it. At one side, I'll be
honest with you, it's more of a stretch to do that unless you could find a profitable block
trade or something.

I don't know it can compete with your mother's though, so I mean what can you do?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, my mother is in Cyprus unfortunately, so we got to deal with a local restaurant.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay. So, two questions. First of all, Mike Nannizzi asked a question about mortgage
reinsurance versus mortgage primary. And you said in the margin, the reinsurance was
more profitable because of the good accident years. If I think about reinsurance in
general, companies have been bumping up (58:26) commissions. And when I talk to a lot
of reinsurers, they say oh, our book, we use a lot of local players so we get better deals. I
mean clearly, the large companies are going to arb you out. And when it seems that
mortgage insurance is so profitable these days, how is mortgage reinsurance so
profitable? Why aren't the large players charging to cede that risk?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

For the simple reason that when these transactions, Josh, were taken – don't forget, in
the mortgage space you make a transaction in a particular year and you have a stream of
revenue that comes over six years, seven years. At the time that these transactions took
place, we were providing very valuable capacity to people that they needed capacity. And
for that reason, I think we had equal negotiating leverage as they did. They needed our

Page 20 of 30



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2015-07-30

capital as much as we needed the business, so that's a good combination. And for that
reason, we got terms that they're not disadvantageous to them but they're not
disadvantageous to us either.

FINAL

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay, that makes sense. Number two, Mark went through in detail on the expense ratio
for the insurance business. Mortgage insurance has grown dramatically over the past 12
months, but expense ratio really hasn't come down. When should we think that's going to
occur and why isn't that proportional with the growth rate of the new insurance written?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, the growth is starting to show, but don't forget also we had an acceleration of
expenses because we were building these marketing team that is out there. We added in
the last – I don't know – five quarters, some 60 people purely in the sales and marketing
area.
I think now we're on a steady state. So when it comes to that, it's not going be a
significant addition in personnel in our mortgage business. But as the volume starts going
up, you're going to start seeing the reduction in the expense ratio.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And one last MI question. How should I think about growth in capital? Do you need to
dividend money down into Arch Mortgage U.S. in order to fund future growth?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

No, we gave you that number, Josh. I think now, we're operating at around 10:1. 9.7:1, I
think, is the exact number.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And you can go to 15:1 if you want?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

As I'm getting older, I don't like to be exact because I forget things, but – and we got a lot
of room to go to 15:1. So I don't see us requiring to downstream capital into those
operations for a couple more years until we – I think I use a size 3 shoe to a size 9 foot,
we still got the opposite, a foot is size 3 and the shoe is size 9. We got a long way to go
to fill it.

in the medium term to support your current expense growth profile? It doesn't seem
(1:03:33).

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

No, no, we don't – we never really run the company in any segment, with the exception of
MI because we think it's a very, very good time to grow, on a growth prospect. Now,
having said that, you've got to match revenue with expense, as long as you don't cut
muscle. And I will accept one point or two points higher expense ratio than normal, as
long as I'm not losing underwriting capability because that underwriting capability can
produce what it will cost you to maintain for a year or two years or three years in one
quarter.
Let me remind you guys, in the 2002 year, our reinsurance operations produced on an
underwriting basis, $790 million worth of premium and we had 22 people, right? And, it
can come and I can tell you, the profit coming out of that was significant. So, at the end of
the day, it's that balance and you got to make those hard judgments, but I can tell you, if I
got good experienced underwriters, they don't have to worry about their jobs as long as
with us. We'll find things for them to do, and if they don't, we'll have to ask them to play
golf until the good market comes.

Our next question will come from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Please proceed.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, thanks. Mark, you mentioned that you can't necessarily infer anything strategic from
the shortening of the portfolio duration. So can I put that as a more direct question? It also
could reflect something. Is there any – should – is there anything that we should read from
the second quarter change?

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

No, let me expand on it a bit. It is a point in time estimate as I mentioned, but we continue
to have the same exact process where we look at the liability stream and we duration
match it, and the – however, the assets underlying shareholders' equity are shorter. So,
there's no fundamental change to the overall philosophy and the overall approach of
matching losses or duration, which I think is the most important thing. So, there's going to
be tactical moves that happen from quarter to quarter. So, I wouldn't look for some big
theme.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. And then, just a quick numbers question. When we look at the other
expenses – I mean, this on a consolidated basis, it came in at $17.4 million, up almost 17%
year-over-year. Was there anything unusual there, or is that a new good run rate?

FINAL

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well, let's see. You have a slight increase in overall stock-related compensation expense.
For old dogs like me that are retirement-eligible, there is a different accounting treatment
of a quicker recognition of those kinds of things. And it's a series of – a bunch of tiny
things. So, it's nothing I can asterisk for you that's a main driver.

Our next question will come from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please proceed.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, thanks. A couple questions here for you. First, Mark, when you talked about rate on
the portfolio, the minus 0.8%, you said that's net of reinsurance. What does it look like on
a gross basis before reinsurance? And I'm wondering, the advantages you're getting and
how that's looked over the last maybe year or two years so we can get a sense.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yes, it's a little worse. But it's converging – now it could – it was really the benefit of
property cat, really and some other debt that really grows the differential. So – but I can't
get into exact numbers, it's a little bit worse on a gross basis, but that's exactly why you
protect yourself with effective reinsurance.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. And then the second question, looking at Watford Re, I'm just curious. Obviously,
a lot of growth there on a year-over-year basis, it's relatively new. But are we getting to a
point in the marketplace where even Watford is going to potentially have to pull back a
little bit, given the rate competition out there?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, it will depend. It's the same underwriting process that we have for everything else
we do, the only difference between what Watford will do versus what Arch will do is we
believe that their ability as they take a little more risk on the investment side to produce a
higher return on the investments gets factor in, but they can be – they're turning down
business, too. So, without having something in front of me, an account to go through, is
very hard to predict as to – and that's why we never predict volumes because the market
can be very fickle, it can turn on a dime either way, it can get much worse quickly, and it

FINAL

can get much better quickly depending on what happens. Our projection is that it's
probably is getting worse before it will get better. And for that reason, we're very, very
careful in our underwriting processes. So, we don't have these kind of failures that we get
too optimistic on the basis that things will change quickly, and then we can make it up in
the future. We try to write accounts that in our view will produce an adequate return, and
that's why you saw our volume going down a bit.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Right. Is there any business that you perhaps would have kept on Arch's balance sheet
last year that now, all of a sudden is going to Watford's balance sheet because of what's
going on with rates? Are we seeing that?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yeah, there is some of that, yes, absolutely, that's why – and that was the purpose of us
creating Watford instead of throwing that business totally out, at least it can go to a place
that we get participation. We have an investment in it, it keeps us aligned in that, and also,
we can benefit from the – on sharing some of the course because if you discard the
business, you have no revenue at all, where if you're writing it, you're getting reimbursed
for the cost of writing it, and then potentially, you have also the profit sharing in the
backend. So, yes, there is some of that business that otherwise it would have been lost by
us, it has gone to Watford, yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

But be cognizant, Brian, that – remember, they have the – Watford has its own
management team, and they have the ability on yea and nay on contracts, but let's roll
forward year, it's possible Watford – forget Arch and Watford, so Watford itself may
decide to not renew something that they found in the prior year because of ongoing
rates suppression or yields nothing realize, something to that nature. So, it's not just an
Arch sense, it's completely a Watford sense, and their valuation.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. Most of my questions were answered. Just, I guess one question on the
mortgage segment. The accident year loss ratio jumps around quite a bit quarter-to-

quarter. It's a relatively new business, I understand that. At some point, should we expect
that number to kind of settle down into a more narrow range going forward?

FINAL

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Hey Jay. Good question. The answer is accident year in mortgage business doesn't make
much sense. It's – after all, it's the function of the delinquencies, and then claims
emanating from the delinquencies. Until there's a claim, you can't even put a reserve up
on it body, you can't anticipate performing loans becoming non-performing and having
claims emanate from it. So we've railed against the accounting procedures. That's the
(1:12:06) accounting in that business. So it's going to jump around. I think you...

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I will focus much on the delinquencies. It's a better measure than anything else.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Good afternoon Dinos. So I actually was going to ask something similar to Jay, so just to
follow that up. Mark, can you just walk through a little bit – these mentioned was mostly
the reinsurance loss ratio that came in lower and it sounded like there was some contracts
that were reviewed. I guess, can you sort of walk through that process? Is that sort of an
annual review, or was it just you got new information in the quarter and you reflected that,
or sort of what led you to make a revision now?

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Ian it's no different than any sector of our business. There's reserve reviews by the
business unit actuaries that occur every quarter. And it just happened that those particular
treaties had enough information and for-review points that it was going to develop more
favorably, and it was recognized, so...

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It's the reporting from the clients. When they're showing significant improvement, you
can't ignore it, and they have shown significant improvement.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

But just like the PC reinsurance side, it's completely analogous.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

Well, that's why I was wondering. Was it reports from the client – it is a little bit different
market.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

FINAL

Report from the clients showing significant improvement, yes.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Got it. So it wasn't that you guys went in and looked at the contracts on your own and
decided to like lower the roll rate or something like that. It was that the incoming
information was significantly better and that you had to adjust to that?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yes, pleasant surprise for both them and us.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Perfect. And do you get that information from them quarterly or is that kind of a once a
year thing or?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Quarterly.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Quarterly, okay. I just want to make sure there wasn't a seasonal nature to this, is what I
was after. Got it, okay. .And then, just on M&A, one of the things that gets speculated
upon is the ability for you or some others on the island to help sponsor an inversion of
someone who wants to get offshore. A, just is that a meaningful rationale to do a deal
that is – meet your criteria on other metrics, but maybe not as strongly as another deal
that was better strategically and so forth, and didn't have it singled to it? And then, I have
a follow-up on that.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Like I said, price and financial is the fourth item, so if the first three meet criteria, we'll get
into the fourth. But – and by the way, our view is both in us purchasing something or
somebody purchasing us because, unless your're my wife who says the house is not for
sale, you're going to have the right price, the house is for sale, I'll sell my house if
somebody gives me the right price. So, no emotion here. Our view is we are employed by
the shareholders to do the best job for our shareholders, and there is nothing more to
think about other than that.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Got it. And then, specifically, just to follow-up on the inversion specifically – I don't know
how closely you guys have followed this. But I guess my understanding is that when
Page 27 of 30



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2015-07-30

Treasury made those changes last year that, if a company like Arch were to buy a
company in the United States and invert them that depending on how it was structured,
there's chance Arch could lose its tax status. Is that your understanding that essentially,
inversions are kind of on-hold until Treasury clarifies that language?

FINAL

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

I have no idea because we haven't studied that, and I don't have any more insight to it, it's
highly a legal question than a structure question, and – if you want more, I'll do some
research on it and offline, we'll share our thoughts with you. But it hasn't come across my
desk as a situation that I have to focus on.

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

That topic, we've really just focused on the fact that we recapitalized back in 2001 and all
legislation and all proposals really had a grandfather clause. So I know you're asking a
forward view, but our look and evaluation of that has been the preservation of what we
have.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, yeah, I'm speaking do – if you wanted to do a transaction, there's no issue. There
was some language I read about – I can follow up with Don offline, but that if you were to
buy something, it could affect the status possibly, so I didn't know if that was a hang-up.
That's all I was wondering, but I'll follow up with Don.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

Well, if it does, it's part of the mix. You think I will do something stupid for my
shareholders?

And our final question will come from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.

Q - Kai Pan

FINAL

Thank you. And sorry for keeping you guys and really (1:17:40)...

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Not a problem, Kai. Take all the time you want.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Yeah. So, first question on the underwriting margin going forward. It looks like the last
price spot on long-tail casualty primary business, the pricing now below the cost trends.
So are we expecting – so under reason basis, the underwriting margin will deteriorate.
And anything in your power you can alleviate that or control that deterioration?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yes, the answer is yes to both of those. We always talk about the mix of business, these
guys are active cycle managers, whether it's within reinsurance or within insurance, and
when you see it going negative, you can either drop some of your – attempt to drop
some of your frontend volume but perhaps, as Dinos talked about earlier, the reinsurance
market is in a place where you can get attractive terms, and can get some benefit on that
on a net basis. So the insurance group will be looking for that change in mix frontend, and
change in reinsurance to ameliorate some of that. So – and mix alone could change that,
Kai. So, on the written basis, in a quarter or two quarters from now, even with no changes
in reinsurance-seated programs, by the cycle management, that 1% could be a plus-2% or
plus-2.5%.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. On the reinsurance side, and it looks like this quarter, you said actually, the accident
year loss ratio ex-cat improved a little year over year. It's just because of lower level of
losses or anything there?

A - Mark D. Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well, that was the insurance comment. The insurance comment where you control for the
large threshold was really the same loss ratio second quarter – accident quarter, second
quarter last year to second quarter this year. The reinsurance group, it did go up a bit, but
that's the function of the mix of businesses because we're not writing the property cat.
And we're near to the levels we used to in the past, which has a much lower expected
loss ratio.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay, that's great. Then last question on the recently proposed IRS rules on PFIC, I just
wonder if any comments, what are you seeing about Watford's status on that?

Like I said, I mean we will – Watford is an active insurer which – it assumes a tremendous
amount of reinsurance. Their proposed rules are a work in progress, so we don't know
the final rules, but we will continue to monitor that process and we have no – we don't
believe there is problem for us complying with whatever rules they come up, because
let's go back to the first thing – Watford is an active insurer that assumes a significant
amount of reinsurance and it has significant of reserves.
