MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
David Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody and welcome to our results presentation for 2017. You'll notice
that we called our results presentation, moments of truth, and what we've been talking
about for many years. At some point, we're going to get a year of relatively heavy claims
that's actually happened in 2017. And I think it is a year where the insurance industry can
really step up and pay claims well.
As you all know, we've invested heavily in our claims people over a number of years. And I
thought it is an opportunity to differentiate ourselves in paying claims and not only in the
catastrophe lines and we've now dealt with about 8,000 BBR claims and other parts of
the claims area.
So let's look at the overall content, so I'm going to give an overview, and then I'm going to
handover to Martin, he's going to go through all of the financials. Neil, our Chief
Underwriting Officer will talk about underwriting and then I'll come back and talk briefly
about our data and analytics, strategic initiative and then try and give an outlook for 2018.
So if we dive into the overall numbers with highlights of the numbers, not surprising that
profit was down a bit over 2016, $175 million impact from catastrophe, still holds as we
announced, I think in November last year. Return on equity, again driven down because of

the catastrophe losses. Reasonable top-line growth which is good and we saw rate
decreases on the portfolio of 1% below that reversed in the final quarter, especially in the
shorter lines of property, insurance, and reinsurance, pleased with the combined ratio of
99%. I think that shows the active cycle management over the past few years of reducing
our exposure in areas where pricing has come down to property insurance and
reinsurance, but also some of the marine lines and showing growth in the specialty lines
where we think rating environment has been better.
Prior year reserve releases, Martin will go through had a good contribution from Adrian's
specialized team in 2017. The investment team had an excellent year delivering a return of
2.9% over the 2% in 2016. And then we continue with our dividend strategy of growing the
base dividend between 5% and 10%. Of course, we'll have (00:02:03) special dividends
back when we have super-normal profits. We'll have profits greater than the amount of
capital we need for growth. This year, we think our growth opportunities in 2018, of
course, the profits were lower. So therefore no special dividend in 2017.

Bloomberg Transcript

What's actually happened in the business? A few business highlights, continued strong
growth in our U.S. business. Our U.S. business grew by 12% year-on-year that's in
(00:02:27) a number of lines, probably you guys had a good year. We continue to grow in
the cyber, environmental, miscellaneous medical, so a good growth in our U.S. business,
continue to add talented individuals in our offices out there, which have been fantastic.
While that's been going on, we've been trying to look at our international business and
we have this unusual term of Beazley that internationally is everything outside the U.S., so
specialty lines has been looking at growth outside the U.S. under the leadership of Gerard
Bloom, getting our insurance company up and running in Dublin, have that licensing all
done now and then the branch is approved by the local regulators in Spain, France,
Germany and the UK. And almost everything is done. There are this (00:03:06) one or
two operational aspects in one location still to do and then we'll have it fully up and
running, which is great.
We acquired this Canadian business Creechurch, beginning of last year and that's worked
really well adding underwriting talent to that and they performed exactly as we expected.
And you can see the number of underwriters we've added in our international business
for SL, in Europe, Canada, Latin America through Miami and Asia from Singapore.
Launched a small syndicate 5623 to look at writing facilities in the London market more
efficiently than the following market (00:03:36) starting relatively small, half of the capital
to support 563 is third-partly capital. And we put something down around our
environmental, social and governance developments. Our people are most important to
Beazley having high-quality people, retaining and developing them and when we do
surveys of what our people are most important interested in. Diversity is obviously key
and being a responsible business, not only charitable donations, but contributing to the
wider society. And it was great this year to send eight people to Nepal (00:04:10) for a
couple of weeks and that works very well from our people point of view.

And finally, we've got Dennis in the audience. It was his (00:04:19) last board meeting
yesterday. And we'd also like to thank Dennis for his contribution over the past 6.5 years,
6 years as Chairman. He is a fantastic Chairman. It's been great and we are excited about
finding David to succeed Dennis and hopefully take the company on in the same rates
actually that Dennis has achieved. It'll be quite an achievement, because David needs to
quadruple the share price over the next six years which may be more challenging
becoming £10 billion company or whatever that number takes us to. But it'll be great if he
manages it.
Looking at the graph of the numbers over the past five years, I think it's good top – on the
top left, we're seeing revenues grow more quickly, so we're moving gently out of midsingle digit growth to 7% in 2017. We're hoping to hit 10% and beyond in 2018.
Combined ratio hopping (00:05:12) around the 90% mark and of course we've got a year,
of catastrophe's 99% just like 2011 was 99%. Dividends per share good growth in the pink
block, so the base dividend continues to grow, because we've had special dividends the
past four years and we have been saying the special dividends are supposed to be
special and this year there is no special dividend and return on equity, as I mentioned,
impacted by the catastrophe losses, still pretty respectable at 9%.

Bloomberg Transcript

This chart shows a total shareholder return and the overall target of many of us in the
business to try and grow the net asset value by about 15% plus the risk-free rate per
annum, which is where the top end of the grey triangle is and the diamond is showing
what NAV growth we've managed to achieve over the past eight years. Because growing
the NAV by more than 15% has had a great impact on the share price.
I'm going to hand it to Martin.

Martin Lindsay Bride

{BIO 15458196 <GO>}

Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. I'm Martin Bride, the Group FD at Beazley
and I'm just going to go through my habitual three subjects with you of what happened to
investments, reserves, and capital.
First of all, one or two comments on the high-level KPIs. Net assets per share, they're
down slightly in pence, they're pretty much flat in dollars. Shareholders have received
€0.2007 (00:06:45) in dividends since this time last year, so we're very pleased with the
fact that we've been able to distribute that level of dividend from the company and in a
year where, as Andrew alluded to there's been quite a lot of claims activity. We
nevertheless managed to maintain the NAV in dollar terms, which is the currency in which
we carry our capital.
(00:07:08) investments, really very minor changes to the portfolio. Our strategy of having
80% to 85% of our assets in a core portfolio and 15% to 20% in a capital growth portfolio
remains the same. They might be minor tweaks, but they were quite important tweaks as
far as 2017 was concerned. And we achieved an excellent investment return. Our highest

Page 3 of 18



Company N ame: Beaz ley PL C
Company Ticker: BEZ L N Equity
Date: 2018-02-08

return in terms of dollars, because our asset base is much bigger than it was going back
10 years.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

And you know, that return is partly a reflection of favorable markets, but also a reflection
of some very good tactical asset management decisions taken by Stuart Simpson and his
team. So we were very encouraged by that outcome.
Moving on to reserves, reserve releases are a very important part of the Beazley model.
We stress the fact that we reserve prudently and therefore on average you should expect
to see reserve releases coming from Beazley, that is exactly the case in 2017. So the
overall reserve release is very stable in line with previous years. As you can see from the
colors, it's come from quite different places than the previous two or three years. So on
the short tail classes of business, they have been at the – they are taking the brunt of the
rate reductions that have been occurring over the last few years. And there is
mechanically less margin to release from those short tail classes. The counterweight to
that, the specialty lines business with a very strong reserve release, it had a strong
reserve release at the half year and that performance was repeated in the second half of
the year, so the overall position very similar to previous years.
So in the next slide, we talk about what is going to happen next. This reserve margin, the
margin in our reserves on the balance sheet is a lead indicator of the future. So as you can
see, it's at the bottom end of our range. There's one or two mechanical technical things
related to the catastrophes that contribute to that position, but it is at the lower end of
our range. So as far as reserve releases going forward are concerned, there may be a
slight reduction in 2018, but our forward-looking guidance as to what you should expect
reserve release wise from Beazley is the same picture that you've seen in the past.
And in fact, if we just flip back a slide 2012 which was the year that followed the last
significant set of catastrophe events you can see a similar feature. You've got a reduced
reserve release, because essentially our short tail business is carrying much less margin
forward into the following period.
So now capital management, so we continue to distribute significant amount of capital out
of the business. Andrew talked about quadrupling the share price and hopefully David
Roberts will do that. Hopefully, he will also continue to drive this slide forward as well. So
the combination of the capital we've distributed from the company and the increased
price of the shares has really generated a very strong position for the shareholders.
So in terms of our capital outlook, we are in a slightly better position than we guided at
the half year vis-à-vis 2018. The reason for that is in capital setting at Lloyd's. You get
credit for writing a larger and more profitable net cap book. So between the half year
when I think we were guiding for 6% or 7% growth in capital over 2016 we actually have
2% and that is a benefit that we get from the fact that our business plan, our final
business plan envisages more business in certain areas at better margins which Neil will
talk about.

FINAL

We have a surplus of 35% post our dividend compared to our corridor of 15% to 25%. The
board will review that at the end of 2018. Very exciting year for us growth wise and
depending on what happens claims wise, potentially even greater opportunities going
forward. So the board at this stage is very comfortable to retain the 35% buffer. There's
no change to our philosophy that if we have excess capital, we will distribute it to
shareholders if we cannot see ways to deploy it in the business. But at this stage, we think
it's right to continue with the 35% buffer.
Our guidance on how much our capital requirement is going to increase remains
unchanged, so mid-single digit. And again, that's also though a function of exactly what
market conditions, what business plans we ultimately end up framing, but a strong
position that certainly allows us to grow the company in the short-term.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Martin, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And so, in the next part of
the presentation, I'm just going to look at our underwriting performance and that remains
the key to the results that we're announcing today. So if I start with the highlights from
2017, it was a year dominated by a high incidence of natural disasters. We're pleased
therefore to be able to report an underwriting profit combined ratio of 99% that
compares to prior of 89% and our average combined ratio, which is 90%. So in achieving
this positive outcome, I think there are two things to point out. One is our balanced
business model, specialty lines, which is 50% of our business with the exception of one or
two notifications in our environmental team with those exceptions specialty lines is largely
unaffected by these catastrophe events.
Second thing to point out is our active cycle management, so in 2013 our catastrophe risk
budget was $575 million in 2017 that have reduced to $370 million. And one area of our
business in particular benefited from that active cycle management was our reinsurance
division which despite the fact, it was one-off if not, the most costly year on record for
natural disasters achieved a breakeven outcome.
We're also pleased with that growth of 7% and there were a number of drivers for that.
But the two most significant were continued developments of specialty lines which grew
by 11% and of our business onshore in the U.S. which grew a further 12% to $880 million.
And the result, as Andrew said was achieved against the background of a more
competitive market. Rates fell 1% in our portfolio. Overall, I think that we continue to
benefit from our ability to reach an increasing volume of business in the more stable SME
and mid-market in the U.S. and that offsets or balanced the more competitive conditions
that we experienced for most of the – in the large risk wholesale business written here in
London.
So if I turn to claims, the year as I say was dominated by the cats, the hurricanes Harvey,
Irma and Maria. In total those are expected to cost the industry $100 billion as well as the
California brushfires. And we continue to anticipate that our losses net of reinsurance will
fall within a range of $200 million to $300 million as we reported in November. So no

Page 5 of 18

FINAL

change in our overall loss estimates or generally on the claims side as Martin has just said,
we were pleased that the reserves for prior liabilities continue to develop positively and
our consistent approach to reserving means that we have finished the year with the
reserve over actuarial within our target range of 5% to 10%, albeit right on the low
boundary of that range despite the effects of catastrophes.
So if we look at the numbers in a little bit more depth, growth of 7% in gross written
premium and net written premium. So obviously our reinsurance costs were growing
proportionate to our top-line unpacking the combined ratio, the expense ratio remained
stable at 41% as we continue to invest into the business to drive that growth at the same
rate that that premium was growing.
Claims ratio up 10 points to 58%, all of that increase was driven by the catastrophes.
Pricing there at the bottom, you can see that minus 1% continued to fall although it
moderated from the minus 2% we gave our the year before.

Bloomberg Transcript

And if we turn to this side, it shows the risk adjusted pricing change on our five divisions
going back to 2008. And the first thing to note on this slide is the dotted red line. So that
shows the total, the composite of all of our rate changes. And I think it's been relatively
consistent across this period. And of course, that shows the benefit of operating a
diversified portfolio.
On the right-hand side of the chart, you can see the effects we've experienced in 2017. So
three of our divisions experienced more competitive rating conditions to a greater or
lesser degree reinsurance which is the darker blue line, gave up 2%. Marine, which is the
light blue line at the bottom gave up 3% and PAC, Political, Accident and Contingency
gave up 4%.
Balancing all of that, our two largest divisions, specialty lines and property actually had flat
trading conditions through 2017 and the latter experienced some post (00:18:13) event
rate increases in the fourth quarter following the natural disasters.
So if we turn to the outlook for this year, broadly we're expecting those moderately more
positive rating trends to continue as we go through 2018. At the 1st of January renewals,
we've seen property insurance rates increased by 6% and property reinsurance rates
increased by the same number as the market has recalibrated its pricing for natural
catastrophe exposures.
Against the background of low-single digit growth in the real economies of the developed
world in recent years, we've been targeting growth of 5% to 10%. The 2018 business plan
is targeting growth right at the top end of that range. Quarter the plan is continuation of
what we've been working on in 2017. So it's further growth in specialty lines, driven by
three things. We see continued opportunity for growth onshore in the U.S. The
combination of a more focused distribution strategy and the initiative to put more of our
product through our office footprint continues to drive opportunity across the product
range and specialty lines. But if I was going to point to two things, we see particularly
strong opportunities in healthcare and environmental.
Page 6 of 18

FINAL

On top of that, cyber continues to grow strongly. That's both within our core Beazley
Breach Response product which we sell into the SME and mid-market. But it's also in the
larger space where we've launched this joint venture with Munich Re through Vector
(00:19:59) product. And on top of that, we're starting to see increased demand outside
of America as countries around the world adopt stronger regulations around privacy.
Of course, we have GDPR in the European Union coming into effect in the second quarter
of this year. And staying outside of America, as Andrew said, we spent 2017 putting in
place the operating platform for our specialty lines, international initiative under Gerard
Bloom and we are looking forward to the first full year of operation of that business this
year.
On top of all of that, now of course we have some stronger writing conditions in our short
tail lines of business and that creates opportunities both in property and reinsurance. And
against that background, we're going to increase our catastrophe risk budget to take
advantage of those better market conditions. We do benefit from operating a diversified
portfolio and that does allow us to exercise cycle management, which means we push
forward the areas with better margins and we pulled back and are disciplined in areas
where pricing is under pressure.

Bloomberg Transcript

If I think about the last 10 years, in the first part of the period, following the credit crunch in
2008, we were pulling back in specialty lines against the background of the recession. A
recession is not a strong environment to underwrite specialty lines. And at the same time,
we were pushing forward in our catastrophe businesses. In the second half of the period,
broadly we've been doing the reverse.
2018, therefore is the first year for many years, where we've had the opportunity to grow
profitably on both sides of the business.
So with those thoughts, for the prospects for 2018, let me hand back you now to Andrew.

David Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

Great. Thanks, Neil. So I wanted to talk briefly about data analytics strategic initiative. I
think we talked about this about a year ago and we've made good progress on it. We are
very fortunate and Ian, our Chief Operating Officer having someone who actually
understands how to make business placing more efficient and more effective and we've
done a number of things. We've highlighted them here.
We're also supporting the Lloyd's initiative. Lloyd's has got some press over the London
market initiative to try and make the market more efficient and Lloyd's got some press, I
think towards the end of last week regarding the placement platform, placing business
electronically into the market. We at Beazley have also been doing things. And Beazley
Insight is a fantastic system looking at complete customer view of how we trade with that
customer and automating it and looking at external data to enhance our underwriting
decisions with our customers.

Robotics, we now have some robots. I like the live in inverted commas. We have some
robots within the company, who are doing repetitive processes which is great. And then,
there is Natural Language Processing. It would be great if broker sent everything to us in a
perfect submission with all the data on an e-trading platform that we would like them to
use, but unfortunately they won't do that. They send us emails in and if we can actually
read from the email the information we actually want, we have to respond to them more
quickly and the whole aim of this is making our internal processes and our responsiveness
even better and making our underwriting decisions better.
One of the great things Ian has done (00:23:31) changed the structure of his own
organization to ensure he's got people who are focusing on innovation and change as
well as ensuring the organization as it currently stands is operating well.

Bloomberg Transcript

The picture on the bottom right is how the management team are going to look in five
years' time. I've already bought myself a T-shirt with a rocket on and I already have that
hairstyle, so I'm quite close to being that guy in the bottom right-hand corner.
Onto the outlook, Neil has covered a fair chunk of the outlook. I think it's (00:24:03) going
to be an exciting year 2018. We're seeing rates rise for the first time as we mentioned in
the short tail lines. So it is an opportunity to grow all five divisions in terms of top-line this
year, which we have not done for many years. So that's going to be exciting. We have silo
business continue to grow. We have the international opportunities. The U.S. is still
performing really well for us. We continue to attract and retain good people, which is core
to what we do and want to continue to invest and we have the data and analytics strategic
initiative. So I think 2018, we start the year with a lot of optimism. It should be a very good
year for the company.
And on that note, we're happy to take up any questions.

Q&A
Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

Hi, there. I'm Ben Cohen at Investec. I had a couple of questions. Firstly, on the reserve
release in specialty, the sort of the split between, if you like, the benefit from the cyber
performance and then the prior years of economic benefits coming through. Could you
give us some sense of that to maybe allow us to try and think about how that will work
going forward? And secondly, as part of that, does that development on cyber, is that
going to have an impact as to how you set initial loss picks over the next couple of years
for the cyber product?
And my second, I suppose broad question in terms of the growth opportunities in
property and reinsurance, could you give some sense in terms of how you expect kind of
new business and pricing to split between the two in terms of the growth that you've
done and if not, looking forward then maybe just from the January renewals? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Martin Lindsay Bride

{BIO 15458196 <GO>}

Yeah. So if you look in the table in the report and accounts, you'll see that the reserve
release on the 2015 year of account from specialty lines was $30 million, that's purely
cyber. And then, there was $91 million on 2014 and prior. And there's going to be another
$10 million potentially of cyber in that figure. So potentially a third of the specialty lines
reserve release roughly came from cyber, Ben. In terms of opening loss picks, there is no
intention to change them. I think we've quite clear that we see potential for systemic
events in the cyber business and the fact you're getting strong reserve releases is, one of
the reasons for that is we haven't had any of those events yet.
So I don't think moving loss picks down if that's what direction you were thinking we might
go is something that we – who really got in our minds. I think we feel the loss picks are
appropriate. And as we said in the report and accounts, perhaps compared to history,
specialty lines reserve releases will show a little bit more variability going forward,
because the cyber account will have good years and less good years and that will flow
through in our reserve releases as we go forward. But we certainly think that the initial
reserves we're setting on cyber fit within our overall strategy of being conservative to
start with.

A - David Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We do open cyber (00:27:16) lower than the rest of specialty lines.

A - Martin Lindsay Bride

{BIO 15458196 <GO>}

In terms of the short tail opportunities, the gross is in line with rate. But we do also intend
to grow our catastrophe risk budget and we'll do that by buying slightly less reinsurance.
So we will be growing our net exposure against the background of better rates.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi, it's Kamran Hossain from RBC. Couple of questions back on cyber. Would it be
possible just to talk through your claims experience in 2017 versus 2016? Obviously, there
is a lot of kind of noise in the middle of the year about some margin (00:28:09) losses.
Secondly, in terms of, I guess, the profitability of cyber. It sounds like these things have
developed particularly well, would you consider keeping more of the business in-house
rather than seeing more of it (00:28:23) to the reinsurance market? And in terms of kind
of the dollar amounts of cyber reserves, do you have that number at hand (00:28:32)?

A - David Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

Sure. (00:28:33).

A - Martin Lindsay Bride

{BIO 15458196 <GO>}

We calculate the third one (00:28:33).

FINAL

A - Neil Patrick Maidment

{BIO 5232207 <GO>}

Exactly. So I think broadly the claims experience has been consistent 2017 over 2016.
There are changes as the products and the risk itself continues to evolve in terms of what
are the drivers of claims. So over the last 18 months, we have seen increasing amount of
ransomware type events. So the drivers of experience change, but the overall trend, I
think is in line with the growth of the business from an attritional point of view. What we
haven't experienced is the materialization of the catastrophe events that we planned for
and for which we're buying that reinsurance.
In terms of the reinsurance, most of what we're buying is excess of loss to protect for
those catastrophic events. And our intention would be to continue to do that, because our
board has set a risk budget for those extreme events and we need to buy reinsurance to
manage within that risk budget.

A - Martin Lindsay Bride

{BIO 15458196 <GO>}

I think on the last part, we have updated in the appendix of the presentation. We have
updated the cyber premium figures for you, so you should be able to model. As Neil has
said, we open cyber the same loss ratios are the short tail businesses. So it is around
between 55 and 60 (00:30:06). So you should be able to build a model of what we think
are – cyber reserves are from that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - David Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

Yeah, just three questions on cat, please. Would it be possible to breakdown the HEM
(00:30:32) losses from last year on a gross and net basis? Just to see how your
reinsurance program worked to absorb the gross part of the book? Also, on your
reserves again the 5% margin that is sort of left at the end of the year. What in there is
the actual cap margin that is left and that sort of feeds through into next year, please?
And finally, on property binder, just maybe comment on how the property binder book
behaved in the U.S. where the losses in that portfolio were in line with expectations and
so perhaps unexpectedly high? Thanks.

A - Neil Patrick Maidment

{BIO 5232207 <GO>}

So if I start with that, the binding authority book, I think has performed reasonably well.
Within our property division, the larger driver of loss activity was our open market, the
large risk business. The binding authority book under Paul Bromley's management we've
generally avoided writing pure catastrophe-driven binders, both through the Caribbean
and onshore in the U.S. we write some, but that strategy has limited the impact in the
binding authority, part of the account. In terms of utilized cat margin, we've used it. So
we're not carrying a lot into 2018 which accounts for Martin's comment, when one thinks
about the prospective reserve releases in 2018.
We're unlikely to see a great deal from the property and treaty divisions, because they've
used their 2017 cat margins this year, because we've actually experienced some real life
cat losses. And in terms of a breakdown, I don't think we're publishing a break down, but
I'm happy to talk to about how our gross net performance worked out.
Page 10 of 18



Company N ame: Beaz ley PL C

Broadly speaking, we experienced the number of – a series of losses that were within our
retention for our property insurance division, but for our reinsurance division that uses a
combination of proportional reinsurance and aggregate reinsurance. They got more
benefit from their reinsurance program this year.

FINAL

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Thanks. Thomas Seidl, Bernstein. First question is on cyber, you re-launched the data for
each product now covering first (00:33:02) I wonder if you could provide a little bit color
how you control your risk and what you're covering (00:33:08) there rate manufacturing?
So is this large manufacturing? Is it mid-sized manufacturing?
Secondly, last year we talked about the, political, accident and contingency business, it's
back to profits now, is this a profit level you think is what can be achievable or is there
more room to improve in this segment? And thirdly, commissions are up. Is this structural
or is it a one-off ?

A - Neil Patrick Maidment

Okay.

A - Neil Patrick Maidment

{BIO 5232207 <GO>}

Yeah. I was going to work in reverse again, because this is sort of easier. I think the last
point is mix and – so, there has been some upward pressure, I would say, in soft trading
conditions on brokerage, but largely it's the effect of mix in our portfolio. In terms of the
political, accident, and contingency division, the plan, I think is for to return to profitability.
Christian Tolle has brought together the Accident and former PCG businesses this year.
We discontinued our operations in Australia, which were a drag on the results. And I think
the prospects for that business sort of – are positive and in-line with the margin that we
are anticipating from the rest of the business going forward.

(00:34:36) comes to get back from all the 2016, 2015 levels. So it's at a low-ish level in
2017.

A - Neil Patrick Maidment

{BIO 5232207 <GO>}

And in terms of the cyber question, we've very positive about the development
prospects for the products, as the risk continues to develop. So I would say the big driver
for all the purchases of our cyber product to-date has been a data breach. So the people
who bought cyber insurance so far being natural customers of data breach insurance,
because they are a hospital or a retail or school has a lot of personally identifiable
information.

FINAL

Clearly, digital risk is a broader subject than that. And our team are evolving the product
to be more relevant to the people who haven't bought cyber insurance yet. And that
would include manufacturers for whom they have clearly have some personal identifiable
information, but it maybe that I'm more concerned about a physical damage loss and
business interruption consequent on that loss.
We haven't I think seen the materialization of a loss of physical damage events. There are
a number that have occurred. Stocksnet (00:36:00) would be an example, the Ukrainian
utilities would be an example. There was a fire in a factory in Germany, but they're quite
limited. But clearly, the potential does exist and with working in particular in the large risk
space with the co-venture with Munich Re to bring together what they know about
physical damage and business interruption with what we know about data breach and
other elements of cyber to design and sell a relevant product to those types of
customers.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Thanks. It's Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. A lot of questions. Well, I'll try to keep them
short. Just so I don't pester Martin next time, there is an event, just remind us on the
reinsurance ranges, the net – I think you mentioned net retention is $10 million on cyber,
but for the specialty (00:37:06) arrangements are on the reinsurance. And has that
changed? Specialty line's pricing, you didn't really talk, you talked about property and
reinsurance (00:37:15) what's happening in specialty lines pricing? My sense is it's going
(00:37:20) a little bit, but because the claims environment slightly trickier. Onshore U.S.,
onshore Europe, I can't find anywhere what the actual premium number is at the end of
the year for those divisions, it's quite hard to extricate. So this onshore Europe, I guess, is
very small still, but yeah...

A - David Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

Yes, we haven't got that, I mean, the U.S. number I think we were in the $778 million, which
is quoted in my CEO statement.

I guess, on onshore Europe, just give us a sense of the timing as to when we start to see
– your office is in place, but when you start see meaningful contribution in relation to that,
what's the early reception being around GDPR and potential increase penetration of
cyber? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Neil Patrick Maidment

{BIO 5232207 <GO>}

So the retention on the catastrophe program for specialized is $30 million. Specialized
pricing overall is flat. And...

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

It is flat now versus minus one (00:38:26) at the half year, I guess was it?

A - Neil Patrick Maidment

{BIO 5232207 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Neil Patrick Maidment

{BIO 5232207 <GO>}

Yeah. I think specialized itself is quite a diversified business. So there are areas of the
specialized world, management liability in the U.S. springs to mind is one where there's
been an increasing claim trend widely discussed publicly and that's putting some upward
(00:38:52) pressure on primary D&A (00:38:55) rates. There are areas like international
professional indemnity where most activities is likely to lead to some re-pricing as well,
but then that will be offset by other areas in the portfolio that are performing well, where
pricing might be under pressure, hence overall, broadly neutral pricing.
And in terms of GDPR, I think our view on GDPR is regulation will be at the back – or
insurance will be at the backend of people's responses to that regulation. And so, I don't
think we're necessarily expecting the market and demand for insurance for cyber
products dramatically escalate in the second quarter instantly with the impact of that
regulation. But what it does do is, raise at board level a very heightened interest in cyber
resilience and cybersecurity and I think inevitably will lead to increased demand for cyber
products in Europe.

A - Martin Lindsay Bride

{BIO 15458196 <GO>}

I think as far as onshore premiums generally are concerned, especially on the international
business, it's five-year plan, I mean, we would like to grow premiums from where they
currently are by some $400 million, $500 million. I assume the UK is not part of onshore
Europe to your question. I would say, the UK will definitely be an important part of that
growth and then onshore Europe would also be an important part. So perhaps a couple of
hundred million dollars, but we talked about GDPR, I think exactly where specialty lines
international premium growth come from is going to be dependent on things like how

markets such as cyber develop outside of the United States, so but certainly a meaningful
contribution over the next five years hopefully.

Q - Eamonn M. Flanagan

{BIO 14018002 <GO>}

It's Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital. Two questions, please. And you talk about the loss
– the cat loss in 2017 of between $200 million and $300 million and so what figure – was it
within the figures? And what swing factors should we watch during this year to view
whether that figure is too low or too high? And then, if you do have a minute just what
your thoughts and prospects of the new syndicate in 5623, the scale of the appetite, et
cetera?

A - David Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

(00:41:35) first question, because we have to put in a number that's the P&L, so the P&L
impact (00:41:40) $175 million, so I'm guessing...
(00:41:43)

Bloomberg Transcript

(00:41:45) range. So we're using the middle of the range for the $175 million. It will be
interesting to see, I mean, I think if we have a material movement away from it, you'll have
to see prior reserve releases come through, if it's down. So therefore Martin said about
reserve releases. He was actually seeing on the chart and if it's materially the other way
you will see prior reserve top-ups. So you will actually see it coming through their....

Q - Eamonn M. Flanagan

Maria or the wildfires or is it the whole...

No. I mean, we have exposure to all of the events. And I still think it's relatively early to
conclude which is why I was offering the range, but our reserve is based on the midpoint
of the range.

FINAL

A - David Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

Sorry, question (00:42:45) was...

Q - Eamonn M. Flanagan

{BIO 14018002 <GO>}

The likely prospects scale, size?

A - David Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

So it started small, so it's got a €30 million capacity to write premiums this year. It's seeing
whether it works, Eamonn, so we're trying to write facilities more cheaply than the
following market currently does, having a lower cost of capital building a sort of smart
cracker type portfolio, trying to take cost out of the whole placement of insurance. So let's
see whether it works. And if it works, I think, you can scale up to €0.5 billion and beyond
because if it works, there will be more and more facilities and it works and if it doesn't
work, it will scale down to nothing.

Q - Joanna T. Parsons

{BIO 1558226 <GO>}

Joanna Parsons from Stockdale. Couple of questions, if I may. You talk about looking for
positive momentum through 2018 albeit for the relatively cautious overtone, but could you
give us a feel for what you think might happen (00:43:48) renewals? You talked about the
IT investment which I know is an ongoing thing. But I felt reading the release that perhaps
you were suggesting that was going to be a kick up in that investment. Is that correct and
will that have any impact on the expense ratio? And obviously, there's a lot to talk about
ILS and companies having their own ILS arm. What's Beazley's long-term view on this?

A - Neil Patrick Maidment

{BIO 5232207 <GO>}

So (00:44:31) cat rights to January, as I said we were experiencing plus 6. Our plan
assumed plus 10 (00:44:42). So I think our expectation is the year is developing in line
broadly with our planning assumption quite a lot of loss affected business comes up in the
second quarter. So I mean, we're within tolerance with what we were anticipating within
the plan. On ILS, I think previously we've looked at that as whether we could develop
something that was complementary to our traditional reinsurance play. I think with the
development of the supportive regulations here in the London market we're revisiting
that analysis.

A - David Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

I think on IT investments, as we see things today, no, there's no investments we have in
mind that would sort of trouble the score, so to speak, in terms of our expense ratio. That
having been said, if we identified something that we felt it was important to invest
significantly and quickly. Then, I'm sure the board would be open to doing that, but as we

Page 15 of 18



Company N ame: Beaz ley PL C
Company Ticker: BEZ L N Equity
Date: 2018-02-08

see things today. Yes, there is investment going in there, but it's not going to make a
significant change to the – drive a significant change in expense ratio.

A - Martin Lindsay Bride

{BIO 15458196 <GO>}

FINAL

(00:46:05) we've already invested in IT over the number of years. We are expecting that
to hopefully reduce expense ratio. So thanks (00:46:13).

Q - Joanna T. Parsons

{BIO 1558226 <GO>}

(00:46:17) expense ratio.

A - Martin Lindsay Bride

{BIO 15458196 <GO>}

Exactly.

A - David Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

We should say, we did actually raise the IT budget, $5 million (00:46:25) last year and
(00:46:25) expense ratios, so we have managed to find savings elsewhere operationally.

Q - Joanna T. Parsons

{BIO 1558226 <GO>}

So done by £5 million (00:46:33).

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Nick Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Hi, there, it's Nick Johnson from Numis. Question on the growth outlook for double-digit
phraseology. You talk about potential secondary impact of the cat losses on unrated lines
such as marine and possibly large tickets, U.S. specialty. Just wanting to what extent those
sorts of developments might be factored into the double-digit guidance. So whether
those would be incremental positives, if they happen?

A - Neil Patrick Maidment

{BIO 5232207 <GO>}

The double-digit reference goes back to what I was saying in my presentation, Nick. We'd
been planning for 5% to 10% for several years. We've been achieving that recently. Thanks
to the opportunities that we have to grow specialty lines on top of that. Now we have the
short tail rates strengthening. So if we just add that on top of the specialty lines, that's
why we got a business plan of 10% if the market continues to evolve more positively then
that would be some top side, but our plan is at the top-end of that 5% to 10% range.

Q - David Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

(00:47:50) UBS. Quick one on the capital intensity of growth. How should we think about
that for 2018? You've given us the guidance, but I know, it moves around. I mean, I guess
historically last few years specialty has grown (00:48:05) next year should be more of a
mixed picture for growth, well spread, but a bit more cat in that potentially, so same or
down?

Page 16 of 18



Company N ame: Beaz ley PL C
Company Ticker: BEZ L N Equity
Date: 2018-02-08

Yeah. So I do think the right model is to suppose premiums and capital grow in line with
each other. I think you would break out of that if there are further catastrophes and
there's really a big push into catastrophe business then we would start to get greater by
those vacation benefits and that rule might be broken. But I think premiums and capital
growing together is the right assumption for you guys to have currently.

FINAL

Thanks.
Wendy's (00:48:47) Ed had his hand up for like, 20 minutes.

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Thanks. I think I sat on the wrong side of the room. Ed Morris from JPMorgan, a couple
questions. First is on investments. And (00:49:02) us some helpful guidance on what do
you think the investment return might be looking forward, based on where rates are
today. Also with the uptick in premium growth expectations, can you just give us an idea of
how you expect the investment portfolio to grow over time?
And second question, just briefly on reserves, you mentioned 2012 was a good indication
of what reserve releases might look like in a year where you enter with less cat margin in
the short tail classes and given that was slightly below where we were in 2012 in terms of
being at 5% versus sort of 6%, 7%, should there be an expectation that it will be any lower
or do you think that that is good benchmark?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - David Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

Yeah. So as far as investments are concerned, we are guiding for 2% investment yield this
year. This year is a sort of transitional year, so you've got potentially actually higher rates
on an ongoing basis from the core portfolio of the map, but then you've got to traverse
the period where rates are going up and creating mass market losses. So I think our
guidance remains 2% for this year, but potentially higher than that. If we stabilize with the
rate curve, U.S. rate curve, that's a bit higher than the current one.
As far as the investment portfolio is concerned in terms of its size, I mean, again, it should
grow with the top-line. As Neil said, we're growing all businesses. So I would expect the
balance sheet to grow at a similar right to the top-line. Then as far as the reserve releases
is concerned, I mean, I think the way you might want to think about modeling that is 1% of
that margin is $25 million. So if the margin is going to go up from 5% to 7%, for example
and I'm not saying that's what it's going to do, but were it to do that, then reserve
releases will be towards $50 million lower than normal is one way you could think about it.

Q - John A. Borgars

{BIO 15015364 <GO>}

John Borgars, Equity Development. I had two questions. One on reinsurance, if you add
back the reserve releases to reinsurance claim, only comes at 114% (00:51:27) which is far
lower than some of the U.S. reinsurance. Can I ask some guidance as to where your
geographical spread of (00:51:42) reinsurance is, which sounds more intelligent the
average U.S. insurer, but we like it (00:51:48) to be?

Page 17 of 18



Company N ame: Beaz ley PL C
Company Ticker: BEZ L N Equity
Date: 2018-02-08

The other one is very, a small detail. The unpaid premiums (00:51:55) has gone up to 20
weeks, is that a reflection of them making up for not getting the commission rate
increases to try to squeeze more profits or is it related to revising investment returns?

FINAL

A - Neil Patrick Maidment

{BIO 5232207 <GO>}

You take the second one and I'll take the (00:52:16) first one. The reinsurance portfolio is
broadly 50/50, so 50% U.S., 50% non-U.S. I think what's really helped the performance
this year is that active cycle management that I was talking about. So as rights have
reduced in catastrophe reinsurance in recent years, we've maintained our position in the
market, but bought an ever (00:52:44) increasing amount of reinsurance and that has
meant that we have much less at risk this year than we did four years ago.

Q - John A. Borgars

{BIO 15015364 <GO>}

Yeah. (00:52:57) growth.

A - David Andrew Horton

{BIO 5697110 <GO>}

Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Martin Lindsay Bride

{BIO 15458196 <GO>}

There have been no changes in sort of terms of trade and payment by (00:53:04), so
that's stable in terms of why our premiums receivable might have gone up. I mean there
might be a couple of effects such as reinstatement, premiums due. And we did right quite
a lot of business in the last couple of months of the year off the back of the hardening
short-term markets, but there's really been no change in payment terms or the efficacy of
payment by brokers.
