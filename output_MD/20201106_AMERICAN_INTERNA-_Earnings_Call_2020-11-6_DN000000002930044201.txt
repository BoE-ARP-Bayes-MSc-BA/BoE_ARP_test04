Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Given the announcements we made
last week, we will handle today's call differently with the objective to leave as much time
as possible for your questions. I will focus most of my remarks on our leadership changes
and the separation of Life and Retirement. Peter will expand on what the separation
process will entail. He will provide an overview of our third quarter results for General
Insurance and Life and Retirement, and give an update on AIG 200. Lastly, Mark will
provide additional color on our financial results for the quarter. Kevin Hogan, Dave
McElroy, Doug Dachille will be available for the Q&A portion of the call.
As you saw in our earnings release, AIG continues to manage through the ongoing global
economic uncertainty. We're financially strong and well positioned to capitalize on the
opportunities for growth. In the third quarter, we reported adjusted after-tax income of
$0.81 per common share, and we saw improvement in both the accident year combined
ratio in General Insurance, and Life and Retirement's adjusted return on attributed
common equity.
As we announced last week, the AIG Board unanimously elected Peter to become the
next Chief Executive Officer of AIG, effective March 1. At that time, I will assume -- I will
become Executive Chairman of the AIG Board. This leadership transition demonstrates
our continued momentum and focus on AIGs future. It's an honor to serve as the CEO of
AIG, and I want to thank our directors for their ongoing support.
I also want to congratulate Peter. I worked with Peter in several capacities for many years,
and I'm extremely proud of him and the legacy he is building in our industry. He is joining
me at AIG in 2017. He designed and executed on the turnaround in our General Insurance
business, which by any measure has been historic. I greatly admire Peter's strength of
character, leadership abilities, and willingness to take decisive action. He has a proven
track record of building great teams and successfully leading them in times of significant
change and growth. Peter exemplifies the rare executives who is both a hard working
operational leader,and a strategic visionary. I know that he will be an excellent CEO for
AIG, and the company will be in great hands.

Turning to our second big announcement last week. As I stated before, we have
continually examined the composite structure of AIG, and over the last several months,
with the assistance from independent financial and legal advisors, we conducted a very
comprehensive review to determine if a change would be in the best interest of our
shareholders and other stakeholders. This review included examining strategic,
operational, capital and tax implications, and the output of this review was very clear that
is a simpler structure will benefit both GI and L&R. This is largely due to the significant
foundational work our team has done across AIG to strengthen our businesses and
position them as market leaders.
In addition, impediments to separation have existed back in 2017 have greatly diminished.
For example, the tax benefits of AIG's current composite structure have decreased over
time, and with a stronger capitalization of our core business, the capital diversification
benefit has become less significant. We believe our businesses will be more resilient as a
separate companies, with more appropriate and sustainable valuation, and each will
continue to be market leaders in their respective sectors, with strong balance sheets,
appropriate capital structures, attractive earnings, and cash flows.

Bloomberg Transcript

We also believe both will have sufficient financial flexibility to compete effectively. We do
not anticipate that either will require additional capital -- equity capital in connection with
the separation, and neither will be over-leverage especially when compared to their
respective peers. We've evaluated various structural alternatives for the separation, and
Peter will provide details on our initial conclusions. All the separation process will be
complex and will of course require regulatory approvals.
We are confident that we will execute in a way that provides the best long-term value for
shareholders and other stakeholders. We are committed to transparency and providing
you with updates as the process moves forward.
Now, I'll turn it over to Peter.

Peter Zaffino

{BIO 15942020 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Brian. I appreciate your kind words and want to
thank the AIG Board for the opportunity to lead this company. As Brian noted, we are
living through a sustained period of global economic challenges. At AIG, we are well
prepared as our purpose is to partner with our clients, especially during challenging times
to help them solve complex risk issues, capture opportunities in all market cycles, and
provide a consistent approach to providing insurance solutions in this period of
uncertainty. We continually ask ourselves what are the things that worked well yesterday,
we'll continue to work tomorrow and into the future.
This morning I will expand on Brian's comments regarding key areas we're focused on. I'll
start with additional insight into our plan to separate Life and Retirement from AIG, then I'll
provide an overview of the third quarter results for General Insurance and Life and
Retirement, and lastly, I'll briefly outline our progress on AIG 200.

With respect to Life and Retirement as Brian said, we undertook a comprehensive review
of our composite structure over the last several months. We concluded that over time the
value of full separation can create for our shareholders will be significantly greater than
maintaining our current structure. Our analysis took into account many factors, including
potential impediments and benefits. Among the more significant factors are: one, the
progress we've made since late 2017 to strengthen the foundation of General Insurance,
materially reduce risk and volatility in our portfolio, and position General Insurance as a
market leader poised for sustainable profitable growth. A separation of Life Retirement
from AIG would not be possible without a strong General Insurance business that can
support itself and drive on a stand-alone basis.
Two, we believe that we can effectively manage any loss of diversification benefits in our
capital model as a result of separation. Our current expectation is that no additional equity
capital will be required given the improvements in our subsidiary capital positions over the
last three years. This is especially true in General Insurance with the capital base is
stronger than it's been in many years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Three, the separation process will require us to implement a standalone capital structure
for Life and Retirement. This will involve raising new debt at Life and Retirement and
restructuring debt at AIG Parent. In the end, both companies will have independent capital
structures in line with peers and appropriate financial leverage for their respective ratings.
Both companies will also have strong financial flexibility to execute on their strategic
priorities.
Four, AIG deferred tax asset is no longer an obstacle as it was in the past. With DTA, it is
made up of net operating loss carry forwards and foreign tax credits. With respect to the
net operating losses, we expect AIG to have taxable income post separation that is
sufficient to utilize remaining $6.6 billion before they expire. The foreign tax credit carry
forwards have been significantly utilized in recent years, and we expect to utilize the vast
majority of the remaining $1.5 billion before we deconsolidate Life and Retirement, leaving
only a small portion potentially at risk.
And five, there is a limited number of legal entity restructurings required to achieve the
separation, as well as limited expense dis-synergies. In fact, we will leverage the
important work we're doing as part of AIG 200 to facilitate operational separation. While
the precise former separation will be subject to AIG Board and regulatory approvals,
rating agency considerations and market conditions, we currently contemplate either an
IPO or private sale of up to 19.9% of Life and Retirement, followed by one or more
dispositions of our remaining ownership interest over time. We're proceeding with the
sense of urgency to determine the initial step of a separation, and we'll continue to
engage with regulators and rating agencies throughout the process.
Finally, we do not intend to break up Life and Retirement and sell it in pieces as a
significant strength of the business is the breadth of its platform and diversified product
portfolio and distribution network. Throughout the separation process, we will remain
laser focused on continuing to position our businesses to deliver superior value to our
clients, distribution partners, shareholders and other stakeholders.

Turning to our third quarter. In General Insurance, we achieved another quarter of positive
results in our core business. We've continued improvement in our underwriting margins.
The accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophe improved by 260 basis points to
93.3% compared to 95.9% a year ago, and by 610 basis points compared to 99.4% in the
third quarter of 2018. The improvement was driven by our commercial business, which
improved by approximately 560 basis points year-over-year as a result of lower accident
year loss ratio, excluding CAT and a lower expense ratio. The lower commercial accident
year loss ratio ex-CAT reflects the higher quality book of business, driven by a better mix
and portfolio management actions.
In Personal Insurance, not surprisingly, our portfolio mix continues to be impacted by
COVID-19, which has reduced premium volumes by more than 80% in our travel business
alone. The mix of business was further impacted in North America Personal Insurance due
to the reinsurance cessions related to syndicate 2019.

Bloomberg Transcript

With respect to CAT, third quarter was very active, with low to moderate severity per
event in both North America and Japan, with an upper industry range of $45 billion
globally. As we disclosed last week, our third quarter CAT loss estimates, net of
reinsurance, totaled $790 million for the quarter. Included in this CAT number is $185
million of COVID-19 loss estimates. With respect to COVID-19, the loss estimates primarily
related to travel, contingency and Validus Re.
Our year-to-date COVID related net loss estimates are slightly over $900 million. Our
reinsurance program continues to perform as expected, with recoveries in our
international per occurrence, private client group per occurrence, and other discrete
reinsurance programs limiting volatility. Regardless of frequency and severity of natural
CATs, in addition of COVID-19-related losses, we expect overall CAT losses for the
remainder of the year to be limited due to various protections we have in place under our
aggregate CAT covers.
Turning to rate, in the third quarter, our underwriting discipline continued as our team has
pivoted to pursue premium growth, while not losing our focus on a CAT level decisions,
risk adjusted rates and margin expansion. In commercial, there is continued momentum in
our portfolio optimization strategy, and we're seeing sustained rate on rate improvement
across most lines of business. For the third quarter, our Commercial business had rate
increases of approximately 17%. North America commercial rate increases were 20% in
the third quarter, compared to 12% in the prior year. Rate increases in admitted property
were over 30%; in financial lines, they were over 25% led by D&O; in excess and surplus
lines, they were over 20%; and in excess casualty, they were over 30%.
International commercial rate increases were 14% in the third quarter compared to 8% in
the prior year, driven by financial lines in specialty. Rate increases in commercial property
was 12%; in financial lines, they were over 20% led by D&O; and in UK specialty, they were
over 25% led by energy, aviation and trade credit. It's important to note that the rates
we're achieving are on a policy year basis and will take time to earn into our action year
results. Additionally, we're confident that the rate increases we are achieving are
outpacing loss cost increases in our portfolio.

FINAL

Turning to Validus Re, an upcoming 1/1 renewals, our team continues to be disciplined in
deploying capacity and focused on acceptable terms of conditions, as well as appropriate
risk adjusted rate changes. Double-digit rate increases are being quoted in most lines
with tighter terms and conditions. Retro business is very active, with meaningful doubledigit rate increases being quoted, with terms altering to model perils-only with the current
covers being preferred over aggregate covers.
Before turning to Life and Retirement, I want to provide context for how we view the rate
environment in the P&C market. Insurance carriers have faced challenging business
conditions for more than a decade. Soft market conditions have gripped the industry since
2007 and had been coupled with historically low interest rates, and an increase in
frequency and severity of natural catastrophes. As an example, we're looking at property,
the expected agri industry natural CAT losses for 2017 through the third quarter 2020 are
estimated to exceed $400 billion, median annual losses over the last 15 years have been
approximately $65 billion. These amounts are nearly double the amount of expected loss.
For natural catastrophes, pricing has adjusted in light of these new norms. And keep in
mind, none of these numbers include catastrophe losses from COVID-19.
With these challenges and the increasingly complex environment our clients are looking to
us to help them manage the work we do is becoming more complex. We believe our
retention rates demonstrate the strength of our relationships with clients and distribution
partners, and confirm that a flight to quality has, in fact, on the provision, particularly due
to COVID. The momentum we have generated in General Insurance is significant, and we
believe that we will achieve top line growth in 2021, and by the end of 2022, we'll achieve
an accident year combined ratio, excluding CATs, below 90%. This will represent a 1,000
basis point improvement since 2018.
Turning to Life and Retirement. I've spent the last couple of months working with Kevin
and his team to analyze this business. It is a franchise that is extremely well positioned in
the market. It has a track record of delivering consistent performance. Third quarter
adjusted pre-tax income was $975 million, and adjusted return on attributed common
equity was 14.5%. Third quarter results reflected strong performance in all lines of
business, driven by recovering sales and strong equity market levels resulting in favorable
impacts to deferred acquisition costs and variable annuity reserves, as well as higher
private equity returns.
Additionally, lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads drove higher call and tender
income, which is a short-term benefit that will be offset in the long-term in the form of
additional base spread compression. The sensitivities Kevin previously discussed
generally held up, recognizing the limits of sensitivities, especially in times of
macroeconomic stress and high levels of volatility.
As we noted in the second quarter, reported base investment spread compression has
been impacted by substantially lower returns on our tactical cash and short-term
investment position. Excluding this impact, base investment spreads would continue to be
in the 8 to 16 basis points range of annual spread compression. Excluding estimated
COVID-19-related deaths, mortality experience was favorable and consistent with prepandemic trends. Risk management efforts and discipline in Life and Retirement have
Page 6 of 22

FINAL

continued to serve this business well. The hedge program has performed as expected
and our balance sheet remains strong.
Additionally, we view our lack of large legacy blocks, such as long-term care, as a risk
differentiator. As expected, retail annuity sales rebounded significantly from the historically
low second quarter levels as our distribution partners became more customed to a new
working environment. We also grew sales and group retirement and institutional markets
where we successfully issued three large guaranteed investment contracts during the
third quarter. Our total premiums and deposits decreased from second quarter levels,
and we remain well positioned and confident to deploy capital as attractive opportunities
arise across our business.

Now let me provide a brief update on AIG 200. Since we announced AIG 200 in 2019, we
have been focused on investing in our core processes and infrastructure in order to be
more competitive in the marketplace and make real transformational change at AIG. A
few key points I'd like to highlight.
We are on track to deliver and will likely exceed our original guidance of $300 million exit
run rate savings this year. We also expect to come in below the $350 million cost to
achieve that we initially communicated for 2020. An important milestone we recently
achieved was entering into a partnership with Accenture, whereby Accenture will acquire
our existing shared services footprint. Working with the AIG global operations team,
Accenture will help us to create a modern digital shared services platform, with true endto-end processes that will improve the user experience. This agreement is subject to
regulatory approvals and march the first phase of our overall relationship with Accenture,
which we expect will expand over time.
Our overall targets for AIG 200 remain unchanged. We still expect to deliver $1 billion of
run rate savings by the end of 2022 against the $1.3 billion total investment. Lastly, we do
not anticipate any delays or significant changes due to the planned separation of Life and
Retirement.
Before I turn it over to Mark, I'd like to end my remarks where I started, and thank Brian for
his leadership over the last three years. Since I joined Brian in mid 2017, we have navigated
truly unprecedented conditions. Throughout, Brian has remained steadfast in his
commitment to build a world of leading insurance franchise, with no shortcuts or quick
fixes. I'm incredibly proud of what we achieved so far in our journey.
Our colleagues have demonstrated unmatched resilience and a commitment to
excellence, and all that they do despite the significant disruption we've all experienced,
full personally and professionally, due to COVID-19. I know I speak on behalf of all AIG
colleagues when I say that we look forward to continuing to work with Brian as we close
out 2020 and look ahead to a very bright future for our company.
Now I will turn it over to Mark.

FINAL

Thank you, Peter, and good morning everyone. As Brian and Peter have already
commented on the announced separation of the Life and Retirement business from AIG, I
will briefly discuss the third quarter results in order to allow sufficient time for Q&A.
AIG reported adjusted pre-tax income or APTI of $918 million, and adjusted after-tax
income of $709 million or $0.81 per diluted share compared to $505 million or $0.56 per
share in the third quarter of 2019. The key drivers of this increased earnings were: one, a
general insurance underwriting gain, exclusive of the impact of catastrophes and prior
year development, which improved $135 million compared to the third quarter of '19.
Second, a very strong Life and Retirement results, inclusive of the impact of the annual
actuarial assumption update. Third, solid net investment income results, up $271 million
after adjusting the third quarter of 2019 for Fortitude, reflecting higher private-equity and
hedge fund income in addition to fixed maturity securities. Fourth, reduced total AIG
general operating expenses by approximately $200 million.
Turning to General Insurance. Third quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $416 million,
down $91 million from the third quarter of 2019, due primarily to the previously announced
catastrophe losses of $790 million pre-tax, partially offset by higher net investment
income stemming from alternatives. As respect to prior year development, $16.1 billion of
reserves were carried -- excuse me, were reviewed this quarter, bringing the year-to-date
total reviews to more than 60% of carried reserves. The net result was unfavorable
development of $13 million, which reflects $53 million of favorable development from
amortization of the ADC deferred gain, so the unfavorable development was $66 million
growth of this amortization impact. The areas reviewed were primary workers
compensation, environmental, program businesses, western world, cyber, personal lines,
property casualty, Canada and UK, Europe and Asia-Pacific casualty and financial lines, as
well as European short-tailed lines.
Next quarter's focus will be our US financial lines and some casualty areas. This quarter's
PYD showed favorable development in North America, driven mostly by primary workers
compensation, a California 2017 wildfire, subro and short-tailed lines, and unfavorable
developments internationally, driven mostly by financial lines, large losses, and UK and
Europe Casualty, mostly in prior accident years.
As Peter mentioned, the General Insurance business has continued to improve with an
accident year combined ratio as adjusted of 93.3% in the quarter, a 260 basis point
improvement from last year. North America was 96%, 250 basis points better than last
year, while North American commercial lines was 630 basis points better than the prior
year. 560 basis points of which emanated from the approved loss ratio.
International improved the accident year combined ratio as adjusted by 240 basis points
to 91%, with international commercial lines better by 410 basis points, with 170 basis points
of this emanating from an approved loss ratio. The global expense ratio was 180 basis
points lower quarter-over-quarter, driven by an improved acquisition ratio. The General
Insurance also reduced their GOE by $76 million. The margin momentum in commercial
lines reflects the hard work of the past several years, with the added tailwinds of achieved
Page 8 of 22

FINAL

rate in 2020 above our initial expectations, both will drive a margin improvement through
2021.
I would also note that on a global basis, Personal Insurance results are not really
comparable to last year due to the significant drop in travel business, the formation of
Syndicate 2019 for North American PCG business discussed last quarter, and higher North
American catastrophes including the COVID impact on the travel book. International
personal insurance accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, improved by 80 basis
points, with favorable frequency in Japanese auto at a lower expense ratio.
North American Personal Lines accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, was significantly
higher to 118.6% due to the approximate 60% drop in net earned premiums from the
segment, led by travels nearly 80% reduction, as well as the noise associated with the
changes to PCG that was discussed on our prior call. Warranty, personal A&H, and
Canadian personal lines, all continue to perform well.

Bloomberg Transcript

With the commercial lines re-underwriting largely behind us, we are now pivoting to
growth, which will become evident in early 2021 as near-term top line results are still
impacted by personal insurance. Global gross premiums written were $8.3 billion in the
quarter, down approximately 4% before the impact of currency and net premiums written
and earned were both down approximately 11%, principally due to personal insurance, as
well as the impact of reinsurance and portfolio management on the North American
commercial lines book.
In North America commercial, net premiums written decreased by approximately 5%,
reflecting the impact of reinsurance as stated, portfolio management actions in COVID,
but retention and new business levels have improved the specific areas, for instance. Our
Lexington property business grew by 20% year-over-year as a result of increased flow,
continued rate increases, and new business momentum.
International commercial's net premiums written increased by approximately 5%,
reflecting significant rate momentum and growth in financial lines specialty in Talbot. North
America personal insurance net premiums written was impacted by business mix shift due
to the lower travel premiums, and the changes to PCG. As we enter 2021, we will retain
approximately 25% of the PCG business, and the syndicate structure will reduce the
volatility of the overall personal lines book as was the case this quarter.
International personal insurance net premiums written were down 10% on a constant
dollar basis, principally because of the reduction in travel premium. Aside from travel,
most of the international personal insurances in Japan, which had a slight decrease in
premiums due to lower new business, also was the result of COVID.
Now turning to Life and Retirement. Adjusted pre-tax income was $975 million for the
quarter, up over 50% compared to the prior year, with strong performance in most
businesses. Third quarter adjusted return on attributed common equity was 14.5% as
Peter noted, and 12% on a year-to-date basis. Also, as Peter mentioned, Life and
Retirement's retail annuity sales rebounded significantly from historically low second
Page 9 of 22

FINAL

quarter levels. Sequentially, fixed annuities were up 144% to $942 million from the second
quarter, low of $387 million. Variable annuities were up 44% to $670 million [ph] and
indexed annuities were up 38% to $942 million. Life and Retirement also grew sales
modestly in group retirement, and in institutional markets, some of our guaranteed
investment contracts were issued during the quarter, totaling approximately $1.2 billion.
Total premiums and deposits increased from second quarter levels, and net flows,
although still negative, having material rebound sequentially of over $612 million for fixed
annuities and fixed index annuity flow.

Bloomberg Transcript

The balance sheet remains strong with a solid investment portfolio, with limited exposure
to large legacy blocks on the liability side, such as long-term care, pre-financial crisis
variable annuities or long duration payout annuities. While low interest rates in the last
year will drive additional spread compression, the diversity of our product portfolio is a
strength in this environment. Our annual actuarial assumption update which lowered our
10-year forward 10-year treasury assumption to approximately 2.8% from 3.5% previously
will generally benign as we also updated our lapse, mortality and policyholder behavior
assumptions, resulting in an unfavorable impact of $120 million to adjusted pre-tax income
and a net unfavorable impact of $42 million to pre-tax net income, mostly from revised
lapse and policyholder assumptions.
Shifting to investments. Net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.2 billion or $277
million lower than the third quarter of 2019. As a reminder, due to the sale of Fortitude,
the prior year included the full quarter income on the Fortitude portfolio, whereas it is
excluded on an APTI basis this quarter. Adjusting the third quarter of last year's net
investment income accordingly, this quarter's net investment income on an APTI basis
actually grew $271 million compared to the prior year, reflecting stronger income on both
hedge funds and private equity.
Turning to other operations. The adjusted pre-tax loss after consolidations, eliminations
was $562 million, $62 million higher than the third quarter of 2019, principally due to
additional interest expense from our May 2020 issuance of $4.1 billion of senior notes to
pre-fund upcoming maturities. Current and service company GOE declined $50 million
pre-tax, reflecting AIG's continued focus on expense reduction. Our legacy segment,
where adjusted pretax income no longer reflects Fortitude at $89 million of APTI in the
quarter, slightly down compared to the third quarter of 2019, due to lower income as a
result of Fortitude sale, offset by higher gains on fair value option portfolios within the
legacy investments. Legacy results also reflected a favorable impact of $13 million related
to the annual actuarial assumption update.
Now turning to the balance sheet. At September 30, 2020, book value per common
share was $73.86, down 1% from the prior year-end, but up 3% from June 2020. Adjusted
book value per share, which excludes AOCI and DTA, and net cumulative unrealized gains
on the Fortitude funds withheld assets, was $56.78 per share, up 2% sequentially from
June 30.

FINAL

At September 30, AIG Parent had cash and short-term liquidity assets of $10.7 billion after
third quarter dividends of holding company expenses, as well as the August debt maturity
of $638 million. Looking into next quarter, we expect to pay the balance of the IRS tax
settlement on cross-border transactions that date back to the 1990s.
During the second quarter, we had prepaid approximately $548 million related to principal
and penalties. We recently settled the litigation associated with that case and are awaiting
potentially by year-end the final interest calculation from the IRS. We have requested
interest netting which may lower the total amount below our remaining settlement
estimate, which we have accrued at $1.2 billion. As for debt leverage, we reduce that ratio
by approximately 100 basis points in the third quarter, driven by maturing debt, which had
been prefunded and growth in retained earnings.
Finally, our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized despite
the continuing impact of low rates, credit experience in COVID. For General Insurance, we
estimate the US pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the third quarter to be between
430% and 440%, and Life and Retirement is estimated to be between 410% and 420%,
both above our target ranges, and both providing a good buffer for the uncertainty of the
current environment.
With that, I will now turn it back over to Brian.

Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, Peter, is going back to your comments on Life
and Retirement. You mentioned the option for the separation will be in IPO or hybrid
sales? But then in reference to Board, it sounds like you mentioned 19.9%. So I guess, I'm
confused on what a private sale? Could you go down the route of a private sale of 19.9%
is L&R with subsequent sales after that. If I can just get some clarity on that comment,
please?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Peter, go ahead, and take that please.

FINAL

Thanks, Elyse. Good morning. Yes, the 19.9% was referencing to the IPO. And we said that
there could be -- we can't predict the future, but there could be an approach for a private
sale, but it would be for the same percentage, the 19.9% or less, that we would not
consider anything that would be above that. So I would think about whether it's the IPO or
in the event if something came from a private party that it would be the 19.9% or less as
an initial first step.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then on -- so if it was 19.9% to a private party, I guess then which is we looking
for subsequent sales down the road. Is there a time frame if it was a private seller gets
the IPO for the -- as you think of the 19.9% option for -- for the full disposition of L&R.

Go ahead, Peter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Yeah, so really the timeline, at least, I'd think like whether we pursue a minority IPO
or sale, we're going to make that decision in the near-term and we'd like to communicate
that properly. I mean, the ultimate closing of an IPO or sale will depend on regulatory or
other required approvals, and we like to think we can close on the first step of separation
in 2021, but of course, we'll have to see how the process unfolds.

A - Brian Duperreault

ahead.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you very much. So the first question was the general guidance around
growing premium volumes next year. Is that exclusive of what happens with travel and
accident premiums?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, I think, that's Peter's question. Peter?

A - Peter Zaffino

{BIO 15942020 <GO>}

Thanks Josh. It was not exclusive. I mean, we believe that we can grow the top line for
General Insurance even in those conditions where we would have a prolonged headwind
and travel, but we think that we can grow the top line without caveats.

FINAL

And for those who looked at the third quarter liability, premium numbers down in the lowdouble digit range given where pricing is. Does [ph] that gives them concerns about your
appetite for liability business assets price. You've obviously run a lot of liabilities business
for the last couple of years. How does that reflect on your confidence on the last couple
of years of books in the attractiveness of writing liability business on-- in November 2020?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Go ahead, Peter.

A - Peter Zaffino

{BIO 15942020 <GO>}

Well, we've been doing re-underwriting of the liability lines for a couple of years now. And
so, we've seen the shift in the portfolio in a very positive way. I think what you'll see on the
net premium written is just a lot of reinsurance cessions just because we put in excess of
loss and quota share. In this particular year, we had even more cessions on the quota
share, but we feel very good about the way in which we are positioned in that portfolio.
We do think that we can grow that portfolio on the top line, and the rate on rate increases
that we're getting in the casualty and liability lines are meaningful, and we believe our
above loss cost. So I wouldn't read into it. I would say that it's part of the remediation, it's
part of reinsurance, and we think that we are in a position to grow it.

Q - Joshua Shanker

Would you care to share an idea about the gross written premium growth in liability,
whether it was much less than down low double digits?

A - Peter Zaffino

I wouldn't. It's the same comment. I think we can grow the top line on a gross basis as
well.

FINAL

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks. Peter, (inaudible) the guidance with respect to the below 90 underlying
combined ratio, and I assume that's kind of run rate that you go out end of 2022. How do
we going to think about that expense ratio kind of loss ratio as you kind of think about it?
How much is going to be AIG 200 related?

A - Sabra Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

Go ahead, Brian -- go ahead, Peter.

A - Peter Zaffino

{BIO 15942020 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. It's end 2022 run rate, and we just thought about as we start to exit 2022. But I think
all of the variables will contribute to the improved combined ratio. So I gave you some
guidance on -- in my prepared remarks on AIG 200. So we remain committed to the $1
billion, and so we'll recognize $300 million of that as an exit run rate this year. So you
could think about a couple of hundred basis points contributing to expense improvement
during that period of time. We feel very good about the opportunity to grow the top line.
And so, we will start to see top line growth, which will help the ratios.
We think we will have a revised reinsurance program that will reflect the portfolio that we
have today. And so, the best re-underwriting to pivot to where we are today, we will have
a different reinsurance structure going forward, and we will likely not need quite as much.
And then the last piece is just the rate increases above loss cost will start to earn into the
portfolio. And so, I think, all of those four variables will contribute to an improved
combined ratio below the 90s.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

So, I think, Paul, the question was use of proceeds from the IPO. I think I got that right. And
if that's the case, Mark, would you take that question?

FINAL

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Sure, and hi, Paul. Thanks for the question. Well, our primary focus for the proceeds from
any initial disposition will be to reduce AIG's debt leverage, but we'll continuously review
the best use of our capital, which certainly include share repurchases and acting
accordingly based upon those priorities.

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Paul, was there another part of the question, because you were a little unclear in my
audio?

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

No, I mean, I was, like, with the focus on it, but maybe if you could just further that in terms
of your debt leverage for synergies. I mean, my sense was, (inaudible) pre funded all of
this debt leverage. So I guess, a little bit surprised that there is more to do.

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Okay. Mark, can you take that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Sure, sure. So we talked about that Paul also. AIG clearly has strong liquidity that was
bolstered by the $4.1 billion cap rates we did in May of this year that attractively prefunded those forthcoming maturities, and provided liquidity from a risk management
perspective. But the near-term capital management strategy remains focused now on
reducing our debt level to leverage ratios, and executing on this separation with Life and
Retirement from AIG. So -- but as previously notably though, we have upcoming
obligations associated with that liquidity of roughly $3.5 billion.
So we've got the tax settlement that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that could be
up to $1 billion to $2 billion and we have maturing debt that we did pre-fund which pushed
up the leverage ratio knowingly, but we know that's coming due and its $700 million range
in fourth quarter and $1.5 billion by March of 2021. So we really have -- those priorities are
right in front of us.

A - Brian Duperreault

Q - Thomas Gallagher

{BIO 3311667 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning. Peter, you mentioned that you don't intend to break up the life insurance
business and sell it often pieces. I guess, my question is, we've seen some recent
indications in the market that private values are potentially double that of current public
market values of life insurers. Have you taken that into consideration and still concluded
your path is the best one for shareholders?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

I want to take that one, and Peter can add to it. I think, you just have to understand that
when we look at our Life business, we believe the ongoing strength of it is the breadth of
the platforms, unequal product and distribution, we've got leading market positions, and
there's a lot of cross-unit synergies. So the integrated platform we believe provides the
kind of knowledge and expertise and stability, and that's more valuable together than in
pieces. And so, we've cleaned it up. We've done a lot of derisking, but L&R really is a
beautiful machine where these things all interact. So we believe that some of the parts is
definitely greater. Well, I mean the whole is greater than each of the parts, say it, great
way. I hope that helps, Tom. Peter, do you want to add anything to that?

A - Peter Zaffino

{BIO 15942020 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, I think, between my prepared remarks and your comments, Brian, we did look at
many alternatives and just believe that the consistent performance that Life and
Retirement has produced, added structured is going to create the most shareholder
value keeping it together.

Q - Thomas Gallagher

{BIO 3311667 <GO>}

I appreciate that guys. Just my follow up is, back in 2016, there was an estimate of capital
diversification breakage of over $5 billion. It sounds like that's a lot less now. Is there still
some dis-synergy, non capital diversification, and if so, could you quantify it?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, I guess, I'm going to turn that one, Tom, to Mark. Mark, can you just take us through
that?

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Sure, sure. So Tom, 2015 is quite a while ago. And as you know, there's been massive
changes to the portfolio, pretty much across the Board. So I mean, when you think about
it, not only from 2015, but when Brian arrived in 2017, you've got a targeted risk reduction
progress that really went across the Board and we revamped risk appetite, no matter of
how you looked at it. So that's been successfully implemented on both sides of the
balance sheet, and involve the Parent and FGI, and Life and Retirement, and Investments.
And the operating subsidiary RBC and risk-based capital is strong for both GI and for L&R
and the volatility in total and within each of those operations is clearly been markedly
reduced.

Page 16 of 22



FINAL

Company N ame: American I nternational Group I nc
Company Ticker: AI G US Equity
Date: 2020-11-06

So -- and just as a -- and a little bit of a remembrance, so you see exactly the kind of risk
reduction which involves all the things you asked about. So the investment derisking, the
Fortitude transaction which we went into greater [ph] sale moving not only $35 billion of
reserves, $31 billion of which is on Life and Retirement and $4 billion plus on GI. But it's
also what constitutes those reserves. So when you look under the covers and you see a
lot of structured settlement reserves, and a lot of single premium immediate annuity
reserves, those are clearly loaded with interest rate risk. So now that type of volatility and
that kind of issue has now been pushed off as well.
We have the ADC that we've put into place with General Insurance, but still has $6.4 billion
unused, representing 80% session. The underwriting change to the book that has been
massive, both on the front end and at a proper reinsurance structure to protect it that
Peter has always talked about. Consequence, the PML have gone down enormously. The
marketplace taking advantage of that with improved earnings by driving compound rate,
and improved terms and conditions, but trimming the portfolio the right way, not just
renewing books of business but getting into classes and things doing it properly.
And not only on that, we've got the -- where we kind of referenced earlier, which was the
debt rates that we had that allowed us to have you risk management, liquidity risk
management capability in slight of the pre-funding of those maturing debt security. So I
think, all in, we've got a lot of strength in earnings, a lot of strength in -- of lesser volatility
around those earnings, and there is certainly a reduction of all those things combined.

Q - Thomas Gallagher

{BIO 3311667 <GO>}

Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning everybody. My first question goes with the financial leverage
commentary around separation. It sounds like you're comfortable and confident in the
leverage (inaudible) by those entities after separations. Today, I think, the leverage is little
bit higher than where the Life and P&C groups are at. So I guess, if I try to connect the
dots there, is that one you're talking about is 19.9% sale at first to potentially fund some of
that decrease leverage, and then you consider some of the rest?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Well, look, since you brought up the 19%, I would have given us to Mark. But Peter, you
might want to comment on 19.9% first, and then maybe Mark can go into the leverage
question.

A - Peter Zaffino

{BIO 15942020 <GO>}

Thanks, Yaron [ph] largely in my script, which is the 19.9% does preserve the foreign tax
credits, and that's a meaningful number today but we will earn out of that. But I think,
Mark, I don't know if you want to go in a little bit deeper as to the deconsolidation issues?

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Yeah, well, as Peter said, the 19.9% certainly, because you still consolidate. So you still
continue to reap the benefits as he has noted, which is why it's important, number one.
And number two is, the shrinkage of that, because consumption of that has really been
pretty evident over the older years till to where we are now. And with L&R and GI,
because think about, Yaron, L&R have really been the consumer of the DTA, especially on
the FTC, that's deferred tax credit side. But now you have two strong platforms with a lot
of great prospects on a go-forward basis where both can use it, both can consume that.
So I think that's important.
Now getting back to the structure, both -- all the AIG subsidiaries really are strongly
capitalized today, and we do anticipate though that each of the General Insurance and
Life and Retirement businesses will maintain strong RBC levels, and will have a leverage
ratio which is consistent with the respective peers and brands [ph] and we will be working
closely with our regulators and rating agencies as Peter referenced throughout this
process to validate, Yaron, our analysis. And our intention is to remain at or above our
target ratings of these operating subsidiaries. So we believe as separate organizations,
both will have sufficient financial flexibility to compete effectively as we generate returns
above their individual cost of capital. So, again, to reiterate, at this time with all in, we do
not anticipate the need for additional equity capital in either business as part of the
separations.

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Thank you, Mark.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

That's helpful. And then my second question, with regards to the guidance for 2022,
combined ratio has been below 90%. And I think, Peter, you may have touched on this
with your answer to Josh earlier. Do you need further rate momentum still to achieve that?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Peter, what do you think?

A - Peter Zaffino

{BIO 15942020 <GO>}

In the current rate environment?

Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up on Tom's question about, I guess, why -- how
rate separation is the right path forward rather than more of a piecemeal approach. And it
started like Brian gave some strategic rationale for it, but you guys also mentioned, if you
look at the capital and tax considerations when you decided on what you're going to do.
So what if any of the capital and tax considerations that made this a better path than a
more of a piecemeal process of selling the Life business in parts?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Okay, Ryan. Let me start with this. So when you -- when we looked at this question, the
question is, does Life and Retirement and GI belong together or are they better apart?
And at the end of the kind to conclusion was they were better apart. So let me look at the
Life and Retirement, and you say, okay, Life and Retirement better together or apart, and
it's the same kind of process. As I outlined, we believe that the Life and Retirement
business itself, as I said earlier, really is well integrated. There is a synergy around them
that produces greater value than separating them. So that was -- we didn't see that value
between Life and Retirement and General Insurance but we see the value in the Life and
Retirement business where there is a creation of value because they are together and
that was the strategic decision.
The question is, is it practical to separate and all that, we went through all that. And yeah,
we have the capital we believe, we can get the -- we have the ability to appropriately
stand each up, stand up L&R, I should say, so. But it really fell on that very simple process.
Hope that helps Ryan?

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Yeah, it does. I mean, I guess, this is for Peter. Generally, when thinking about the dissynergies associated with this stranded cost that type of thing. I mean, you think about the

Page 19 of 22

cost base of the company. I guess, I would like hear your early thoughts on any
complexities there?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

FINAL

Go ahead, Peter.

A - Peter Zaffino

{BIO 15942020 <GO>}

Thank you. So I would think about it if I was-- if we're going to do an IPO with Life and
Retirement, there will be additional investment in order to have the company stand up on
its own. But how I would think about it is that, the benefits of AIG 200 to Life and
Retirement will be at or more than what the investment costs were. So there'll be no
additional costs in terms of the run rate today. And then, I do think that there will be more
expense synergies at AIG post separation, and we're working through that and that would
be in addition to AIG 200 (inaudible) more insight in one of our field share quarter call that
we will give a little bit more ground network on it.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great, thanks. On the fourth quarter '19 call, I think, we got the sense that the underlying
accident year loss ratio improvement would be more pronounced in 2021 than in 2020. Is
that still the expectation?

A - Brian Duperreault

{BIO 1645891 <GO>}

Peter?

A - Peter Zaffino

loss cost or like I just want to make sure I understand what you're asking?

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

I guess, I mean, you've talked about how rate above loss cost is helping 2020, but
wondering whether that would -- any of that improvement was originally expected more
in 2021 and has been pulled forward or is it just the absolute better pricing environment?

A - Peter Zaffino

A - Mark Lyons

{BIO 21746221 <GO>}

Sure, sure happy to. Thank you, Meyer. So I think one thing that's been clear from the
informations Peter has provided, not only this call but in prior calls is, we don't see any
reduction of the rate of increase. One is global, not just considering [ph] US. And
secondly, we don't see it slowing off in virtually all the major areas that we've discussed. I
think, some others may, but we have not, and I think that's a paramount to the continued
professionalism with the underwriting here. So think of it this way. So if you have that kind
of strength by policy quarter, effective quarter, and if that continues to build, it's going to
throw off increasing rate adequacy into future calendar quarters. So '20, it's going to have
a very strong year and I see nothing in the way stopping 2021 from being marginally
better than that.
