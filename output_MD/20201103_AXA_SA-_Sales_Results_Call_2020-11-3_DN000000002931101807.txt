Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the AXA Group's Nine Months 2020 Activity Indicators Analyst
Conference Call. To begin the call, I will now hand over to Andrew Wallace-Barnett, AXA's Head of
Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.

Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Thank you, and good morning to everyone, and welcome to AXA's conference call on our activity
indicators for the first nine months of 2020. I'm pleased to welcome Etienne Bouas-Laurent, AXA's
Group CFO. Etienne will briefly take you through last night's release. And at the end of his
introductory remarks, he will be happy to take your questions. Etienne, I hand over to you.

Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Thank you, Andrew. Hello, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining the call today. As you
would have seen from our press release, AXA's activity rebounded strongly in the third quarter
after a significant decline in the second quarter in the context of COVID-19. The rebound in
revenues we saw is an important demonstration of the resilience and strength of our business
model. It stems from the strategic choices we have made in recent years to focus on P&C
commercial lines, health, protection and unit-linked. And is a reflection of the commitment of our
employees and distributors. And most importantly, the loyalty of our customers.
Let me rapidly go through some of the details, starting with P&C. P&C revenues were up 2% yearon-year versus the third quarter '19, driven by both commercial lines and personal lines. In
commercial lines, revenues were up 2% year-on-year in the third quarter, driven by continued
strong price increases, partly offset by underwriting actions to improve profitability at AXA XL. In
the third quarter, prices were up 4% in France and Europe.



FINAL

Personal lines revenues were up 1% year-on-year in Q3, with a strong increase in net new
contracts, notably in motor, including in France and Europe with around plus 100,000 contracts.
On AXA XL, specifically, we continue to see an acceleration in pricing increases. In Q3, insurance
pricing was up 20% and reinsurance was up 10%. At the same time, Scott Gunter and his new
leadership team are taking decisive underwriting measures to enhance the performance of AXA
XL's business. As an example, in Q3, AXA XL decided to exit from some financial lines in our UK
and Lloyd's business as we believe the level of pricing increases are not sufficient to compensate
the uncertain and volatile outlook for these lines.
You all know that Q3 was another active CAT season with above-average insured losses across the
industry. This stems from an elevated number of storm in the US, including Hurricane Laura, Isaias,
Sally, Derecho as well as wildfires in California. Our current bottom-up estimates indicate that we
may incur claims charges of EUR0.3 billion in excess of the normalized level for AXA XL for the
second half of the year before tax and net of reinsurance.

Bloomberg Transcript

Very recently, AM Best in its September 2020 rating review, reiterated the AA- rating of AXA XL
with a stable outlook, which is important commercially and a sign of confidence in the measures
currently being implemented.
If I now move rapidly through our other business lines. On health, we continue to see growth with
revenues up 7% over the nine months, up strongly in France and across all our geographies. On the
life side, despite a continued slowdown linked to COVID-19, I'm pleased to see a sustained
positive shift in the quality of our business. Specifically, we saw positive flows in the third quarter in
protection and in unit-linked, and continued outflows in G/A savings in line with our strategy. Finally,
on asset management, we recorded EUR11 billion of net inflows in Q3 from both core and
alternatives, with revenues up 4%.
Now let's move on to Solvency II. As at end September, our Solvency II ratio remained stable
versus end June at 180%. This includes a pro rata dividend accrual based on the full year dividend
of EUR1.43 per share, initially proposed by the Board for full year '19.
Looking ahead, the Solvency II ratio for full year '20 is expected to benefit from the integration of
AXA XL into the Group's internal model, and from the completion of previously-announced
disposals, including plus 2 points from the CEE disposal, which was not captured in the 180% as of
September 30. And that is a good segue to remind you that we continue to pursue our
simplification journey.
In mid-October, we closed the CEE sale of EUR1 billion of cash proceeds. We announced, in
August, the disposal of non-life operations in India. And a few days ago, we closed the sale of
Architas UK investment business. We expect the level of cash at holdings to remain high at the end
of 2020, above the top end of our desired range of EUR1 billion to EUR3 billion.
Finally, a brief word on COVID claims. At this stage, we expect only a limited impact from the
current second wave of lockdowns, and we have reaffirmed our best estimate of EUR1.5 billion, net
of tax and net of reinsurance, for COVID-19-related claims in 2020.
So to conclude, AXA has performed well in the context of COVID-19 with a strong high-quality
rebound in our activity in the third quarter, and which initial figures indicate has continued into
October. Our business model favoring technical risks over financial risks is proving its relevance and
strength as confirmed by the continued growth momentum in our preferred segments and the
loyalty of our customers.
Our balance sheet is strong and remains resilient in volatile market conditions and with upside
ahead of us on our Solvency II ratio. We expect the level of cash at holding to be above the top



end of our target level of EUR1 billion to EUR3 billion at the end of 2020. We expect only a limited
net impact on claims from the current second wave of lockdowns, and have reaffirmed our
estimated EUR1.5 billion impact from COVID-19-related claims in 2020.

FINAL

We believe in our strategy and its execution. We have become a simpler and more focused
organization, and we are confident to deliver sustained good performance.
I'm now ready to take your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) First question from Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America. Sir,
please go ahead.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 21847791 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Three from me as usual, if that's okay. First one is probably a
slightly longer one. Look, your comments about ensuring that XL has necessary resources to take
full advantage of market conditions. There's been some discussion as well about potential cash
down streaming before year-end. I just wondered if you could give us some color here. Should we
think about just reserve strengthening cash for future growth? I know the subject of reserves for
anything you'll be in a position to give us more disclosure to properly analyze adequacy of XL's
reserves. That's the long question one.
Second question was just on the COVID loss guidance. Good to hear further lockdowns will not
have a material effect. I assume that's on a net basis after allowing for lower attritional frequency. I
just really wondered if you can give some breakdown on kind of gross versus net claims there.
And thirdly, just what proportion of your commercial lines contracts have now explicitly excluded
COVID claims as we go through renewals during the year? Thanks.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Good morning, Andrew, and thank you for your questions. So your first question relates to the -our willingness, and our wish to reinforce the resources of XL, to be able to benefit from the
current favorable pricing context and the anticipated resumption of demand across most lines
segments in 2021, which is a very clear statement from our side.
Obviously, we need as well to offset some expected loss from COVID-19. And all in all, what we
want to ensure is that we have sufficient resources capital within our risk appetite framework to
continue to grow this business. We are not shrinking this business. Of course, we are reunderwriting, we are line-sizing.
We are increasing the client retention, but we want as well to grow in the business lines where we
think that it's correctly priced, and we think that the market will grow -- will continue to grow next
year. So we want to be in a good position to benefit from this trend. We have -- of course, your
question related to the reserves. We don't make -- at the nine months, we don't publish a balance
sheet. So what I can tell you is that we continue to consider our reserves are adequate.
And lastly, the amount of capital we intend to inject is around EUR1 billion. We think it will put us in a
comfortable situation at year-end. This will be -- there will be no impact in terms of liquidity at the
Group level because we have also other upstreams from entities in the second part of the year.
And last point, there will be, as well, no impact on the solvency for the Group.



FINAL

So your second question is related to the COVID losses. So as you know, there are two aspects.
The first one is the first wave. And on the first wave, we consider that the uncertainty is really
reducing month after month. I would say that we have clarity in the UK in the meanwhile since the
first half. There are still some uncertainties in France, but which remain, in our view, manageable.
And there is some debate around some contracts, which we think are extremely clear because
they exclude pandemics. There is some confusion in the French courts around that. We think that it
will be settled over time. But after reinsurance, we don't see that as a very material impact.
Regarding the second wave, we are confident that the impact will be very limited for two main
reasons. The first one is event cancellation, you remember, represented a pretty big part of the
cost in the first half. Event cancellation, we already booked a provision for the 12 months so starting
from March. So -- because there was very limited new business, and when there is no business,
including pandemic and because we had already booked a provision, we don't consider that there
will be any impact related to a second lockdown.
The second part was the business interruption. Business interruption is, I would say, a more
complicated topic. However, based on what we see and understand, first of all, the second
lockdown have softer restrictions than the first one with more government support.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second, I remind you that in some cases in France, in Germany, in Switzerland, there were
settlements, settlements in case of lack of clarity of the contracts. These settlements included a
clear waiver on any claims linked to a further lockdown. So we think we are safe on this part.
And maybe a link -- a third point, which is linked to your third question. We have adapted -- we
have started to adapt, already a few months ago, and we continue it to be rolled out, the wording
of our contract in a way which is not only excluding pandemic, but as well, clarifying what is really
covered and what is not. We had in the past, especially for business interruption contracts, an
approach with a sort of blanket coverage with exclusions. So -- which was saying, you are covered
for everything, but. And this led to some confusion. And therefore, we have decided to switch to
an affirmative description of the coverage provided. So (inaudible) so as to not to be exposed to
systemic risks.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 21847791 <GO>}

Thanks, Etienne. And can I just come back to the first question again? You mentioned that you'll be
fitting the XL business in a comfortable position on reserves around year-end, but I think the
market has been struggling for a few years now to really get comfortable on that level. Are you
able to commit to giving more disclosures, say, more detailed reserve triangles on XL over the
coming months?

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So as you know, it's difficult for me to comment balance sheet items at nine months. I -- so we will
give, of course, the numbers in the full year numbers, which means at the end of February. But I
think -- I guess your point is more related to the -- it's less a question of numbers, but more a
question of disclosures, if I understand well. What your message is to say please provide us with
more detail so that we get more comfort. And I know this point, we have that in mind and it's a fair
point.
We just need to ensure that the format of the information provided gives indeed more clarity.
Sometimes when you look at net of reinsurance amounts and the historical data, the scopes, you
don't always get the needed clarity. And this is why -- this is my only waiver. If it was very clear, very
helpful for the analysts and investors, we would not hesitate.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 21847791 <GO>}

Understood. Appreciate it. Thanks, Etienne.

Thank you. Next question from Farooq Hanif from Credit Suisse. Sir, please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. Thank you very much and good morning. Returning firstly to AXA XL. How can you
convince us that the EUR1 billion capital injection is enough? Clearly, there have been questions
about this. And when you talk about the upstream from other entities, is that Switzerland? Can you
explain where that capital is coming from so that we can be assured that you're not taking surplus
from one area to bulk up surplus in another area?
Secondly, on AXA XL, can you talk a little bit about the future of further mix shift that you're going
to do? So we've heard about financial lines and some liability lines in the US. Just wondering what
further work do you have to do? So at what point should we start to see better top line growth?
And then last point is, I understand a difficult topic, but even if we are convinced that you can pay a
dividend, the elephant in the room is whether you will be allowed to pay a dividend. What can you
tell us about that? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Good morning, Farooq, and thank you for your questions. Not easy ones, especially the third one.
So on the dividend, the thing which I can tell you is that technically, if I can use this word, there is no
hurdle, no constraint. If you look at profitability, liquidity, solvency, there is no technical hurdle. And
it's very difficult for me to, at this stage, to comment on any intention or positions from the
regulators and especially on the French regulator. It's too early for me.
You just need to understand that we have, I think, a good motivation. We cited to pay part of our
dividend this year. And for next year, I think we'll be in the same spirit. This was for your question
number three.
Question number one, why? So on the capital increase -- so first of all, we manage internally our
capital. It's business as usual for us. And reallocating capital from capital-intensive businesses like
G/A business to more technical risk like XL's business is something we want to do in the future.
This being said, we have -- the amount I gave, which is around EUR1 billion should be sufficient for
us to support the growth, not only this year but next year as well. So this is what I can tell you at this
stage, and it corresponds to the guidelines of our risk appetite.
The financing is very clear. It's coming partly from the cash upstream from the other entities, it's
coming partly from Switzerland. And you know that because we have restructured our general
account business in Group Life. So it's freezed [ph] capital. It started last year. It continued this year,
and it will -- there will be a third part normally next year. So this is the second part for this year,
which would be paid. And the other one is Japan, which usually pays its dividend in second part of
the year. So there is absolutely nothing unexpected there.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. Just -- sorry quickly, while you're on that point, you're still not intending to pay a dividend
from XL next year in light of this year. Is that correct?

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Yes. Yes, absolutely. Because XL, you saw at half year, had a negative earnings. So when you have
an entity with negative earnings, usually they don't pay dividend the year after.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}



Okay.

FINAL

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

It's very clear, yes. So on the business mix shift. So you saw our communication on the Lloyd's and - from the Lloyd's and UK office. We have decided to put enough around half of the financial lines
of the UK and Lloyd's business because we think that in the medium term, they will not come back
to a level of profitability with enough security, given all the risks we see associated to this business
despite the price increases.
It's -- this being said, it's within each subsegment of the Company, we are fine-tuning the
approach. So it's not such a radical move, it's more line-sizing. So we already explained that their
contract, we don't want to have more than EUR25 million of risk. There were a substantial amount
of contracts, which had a EUR50 million of risk. We are increasing the attachment points in excess - in case of excess of loss. So accounting with a higher retention from the clients.
We are then fine-tuning per geographies, per really contract subsegments underwriting. So it's not
that we are changing radically the Company. It's really a mix of stopping, fixing, increasing the
different activities in a very, very granular way. And this -- we'll come back to this with much more
explanations soon, I would say. So don't worry about that.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. Next question from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Three for me, please. The first one on your EUR1.5 billion guidance. I mean, I
guess, at H1, that consisted of EUR1.9 billion of adverse claims offset by EUR0.4 billion of lower
frequency in France and Europe. I'm guessing that both of those numbers have increased a bit, but
perhaps you could confirm that. And I mean, I guess what we've also seen so far is more
restrictions in Europe where you saw the sort of the frequency benefit. So I'm just wondering if we
get more restrictions in the US or if that changes? Is there any risk of -- creep there? Just
wondering if you could comment around that. Right.
The second question was on nat cats. And I guess your EUR0.3 billion estimate is a bit lower than
last year, while many in the industry have sort of reported slightly higher amounts. And I'm just
wondering if there's anything sort of in particular you'd like to highlight there as a reason that,
that's come down a bit?
And then finally, just a follow-up on XL. I mean, I guess, post EUR1 billion capital injection, we're
looking at a solvency ratio of about 140%. That's obviously higher than it is at the moment, but it's
still lower than it has been in the past. I mean do you have a sort of feeling for what level is the
right sort of level? Or is that the wrong way of thinking about it? Any light you can shed there would
be great. Thank you so much.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So hi, Peter and thank you for your questions. Your first question relates to the EUR1.5 billion. And
so I think you referred to the mix, and how this mix of claims have evolved between half year and
full year across entities. So we always say that there might be some variations across geographies
because indeed, you -- we, I think, had some more good news on the retail front, especially in



motor in the retail side. And some movements between the geographies, maybe a bit more in
France, a bit less elsewhere in terms of claims cost.

FINAL

I think this is the comments we made already and which revealed true at the moment. The second,
but -- maybe if you have a more granular question on this, I'm happy to answer. I just was not sure
if I got fully, your question.
The second part, which is related to the nat cat. Obviously, we reduced our market share in nat cat.
You remember the -- we have reduced our underwriting a little bit. We have also a quota share of
15% on nat cat. And therefore, our exposure can be considered as reduced by more than 10%. We
are -- market share worldwide has certainly gone down from 1.6% to 1.4%, which explains part of
the fact that we are a little bit below last year, while one might have expected a higher cost.
Regarding XL, we don't make comments at a granular level on how we capitalize versus the
Bermudan regulators' rules. What I can tell you is that we have the same approach across all the
countries. We are within our risk appetite framework. And we consider that after this capital
increase, we will be at the right level to pursue the activity of XL without any kind of constraints to
subscribe more business.
Peter, did I answer your questions?

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. No, that's right. Thank you very much.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Next question from William Hawkins from KBW. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hello, thank you very much. Etienne, I'm sorry. I'm going to come back and ask you to talk a bit
more about regulatory conversations that you're having. I understand the answer you gave to
Farooq. I wonder if you could talk a bit about what you may be hearing from AOPA rather than the
French regulator? And also whether you think there's just going to be more nuance in what
regulators say going into 2021?
This year, it's been reasonably black and white, hasn't it? Regulators went from saying yes to then
saying no to then saying yes again. But when you look at the banking sector, there does seem to
be more of a focus of intervening and payout ratios and all that kind of thing. So I'm just wondering
if you're having any more nuanced conversations locally, and what you're hearing from AOPA?
And then secondly, please, could you also just update us on any thoughts with regards to the
sensitivity to the low interest rate environment? This always feels like old news and then something
else comes along. So particularly for this quarter, any important changes to update us in terms of
product evolution? I know the general trends towards protection, I'm just asking specifics.
And then even you guys did still have IFRS issues from low yields, thinking of French annuities in the
first half of this year. Can you just update us again on whether there's any particular earnings issues
we need to be aware of as the low interest rate environment endures? Thank you.



FINAL

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Good morning, William, and thank you for your questions. So on the AOPA, I think you know, and
you hear a lot of things as well. I'm not sure that I have to comment anything. There are ongoing
discussions. Nothing concluding at this stage. I think that you have some -- certainly, the AOPA is on
the conservative side. I'm not sure they have changed their position versus the recent months or -or last year, even. But I'm not -- it's too early for me and too sensitive to comment on any kind of
nuances going forward into 2021. I think it's too early, and it would be really a speculation from my
side.
So I don't think I am in a measure to comment in a very concrete way on the regulatory updates. I
think it's too early and not -- we don't have any hard facts at this stage. Regarding the sensitivity to
interest rates, of course, when interest rates go down, you can expect lower investment income.
This is very true for P&C, a bit less for life, given the longer duration of the assets, and given our
capacity to adapt the crediting rates in most other countries.
However, where you have a good point is that it's true that we are repricing our products in a lot of
countries at the moment in order to reduce the level of guarantees, if there are any. And this is an
ongoing trend and will continue, including next year. I think there is a real shift in the way the life
business is being done.

Bloomberg Transcript

And coming back to P&C, I think that this is part of the reason why we see as well this price
hardening, especially in the commercial lines. There is lower investment income. It has to be offset
by a higher technical margin, and this is a sound evolution. Regarding your hint that we might have
a big hit on -- there might be a big hit due to interest rates. At this stage, I don't see any reason to
have perhaps a specific query on our earnings or more than business as usual.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

That's great, Etienne. Thank you.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Thank you, William.

Operator
Thank you. Next question from Michael Huttner from Berenberg. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

So I just wondered can you give us a little bit of a feeling where the sensitivity lies. Is it just French
specific? That's what it sounds like to me, in which case, it really is difficult for French insurers. I'm
not sure the regulator understands that. But anyway, that's the main question.
And then on the cash flow, you've given us a few indications on cash. So there's something left in
Switzerland. I just wondered if that's the third of the original amount of EUR700 million for next
year. And would it mean if I add the numbers in terms of cash flow, we had EUR4.9 billion, I think, at
six months. If I add the EUR1 billion we're talking about now, that means EUR5.9 billion. And I just
wondered if we could see a similar number for 2021. Or do you think that would be down?
And then the last question, and you alluded to it, is on the reinsurance recoveries. How confident
are you or how big is it in your EUR1.5 billion number, EUR1.5 billion number that you (inaudible) to
reinsurance recoveries and other discussions around that? Thank you.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}



Good morning, Michael, and thank you for your comment on the good numbers. Good to hear
from you.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. Very fantastic. Really well done. I wish I had the -- your management's -- yeah, it's really good.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So your first question related to the regulators again. So first of all, I don't think that it's purely
specific to France of -- some other regulators are in the same I would say, spirit, mood or
approach. I guess that there is -- it's not specific and it's not specific to insurance. I think that
certainly, the French government and authorities are very worried about the economic situation as
a whole. And this has an influence on everything. They are worried about the economic situation.
They are worried about the sanitary situation. You have seen that the confinement measures are
certainly stricter in France, can add Belgium to France as well, than in other countries.

Bloomberg Transcript

So there is a real concern, a macroeconomic and sanitary concern about the situation. And this has
an impact on all the rest, not only on the regulation and insurance. But on the way they see or they
want to protect, according to them, the economic sectors. So -- and it's difficult to say much more
than this, right? It's really certainly this worry, and we felt that from the beginning, they were really,
really afraid. Maybe because French doesn't have a very strong economic culture. I don't know. I let
it to you.
Regarding the cash. Obviously, the cash upstream next year will be lower than the cash upstream
this year because it's a direct consequence of the level of earnings of the previous year. So if you
make the math, obviously, will come to a lower number. On the reinsurance, every time we tell you,
we don't disclose the gross and net amount because we are in discussions and I should say,
negotiations with the reinsurance companies. So it's a very sensitive information.
What I can tell you, again, is that we are confident with the numbers we have taken into account in
our calculations because they are the result of a very fine-tuned and granular approach, taking
account different scenarios to ensure that at the end of the day, our amount be fair in any
circumstance, and that we don't get a bad surprise at the end.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

That's very clear. Superb. Thank you very much and good luck with the French lockdown.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Thank you, Michael.

Operator
Thank you. Next question from Andrew Crean from Autonomous Research. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Good morning, Etienne. Two questions, if I can. Firstly, you're, I think, now celebrating your second
birthday of ownership of XL. And throughout that period, nat cats have been above your expected
rate. Could you say whether your expected rate is too low? And whether in the next renewal
season, you're looking to buy additional covers to reduce the volatility of XL's results? First
question.
Second question, I'm going to come back to this question of regulators. You seem not to wish to
answer any questions about AOPA or the ACPR, which leaves the investors with a view of deep
uncertainty of your 2020 dividend. Are your answers actually merely political because you may



have the regulators in the room? Or is there something substantive there? And is there any efforts
being made by the industry privately to equalize the playing field between the different national
regulators?

FINAL

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Good morning, Andrew. Regarding the nat cats, I fully understand the -- your questions because
we have been above our budget for the second time. And I think it's a very sensible question you
are asking. I don't think that taking more and more reinsurance is the solution because it's very
costly. And at the end of the day, this is our -- part of our business model. What I propose is to get
back to you to the market pretty soon with some clarification on what it means for us. In the
meanwhile, what I can tell you is that when I see the prices -- the price increases we are seeing at
the moment, part of the answer is in the price increases we see at the moment.

Bloomberg Transcript

So on the reinsurance, if you see on average, plus 10%. This covers, of course, nat cat. You will see
that there is some correlation between the expenses -- sorry, the claims incurred and the price
increases performed. I don't say this is the only solution, but this is part of the solution, and we'll
come back to you very soon with more concrete answers on this very important question.
The second question on the level playing field. You know that it has been our wish that there be a
level playing field in Europe, which is, I think, common sense. Where there is -- and I think this is not
only AXA, this is most of the insurance companies as you hinted. The second wish is that decisions
on dividend be made on economic factors. So within -- not capitalizing on the Solvency II
framework. And not a sort of approach, sort of, yeah, black or white approach based on
macroeconomic factors because we think that it would undermine the credibility of Solvency II,
which is a framework which has its disadvantages, but also has the merits of being pretty
conservative. And having an influence on the way we manage our businesses.
So I think this is it, and I see a convergence among the various bodies representing the insurance
industry, like the PIF, CRO, COO Forum, Insurance Europe. All these bodies going to the express
themselves, I think, in the same direction.

Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Next question from Nick Holmes from Societe Generale. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thank you very much. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Firstly, with XL, do you think it's
on track for EUR1.2 billion underlying earnings, if you take out all the bad stuff, the COVID, US civil
unrest and the nat cat hit?
And second question is just coming back on the reinsurance protection. Can you remind us what
levels you actually have at the moment, if you were to take some -- or if there were to be in the
industry, some bad nat cats this year? Thank you.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Hello, Nick. Good morning and thank you for your question. So I will not comment just right now on
the normalized earnings for full year 2020, I think it's too early. But this is something on which we
will, as well, come back to you soon, I would say. But please understand that it's difficult to
comment on H2 normalized earnings during -- so right now. Even if your question is absolutely
justified, and I would say, if you exclude all the one-offs, we should not be that far away.



FINAL

Second, on the reinsurance protection, how can I tell you? We have, I think, a very solid protection
in terms of high-severity amounts. The difficulty is the high frequency. And this is what's happening
at the moment, again. So low to medium events -- medium-sized events. And on this, the only
protections we have and which we disclosed in the beginning of the year was to say we have a
quota share of 15%, and we have reduced our underwriting. But this does not prevent us from
incurring more losses, if there were some more small events, I would say.
And therefore, it's very difficult for me to tell you. Don't worry, the cap is -- there is no cap as such.
So we are well protected against very severe events. But you cannot protect yourself against
events, which for instance, are below EUR50 million. On this, you just have to live with that, and it's
part of the business.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

So it's really frequency rather than severity that you would be worried about. Would that be fair to
say?

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Exactly. And this -- it comes back to the question of Andrew a bit earlier. You have different
possible answers. More reinsurance, I don't believe in that, too costly and not possible below
certain threshold. Second, price increases for sure, and this is a priority. And there might be other
options, which we'll discuss very soon with you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

That's great. Sorry, just very, very quickly. So with the underlying performance at XL, any quick
comments on anything that's particularly good at XL that you can see at the moment? Obviously,
you're aiming for a higher-pricing, better-quality business. Any sort of wins that you feel XL is really
making at the moment?

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Yes. Absolutely. I think that -- and again, I think we will be very keen to give you more granularity
and more details on XL soon. I would say that, first of all, I reiterate the price increases. When you
look -- the amount of these price increases, given the size of our business, if you convert that into
earnings impact, it's significant, really significant. You might argue, of course, but this is in response
to higher loss ratios, yes. But the price increases are much higher than the loss increases and the
loss trends at the moment. And this is certainly going to continue for a while based on what we
see on the market at the moment. So we see a very, very favorable tailwind in pricing continuing.
Second, the organization, which has been -- the new organization in terms of accountability, which
had been announced by Scott Gunter, quite rapidly after his arrival, I think, two months after his
arrival has been implemented and is in place since the end of October. So it took him six months to
put in place a new organization, which is a quick. And they are really re-underwriting the way a little
bit. I described it earlier, the full portfolio, which is a good sign.
And it's with a quite high level of retention on the portfolios we want to keep and on which we,
anyway as well, increase the prices quite significantly. So I think it's -- the momentum is absolutely
great, and we are extremely confident that you will see very good numbers next year.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

That's very clear. Thanks very much, Etienne.

Thank you. Next question from Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley. Sir, please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. I've got two questions, please. Just coming back on to the dividend.
And maybe to ask the question slightly differently. You've continued to accrue, mechanically, in the
Solvency II numbers for the EUR1.43 that was originally declared for 2019. And obviously, with the
COVID losses, et cetera, that's going to result in a payout ratio above the 50% to 60% guidance.
Aside from the regulator, is AXA at the Board level happy with that? And is it sensible to think that
you would actually pay a dividend, which is above the payout ratio range guidance given the
extraordinary circumstances in 2020? Or is it just that you're mechanically accruing that? So is there
any information contrary to that is, I guess, the question.
And then secondly, Etienne, you mentioned that the simplification process is ongoing, and you've
had quite a few disposals already. Is it reasonable to think there's more opportunity for disposals
as we go into 2021? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Good morning, Jon and thank you for your questions. To be frank, in the solvency ratio, we apply
the formula in a sort of mechanical way. Why? Because at the end of the day, the decision to pay a
certain level of dividend is the decision of the Board. And the Board decides and will decide at the
end of February. Second, the payout ratio of 50% to 60% is, I would say, a guidance, but it's not a
rule we have to abide by, right? It's not any kind of regulation.
So it's there to help. But if in exceptional circumstances, we are free to use another payout ratio,
whatever it is, right? And so we are not forced to link it with -- to any kind of rule. So we are
completely free.
The second thing is on the simplification. I think you're right to say that the simplification will not
stop at the end of this year. It will continue in '21, maybe in '22 as well, and there will be more to
come certainly.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Thank you. Just to come back on the dividend point. So you said in your comments that you're
looking it from an economic perspective, so in terms of solvency, cash and, I guess, underlying
earnings potential, there's no reason why you wouldn't declare a dividend. So that's the way which
the Board will look at it? So the payout ratio is right not to attach to its attention to that. Is that the
message? Or am I putting words in your mouth?

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Maybe Jon, just pose your -- just repeat your question. We just missed it.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

I'm just trying to get with the level of the payout ratio point. So -- because actually, I'm saying in
exceptional circumstances, you may want to look for it. But say, as long as the solvency is in the
right zone, the holding company's liquidity is in the right place, the underlying earnings capacity is



there then it is reasonable to think that the Board might look through the payout ratio. Is that the
message?

A - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

FINAL

You mean go above the payout ratio?

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Yes, exactly, yeah.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Okay. Now I understand, sorry. Sorry, Jon. Yeah, we think that there are -- there is a good case for
the Board to consider going above the payout ratio. But I'm very cautious because the Board
decides. We propose -- we make some suggestion to the Board and the Board decides. So we
need to be extremely cautious as we think there is a very solid case.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay. That's clear. Thank you very much guys.

Thank you. Next question from Thomas Fossard from HSBC. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Good morning, Etienne. Two questions on my side. The first one would be on the DPS again. Is
there any current thinking within AXA to move to an interim dividend. I'm not saying that if we solve
the issue with the annual dividend, but is it something that potentially could be on the card? And
are there any regulatory hurdle, if this was your choice to move to this twice a year DPS cash out?
And the second question would be, you're going to have an Investor Day on the 1st of December.
Could you shed some light on the -- not on the content, but on the agenda and the topics you're
going to present in a couple of weeks' time? Thank you.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

(Foreign Language) Thomas, and thank you for your questions. On the interim dividend, this is a
question we are -- we have sometimes from some investors. It's true that in the current context, it
might have helped. We are not there yet. So I think at the moment, really, it's more about the
previous questions related to the regulatory environment, which prevail. Once this is clear, we'll
have a look again at this question. I already say that it's not a bad idea to have twice a year, but
there are some constraints related to that, which we need to clear.
On the Investor Day, what I can tell you is that it's an important meeting for us and for our
shareholders. We will address topics, which we think are important to them and to us with certainly
an important element on the strategy and focus on some business developments, which matter to
all of us.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Oliver Steel from Deutsche Bank. Sir, please go ahead.



Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

FINAL

Sorry. Hello. I had it on mute. Two questions from me. The first is, do you have any extra clarity at
this stage about the benefits of moving XL to your internal model? And sort of by early November,
one might hopefully you've got a bit of extra clarity on that. And secondly, just going back to the
last question. I think Thomas said at the interim results that you weren't intending to announce the
three-year plan at the Investor Day. Is that still the intention not to make that announcement?

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Good morning, Oliver. On the internal model, there is no news, I would say, because our
application has been filed as said in August. This is -- the regulators take a few months. So there is
no new development, which is good news in a way. Therefore, we expect no surprise for the end
of the year. So not much more to say at this stage. And on the Investor Day, I think that I told you
everything I could in the previous answer to Thomas, which was a little bit short, I must confess, but
reflected what I can tell you at this stage.

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Okay. Actually, can I ask a third question since I'm on, which is that are you able to break down the
premium growth in the third quarter at XL between pricing volume and then the actual economic
effect of COVID? Because I mean, you've obviously lost some average premium per policy as a
result of economic activity declining. I'm just trying to isolate that third element.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So I think that basically, the premiums offset the volumes. And within the volumes, what I think is
that the -- so if I give you numbers, the pricing effect was plus EUR1.4 billion. The exposure was
minus EUR1 billion. And then -- so this is the reduction of exposure to minus EUR1 billion. And then
there is some volume decrease related to the COVID-19. So the indexation of our policies on the
level of activity of our clients.
So there is a slight positive between pricing and the underwriting and a negative on top of -related to the lower volumes due to the review of our estimates for the end of the year. I think we
gave a breakdown in a precise manner at half year. I'm looking if we have more precision here.
Yeah, so the provision for premium adjustment linked to COVID remains quite in line with the 1H
estimate, which was around minus EUR0.9 billion GWP.

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So excluding COVID adjustment, revenues of AXA XL would have been up 7.5% in nine months
'20, and plus 4% in this quick Q3.

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Next question from Pierre Chedeville from CIC Market Solutions. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Pierre Chedeville

{BIO 15076220 <GO>}



FINAL

Yes. Good morning. Two questions. First question regarding asset management business. I wanted
to know regarding fees that you mentioned increasing by 3%. Is this increase only due to the
increase in assets under management? Or if it is also due to a different mix in the products that
you have under management, and notably, real assets where you are one of the first in Europe?
And I also wanted to know regarding the net inflows. If you disclose part of ESG net inflows for this
activity.
My second question relates to your reporting. I was quite surprised to see that for this quarter, you
didn't make any comment by countries, but by business line, health protection, et cetera, life, but
not by France, Europe, Asia, et cetera [ph]. I wanted to know if it was due to the exceptional period
that we are going through.
If you prepare, once again, a change in your reporting and in your strategic view, which would not
be anymore by country, but return, I would say, return to the future to the business lines? Thank
you.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

(Foreign Language) Pierre, thank you for your questions. So on the asset management, there is no
real business mix shift at nine months. So it's pretty -- the overall assets under management going
up. And then on the transaction fees, they are quite -- it's always on the real estate side, that we
had some increase in fees. We don't disclose net inflows with ESG, without ESG. We have an ESG
policy in our core companies across the board.
Regarding the reporting, this way of presenting is pretty aligned with what we have tried to do in
1H already, which is to have, as a first indication, the lines of business, and then we keep all the split
per geographies, mostly in the appendices. And this is in response to some investors' request and
especially analyst request to have more simple presentations by line of business to get clarity. If
you take, for instance -- we are becoming more and more a P&C company. So when you are a P&C
company, people tell you what's your combined ratio.
So starting with the line of business allows us to clarify the big value drivers and then the split per
geography is more in the appendices. So the attempt -- and sorry, if we failed, was to give you
more clarity with this line of business approach. And then you have all the information per country.
And we think that it's easier for the investors to understand our business.

Q - Pierre Chedeville

{BIO 15076220 <GO>}

I don't say the contrary. I'm not saying it's not clear. I'm saying that it's a complete change from a
previous strategic view from Thomas who wanted to talk about countries and not anymore about
business lines. That's what I'm saying, but you can change in life.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Okay. I think this is not -- what is true is that we are managing countries. So in terms of
empowerment, when you look at the way the management committee is built, you have a CEO,
the CEOs are per country and not their line of business. It is completely true, and this is the way we
manage the business. However, in terms of reporting, we think that showing the line of business
first is much clearer.

Q - Pierre Chedeville

{BIO 15076220 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent
Thank you, Pierre.

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Last question from Michael Huttner from Berenberg. Sir, please
go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Fantastic. I'm not going to congratulate you again because you really are doing a fantastic job. But I
have two questions. One is, I'm sure you've done it, but when you're speaking with regulators, did
you point out that Coface was allowed to do a buyback, and that's quite recent. I know this wasn't
a big buyback, but still indicative that -- we were all hoping that it indicated that things were more
relaxed?
And then the second, this is a question I have from investors. Next year, so 2021, can we look
forward to positive premium growth? I mean, clearly, Q3 growth has recovered in non-life. So I
think the figure is plus 2%. And with health, we're plus 3%, Q3 on this year versus Q3 last year. But
can you give a feel for how you would see this developing in 2021? Thank you.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, again, Michael, and thank you again for the first part of your comments, which are very much
welcome. So don't hesitate every time. Regarding the Coface, I think it's a logical step. As you said,
it's a very, very small transaction. I think this is a positive signal. But even -- and when I say signal, I
hope I'm not exaggerating. I hope it's a positive signal, showing that our regulators can show some
flexibility, which I think is great if it's confirmed. It's very difficult for me to comment more than this.
Regarding your second point, which is the business momentum. I would say, in October, we saw a
very similar trend as in Q3 when I say -- we saw its very initial forecast. But this gives us a good
level of comfort for, okay, what would be a sort of normalized underlying growth trend? Very
difficult at the moment to make predictions because as you know, the GDP estimates fluctuate
quite a lot. You have different scenarios.
So we need to be very humble with our predictions. But I take the October and the Q3 numbers as
-- first in health. Whatever the economic situation, there is a need of the customers, which is not
decreasing and there is continued inflation.
So this -- both components show that we should be able to have a positive development over the
next years. In P&C, you really have two different markets. I think retail and commercial lines don't
behave in the same way. You see that commercial lines are very much impacted by the GDP
growth directly. However, the pricing is de-correlated. And I told you a little bit earlier, we see that
this price -- hardening pricing environment should continue in '21, maybe not to the same -- at the
same level, which is extreme at the moment, but it should remain positive.
The retail is, in a way, indexed as well a little bit on the GDP, but much less than the commercial
lines. On this, we see much less price increases. So we think that the name of the game will
certainly be on the quality of the underwriting, pricing and the cost reduction.
And on the life, we see that protection. Protection should be at least stable. The savings is much
more volatile. But the revenues in savings, the way we have accounted for, make little sense. So it's
more the net inflows. And on the net inflows, as you could see, what matters for us is to increase
the net inflows on capital-light products and not on the classical guaranteed books. The classical
guaranteed books, we are not looking for positive flows.

Q - Michael Huttner

So yeah. I don't know -- I will be very short, actually. So first of all, thank you for your very precise
questions and strategic questions, which are not all easy to answer, but we tried and I tried my
best.
I just want to reiterate that we are very happy with our Q3 numbers and especially the stickiness of
our clients. It's very important because there has been some noise around the business
interruption. I can ensure you that our clients are with us. It's very important. And the quality of the
franchise of AXA is stronger than ever.
Second, when we say that our balance sheet is strong, we say we -- it's not marketing, it's based
on facts. And the liquidity and the solvency are extremely solid. And you can count on this for -- to
stick to that until the end of this year. And we are very happy to, in advance, to interact with you for
the IR Day, which will come in four weeks. So very, very soon.
