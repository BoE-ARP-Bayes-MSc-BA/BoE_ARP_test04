MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to Swiss Re's First Quarter 2018 Results
Conference Call. Please note that today's conference call is being recorded. At this time, I
would like to turn the conference over to John Dacey, Group CFO. Please go ahead.

John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and good morning to those of you in the Americas
and welcome to the first quarter 2018 results conference call. I'm here with Patrick
Raaflaub, our Group Chief Risk Officer and Philippe Brahin, the Head of Investor Relations.
And if you indulge me, I'd like to start with a brief overview of the key figures which we
published this morning. Swiss Re reported a net income of $457 million for the first
quarter. This number reflects the negative impact of the change in the U.S. GAAP
accounting rules or equity investments held in our investment portfolio. On a pre-tax
basis, the impact was $280 million, on a post-tax basis $221 million. And in the press
release, we issued today you see that the alternative number estimated with the previous
accounting regime was $678 million.

Going through the performance of the individual business segments, we're pleased with
the performance of the Reinsurance units, our two largest businesses. P&C, we
maintained underwriting discipline, while expanding and improving, but we think still
challenging price environment. We delivered $347 million, which translates to an ROE of
13.5%. These numbers are not adjusted in any way for the previous accounting of U.S.
GAAP, but instead reflect the 2018 performance. In terms of renewals, treaty premiums
has increased 7% year-to-date with the price improvements of 2%, a continuation of what
we saw for the January 1, renewals.
Life & Health Re continues on its solid performance track record, delivering a net income
of $201 million and an ROE of 11.5%. Corporate Solutions net income was $41 million in the
first quarter of 2018. This result continues to reflect the impact of business written in
previous underwriting years where soft market environment prevailed. Commercial
insurance rates, as well as terms and conditions have started to improve after last year's
sizable nat cat losses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Life Capital delivered an exceptional gross cash generation of $705 million, reflecting
proceeds from a minority stake (00:02:52) as well as benefiting from the finalization of
the 2017 Solvency II calculation. The net income of the unit was impacted by the negative
investment market performance in the UK of Q1.
Though I mentioned the overall Group results, the asset management performance was
clearly impacted by the U.S. GAAP guidance from the treatment of equities. The reported
ROI of 2.2% was in fact on an adjusted basis estimated to be 3.2% for the quarter if we
had applied the counting rules of the last year. The fixed income running yield of 2.8% was
stable and in line with the expectations which we had previously communicated.
Finally, and given our strong capital position that we announced at the launch of the share
buyback program, without caveats or constraints which was authorized by the AGM two
weeks ago. We will begin repurchases on Monday, May 7, as we have received all the
necessary approvals.
With that, I hand it back to our Head of Investor Relations, Philippe, to who will introduce
the Q&A session.

Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Thanks, John and good day to all of you also from my side. So as we did at Q1 and nine
month last year, we were will only comment on the key figures we reported in our press
release and provide you with the qualitative assessment on underlying trends. I also
wanted to mention that we published our 2017 financial condition report at the end of last
week. And we are very pleased to have our group CIO with us today as John mentioned,
in case you have questions on the (00:04:33) or on any risk topics. And as usual please,
restrict yourself to two questions during the Q&A, register again for follow-up questions.
So with that, operator could you please have the first question?

Q&A

FINAL

The first question is from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hello. Hi, there. In your opening comments, John and I think in the press conference this
morning, you still described the pricing environment as still challenging, I think, were your
words. I mean, can you give us any additional color on that, has it become more
challenging? It looks like there was a kind of flat evolution with April renewals which I guess
is not surprising, so any more color would be useful on that.
Second question, Life Capital, I mean is there a black box as one – to try and work out sort
of the GAAP earnings? Is there any sort of things we should consider that, I think,
(00:05:27) press the result or you talked about the effective markets which obviously
lowered the linked fee income. Can you give us any flavors of the amount there or the net
strain that you're still seeing from the L&G savings business or net strain coming out of
the front books which I guess is still negative? Just any color on the median term run rate
GAAP earnings for Life Capital would be useful?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Operator
Andrew, thank you for that and I appreciate and to some degree of the frustration of
trying to model out Life Capital, there are a lot of moving parts there. Let me start with
the first question you had on the price environment. I think, the April renewals which were
dominated frankly by our business in Japan didn't bring a lot of new information to us. As I
said, we continue to be able to get the rates that we saw in the January 1, a net increase
of 2% with the LPTA (00:06:39) of 103%.
Our overall sense is we will see more in June and July with the renewals in the U.S. market
with the loss affected portfolios and our expectations are that prices should continue to
deliver an inflection based on the actual performance and actually the insufficient pricing
we saw through 2017. So, I guess, I'd say we would have more to tell you on our half year
results in terms of real color there.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Where you are referring to the fact that there's just not enough price yet?

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

I think, our expectation and we mentioned this at the full year results was, with the $140
billion of losses in 2017, the market should have reacted a little stronger than it did. Now
part of this is both a supply issue as well as demand issue. We are seeing people
interested in additional and broader coverage on the reinsurance buying. So the demand,
I think is there at the moment. Supply is meeting that demand and I suggest that Swiss Re
continues to be one of the leaders in trying to push for adequate pricing across the

board. We're comfortable with what the business we're riding and the prices we are
achieving, but obviously, it's constraining our growth compared to some of our
competitors.
With respect to Life Capital, I'd say that probably, I can give you a little bit of color. The
L&G portfolio integration is going to not deliver any material earnings to this business for
the next quarters. And in fact, there are some costs, not large, but real cost in bringing
this portfolio onboard. I think, as the UK equity markets were down about 8% in the first
quarter that has had an impact on the fee income for the unit linked businesses that we
have within Reinsurance. So that's been a net negative for the quarter.
I think, thirdly, the open book business (00:09:18) in particular, does have a growth strain
and you see that we were able to grow our premiums in that segment strongly in the first
quarter. There was one significant transaction with STQ (00:09:32) in Europe which
accounts for a substantial part of that, but net-net there was a new business strain and
that is there. So, I think, those three factors together dampen the profitability for the
quarter and we would expect as markets behave a little better that we can show some
improvement in these numbers obviously after a pretty low starting point in the following
quarters.

All right. Thanks, Andrew, for your question. Can we have the next question, please?

The next question is from Kamran Hossain from RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi, everyone. Just one question from me. Currently P&C Reinsurance has had a pretty
good start to the year, and some decent improvement in the combined ratio there. And in
Corporate Solutions, I guess things are a little bit flat year-on-year in terms of profitability.
Could you give us an indication on rate increases at Corporate Solutions, or if you can't
give a number, whether the rates increases for Corporate Solutions are above those seen
for Reinsurance? Thank you.

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Sure. So I think at the Investor Day, Agostino, our CEO of Corporate Solutions, gave an
indication that he was expecting a 5% increase on average across the board for his
business for the year. I think to-date we've been a little shy of that, but we still see that as
a reasonable objective for the full year, and we'll see if we can reach that during the
course of the year.
I do think importantly in the Corporate Solutions business, since we don't have a big
January 1 renewals but rather the portfolio goes through a normal year cycle, you've not
seen much of the post 2017 book actually come on board yet. And so a little different than
Reinsurance where the premiums on 1/1 came in. This is going to take a little more time
Page 4 of 12



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG

for us to get that combined ratio down as a result of better pricing in the current
environment.

All right. Thanks, Kamran, for your question. Can we have het next question, please?

Operator
The next question is from William Hawkins from KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hello. Hi, John. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, you have the big gross cash
generation in Life Capital. Has that already affected the outlook that you gave us at the
Investor Day of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion over the 2016 to 2018 period? And if so, roughly
by how much, I'm trying to get a feel for what's been the scale of this one-off ?
And then, secondly, I know that you guys care a lot more about EVM than you do U.S.
GAAP and there has been a lot of stuff going on this year with big contracts in volatile
capital markets and the rest of it. So I just wonder if you could give us – given that you care
more about those numbers, give us any kind of indication of how the EVM performance
has gone yesterday, any notable factors?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

So I think on the second question, I can give you an answer, which you may not be looking
forward, but won't be surprised. We really don't release any quarterly indications on EVM.
And I don't expect that we'll start doing that any time soon. But as you rightly point out,
there is a little bit of noise in these U.S. GAAP numbers. It's frustrating to us. I'm hoping
that in future quarters, this impact of the – having a ride through the unrealized losses or
in some cases gains, equity portfolio won't have this kind of an impact.
On the gross cash generation, you're right. $705 million brings us awful close to the
finalized in the three-year target after two years and one quarter. I'd say we would expect
later this year to be able to provide you with more guidance on future years delivery of
cash, but we're not at this point in time changing what we got (00:13:58) that's out there
currently.

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, firstly, how big do you think the premium
base in Corporate Solutions needs to get to, to give you the sort of desired scale that
you're looking for? That's first question just in the context of the 30% growth we've seen
today.
And secondly, there were small positive reserve releases in P&C Re in the first quarter.
Can you give us some color on how that develops in property versus casualty (00:14:41) or
California wildfires? Thank you.

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So let me take the second question first. We have, in P&C Re, had a, as we said, a modest
positive prior year development. I can say that it was also modestly positive in our casualty
book of business. And so, that was one of the areas where people seemed very
concerned in the Investor Relations Day and I was pleased to say that the reserves there
continue to demonstrate their resilience.
No specifics on HIM or California wildfires. I think we're probably able to say more about
that development later this year. On how big this (00:15:37) have to be, we're obviously
continuing the growth you see year-on-year. There is actually a fairly strong growth in
Corporate Solutions. I can attribute that to three specific areas. One, the U.S. accident and
health business where we've acquired a company two years ago has continued the strong
source of growth. Similarly, some specialty lines in our European markets have delivered a
nice premium uptick in 2018. And third, the joint venture with Bradesco in Brazil has come
online. And for those three, plus a little bit of a tailwind from foreign exchange are
responsible for this growth here in the first quarter. We have not done a material
expansion either of our property book or casualty book, and I think as we (00:16:41) some
verticals with the price environment is probably put some constraints on our ability to
grow strongly there.
The overall size, I'd say we're keen to be over time a major player in the commercial
insurance space. How big we have to be? It's a little bit of a moving target as some
people continue to consolidate, but I think the expectation is we would continue our bolton acquisitions, continue the investments in primarily – expect at some point of time to be
materially larger than we are today.

The next question is from Thomas Fossard from HSBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon. Two questions on my side. One for John and one for Patrick.
Question for John is on the P&C Re, you site 92% combined ratio, Q1. Can you put that in
the context of the full-year guidance of 99%? I mean any (00:17:50) deviation from the
Page 6 of 12



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG

Date: 2018-05-04

FINAL

full-year guidance you have provided with full-year number. And the question for Patrick is
looking at the FCR report (00:18:01), I'm assuming that I have been quite surprised to see
how high was the SST ratio of the Reinsurance division 252%. How should we take this
number or read this number as actually you mentioned in the past that a significant
amount of the excess capital should be upstream at the HoldCo and not be holding in the
entity or operating entity level. So I mean, is 250%, 230% that was a level in 2017 about
the right level of comfort you need to keep at the Reinsurance level? Thank you.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Thanks, Thomas. And maybe we will start with John.

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Sure. So in relating to the combined ratio, I think we were in a fairly benign quarter with
respect to large losses. In Reinsurance, we consider a large loss something in excess of
$20 million and we had neither – and in that cat more, any manmade loss coming into the
category of large losses for Q1 for Reinsurance. But further, there were a whole lot of
small and medium losses that accumulated which kept the combined ratio at 92%. There's
nothing we see that would lead us to change our full-year guidance of 99% and so we're
comfortable with – sorry, that estimate is a good estimate to hold on to. Maybe Patrick?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Raaflaub

{BIO 16381419 <GO>}

Yeah. So we are – and as you know, we are not giving specific target for the business unit
or the subsidiary company. We only communicate the internal respectability target of
220% SST for the entire group. That is for the first time -within the FCR (00:20:23), you
see a little bit more details of how the group – the components of the group and how
they look under the SST format. And that you could expect that that might fluctuate a little
bit in the future, but there's not really much I can say about or more detail I can give you
on the Swiss Re Zurich (00:20:56) or the business unit Reinsurance SST ratio.
So, maybe also important to see also from the group perspective that why the SST target
is a very important target from a risk policy standpoint. It's not the only indicator, not the
only measure that we use to see the group's capitalization. So it's a significant one, but
it's not the only one. And it also depends obviously at any given point in time how much
capital is deployed, for example, in financial risk, whether the ratio is above and – or how
significantly it may be above that target or even, as the case may be, slightly below that
target.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. I have two questions. My first question is on the buyback.
If you change the conditionality, could you also comment on how you are going to execute
it while it will be on a steady basis or you might become more opportunistic on this? And
then secondly also a question on Financial Condition Report, I realize that on one side the
target, the risk capital for P&C increased by around about 10%. As on the other side,
mainly all peak risks, they declined. So could you bridge this development for us?

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Sure. I'll take the first question on the buyback. We'll delegate the operational activities of
buying the shares to a bank here in Switzerland, but we have the responsibility of the
target. Finish date would be in February of next year, and absent any additional insights,
we would expect that they would spread this out reasonably evenly over the course of
the year (00:23:15) the opportunity in a particular week or month to do a little more
because of softness in our share price, that's up to them, not directed by us.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

All right, Patrick...

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Raaflaub

{BIO 16381419 <GO>}

On your second question, really the major reason for this seeming discrepancy is that
reserve risk went up because of the nat cat events of the last year. And that increased the
target capital because obviously there's some reserve uncertainty for which we have to
hold capital according to our model.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

All right. Thanks, Frank, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please?

Operator
The next question is from Thomas Seidl from Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yeah. Good afternoon. First one on Cor So, there I was quite surprised to see the strong
growth given your comment on rather low price increase. You now explained this is from
three segments; U.S. A&H, specialty in Europe, and the joint venture. Could you explain a
little bit more what exactly you are writing, especially the U.S. accident and health? I think
it's about $200 million in total.
And the second question on the P&C Re business. If I strip out the price increase,
premium is flat year-on-year despite your price signals pointing to 103%, adequacies are
not too bad in historic terms. Does it mean basically you need to maintain this topline just
to keep this price level and hence if prices do not change at the mid-year, we should
expect a flat topline for Swiss Re in the P&C Re business? Thank you.

FINAL

U.S. accident and health.

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Sorry. Within the accident and health, remember, two years ago, we bought a business – a
smallish business in the U.S. called IHC. This is employee stop loss. So employers or
companies which are clients of Cor So run their own accident and health programs for
their employees. We come in on the back end of that and assume where is (00:25:52) risk
for these programs and that's a business which has been profitable and which we've
been able to grow our market share in the U.S. market year-on-year, the first quarter was
actually a very nice and strong growth.
On the P&C Re, we will continue to hold the line on we think are appropriate price levels
and if that provides the opportunity for growth on our (00:26:24) book through the year,
we're up 7%. We'll take that. And if for some reason, the prices are being undercut by
other providers that are (00:26:40) prepared to work with them, we don't feel the need
to grow this business at unreasonable price levels.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. So one question on Life Re please one on Corporate Solutions. On
the Life Re, I noted with interest that there's not much mention of U.S. mortality pickup.
We have seen some very sharp increases from flu-related deaths, for example, and from
one of your peers a lot of comments on that. And could you just comment a bit about
what you are seeing in your book, maybe it didn't bother you, maybe the frequency was
not enough to be a problem, but just a comment would help, please.
Second thing is, just on Corporate Solutions profitability, there is a 100-odd combined
ratio without any TYD (00:27:43) problems, which we have seen in recent data from
Corporate Solutions. It means – and as you've written in your press release that some
business from previous underwriting years was harming. What is the deal here? I mean do
you think this previous year business would continue beyond maybe this year to affect
number on a current year basis? Thanks.

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Sure. So on the first one, yeah, we did (00:28:12) know there is a little bit of a seasonal
impact on the U.S. mortality, and also a few severe claims for our Life portfolio. But we
don't extrapolate either those to any particular trend issues and as you see that we were
able to endure those bumps in part because of the size of the portfolio and strong
performance in other places. So we don't feel that – there was some issue. It wasn't
material enough for us to spend a lot of time talking about it. With respect to the Cor So,
we believe the reserves are at the correct levels, as you said correctly, either there was
no negative prior year development. It was effectively flat for the quarter. And our
expectation is that the new business that comes on during 2018 will start to trend this
number down, not dramatically and not quickly, but 2017 business will continue to be
influencing that performance through this year and by this time a year from now we
expect that the better pricing that we are achieving should help us with a more
sustainable combined ratio that starts with the 9.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ivan Bokhmat

{BIO 15378004 <GO>}

Hi, thank you for asking my question. I have a question regarding the earnings volatility
from the equity mark-to-market. I appreciate there was a new accounting policy adopted,
but I suppose it will become a recurring feature in your results going forward. I was just
wondering how you think about managing this volatility in future?

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

We would like to see equity markets go up and so the volatility we manage is a volatility
on the upside. But look, I think, we've got about $6.6 billion (00:30:39) of investments
that are in the bucket, which is going to show this kind of volatility. That's a little about
5.5% or maybe 5% of the total investment portfolio. I don't think we want the accounting
rules to change our strategic asset allocation. And therefore, the best we can probably do
is just be transparent. And so, with every quarter we're going to provide this comparison
that you see here in Q1, which says what the 2018 result for the half year, for three
quarters, for the full-year would have been under the previous accounting standards, so
you can do your comparison back to 2017.
In 2019 my expectation is that we'll simply provide the movement in the quarter for
unrealized gains or losses out of this portfolio. So unfortunately, in the first quarter that we
applied this, it is negative and it's substantial. What the slide we included in the Investor
Day presentation where we flagged that this was coming, I think, demonstrated that for
many quarters, at least historically over the last three years, the impact tended to be
much smaller. And so, we hope that it will be a little less of a distraction in those quarters.
But we've invested in these equity shares because we think it's an intelligent place for us
Page 10 of 12



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG

Date: 2018-05-04

to allocate the funds that we get from writing our business and I don't expect that we'll
materially reduce that portfolio for the reasons of volatility.

The next question is from Stefan Schürmann from Vontobel. Please go ahead.

Q - Stef an Schürmann
Yes. Good afternoon. I had just two small questions, the first one on the cash generation
on the $705 million in the Life Capital. Can you maybe give us some qualitative split of
that, how much stems from the Solvency II adjustment, how much from margin and how
much from the 5% stake of Mitsui? And then, the second one on growth in Life & Health,
just can you give me some insight here how much is coming from the Life side and what
from the Health side if possible?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

So on first one, the gross cash generation, I think, as we said the two major single pieces
are the Solvency II finalization for ReAssure and secondly the investment from NS Navy
(00:33:26), I can suggest that the latter of those was approximate – will be more than
$200 million and actually, I think, you probably do the math to get to $240 million for that
number. The Solvency II amount was also substantial in the quarter and, but I don't know
that if (00:33:53) released the absolute amount, but it's the only other major piece worth
noting, I think. The important piece for us is that gross cash generation eventually will
allow us to consider important dividends coming up from (00:34:14) capital into the group
and we look forward as the group CFO to that flow for Swiss Re Group.

A - Philippe Brahin

Regarding the second question, Stefan, I think, you should expect that Q1 to reflect a bit
what we have seen in terms of split between Life and Health, Life being 60% of the book
and Health 40%, though we don't provide more detail, you'll have more at H1.
All right, so actually this is the last question, so thanks, Stefan again for your question. And
we come to the end of the Q&A review, John and Patrick Raaflaub for joining and all of
you for joining today. Maybe you can take to reach out to any member of the IR team if
you have follow-up questions. And with that, thank you again for your participation.

Operator
Thank you for your participation ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.
