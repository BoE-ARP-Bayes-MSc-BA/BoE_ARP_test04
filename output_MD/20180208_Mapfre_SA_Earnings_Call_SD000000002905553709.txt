Good morning. Welcome to MAPFRE's results presentation for full year 2017.

Bloomberg Transcript

On this occasion, it's a pleasure to have Mr. Antonio Huertas, our Chairman and CEO, here
with us. He will start providing us with a brief review of the main highlights of the year. And
at the end of the presentation, he will also participate in the Q&A session. It's also a
pleasure to present our CFO, our member of the board, Mr. Fernando Mata, who will take
you through the main trends of this period, as in previous quarters. As usual, during the
final Q&A, all questions received in the specified e-mail address will be answered by our
speakers. And the Investor Relation team will be available to answer any further questions
you may have after that.
And now let me hand the call over to our CEO.

Antonio Huertas MejÃ­as
Thank you, Natalia. And good morning, everyone. Before we run through the numbers, I
would like to go over the main highlights of 2017.
The Fourth Quarter results have been excellent in the wake of the catastrophe events
occurred during the year. We are happy to announce that our initial loss estimates have
been revised downwards, thanks to our effective reinsurance program. Fernando will give
you more detail later.
I'd like to make a special mention of 2 units that are performing extremely well, Iberia and
MAPFRE RE, where our profitable growth strategy is proving to be a great success.
LATAM North, LATAM South and EURASIA have also shown exceptional results. Other core
units for us, Brazil and United States, need more time to reflect in their accounts the
effect of the measures that are being already implemented.

Regarding to the Fourth Quarter results, I'd like to highlight that the NatCat losses were
lower than our initial estimated, supported by an effective reinsurance policy; secondly,
the extraordinary income in U.S. and Brazil; thirdly, significant progress made in cost
reduction program; and lastly, successful management of our investment portfolio.

FINAL

Overall 2016 (sic) (2017) results exceed EUR 700 million allowing us to propose a total
dividend of EUR 0.145 per share, the same of the last year.
Moving to Slide 4. Here, we are presenting the breakdown of shareholder remuneration
for the last six years. At this point, I'd also like to highlight MAPFRE's commitment to stable
ongoing shareholder remuneration.
For the year 2016, the final dividend to be proposed to the AGM stands at EUR 0.85,
equivalent to a 63.7% payout ratio, which is within our target range. Therefore, the total
dividend for the year will amount to EUR 0.145. I'd like to assert that this high dividend
shows our strong commitment to our shareholders, especially in such a difficult year in
terms of cat events.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's move to Slide 5. Going into more detail, let me give you a brief summary by
business unit. Spain, we have grown in our line of business with an excellent technical
results, thanks to our prudent underwriting guidelines and gaining market share in the
majority of business lines.
In Brazil, one of MAPFRE's main feature is our business diversification. And in this country,
this has helped us offset the effects of strong competition in motor business with
outstanding results in other lines.
We are confident that the improvement of the economic environment in the country is
underway. In addition, we have just announced the signing of a memorandum of
understanding with our partner, Banco do Brasil, to update our bancassurance agreement
after six years of success.
According to this new agreement, MAPFRE will own 100% of the business generated by
the agent network and the Motor and Large Risk assessments in BB, Banco do Brasil,
bancassurance channel. However, it won't affect life and agro business. We are very happy
with our partnership with Banco do Brasil. And we are layering the foundations to make it
more efficient and profitable. Both groups think the same. We have now more
opportunities to increase business and profits.
Now let me talk about the U.S. markets, where the Northeast region continues to be key
to MAPFRE.
As we announced during our last Investor Day, we have already implemented a new
strategic plan for this country and expect to see results soon. As far as I know, we are
closer to exit from the states where we have always decided. Also, we have benefited

Page 2 of 20



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2018-02-08

from their recent tax reform, which has allowed -- has had a EUR 38 million on attributable
result.

FINAL

As we also announced, during the Investor Day, we have already joined the former EMEA
and APAC regions to whether into EURASIA. And our figures have been reported
accordingly as you will see during the presentation.
In Germany, the rebranding of our direct business into VERTI has been a great success. In
Italy, we will start with the rebranding in a few weeks. In this country, we are starting to see
premium increases and a (positive) firming of the business. Malta and Turkey have also
reported spectacular increases in results. All in all, they give us healthy growth in EURASIA.
In LATAM North, Dominican Republic and Central American countries are doing very well
with outstanding performance. Mexico, which is still in transition, has implemented many
measures to improve.
LATAM South is showing an excellent improvement in many countries, like Colombia and
Argentina. Furthermore, Peru and other countries present great results as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

Going to Slide 6. MAPFRE. We are very proud of our reinsurance unit. MAPFRE RE's
performance has been outstanding in a difficult year, thanks to its excellence in
underwriting and effective reinsurance program, which have allowed it to successfully
manage the impact of the catastrophes.
Additionally, we have seen the benefits of diversification both geographically and by
business mix.
MAPFRE GLOBAL RISKS suffered heavily under cat events. Also during the year, it had a
few numbers of losses, which affected dramatically its results.
And finally, ASISTENCIA unit is being very closely monitored and improvements are
expected, thanks to the strict underwriting cost-cutting and restructuring processes
implemented.
Let's move to Slide seven where you can see the main figures for the quarter.
Revenues went up to EUR 28 billion, with an increase of 3.3%. Life insurance shows a
better performance with 4.2% of growth. P&C represents 77% of our total premiums and
grew by 2.6%.
In the middle of that line, you can see premium growth, excluding foreign exchange rate
effects, which shows a premium growth of 4.1% without this effect.
Combined ratio stood at 98.1% and expenses remained stable. Loss ratio went up mainly
due to the weather-related losses.

The column on the right shows data excluding the NatCat events that affected MAPFRE's
primary insurance business during 2017. The result stood at over EUR 700 million, with
nearly EUR 256 million during the Fourth Quarter.

FINAL

Excluding these cat events, the results would have increased by 6.5% to EUR 826 million,
a reduction of 1.2percentage points on the combined ratio.
The ROE would have reached over 9%.
Finally, I'd like to highlight the excellent solvency ratio, which was 189% by September
2017.
Now I will hand the call over to Fernando Mata.

Thank you, Antonio. Good morning, everybody, especially those connected from this -early birds connected from the States. I know too early. I'm happy to have this opportunity
to be here with you again. Before going into the details of our annual accounts, let's take
a look at the impact of exceptional catastrophic losses on MAPFRE results in 2017.
These events were the largest accumulation of cat events in a 3-week period in all
MAPFRE's history. We were very accurate in our initial loss estimates, releasing figures
ahead of our peers. The gross loss is now estimated at just over EUR 1 billion with EUR
100 million reduction compared to the initial estimate.
Of this EUR 1 billion at year-end, EUR 189 million correspond to claims paid, EUR 552
million of outstanding claims. And the remaining EUR 306 million of IBNR reserves.
The total net loss is EUR 183.8 million, including the Coastal NiÃ±o, of which EUR 125.6
million correspond to losses at primary insurance units, the remainder at MAPFRE RE.
During the last quarter, the main variations were a significant reduction in losses at
MAPFRE RE and GLOBAL RISKS, which was slightly offset by increasing losses in Puerto
Rico.
MAPFRE's strict underwriting policy and our reinsurance protection has helped mitigate
the impact. Also we have implemented the necessary processes in each of the affected
countries to handle and settle all claims as quickly as possible. However, settlement will go
on for months and some of this adjustment could be quite complex.
On this slide, you have the breakdown of premiums and results by region and business
unit. You can see that MAPFRE's appropriate geographic mix has also helped our resilient
results. Reinsurance units represent 75% of business volume. And MAPFRE RE represents
over 16%, with the remainder of premiums at GLOBAL RISKS and MAPFRE ASISTENCIA.

Regarding reinsurance units, Iberia represents nearly 27% of total premiums, followed by
Brazil with 18.6% and the rest of LATAM with over 13%.

FINAL

North America contributes nearly 10% of business volume and EURASIA also has a strong
share with 7%.
On the right, you can see the evolution by business unit, which we will discuss in more
detail in the following slides. Regarding attributable results, Iberia stands out with over
EUR 500 million, by far the largest contributor.
I would like to also point out the strong recovery in EURASIA, with an over EUR 100 million
increase in net result as well as an over EUR 50 million improvement in LATAM South.
These are both clear example of the success of diversity in processes that have been
implemented in both regions during the last two years. Furthermore, the results in Brazil
have proven very resilient taking into account the market context.
MAPFRE RE has performed very well too, especially considering NatCat events.
Finally, Iberia's results, excluding real estate transactions, grew by almost EUR 27 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

On this slide, you can see that the revenue was up over 3%, supported by the positive
evolution of premiums, while financial income is still being affected by lower reinvestment
deals across LATAM basically and Europe.
Our income grew substantially, sustaining from positive currency differences. The Life
business grew by over 4% and Non-Life by 2.6% despite the cancellation of more than
EUR 528 million of loss-making portfolios, in line with profitable growth strategy that
started two years ago.
Growth was positively affected by a multiyear policy in Mexico for nearly EUR 500 million,
issued in June 2017, already mentioned in previous quarters.
In addition, I would like to highlight the following. In Spain, the Life business is performing
extremely well, especially in unit-linked, with outstanding performance in the
bancassurance channel. Retail Motor and Health are also growing, thanks to new
campaigns and fine-tuning of some products.
In Brazil, we're seeing some green shoots with a slight pickup in premiums in local
currency. But the appreciation of the Brazilian real is still the main growth driver.
Let's move on to the next page. Slide 11, I would like to take a look at the extraordinary
impacts that have affected MAPFRE's net results. 2017 was a special year in terms of
complexity and one-offs.

Page 5 of 20



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2018-02-08

And we have already mentioned the largest effect has been NatCat losses, with a net
impact of around EUR 126 million.

FINAL

Net realized gains were also EUR 75 million lower than 2017 -- '16, sorry, comprising both
financial investment and real estate.
The decrease is mainly due to the sale of MAPFRE Tower in 2016 and lower realized gains
in the Fourth Quarter of this year.
On the other hand, we booked 2 non-recovering positive events in December this year.
The first impact is related to the write-down of intangibles. As you may recall, last year, we
wrote down goodwill by over EUR 46 million, mainly in Italy.
In 2017, the positive net impact of EUR 28 million is the result of write-downs with goodwill
and other intangibles for EUR 75 million, offset by the cancellation of our provision
amounting to EUR 103 million.
With these cancellations, we have aligned balance sheet valuations with the current
economic context and distribution structure in Brazil.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second, there is an extraordinary income of EUR 38 million at MAPFRE USA as a result of
the decreasing deferred tax liabilities from the U.S. tax reform.
And last, EUR 27 million positive impact due to the reversal of a provision for
bancassurance made in the First Quarter of 2017 that you already know.
On the screen, you can see the breakdown of key Non-Life figures by region and unit. The
result of Non-Life was impacted by: first, the falling underlying financial result mainly due
to a decline in deals and inflation in Brazil and the rest of LATAM, as well as the low
interest rate environment in Europe; second, the already mentioned cat losses of the
period, affecting mainly North America, MAPFRE RE and GLOBAL RISKS.
I would like to emphasize the following positive trends in combined ratio. The
improvement seen in Iberia, which I will cover in more detail later, the 6.3percentage-point
improvement in the combined ratio in EURASIA, thanks to successful restructuring and
better claims experience. And LATAM North, minus 4.2 bp; and LATAM South minus 2.2 bp,
are reaping the benefits of profitability initiatives.
On this slide, I would like to comment more in depth on the result of the Non-Life
business, which has proven quite resilient, excluding the impacts of NatCat events and
other nonrecurring events already mentioned. Please keep in mind that the extraordinary
events disclosed in this chart are before taxes and minorities.
As you can see, the underlined result decreased by EUR 69 million with 2 opposing
factors. First, there is an improvement in the technical result of EUR 62 million. Second, a

Page 6 of 20



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2018-02-08

decrease in the financial result of EUR 131 million due to the already mentioned reduction
in deals.

FINAL

On the right, you have the combined ratio information, which stood at 98.1%, 96.9%
excluding cat events.
While we're talking about Non-Life, I want to discuss the extraordinary Non-Life results in
Spain. The implementation of the Non-Life transformation process that began in 2015
focused on profitable growth is delivering results in Spain. You can see on the left, pretax
profit grew from EUR 235 million to EUR 427 million in two years. This outstanding
performance was achieved, mainly thanks to the reduction of the combined ratio, which
improved from 97% to 94%.
On the right, you can see the Motor premium growth, reaching 3.9% in retail lines, while
fleets are still decreasing. Total Motor premium growth was 3.5% compared to 3.4% for
the market.
MAPFRE EspaÃ±a is outperforming the market despite the cancellation of
underperforming business segments.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the year 2017, MAPFRE has continued reinforcing its leading position in the Non-Life
Spanish market and has increased its market share in Motor, Commercial and Health
business.
MAPFRE's growth is based on profitability and average Motor premium growth is well
above the market.
Continuing with their strategy for profitable growth, MAPFRE EspaÃ±a has implemented a
series of measures to control and reduce claims and expenses in Motor lines. All of these
measures have significantly lowered the combined ratio, which stood 5 points below the
market and has continued improving. At the close of 2017, MAPFRE's Motor combined
ratio stood at an extraordinary 90%.
I'm going to skip the 2 following slides, which contain the main highlights for Non-Life by
region and unit.
Moving on to information regarding the Life business. We will take a look at premiums,
which are up over 4%, thanks to the outstanding performance in the bancassurance
channel in Iberia as well as positive developments in Mexico, Colombia, Peru and MAPFRE
RE.
In Brazil, net premium are down 2% as a result of lower lending activity. The result of the
Life business is down slightly, largely driven by the declining financial income in Brazil due
to the sharp fall in interest rates and inflation.

Page 7 of 20

FINAL

This was mitigated by strong results in Colombia and Peru as well as the gains in Iberia
from the cancellation of the provision for continued liabilities in the bancassurance channel
already mentioned.
Shareholders' equity decreased by over 5% in the year, mainly as a result of the
depreciation of all of our main currencies. And I repeated, all of our main currencies,
especially the Brazilian real, nearly 14%; the U.S. dollar, around 12%; and the Turkish lira,
over 18%. All the Latin American currencies have also fallen in value against the euro.
Assets under management continue to grow steadily, thanks to the strong performance
of equity markets during the year. This positive trend was partially offset by the decrease
in the value of the bond portfolio due to an uptick in rates in Europe, especially at the
longer end of the curve.
Finally, the mutual and pension fund businesses continue with a strong growth, nearly 10%,
thanks to MAPFRE's successful strategy to foster the asset management business.
Next, please? Yes. As you can see on this slide, our investment strategy has been stable
throughout the year with a slight reduction in fixed income assets, mainly reinvesting in
equity and mutual funds but also in alternative assets. We took advantage of higher
volatility of the year to make changes in our portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

Please turn to the next slide. Realized gains in Non-Life are lower than the previous year's
figure, mainly as a result of the sale of MAPFRE Tower last year.
I would like to point out the high level of unrealized gains on our equity and mutual fund
portfolios. In Europe, around EUR 130 million. This gives us leverage to take advantage of
future market opportunities.
And finally, it's worth pointing out the high accounting deals in our portfolios, 2.6% in NonLife and over 4% in Life, well above market deals and quite stable during the year.
Next, please? Yes. On the left side, you can see the breakdown of our capital structure at
year-end, which amounted to EUR 12.8 billion. Its largest component is equity, with 82% of
the total. And you can see its breakdown on the chart on the bottom left.
The majority is capital, retained earnings and reserves. There are over EUR 600 million in
net unrealized capital gains, which remain, as you can see, quite stable for the last three
years, even after realizing over EUR 100 million in 2017.
Finally, these gains are offset by over EUR 700 million in negative foreign exchange
differences.
The right side, you can see the evolution of the shareholders' equity, which has fallen by
over EUR 500 million during the year to EUR 8.6 billion. The decline was largely driven by

Page 8 of 20



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2018-02-08

the depreciation of our main currencies, which we have already mentioned resulting in
EUR 639 million decrease in equity.

FINAL

On the other hand, there was a decrease in financial assets available for sale, which was
partially offset by shadow accounting.
On the next slide, we will present the Solvency II information, which was already given at
the Investor Day. So there are no further details to discuss now.
Yes. As a reminder, we will release the full year Solvency II figures with the First Quarter
2018 results, which will include the annual solvency capital requirement calculation.
That's all for me. As I said, 2017 was a complex year in terms of one-offs and cat events.
But we were more than happy with the final outcome.
We hope the information disclosed has been interesting for you. And now, Antonio
Huertas is going to discuss the MAPFRE Banco do Brasil alliance and wrap up the
presentation. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Antonio Huertas MejÃ­as
Thank you, Fernando. At this point, I would like to go back over our new scenario in Brazil.
You know we have just announced a memorandum of understanding to update our
agreement with Banco do Brasil. According to that, MAPFRE will control 100% of BB
MAPFRE's agency channel. Secondly, MAPFRE will also control 100% of Motor and Large
Risk business in the bancassurance channel. And next, MAPFRE will maintain exclusivity
both in Life and Non-Life for the distribution of products in the Banco do Brasil channel.
And finally, BB MAPFRE will focus on Life, Agricultural, SME. And Homeowner insurance for
Banco do Brasil customers.
Please turn to the next slide to see the main advantages of our new agreement. What will
this agreement bring to MAPFRE? In my own evaluation, firstly, it significantly increases our
shareholding in Brazil. Secondly, it increases the profit contribution, expanding its
consolidation scope from Brazil.
Also, it will simplify MAPFRE strategy execution in Brazil and eliminate shared
management restrictions, giving us even more freedom to make management decisions.
Moreover, leverage the MAPFRE brand in Brazil, becoming (alone) the second largest
Non-Life insurer in the country. And last but not least, exclusivity in the Bank of Brazil
channel is maintained.
To draw the presentation to a close, I would like to outline some conclusions regarding
2017 MAPFRE performance. Firstly, MAPFRE has delivered solid results in an extremely
complicated year.

Page 9 of 20



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2018-02-08

Secondly, we continued demonstrating our financial strength, conservative management
strategy and a continuous commitment to our shareholders.

FINAL

Also, after the successful implementation in Iberia, the focus on profitable growth is
beginning to bear fruit in other regions.
To wrap things up, we are satisfied with the results of our well-defined and well-executed
strategy.
Thank you. And now I will let Natalia begin with the Q&A session.

Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

Thank you, Antonio. Thank you, Fernando. We hope that you have found this presentation
useful and that we were able to cover the main topics of your interest.
And now, as in other quarters, we will try to answer all the questions you have sent, time
permitting. If there are any remaining questions after this call, please feel free to contact
the Investor Relation team, who will be more than happy to help you with whatever you
may need.

Questions And Answers
A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Now let's start with the Q&A session. First question regarding Brazil, coming from Paco
Riquel Alantra Equities. It's regarding the reorganization of the JV in Brazil and the buyout
of the Non-Life business. Is this the year that you can finance with debt? Or would you
consider raising equity at all?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Paco. First of all. And as you know, I'm pretty happy, I mean, to answer your
question regarding Brazil. But there is not yet a deal. And what we have signed is a
nonbinding agreement. And we have to still -- to wait still probably a couple or three
months in order to wait and have the final contract. But anyway, I mean, let me say that
with this current nonbinding agreement, there is no change in the risk that we are taking in
Brazil. I mean, Solvency capital requirement will be quite similar. And also total assets as
well. But you are right. I mean, the only change that we have to replace, some of them are
minorities because the acquisition will be in cash. We have to replace minorities by some
sort of a capital instrument. At that point, we haven't decided yet. It could be both, I
mean, debt or we'll write issue. We haven't decided yet. And also you have to be
reminded as well that there is an excess of cash currently in Brazil that we can use for this
potential acquisition. Regarding our capital Solvency II ratio, capitals are currently excellent
and within the target range of EUR 175 million to EUR 225 million. So overall, we do not
expect a significant impact on our capital position.

FINAL

A - Antonio Huertas MejÃ­as
I'd like to add to Paco, information about your question, if we are able to get any synergy
or efficiency gain from this acquisition. It's -- indeed, we don't have any doubt about that.
You know that usually, when you run a company alone, it's better than doing that with -inside a joint venture. As well, MAPFRE has strong knowledge of P&C business. And
usually, in all the Latin American countries, we run these companies along, doing our risk,
getting excellent results. In terms of our business in Brazil, for real, we have had good
returns. And we know that managing this business, both the business coming from agent
channel and the Banco do Brasil channel, we can increase efficiency, mixing the teams
using one single platform and trying to make the most out of our knowledge. We haven't
yet quantified the savings. But we know that we will do better managing this business in
the newest scenario.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much. The next question is also regarding Brazil. It also comes from Paco
Riquel. And the question is, what is the financial criteria that MAPFRE will follow when
assessing such an acquisition?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Natalia. Back to our commitment, regarding the strategy planning, as we said,
we focus on our current footprint. And we were more than happy, I mean, to expand. And
also our current strategic operations. And obviously, Brazil, has been and will be for sure, I
mean, a strategic operational country for MAPFRE. It's a quite attractive market with an
excellent growth potential. And as you know, it's moving out of the recession. The current
macro figures, I mean, look much better. Regarding insurance, it's a country which has still
low insurance penetration. So it gives a lot of opportunities in order to expand our
premium volume in Brazil. Regarding valuation, the assessment of the business that we
will acquire. Both BB Seguridade and MAPFRE both are listed companies. So we're
together, both teams -- in order to get market price valuation for this transaction. (It can)
the other way. So for sure, we will have an arm's length transaction at the end of the
discussions. Obviously, we'll look at the potential synergies, as Antonio said. And future
business plans and so on.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Fernando. Next one also on Brazil. What has been the net
attributable profit in 2017 of your 50% stake in the Non-Life business in Brazil? And was it
impacted by any one-offs?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Paco. As you know, the stakes or the corporation in Brazil, they are split
not into Life and Non-Life. But into bancassurance channel and the agency channels.
Majority of the bancassurance channel comprise Life. But there is Non-Life. So we don't
have with me at this point -- I mean, the right figure regarding Life and Non-Life. But let
me say that the current scenario in Brazil, I mean, is not the best for Non-Life business.
Automobile combined ratio stands for MAPFRE nearly 108%. Fortunately, other lines of
business, they're offsetting this bad results. But overall, we're quite happy, I mean, with
Page 11 of 20

FINAL

Brazil performance. Regarding one-offs, as I mentioned, the most relevant one-off is the
EUR 28 million, which is the net effect of the write-downs of intangible assets for Non-Life.
And also the cancellation of provision for expenses and risk.
Both balances were accounted for in 2011 as a result of the fund bancassurance alliance
that year with Banco do Brasil and both have been canceled. The provision for EUR 103
million, the liability, was established at that year to cover the potential risk for different
sort of expenses. And it was canceled because it was no liability further for MAPFRE. On
the other hand. And in that case, there are 2 main reasons. First is the current economic
situation Brazil, particularly affecting the Motor line. And also the final outcome of the
alliance with Banco do Brasil. So in the end, we thought that both the environment and the
change in the alliance could affect any potential impairment of our goodwill. And with this,
I guess, well, the board decided to write off both in all sort of intangibles affecting the
agency channel. Particular -- mainly was a goodwill. But it was a small amount, well of a
value or book acquire. So basically, this was the one-off, separated into assets and liability,
income and expenses and affected more than Non-Life. It affected the agency channel.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. I think it's clear. Anyway, if you need further explanation, we are available later on.

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Next one, also from -- regarding Brazil is the question coming from Andrew Sinclair,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch. How much is MAPFRE paying up from the standard Banco
do Brasil relationship?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well as we said, this is a nonbinding agreement. We haven't set the price, the
consideration yet. It will take at least 2 or three months. The first thing we have to get -we have to complete is the independent review of the financial accounts and get the
independent auditor's reports and also to draft the final contract. But Andrew, for sure, as
I said, the transaction will be at market price. I mean, both are listed companies. And in the
end, we'll have an arm's length transaction, 100% sure.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you. We continue with Andrew Sinclair on Brazil questions. Brazil Life premiums are
still declining year-on-year in local currency. What signs have you seen of a turnaround?
Yes. You're right. The Life business fell and affected by the drop of Life potential
insurance. You know that the -- you very well know that there is no savings business in
Brazil. Let's say that the trend is well linked to personal loan from Banco do Brasil. We
haven't seen yet a relevant increase in the lending activity. So the evolution in the next
quarter will depend basically to the recovery of the economy. We'll keep the same trend.
In the end, it will be an increase of lending activity. I guess that the process is underway,
the recovery on the banking activity, as I said. And also the distribution of personal loans
from Banco do Brasil.

Great. This one, from Andrew Sinclair also, is regarding the Brazilian investment income
both in Life and Non-Life, that it has been materially lower in Q3. Should we expect further
deterioration in Q4 as the Selic has declined further?

FINAL

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

You're right. I mean, we've seen a relevant drop in the deals in Brazil. We still remember
those good times with the Selic rate above 12%. Last year, at year-end, it was nearly 7%,
the deal. Sometimes we said. And we were right, that our portfolio was privileged. But it
won't last forever. I mean, we have to attend the maturities. And we're trying to replace
with higher deals available in the market. But this year was a significant decrease in
financial -- recurring financial income, approximately EUR 100 million. The impact on the
net result is completely different because in Brazil, there is only 25% net results from Life,
mainly coming from BB. But in Non-Life, affected basically 50%. As long as the GDP grows
up and the interest drops, which is what we're seeing, let's say, that we're trying to
compensate both factors, inflation rate, they are decreasing. We expect a very good
impact in our structural cost in Brazil. So far, what we've seen since the majority of our
investments are inflation-linked instruments, what we've seen is the damage on the value
of their financial income. But we expect to see the effect of the inflation drop in our loss
and expense ratio during this year and probably next as well.

Anyway, in the financial information we have released, in the Brazil part, you can see that
we have estimated around EUR 100 million decline in financial income during this year,
both Life and Non-Life. You can -- if you need further explanation. But you can find it in the
Brazil part in the financial MD&A that we have released today.
So the next question is regarding MAPFRE U.S.A. Now the first one comes from Paco
Riquel. If -- can you update on the restructuring plan in the U.S. the exit from several states
that we had announced during the Investor Day and on the online launch in Pennsylvania?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Paco. What we're seeing and probably, Antonio will then give you an additional
comment as well, we expected both transactions, the one in the middle states and also
New Jersey being pretty difficult. We know that because of the size of some operations in
some states that are quite small and also because they will run in losses, the beginning
we thought that it was a difficult task. Fortunately, we've seen some interest for both
operations. And we are quite optimistic in the medium run. I mean, we don't see any solid
expectation to fulfill both operations in the future 2, three months. But at least, we've
seen a lot of interest for both operations. I don't know, Antonio, you want to add
something?

A - Antonio Huertas MejÃ­as
Yes. It's true. We are very positive. And we should expect major changes, advances in the
process in upcoming months. It's not easy as you know that in the States, we have to
follow a strict regulatory process to exit from different states. But the interest that our
operation has surged -- has appeared has been very, very positive. And we think we are

achieving our goals in the next few months. Talking about our development of the new
operation in Pennsylvania, VERTI, I have to say that it's very soon to say information about
that. Our VERTI launching has been very, very soft. It's a better operation. And we're still
trying to improve the system, to make it -- fine-tuning in tariffs to know better the market
competition in the States. And even the development of boat is still on track. We are
trying to make changes in the next months to improve the development -- the
distribution, the distribution platform and how we can be more competitive in the States.
But in total, we are happy with our launching in Pennsylvania. And we have completed the
launching in record time. And the thing is ready to reach its objectives.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

If I may add something as well. The most likely transaction that we're looking at now is
renewal rights, the sale of renewal rights for the central states. And there is some interest
for the operations. I mean, there's cooperation from business in New York and New
Jersey.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. And now regarding taxes. How much of the EUR 38 million
positive impact from the U.S. tax reform on the attributable result, how much is -- could be
considered recurring?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Antonio Huertas MejÃ­as
Yes. Thank you, Andrew. It was a great surprise. It was our Christmas present from Trump.
We didn't expect, anyway. But let's say that we consider it as a one-off. And it won't be
recurring. That EUR 38 million positive impact is after-tax, obviously. It came from the
decrease of the tax liabilities. Unfortunately, I mean, the tax assets stemming from
MAPFRE ASISTENCIA, we wrote-off because of the running losses for this unit. And the
EUR 38 million is affecting MAPFRE U.S.A. They're coming -- the reason is basically timing
differences, mainly the useful lives used to calculate depreciation, different from tax
purposes and for IFRS purposes. Obviously, it will be a recurring effect because going
forward, the tax rate will go down from 35% to 21%. And so we will expect a higher net
result coming from MAPFRE U.S.A. business.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Great. Thank you. Now we are changing -- moving to MAPFRE GLOBAL RISKS. Carlos
Peixoto from BPI remarks that its Fourth Quarter combined ratio was quite low. What was
behind the improvement? Any release of provisions here?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

There is nothing relevant, I mean, in the Fourth Quarter rather than the degrees of the
EUR 40 million from the cat losses. And also, the good performance at (Solonian) and the
agreement for the security business, which contributed (inaudible) net income of EUR 5
million. But in general, I mean, the Fourth Quarter was quite steady in terms of losses. And
whether it was quite benign both in the U.S -- there was a big snowfall in Massachusetts.
But it was quite benign in Spain. Unfortunately, the change -- the weather change in

Page 14 of 20



Company N ame: M apfre SA

January. And we had the severe weather in both, in the U.S., in Massachusetts and also in
Spain in January, as you know well.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Now Michael Huttner from JP Morgan wants to know what should
we expect in terms of your challenging units in full year '18? What is the outlook at
ASISTENCIA? Will it profit this year? How much can you reduce the losses in Italy and
Germany this year?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well I'll take it. And I'm sure Antonio will give some comments as well. ASISTENCIA, as you
know, we've been dealing with the current problems of ASISTENCIA for the last two years.
The first phase was focused on selling unprofitable business. It was mainly 2016 acrossthe-board but mainly focused on Europe and the U.K. Travel assistance and multiyear
portfolios were provoking a lot of the losses. The second phase was focused on balance
sheet cleanup and adjusting some cost structure to business volume. We started
deteriorating and writing off intangible assets as the decrease -- I mean, in the business
projections. We wrote down as well some debtors and in the end some tax assets, as I
mentioned, particularly in the U.S. The reduction of expenses was made that year -- at the
year-end of 2017. So we will look at the 2018 loss cost structure lower than last year. So in
the end, we expect better results. But I mean, it's too early to say that probably we will
see a turnaround next year with small loss.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Antonio Huertas MejÃ­as
Yes. I would like, Fernando, to add some words about MAPFRE development during the
2018 year. We are very positive because we think that the units that are going well will be
on the same line. Iberia and MAPFRE RE are already at excellent profitability levels. But we
can still expect some room for improvement, especially, for example Spain, Homeowners
and third-party liability. In the U.S., as you know, the foundations have been set to improve
technical results. And we should expect during the year better, better returns, especially
at the long end of the (inaudible) as well the lower tax rate. In Brazil, we are very confident
with the newest scenario with the measures we have already taken to improve the results.
We can expect better performance as well. We could still see some headwinds from the
lower interest rate environment and currency volatility going forward. But we should
benefit as Brazil moves out of recession. (inaudible) As Fernando said, the reduction of
losses should also be a positive driver at 2010 results. And we can't forget Mexico. Mexico
is a great country. We have there an excellent platform. And we expect during 2018
better, better improvements. And if God permits, we don't expect big cat events during
the year. And we should get better results due to the lower frequency in big cat events.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

One thing I forgot, Michael. We're running wonderful -- small but wonderful profit in
Germany. Even looking at the papers, their net result grew from 2.4 to 2.7. So there are no
losses in Germany. Regarding Italy, you're right, I mean, the losses are still there. And
significant decrease due to the restructuring changes made last year. And we're quite

Page 15 of 20



Company N ame: M apfre SA

positive. I mean, the outlook is much better for Italy. But still, probably we expect 1-digit
loss next year.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. So much. Next question is coming also from Michael Huttner from JP
Morgan. And it's regarding the U.S. program of renewal withdrawal from loss-making
states. What's the progress? How much benefit could you -- could we see this year from
that program?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Michael. I mean, it's too early. We set, as you know, at the Investor Day, new
targets for business in the U.S. It's just one month after we released these objectives. So I
mean, it's too early just to discuss or to comment on the performance of these
objectives. Mainly will depend on how fast we are, I mean, in the restructuring of the
different states. So coming back to my words I previously mentioned, I mean, we're quite
optimistic for both a potential transaction, the sale of the renewals rights for the central
states and also the sale of the operations in New York and New Jersey. If we sell both
operations, I mean, let's say at a good price. And we're expecting a good price, let's say
that the net income will be much, much better, I mean, from the U.S. For the long run, as I
said, it was a great and wonderful surprise, the reduction of the tax rate in the U.S. It will
help us actually increase as well our net income. And also, I mean, there is our protection
as well for the goodwill impairment tax we had to carry for the next years. Regarding the
operations. Massachusetts, in general, Northeast New England, I mean, is performing well.
Combined ratio is in the low 80s. And last year was extraordinary. And the quota share
and reinsurance contracts with MAPFRE RE is working well. So I remember that 1/3 of the
profits (closed out) is related to the MAPFRE RE accounts. And in the remaining states,
there is still an increase in combined ratio. But we'll focus on the plan made and unveiled
at the Investor Day in order to reduce on those states that are under development in
order to reduce losses and improve combined ratio. Probably, I mean, at the First Quarter
2018, we will be able to give you further details regarding the progress in the U.S.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Fernando. Now we have a question regarding Solvency II. Do you
expect -- it's from Paco Riquel -- do you expect that Solvency II ratio to improve in Q4
from 189% levels in Q3, despite the increase in the dividend payout?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Paco. And let's say that we're expecting 2 non-relevant effects to (have) at the
year-end Solvency II a calculation. First is the, let's say, the future business profit that we
only estimate on a yearly basis. So on the quarter release, this positive impact on eligible
funds is not contemplated. The second is the cat losses effect. As you know, there is a
relevant increase in our assets due to the reinsurance to be collectible, I mean, from our
reinsurers. And also an increase in provisions. As I said, there is over 500, including IBNR,
like EUR 700 million of increasing outstanding losses in the liability side of the balance
sheet. Both are -- both represent more requirements in terms of Solvency II capital
requirements. But we do not consider it to be relevant, I mean, taking the figures as a

Page 16 of 20



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2018-02-08

whole from MAPFRE. So probably, it will be a slight increase or improvement. But it's still
too early, I mean, to assess, I mean, the final impact. But they will be for sure nonrelevant.

FINAL

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Now we are going to ask you something about Iberia because we haven't talked
yet about that. Silvia Rigol from BBVA, Carlos Peixoto from Caixa, Paz Ojeda from Sabadell
and Michael Huttner from JP Morgan wanted to know what happened during the quarter
in the Life unit? Why have margins decreased despite lower mathematical provisions?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, everybody. I mean, there are 2 main reasons for this decrease in the
Fourth Quarter. The first has been lower level of realized gains and has affected the
financial income. As we mentioned, I mean, the one-off -- the positive one-offs that we
booked in December, I mean, the EUR 28 million in Brazil. And also the EUR 38 million in
tax effect in the U.S., allow us, I mean, to decrease the pace of realized gains from
financial investment. So this is the first reason. And also additionally, as you'll remember, it
was early retirement schedule in Spain that took place affecting almost 100 people. And
at the cost of EUR 35 million. The cost was split between Life and Non-Life. And I guess,
this is one of the reasons for the decrease -- for the drop in net results in the Fourth
Quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you. So much, Fernando. And there is another one regarding Motor combined ratio
in Spain. Is Motor combined ratios recurring for coming quarters? Could you give us more
details on VERTI in Spain?

A - Antonio Huertas MejÃ­as
Thank you. We are certainly happy with the combined ratio of Motor in Spain. Of course,
we don't have the magic ball to know what's going to happen with the business. But we
have in our hands all the possibilities to continue on the same line. MAPFRE started to
raise tariffs, 2, three years ago when we saw the difficulties -- the future difficulties of the
business, for the implementation of the Baremo, for the recovery of the economy and the
market competition. For that, we did our duties. And we now are very sure that we are on
the right track. We have consulted many nonprofitable business in Motor. And we are
trying to do -- to run the business in a very positive way. But it's difficult, we know, to
maintain this combine ratio up close to 90%. But we have still room to improve other lines
as well as Homeowners, Health and third-party liability and others. And we have -- even in
Motor, we are growing over the market, having increases in average premiums in the line.
We are very positive. Talking about VERTI. We said two years ago that we started a new
time, a new season with VERTI because of the differentiation of the company in the
market. As well, VERTI started the process to work more together with MAPFRE in the
back office processes. And we -- VERTI, has made many, many savings in the back office
operations. VERTI is growing less than the beginning of the operation. But it's growing.
VERTI is trying to be the leading company in online business in Spain and reaching the
breakeven, even making a little bit profits during 2016 -- '17, sorry. We are positive. And it's
the beginning of a new time for this operation. (Seven years) after the launching, we have

Page 17 of 20

gotten the goal. And now we are trying to improve the quality of the business, the quality
of the service as well the increase of the margin of the direct insurance of VERTI.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

Okay. Regarding also Spanish Motor combined ratio, there's a question about it. Is there -it includes -- this exceptional good combined ratio of 90.8% in Spain includes any one-off
such as (resell) releases, sort of volume of provision?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. I mean, the 90.8% -- I will clarify. First, the 90.8% is from Spain and
Portugal Motor. It's from Iberia. From Spain, it's even lower because it's 90.5%. But the
reduction is not due to one-offs. It's due to the quite extensive number of initiatives taken
for the last two years in order to improve our performance in this line of business. The
only release of provision we made was the EUR 15 million of the Baremo provision was
made at the Third Quarter, if I'm not mistaken. And probably, I mean, it's very likely there
is no changes in the current trend. Probably, we will release the remaining balance, which
stands at, I guess, EUR 20 million, I'm not sure. But probably next year. What happened? I
mean, in the -- also, I mean, the effect of those initiatives were as well helped by quite
benign weather during the last quarter. That was just the contrary last year. But let's say,
that we're quite proud of the job made in order to improve the performance of our Motor
line in Spain, which is key strategic and are very good example in order to implement the
same process in other regions and countries.

Thank you. And now regarding the bond portfolio. Carlos Peixoto from BPI asks, what
could be the impact of 100 basis points rise in European sovereign bonds? What is the
modified duration of that portfolio?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Carlos. To be honest. And overall, it will be a very positive news, if it happens.
But we do not spread 100% -- 100 basis points increase. It is true that we spread an
increase on rates. But probably nothing significant in next year, in 2018, despite the recent
movements in the financial markets. We will prepare for you, I mean, the calculation, the
sensitivity analysis. And we will back to you with the numbers. But just to let you know that
in our Iberia portfolio, we have a 4.2% deal acquisition cost versus 1.4% of market value.
So there is a relevant gap. And that's why I've said that we have a privileged portfolio.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Thank you. So much, Fernando. Now there is one remaining question in
Brazil from Silvia Rigol, BBVA; and Carlos Peixoto from Caixa. Could you give us more
details regarding high acquisition cost? Is it recurring for coming quarters?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Silvia and Carlos. You're right, commission -- I mean, acquisition costs are quite
high in Brazil, particularly, when we compare with other regions. But this is something that
Page 18 of 20



FINAL

Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity

is recurring in this country. You'll note that what we call the Corretores is the independent
agents. They've got a quite potential role in the block rate of premiums. We're trying to
reduce this acquisition costs. It's quite difficult. But you're right. The only increase in
commissions that I remember is that the one made for the bancassurance channel. And it
was already mentioned in the past, in order to foster activity in Banco do Brasil. My
conclusion, overall, I mean, let's say, that there we expect reduction in the acquisition
costs. We're working on it. But due to the current structure of the intermediary agent in
Brazil, we consider it as recurring for the coming years.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. There's one left. But I think more or less you have talked about that.
What are the expectations on the evolution of premiums and combined ratio in Brazil?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well what we expect is that the similar trend that we've seen -- we saw in Spain for the
next three years after coming out from the recession. We expect a similar trend in Brazil.
As you know, there is a time lag, usually one year, two years, between the good metrics -good macro metrics for a country. And also a relevant increase in premiums in the
insurance business and also improvements in combined ratio. Let's say, that the first year
is done. I mean. And we are -- our expectation are great -- greater, I mean, for next year.
And basically is that's we're quite happy. And our expectations are pretty high regarding
the new transactions with Banco do Brasil that we also enlarge our positions in Non-Life in
Brazil.

The last question. Thank you, Fernando. The last question comes now because we are
running out of time. And it comes from Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays. Will you be able to
present any guidance for 2018 on net profit, combined ratio, investment, result?

A - Antonio Huertas MejÃ­as
Thank you, Ivan. As usual, we don't make any release of our forecast out of the AGM. You
know, we are in the middle -- at the end, actually, at the end of the current strategic plan
and 2018 is a transitional year. When we communicated the impact of a catastrophic
event, we said that we have -- we moderated our protection to accomplish some financial
targets like ROE. It's very difficult in the third year to reach it. But now we are focused on
the improvement of the business in all the geographies. Sales network in all countries will
have pressure all year to get us close to these goals as possible. The new strategic plan
will be analyzed during the second part of this year. And we'll -- it will be launched for the
next 3-year period. We will continue working on the same alliance, trying to get the most
profitable business instead of only to talk about growth. Quarter-by-quarter, we are
seeing the success of the current strategic approach. And in the third year of the plan, we
are satisfied. We are quite happy with the plan, the improvements of the business in
Spain, the first country where we applied the profitable growth. The improvements as well
in LATAM. All the regions in LATAM have excellent combined ratios below 100%. And now
we know that we have to embrace the main challenge to lower the combined ratio in the
States and EURASIA. Iberia and MAPFRE RE will continue having excellent results. USA is in

progress with the plans we have already released. And in Brazil, we are very confident
with the measures that we have taken to improve the technical results. For that, in -- for
that reason, in 2018, we expect to keep going our current process and to improve little by
little our combined ratio and the ROE. But it's obvious that it's a year that where we will
continue doing the same activities to improve the quality of our business. Nevertheless,
we are happy. We are very satisfied with the results of the year. And we think 2018 will be,
again, an excellent year for MAPFRE business in all of the world. Thank you very much.
