{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Great. Hello, I am Antoine Lissowski CFO of CNP Assurances. I'm happy to welcome you
at this call. If you have diﬀerent slides in front of you, I indicate you go to page on which I
am. I go direct to the page ﬁve to start with our activities in diﬀerent countries in 2014.
In France ﬁrst, there was a very strong growth in unit-linked business, where premiums in
general in traditional savings and pension products were up 14.5%, whereas the
premiums in unit-linked business were up 78.7% and personal risk/protection products are
slightly lower with growth of around 2%. This is the ﬁrst protection part our group to have
a very strong shift towards unit-linked contracts. We have a 13% of total savings on
pension premiums last year we are much above the former performance of a company.
Our APE ratio in France was nevertheless down last year, we have APE ratio stayed at 9%.
You see there that the economic environment meaning lower interest rates account for
the largest part of this negative performance whereas the technical and operational
performance factors were signiﬁcantly up by 4.3 points.
Now, on page six we go to the revenue in France. They were resilient, sustained by the
personal risk business line. There was a very sharp rise in net insurance revenue from
personal risk and protection by 8.8% as you see, whereas the savings and pension net
insurance revenue was down 2.2% reﬂecting the low interest rates. You have on the slide

as well, the technical levels on diﬀerent parts of the business in France where you can
observe as usually that what represents one-third, more than a third of our net insurance
revenue comes from just €10 billion out of €283 billion in terms of technical reserves.
In page seven we go to Latin America. Also they are growing the personal risk and
protection business. The year was troubled by political and sporting events, but the most
proﬁtable business lines of the company were up. You see there that like-for-like ﬁgures
which are signiﬁcant for we are not to account for decrease of the real, like-for-like these
ﬁgures in terms of premiums were 17% up and the APE margin on the customer risk were
at about 40%.
In savings and pension business the ﬁgure of premiums went down by 21% in reported
and 14% in like-for-like and the APE margin are nevertheless at above 20%. Just a word
about that. We noticed in Brazilian market important moves on the pension business, and
we refrain from following the pension on these markets and we prefer to keep action
proﬁtability in spite of losing some market share in this business rather than to follow the
rest of the market.

Bloomberg Transcript

Doing that, we have covered the purchases which incorporate a little part of risk
protection in the pension business which explains the maintained level of APE margins.
On page eight, you have net the insurance revenue coming from there. In like-for-like
ﬁgures, it amounts to more than €1000 this year, a growth of 16.7%. What is very
signiﬁcant there is that 80% of that is made of personal risk and protection business which
growth is more that 20% where savings/pension remaining at the same level, roughly at
the same level as last year in like-for-like ﬁgures €228 million.
Now let's come to Europe area with their response to lower interest rate environment. The
premiums there, if we exclude group pension contract which was sold in 2013, the
premiums are roughly at the same level up as last year, and you say that the traditional
savings are up just 2% – 1.7%, whereas the unit-linked products are up 42% and the
personal risk business are slightly down by 16%. In this area, we have had very dramatic
developments of the sale in Italy and Spain in terms of traditional savings product during
ﬁrst half of the year. We stopped it during the second half but because of that move we
registered a very low APE margin, which is for the whole year, at 2.8% down by nine
points to last year. The net interest revenue in Southern Europe stayed at €218 million.
If you have a look on page 10 on the summing up of our new business values, we see that
roughly we're at the same level as last year at the group level, €357 million compared to
€376 million the year before, but this move is made by a very slight decrease in France
due to economic conditions and environment of low interest rates, very strict, important
decrease in Europe with new business value coming to €7 million only for the same
reasons. But in business models which are moderately made of traditional savings
products, and conversely, continuous growth of our new business in Latin America of €142
million.

In page 11, we have highlighted the cost aspect. We have an improved cost to income
ratio at the level of the group. You see that on the right side of the slide. The cost ratio is
now at 35% and when you have a look on the diﬀerent areas, you see that the costs were
very slightly up in France, 1.2% which is consistent with the amounts budgeted. They were
slightly down in Europe because of our ﬁrst very strict cost management in area of Cyprus
or Spain, and they were developed in Southern America with a growth in like-for-like
ﬁgures of 14.3%. This growth, if you exclude the tax eﬀect because our FX is included in
that ﬁgure in Latin America, the growth there is around 8% and in an area where average
inﬂation was about 6.4%. That's the thing that in Latin America our costs grew slightly
weaker than the inﬂation.

Bloomberg Transcript

On page 12, you see that the EBIT in general is growing by 3.7% at €2.4 billion. This
growth is attributable essentially unit-linked to personal risk and protection businesses
with the growth of 9.2%, and with a stable digit ﬁgures with savings and pension business
at €1.373 billion. You see also there that the like-for-like ﬁgure of growth in Latin America is
very consistent, 13.6% whereas a solid performance in France 4.4%, and as already
mentioned, a slight decrease in other European countries.
On page 13, several indications on diﬀerent ﬁnancial aspects of the management of the
company. The ﬁnance cost which represents the cost of our debt increased last year in
line with issue of two – Tier 1 or Tier 2 issues. Income tax expenses grew by 3.8% in line
with the result itself. The recurring proﬁt is therefore up by 3% – 3.1%, and all the lines
represent the eﬀect of the management of the assets of the company on the net revised
gains on equities and investment property and the impairment eﬀect. The fair value
adjustment to trading, there is nothing speciﬁcally noticeable there, and what we call nonrecurring item which this time represents ﬁrst, the ﬁne by the French insurance supervisor
of €40 million at the end of the year, and additional rotation to policy order surplus which
is there.
On page 14, you have diﬀerent consideration on how we are managing the investments in
the context of very low interest rates. In a few words, there is a double diversiﬁcation in
course in the company, ﬁrst, regarding the bond and ﬁxed income investments as a whole
there is a switch from govvies to corporate and ﬁnancial bonds, the ﬁgure for corporate
was about €7.5 billion last year, the investments in ﬁnancial bonds were €5 billion where
the new money invested in sovereigns were much lower this year.
The second aspect of diversiﬁcation is accent put on equities. We invested more than €2
billion last year on equities, we have also invested €1.4 billion in property, and in private
equity we remain probably the most important insurer in France, in that respect, we have
around €800 million new capital committed in 2014. I'll just add to that, that we will
remain in the same direction in 2015. We intend to invest more than €2.5 billion or around
€3 billion in equities to keep the same amount in 2015 for private equity, around €800
million, and to invest around €2 billion in investment for properties.
On page 15, I do not insist on that. We give some examples of the way these investments
now are channels to diﬀerent economic sectors, mid-cap sector, corporate debt funds
and real estate and infrastructure project ﬁnancing.

FINAL

On page 16, you have the view on the operating free cash ﬂow of the company. We have
made a speciﬁc mention of the subordinated debt which was issued last year which
accounts for €1 billion in the measure. If you exclude that, you see that the In-Force
contribution is about €1.7 billion. The required capital for the new business of the
company is €120 million roughly. That means that it leaves €880 million for operating free
cash ﬂow which is much suﬃcient to pay the dividend and to contemplate diﬀerent
diversiﬁcation if necessary.
On page 17, you have some elements regarding the equity. It amounts to around €17
billion at the end of the year, €16.680 million at the end of the year. And the MCEV which
is at about €17.5 billion, meaning €25.5 per share, with the value of In-Force climbing from
€4.5 billion to €5.9 billion in a year. You have diﬀerent detail in the next pages of the
comments regarding these ﬁgures.

Bloomberg Transcript

On page 18, we draw your attention to the Solvency capital. Page 18 is just on Solvency
capital in Solvency I which is still the oﬃcial norm. Of course, the decrease of interest rates
resulted in a very important surge in unrealized capital gains. And all-in-all that means that
the coverage ratio is at 403% which is of course not very meaningful if you consider the
volatility of unrealized capital gains. What is more important is the subordinated debt and
equity together through the Solvency capital requirement and there our ratio is at 118%.
You see on the right side of the slide how it evolved along the year with the contribution
of the proﬁt and the subordinated debt issues and to cost change in the SCR, in the
capital at work and the Santander acquisition which we already announced as having had
the cost of 3 points of coverage ratio.
If you come to page 19, you have our measurement so far on the Solvency II ration at the
level of Group which is at 160% to 185% last year and this ﬁgure is the present ﬁgure of
what we consider as our ratio. But the work is not over, we've got diﬀerent assumptions
which has to be taken before the end of 2015 to come to a deﬁnitive measurement of
Solvency II ratio which will be of course published and oﬃcial and it is probably this ﬁgure
of 160% certainly I would say downplayed in terms of possibility to show the real picture
of the ratio.
If look at down of the slide, you have two interesting informations I think. First, the part of
the French and Latin American operation in terms of capital requirements. You see that
the French activities represent roughly 90% of the capital required, whereas the Latin
American represent 8%. And if you compared this 8% to for instance the part of new
business margin made in Latin America, which is €142 million oﬀ of €357 at the Group
level. It shows that we are developing ﬁrstly in the regions which capital requirement by
being of activity are much lower.
On the right hand side you see that the capital requirement by risk is very speciﬁc to our
business model. We are the large savings and pension manger which results in a very
important activity in terms of market risk and in terms of counterparty risk. If you consider
that, the life risk in comparison also lots of risk which is rate sensitive which shows that our
capital requirement by risk is clearly marked by the level of interest rate. And it is one of
the explanation of the sensitivity of economic risk coverage ratio to interest rate
environment.

On page 20, you have just a view on what could be the dividend in 2014. The dividend
will be proposed at the same level as last year, but not completely payable in cash.
There's no scrip dividend this year and the payout ratio is paid-out roughly 50% as we
saw.
The next pages illustrates diﬀerent aspect of our activity and strategy. We have results – an
important results delivered by La Banque Postale which registered a very good success of
the new Cachemire range. We have a very brisk growth in personal risk and protection
premiums in France and Brazil. We have very quick growth in unit-linked sales in France
and Europe, everywhere in Europe.
We have launched diﬀerent platforms for small businesses in the world. We have
launched a new AMETIS, the new in-house network of insurance advisors to support our
partners in serving the SME market. We have signed yesterday a new partnership with
BPCE and we have also a new partnership with Santander which becomes operational
now.

Bloomberg Transcript

If you come to Santander, you are on 23, I skip on the page 22 where only additional
question is the sale of CNP BVP to Barclays, but it will account in 2015 account. If you go
direct to page 23, you see that, well, regarding Santander participation where acquisitions
cost was around the €300 million. The key ﬁgures of the company was premium of €650
million in 2014 and an EBIT by €15 million. And we count on growth levers ﬁrst with
insourcing of the insurance business within this global consumer ﬁnance business.
The last is, the certain part of insurance were outsourced at the level of Santander
Consumer Finance, the insourcing piece now at 70% and we intend to completely to have
monopoly of the interest of activities of Santander Consumer Finance in the countries
where we are operational by 2019. There will be also a higher retention rate. The activity
was majority only REIT insured in 2014, 55% were re-insured and we intend to reduce the
re-insurance and to have a retention rate of 95% in 2019. There will be also market
synergies and economies of scale which will result in a very prudent view in premiums
around €900 million in 2019, and then EBIT which should be around €80 million of
performance. This is a very careful assumption of what we are having.
On page 24 and 25, we have some complementary views on the impact of our new
partnership with BPCE. This is a seven year-term contract which was recently renewable
for successive three-year periods. The partnership is focused on growing the personal risk
and protection business, so it's growing very good risk protection business with the two
networks of the BPCE, Banques Populaires and Caisses d'Epargne. This group business
will be triggered by the coming in force of the new French regulation called Accord
National Interprofessionnel under which the small inter-majority businesses will be
compelled to cut the group protection from their salaries.
And second, there will be larger scope for term creditor insurance for CNP. We will be the
term creditor insurer of not only the Caisses d'Epargne as before, but of Banques
Populaires and Crédit Foncier, will be co-incurred with Natixis Assurances. And all-in-all

FINAL

this represents a potential increase of 50% at least in the new business volume for us after
2016.
On page 25, we have some views on the future of savings and pension activities. There
will be an incremental reduction in the exposure of this business for CNP Assurances. We
will continue to manage the existing contracts and future payments and for the ﬁrst time
we disclose report of the path of the future premiums under the existing contract and the
future earned premiums in the business. You see that the new business represents which
will be kept by Natixis Assurances represent in 2014, €4.3 billion realized in 2014 for new
one and existing contracts represented €4.6 billion, this is the part we will keep in the next
business.

Bloomberg Transcript

This will have gradual implementation during 2015. That means that some cash deposited
we still sell CNP products in 2015; partnership with them will be completely closed only at
the end of next year. We will have an additional reinsurance treaty creating it with Natixis
Assurances based on 10% of the technical reserves of the company, of the portfolio
Caisses d'Epargne at CNP Assurance level.
That means that 10% of our risk to the savings business with Caisses d'Epargne will be
reinsured by Natixis Assurances. It is a way to be better protected against I would say too
much competitive aggressive commercial activity by Natixis Assurances which will sell the
new product in the same network, and we have the disposal of diﬀerent protected
mechanisms, protecting the CNP values especially in the case of rising interest rates. This
year we evaluate the impact of the New Business Value in 2015 as non-material, meaning
that it will be low if the agreement has been eﬀective in 2014. We consider that agreement
with an eﬀect of less than 5% of New Business Value – because of New Business Value.
The two last pages of representation with regards to diﬀerent strategic views. In 26 years
diﬀerent consideration with our ﬁrst, we have to ﬁnish our renegotiation with La Banque
Postale. This partnership will be renegotiated and rejuvenated by end of this year. We will
also put new target with Brazilian partner CAIXA with which we already went to an
agreement on an increase of the premium by more than 50% by 2019 and we have
decided to open notice of CAIXA Seguradora in Colombia which will be operational by
the mid-year and which will be a possibility to explore the Colombian market.
We are also innovative in France with diﬀerent contracts; CNP One and euro-croissance
which were launched in February. We have created a vehicle for partnership with multichannel distributor in group health – death and disability and health insurance. And in the
end we indicate that in 2015, we will make signiﬁcant progresses in the use of digital
technologies and we will disclose our strategy on that respect with ﬁrst step being the
launch of the all digital company in Brazil which has been decided at the vote of the
company Brazil last week.
Okay. I am over with this part of presentation and we will be open that they are very eager
to answer to your questions along the table.

FINAL

Thank you. Our ﬁrst question comes from Michael Huttner of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you so much. Thank you. as just three questions if I may. The ﬁrst on slide 59 and
maybe I missed it, the return on equity on the pension business seem to have come down
quite sharply, and I just wondered what happened there? The second, what is the
duration mismatch you have across your portfolio now? And the third is, in terms of the
Solvency II which I think that's partly why the share price is down so much is the number is
clearly down. What is the current level, what would be, or how could we estimate the
current level of Solvency II given that interest rates have dropped further since the end of
the year? Thank you.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

On the ﬁrst question, it is clear that the pension business proﬁtability was very strongly
aﬀected by low interest rates which resulted in supplementary provisions this year. The
second question was the duration mismatch, I'll turn around my side, Mikaël Cohen for
Michael Huttner.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you.

A - Mikaël Cohen
Well, you could have approached this duration mismatch by several indicators, but you're
correct, they were the ones that ﬁgures that is stated in the presentation on page 50 and
it's regards – no, on page 49, you have the sensitivity of our value to interest rates, yes, it
gives you some insight about the – what is interesting to shareholder, I mean they
mismatch in duration at the – from the shareholder perspective and there you have the
ﬁgure impact.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Sorry, Mikaël, do you have any sort of indication even just back of the envelop....

A - Mikaël Cohen

Yeah, now from the insurance perspective, you have two main activities. The ﬁrst one is
the savings life insurance and the mismatch is less than six months if you – given with our
measure. And on the rent activities, rent, not rent..

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

FINAL

The annuities activities.

A - Mikaël Cohen
Yeah annuities activities, the mismatch is a bit longer. We have a duration of around more
than 10 years on the assets, and but more than generally 15 years, sorry, on the liability.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

And the ﬁrst question, Michael, was about the sensitivity of our Solvency II ratio, we can
trace that, I think.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Yes, please.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

I am sure that Thomas is ready to bring you an answer; and guess that, we will also
consider the page 49 which was already mentioned. Thomas?

A - Thomas Béhar
But we are – we not publishing our sensitivity on Solvency capital ratio, so you got only on
the book the sensitivity on the side, you get that under value of info which is stated but for
the Solvency of the capital ratio you have just to wait one year to get that.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

And I didn't quite catch that, the line was bad, so notes on the available capital, but there
is no answer on the required capital as such, is that right?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

No, sorry, Michael, on slide 49 you have the sensitivities that we usually publish on MCEV
diﬀerent line items. We do not today publish sensitivities for the Solvency II, but should
we when Solvency II is in eﬀect. But next best thing as the French say, you can sort of
gather a similar sort of sensitivity, although it's not exactly the same thing from the
sensitivity of the...

Our next question comes from Ralph Hebgen of KBW. Please go ahead.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Hello Ralph.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Yes hi. Hello Ralph Hebgen from KBW. Thanks for taking my questions. I would like to start
with a question relating to the MCEV disclosure; I have seen that there was an opening
positive adjustments to the value In-Force of €1.6 billion. Now, that's a size of a chunk and
explains why the VIF increased so much at a time that interest rates went down. You make
one comment saying that this relates to a change of scope in France, and my question
relates to that, what precisely is behind that?
And that leads me to the second question. Did this have a positive impact on the
economic Solvency ratio as well? And if so, would you be able to disclose what your
Solvency II ratio would have been had that €1.6 billion been excluded?
Question number three remains with Solvency, and it's basically going back to what
Michael wanted to explore. The sensitivity of the economic Solvency ratio appears to be
Page 9 of 19



Company Name: CNP Assurances

FINAL

quite high. We were starting from 185% in 2013, now we are 25 percentage points lower,
during that time the French yield in the main has dropped. Would I be right in saying that
roughly for 100 basis points drop in the yield on the French govvy you are experiencing
between 14 points and 15 points drop on the economic Solvency ratio? And well, that's it
for now. Thank you very much.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Okay. First about the statement in our MCEV the €1.5 billion Thomas will give you some
supplementary views, he is rushing to the phone.

A - Thomas Béhar
Yes, we are preparing ourselves to Solvency II and trying to match and all what was done
between the MCEV process and the Solvency II process and we are also speaking with the
management a number of assumptions during our projections. And for example, we have
worked on a model about the critical insurance, and we are – it's a part of the game that
we are seeing and the restatement we have worked also with our control management
team of the way we are considering internal expenses, the way we are projecting them
during the life of the contracts. And we have also considered the way we may modernize
model, the participation that you consider every just before the proﬁt and now this
discretionary participation is inside this number and is in the value of MCEV and inside
the value in Solvency II.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

That means that in fact, Ralph, the vision of the MCEV is including now much more
consistent with our view, model of business and that's conventional and much more
realistic assumptions are embedded in this new vision and it is simply because we are
contemplating environment where MCEV measures and the Solvency II measures will be
very alike, we're putting them to aside.
Your next question rather it was sort of a guess from your side was to guess what was the
sensitivity of our ratio 200 basis points interest rate moves. Okay, I don't – I would say, I
cannot conﬁrm in term of where you calculated this, but it is clear that we have to
consider and to discuss where the disclosure – the deﬁnite disclosure on Solvency II will
look, because all the brackets we need to rule out these issues. So far we've just disclosed
the sensitivity in MCEV which is just one of the legs of the ratio in itself. It is clear that to
disclose the compounding of the two legs and sensitivity of the two legs is the next step,
but we will do it later.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay. Can you just recap, so I think you were saying that the value In-Force adjustments
related at least in part to a higher proportion of the policy holders' surplus reserve which
include, did I hear this correctly or...?

A - Thomas Béhar

Page 10 of 19



Company Name: CNP Assurances
Company Ticker: CNP FP Equity
Date: 2015-02-19

Yes, part of it, as you will see many diﬀerences we're changing the model, I just explained
some, some numbers. On top of this, we have credit insurance with expenses and also
taking into account what we call the policy on those surplus reserves that we are doing on
the level of the entity.

FINAL

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

And would you say that inclusion of the policy holders share or a portion of it was that the
driving force behind the increase? Which of the components dominate?

A - Thomas Béhar
It is a substantial explanation of the increase, yes.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay, good. Now there was just one other question which I had which was would you be
able to guide what the economic Solvency ratio would have been had you not included
that €1.6 billion adjustment?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, you just have to notice that when we include this kind of policy holders' surplus
reserve which were some billions, you got also an increase on the Solvency capital ratio
on the same time. It's a parallel requirement. The Solvency capital requirement is
increasing at the same time we are taking into account the policy holders' surplus reserve.
So on the Solvency capital ratio, it's quite neutral inclusion of this reserve.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much indeed for your time.

Operator
Thank you. As there are no further questions I will now hand you back to your host for any
additional or closing remarks. We just had an additional question signaled from Ralph
Hebgen from KBW has a follow you question. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Yes, sorry it's me again. I only didn't continue because I thought there were more
questions. So now I am going to monopolize this talk entirely. Well, there were just some
small things outstanding which I know it is. There is I think some new disclosure which I
ﬁnd fascinating often or – do you know I can't ﬁnd it, I think it's on slide 44, and it is
something which you call marginal new business value. Could you explain what that is?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Yes, Ralph you know that usually when the company disclose a new business value, all the
companies to our knowledge consider that the new business is made of – the value of the
new business is made up of return on these net investments made with the money plus

part of realized gain which was attributed to this business which results in higher new
business margin, but when you take it for the loan meaning that when you consider that
all the money which is collected in a year is invested in the same year at the current levels.
But as we were in fact probably the only company which was publishing ﬁgures in a
standalone basis which is in decreasing interest rates environment were to reduce the
ﬁgure, we decided to let go to marginal disclosure as everybody and to give correct
information to the market, with insight, make the conﬁrmation between what was eﬀective
communication over the last four years and what would have been the communication if
we would have considered the marginal structure.
For instance in 2011, we would have had the new business margin by 9.4% where it was at
8.9 and so on and so on. And this year, the 9% which we have in France would be in
marginal approach maybe 11.12%, and in the future we intend to publish on marginal basis
for the future.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

So that means that the number for 2014 on the standalone basis, did you say – intuitively
this goes the other way round for me, standalone would exclude a subsidization of the
current new business from previous generations of policies?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Oh, that's correct, ﬁne. Perfect.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

It is exactly that.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay. And then, one ﬁnal thing, this relates to the BPCE agreement. You were saying that
you would expect 50% increase of new business volume in the risk and protection line.
You left it open over what time that might materialize. Perhaps, you can talk about what
sort of timeframe it is you were having in mind there, and also as you're losing the new
business on the life and savings, traditionally written Caisses d'Epargne, can I clarify
what's the ﬁrst new business generation, if you're losing? Are you still writing new
business in 2015 and then over 2016 that would be a transitional year phasing it out?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Yes, yes. That's it. For the savings you've got, we will have last year of – this year we had
our new business from Caisses d'Epargne, next year in 2016 we will have just few months
of activity with such and such Caisses d'Epargne but let's say you can achieve for your

model that way we will have, let's say, the half of the previous years in terms of new
business and after we will have no more in new business on new premiums, okay.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

For after 2016, meaning the reform will be completed in 2017 in fact. And to come to ﬁrst
part of your question, the ﬁgure of potentially 50% increase of new activity, increase of
activity in Tempo Dental insurance with them, in fact the basis of our activities will be
enlarged much more, but we want to be very careful because in our present – current
environment the structure of the housing market and loan market in general in two years,
it is diﬃcult to anticipate. But we prefer to be very careful when we give ﬁgures saying,
but it might mean an enlargement of 50% of premiums of the ﬁrst year on the contract.
But then it is still in the new business of 2016 which might be higher to a new business,
traditional new business with Caisses d'Epargne by 50%. All things being equal, but this
occur in conditions of markets of loans, housing loans were similar to those which we
have in 2014.

The next question will come from Simon David of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Q - Simon David

{BIO 17536566 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon, two question from my side. I just wondered in the VIF transfer to free
surplus, we've seen a big step up from €787 million in 2013 to €1.1 billion in 2014 I just
wondered what caused that.
And the second question, I wondered if you could give us the dividend, upstream, per
geography in 2013 and 2014, please?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

An answer for your ﬁrst question in fact you have to consider, you have taken the number
on page nine...

Q - Simon David

{BIO 17536566 <GO>}

...of the report. You have to consider the full operating MCEV earnings on page eight of
the report. You will see as the numbers are certain VIF and required capital to free surplus
on the third line which are the diﬀerent components are the operating and MCEV
earnings. So you got the new business value. The expected existing business
contribution, the transfer experience variances and all of that give €1,068 million. And as
we have changed some model, you will see that between 2013 and 2014, you've got some
changes between experience variances and transfer of the VIFs, is a way we are now
where we model the results and we're forecasting the results inside our model.
And if you go to operating MCEV earnings, it will go from €1,008 million last year to
€1,068 million. So it's a progression of 5.9%. Doing the same thing under three diﬀerent
geographical zones is 4.6% for France, 8% for Brazil, and 16% for Europe outside France.
And so it's something that's more linked with all our other key performance indicators
with this provision of the operating MCEV earnings of 5.9%. And if you want to
reconciliate that with the operating free cash ﬂow which is behind your question, may I
recall you that on page 51 of the booklet, you've got – in the operating free cash ﬂow, we
have made appear the operating MCEV earnings

Q - Simon David

{BIO 17536566 <GO>}

Yeah, it should.

A - Mikaël Cohen
Okay. And regarding the dividend stream, we have a policy to give between 50% and
75% of payout by our subsidiaries depending on their situation in general, but with Brazil
it is usually around 75%.

We have a follow-up question from Michael Huttner of JPMorgan.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

So I'm a bit concerned. I mean I'm not particularly reassured that – excuse me, what Ralph
Hebgen was implying but the number now may be about 150% which doesn't sound very
high, but I may be wrong. And I just wondered if you have a kind of internal view of what
the minimum would be, would you still run yourself on the French number the 118%?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then follow-up question to that would be, come January 2016 you'll be under the
French minimum, you just moved to Solvency II, just to understand a little bit the
sensitivities. I feel that there's more pressure here in terms of interest rates, and I had felt I
haven't reﬂected on the sensitivity of the pension book. And then on the cash ﬂow, I
thought it was a fascinating answer, really helpful. And I just wondered if you could just
name a few of the ﬁgures in the columns. I'm looking at the report, but I can't quite reckon
– I'm looking at the France bit, and I'm not sure which number I should be looking at. Any
indication of what the amount, dividended up by France would be really helpful? Thank
you.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

I'm not sure that I perfectly understood that you don't feel at ease with our Solvency
ﬁgures at all. For your second question, I am not sure that I could exactly what you – what
precision you wanted, Michael?

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay. So on the ﬁrst one, I just wondered if assuming Ralph Hebgen is right and the
number if we were to do Solvency II today were 150%. What is the level at which you
decide well, no, things now have reached a level where we need to take additional capital
measures?
And on the second point, I'm looking at, I suppose, page 16 of the embedded value
booklet, so that's a bit which relates to France. And I just wondered which of those
ﬁgures, is the one which relates to the cash paid up to the group?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Well, regarding the ﬁrst question, sorry, I've absolutely nothing to tell. Speciﬁcally to that,
we have not contemplated to ﬁx a limit which we consider that something has to be done.
And so far, we feel very quiet with the measures we have. This thing was mentioned –
these ﬁgures were mentioned at the audit committee of the company at the board of the
Page 15 of 19

company and everybody around the table seems – feels well with these ﬁgures. So the
question of having a capital action was not even raised by any of our board members.
Regarding the second question, perhaps .

And dividends, if you are, again the question of the opening adjustments?

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

I just wanted to – you're explaining to what the dividends are in terms of geographies.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Okay.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

And I just wondered which of those ﬁgures it is?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, its opening adjustments, slide number 28 for the opening adjustment for the group
and it's under page 16 for France, page 18 for Latin America, Latin America is €175 million
and on page 19 for Europe is €29 million and as for CNP Assurances the [holding] is also
the French operator. The diﬀerence is what remains for France is €324 million.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

So, just to understand, so that's really helpful the €324 million because it's a holding
ﬁgure already includes Latin America and Rest of Europe?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

No, not at all it's only part of the dividend that we consider that's coming from, paid by
the activities in France.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

I beg your pardon, okay, that's very clear, okay. Maybe just on the France, maybe I can ask
it in diﬀerent way. So the drop from the 185% to 160% is oﬀset is a substantial drop and
this was after you made this adjustment of $1.6 billion of adjusting the MCEV to your
business model. And so in the current climate where interest rates are actually lower
today than they were at the year-end, I could understand why certain investors would say,
well, what is the ﬁgure today and I understand that this is a not a concern for you. But
maybe you could explain why it is not for the same concern to you as the market may
think. You know your company must better than anybody, but it's just that I'm not quite –
maybe I'm looking at it in a wrong way and I'd be very grateful for any guidance.

Well, you're right but the adjustments we made is included in the ﬁgure we published,
but what we cannot know, that might be, I would say, further adjustments what we
consider that would be very legitimate to make and that would represent in fact the
improvement, possible improvement of the things. And we are not – we are still not in the
Solvency II environment completely. We are just making a very tentative approaches to
manage that. And we know by and large that there are diﬀerent things on which we can
work to represent more realistically the coverage ratio of the company consistently with
renovation. And the reason for which we are not so worried is that we consider, but there
are still groups to represent better the wealth of the company in terms of a ratio if you see
what I mean.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Absolutely no, no I, that's a bit I was missing. Yes, that's very helpful. Thank you.

We'll now take an additional follow-up question from Ralph Hebgen of KBW. Please go
ahead.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Ralph 2?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Yes hello, I'm sorry it's me again. Can I just ask one more thing relating to slide 44 and the
new concept of margin, new business margin. I hear sniggering in the background...

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

So go ahead...

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

It is just because you said that in future, you will move your reporting of the new business
value and therefore of the new business value margin on to the basis of marginal
methodology. And that has so far produced higher margins than in the past. And I'm not
quite clear yet why the margins are higher. I don't want to paraphrase what my
misunderstanding is. Would you explain again in which way the new business value or
indeed the margin is being supported by the marginal methodology as opposed to the
standalone methodology?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

The value of the new business is better on marginal approach than on the standalone
because you've got an unrealized gain that we have, in all this period we had unrealized
gain on bonds. And we consider them a marginal approach and there is nothing on
standalone approach.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Oh, I see. So I think my understanding was exactly the one way around. So in fact you're
saying on the marginal approach you take into the consideration the contribution of gains
of all prior generations of contracts.

A - Antoine Lissowski

Yes.

And it's what we are doing invariably when we are delivering every year. So discretionary
participation to the contract, we are not splitting between the past and the present.
