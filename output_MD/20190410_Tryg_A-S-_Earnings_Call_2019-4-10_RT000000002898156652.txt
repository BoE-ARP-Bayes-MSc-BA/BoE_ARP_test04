Good morning, everybody. This is Gianandrea Roberti, I'm Head of Investor Relations of
Tryg. We publish our Q1 Results early around this morning. I have here with me, Morten
Hubbe, Group CEO to discuss and present the ﬁgures. Over to you Morten.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Good morning, and thank you, Gian. And we start oﬀ on Slide 3, where we reported
technical result of 626 million against 563 year-on-year. Clearly, the result was positively
impacted by the inclusion of Alka for the ﬁrst time and the ﬁrst delivery of synergies from
that case. But then again negatively impacted by higher than normal level of large claims,
but then positively again from whether claims being a bit below normal. More
importantly, we see a continuation of the trend of underlying claims improvement, some
50 basis points both on the group level and in the private business. Clearly, a large swing
factor in the investment result 353 million for the ﬁrst quarter, very positive and we might
want to booked that for all the quarters in the future, but clearly impacted by the global
equity markets up 11% and a general quarter also were all risk classes are up year-on-year.
Dividends per share for the ﬁrst quarter of DKK1.7 in line with our aim of continuously
increasing dividends and compared to 1.65 year-on-year. And a solvency of 168 for the
quarter.

And if we turn to Slide 4, pleased to see that our positive trend on customer satisfaction
TMPS continues. And of course, that one of the positive drivers of that is that improves our
retention rate, which is the most the strongest way possible of improving the top-line and
the bottom-line at the same time. You also see on this slide that the number of products
per customer increase and that also supports loyalty. I'm pleased to see again a payment
of membership bonus from TryghedsGruppen of 8%, now for the ﬁrst time also to the
customer in Alka so now all-in-all, 1.3 million customers in Denmark received the
membership bonus.
On Slide 5, we show the split of the technical result, clearly, generally positively, impacted
by Alka and improves in online claims and negatively impacted by the larger claims. And
you see that reﬂected in the split between private, commercial and corporate, a very
strong development in private lines, but then again we see in commercial and corporate
that the large claims reduce the technical result. Sweden continue to increase the results
and we see a positive result driven in the Swedish business.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide 6, we have shown a new slide, where we just summarize to opposite rather
volatile elements in this quarter. One is large claims and the other is of course, investment
returns. Look at the large claims graph. We see a 181 million large claims in the quarter up
a 137 million a year-on-year. That is largely stochastic and of course we monitor closely if
there are any patterns should be reﬂected there and how to handle that in terms of price
increases, but bear in mind, that we stick to our normalize guidance of large claims for the
year of 550 million . Look at the investment income, we continue with an unchanged lowrisk investment strategy. But of course in Q1, virtually all our asset classes are up, and 353
million for the quarter is unusually high investment income.
On slide 7, we elaborate on Alka. Of course, the ﬁrst full quarter of including Alka and all
ﬁgures and delivering the ﬁrst 21 million of the synergies from the Alka integration and
bear in mind, that we are promised 75 million for the full-year 2019. In the beginning here,
we see the roughly half of the synergies is cost synergies, for instance headcount
reductions, development function reductions, sponsorship football league, etcetera
reductions, much in line with our expectations. And then bear in mind that the biggest
longer-term synergies area is in claims, that has started well, we've been going through
700 contracts having a very clear and concise plan of using the combined muscle on
claims procurement. We've started out mainly in motor insurance, where
TryghedsGruppen's some 8% cheaper than Alka, that is starting to pull through and you'll
see more of that during the year, and then 1 of April, we continue on with property and as
the next big area. We've very clear and conﬁdent in our ability to achieve the 2021
synergies targets of 300 million.
If we look to Slide 8. We elaborate on the payout dividend of DKK1.7 per share, a 3%
growth year-on-year and as usual we aim to pay a ﬂat quarterly dividend throughout the
year. And of course, our ROE target at 21% post-tax continues to install discipline in our
carrying out of the business. And our very high focus on shareholder remuneration. We
will continue that focus on capital repatriation and we're pleased to see that 2019 will be
the eighth-year in a row with an increased dividend.

And we move on to slide 10, where we elaborate on the growth composition. Of course,
the growth is rather high in the quarter excluding Alka some 6% with growth in most
areas, bear in mind that the largest growth is seen in the private lines business, which is of
course our most proﬁtable business line area and our least capital consuming business
area. Bear in mind that underlying in private, we still have positive drivers in Denmark
from FDM for instance from the new product coverages in Norway the new partnerships
with NITO and the impact from (inaudible) and OBOS pick -- pulls up the growth higher
than usual. So although this current growth in private lines would be nice to continue into
perpetuity that is probably not what you should put into your spread sheet. We're very
pleased that the most proﬁtable area is the area that grows the most . And bear in mind
that commercial growth was also held by Alka, and excluding Alka, we see a growth or
some 5% unnaturally high because actually premiums and commercial in Q1 '18 was
unusually low.
And then, you see a low growth in corporate lines very intentional, this is our least
proﬁtable business segment, and if you dig beneath corporate, we see a positive growth
in corporate Denmark and in negative growth in both corporate Norway and corporate
Sweden, where the main focus is to increase prices and enhance our proﬁtability, which is
not at its satisfactory level in neither corporate Norway, nor-corporate Sweden. Then we
see a growth in the private line Sweden, which is not impacted by acquisitions, where we
see a reasonable growth, but from a small business segment.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then we continue on slide 11, on average prices were of course is trying to stay ahead of
the curve and adjusting prices in accordance with claim inﬂation is extremely important
and proﬁtability improvement of course stemmed from a combination of claims initiatives
and price adjustments.
And then, we continued on slide 12, elaborating on customer retention and you see a
very, very healthy development in both Denmark and Norway, and in both Private lines
and commercial. And that is by far the soundest way of improving earnings in an
insurance company, and in all areas we'd see an improved retention rates in Q1 compared
to the same quarter last year. We know of course, that in Denmark the customer bonus
scheme helps this development. It also means that we are particularly pleased to see that
we improving the retention development also in the Norwegian business, which is not
helped by the customer bonus gain.
Further on, on slide 14, we open up the claims section and as mentioned we saw in Q1, a
continuation of the improved continued underlying claims, we see that on the group level
there's a 50 basis points improvement, and then the private lines there's a 50 basis points
improvements.
We noticed that some of you have tried to calculate your own underlying numbers, which
is of course, an interest in exercise, but perhaps you should stick through the calculations
that we make. We have in this slide adjusted the columns for all the periods to include
Alka to make things comparable. If we see price adjustments and claims excellence, those
are the main drivers of improving underlying year-on-year, but also we do have a clear
intention of rebalancing and leaning the portfolio more and more towards a retail, and of

FINAL

course, Alka helps re-balancing the portfolio more to so as private lines. We expect the
underlying claims ratio improvements to continue in '19 and in 2020.
On Slide15, we elaborate further large claims and whether claims, as mentioned Q1 was
quite benign in terms of whether claims development and somewhat lower compared to
Q1 year-on-year and much lower than a normal Q1, where we would normally expect 100
million more in whether claims. But then as mentioned, 181 million large claims, a 137
million higher year-on-year, we do see some trend in ﬁsh farming and a couple of other
lines in the corporate segment, in Norway and generally we monitor very closely the
trends and signals to pick-up to adjust both on exposure and on price development. And
then you see similar to last year that the run-oﬀ result was at a quite high level of around
7.1%.
On slide 16, we'll elaborate on the cost ratio, 14% is much in line with our guidance of
keeping the cost ratio at around 14, it seems like a nothing is moving but actually
underlying there's a huge amount of moving parts with a dynamic that we improve
eﬃciency on one hand to support and ﬁnance investments in IT and digital solutions on
the other hand. You do notice an increase in the number of headcounts, when we do
knew IT solutions, new robotic solutions, new AI solutions we do recruit more staﬀ to
support these areas and also we hired more employees in Alka expecting that some of
the physical integration will lead some employees to leave the company.
And over to you Johan.

{BIO 18640275 <GO>}

Thanks a lot Morten. On slide 18, you can see the split of investments between the match
in the free portfolio there's nothing really new on that, and most of the asset classes in the
free portfolio are exactly the same as shown previously.
So if you move on , on the next slide, you can see the investment return for the ﬁrst
quarter, I think Morten, summarize it well before we made 353 million on the total
investment return, which is a multiple of the normalized amount. So, I guess just pay
attention not to extrapolate too much from that number. And especially in the free
portfolio nearly all asset classes part from equities produced very, very strong returns.
Moving on to the Solvency position, we are produce -- we are reporting an a Solvency
ratio 168, it was 165 but yearend, we're pleased with the development, actually the
development that's more or less driven by the spread between our net proﬁt -- the net
result and the dividend that we're paying. In a quarter, where the SCR, it's mostly ﬂat. You
may see that there's a couple of big components in the SCR the market risk capital charge
has gone up, simply driven by the so-called dampener, that are just upwards after equity
markets move upwards quite a bit in the quarter and then we did an annual update of the
parameters of the model which help mitigating a bit to the higher capital charge. So 168
at the end of the quarter, and I guess the next slide shows very little news our Tier 1 and
Tier 2 capacity. It's more or less fully utilized after a couple of relatively recent transaction.

FINAL

And we mentioned before that to forecast our solvency ratio really should be mostly
functional of net proﬁts and dividends. So it's relatively open and should be model
somewhat easily. And the last slide, that I will comment on its own the sensitivity also this
one are broadly unchanged, the biggest sensitivities to spread risk which shouldn't come
as any surprise considering that are our biggest asset class by far its Nordic coveredbonds. Over to you Morten.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Johan. And on slide 23, we just reiterate our ﬁnancial targets for 2020. We
target a technical result of 3.3 billion and expense ratio of 14% roughly combined ratio as
or below 86%, and ROE post-tax at or above 21%. Bear in mind that 3.3 billion and
technical result target is our highest technical result target ever and we're not guiding for
anything higher than that. And also bear in mind that in the cost ratio target of 14% there
is eﬃciency pulling down the number and then there is investment in IT and digital
pulling up the number, so we are not guiding for a cost ratio in 2020 signiﬁcantly below
the 14.0%.
And then ﬁnally, we just summarize with our favorite quote on slide 24. from John D
Rockefeller on dividends and we're pleased to have been able to increase our quarterly
dividend per share to DKK1.7, when increase of some 3%.

And with that, we will turn to your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)
Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Youdish
Chicooree of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Hi, good morning everyone. I've got two questions, please. Firstly, could you just provide
us an update on pricing and claims trend, in Denmark and Norway? And secondly, it's in
relation to your guidance on the underlying loss ratio. I think we have seen a steady
improvement of around 40 basis points to 50 basis points in the past year. And
considering you're still sticking with you run of guidance of three to ﬁve range by next
year, with the magnitude of improvement accelerate from here? Thank you.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Good morning to you. I think generally in pricing the general trend we see is quite stable
in the retail segment. We see that we're carrying out the price increases and most area of
around 3% as planned, we see that in most areas the claims inﬂation is slightly lower than
that, then we have as reported in a number of quarters been worried about some of the
Page 5 of 20



FINAL

frequency trends in motor handling that, and some of the average repair cost and in
electrical vehicles and Norway is trying to capture that. But all in all, I would say that the
biggest price trend changes actually still comes from corporate and corporate Norway,
bear in mind that we talked about last year in the spring, that we had increased prices in
corporate Norway by a bit more than 7%, we increase the -- we decided to push the
envelope even harder than that, and we've increased prices in corporate Norway 1 of
January in Q1 by more than 11%, which is a very substantial number but to be honest, we
think that trend needs to continue for a couple of years in order to get to a attractive level
of earnings in the portfolio.
And then we see an a quarter like this quarter that vast majority of our large claims, isn't
corporate and in the bigger commercial accounts and clearly earnings and corporate is
not satisfactory. So we need to continue to work, both on the exposure side of corporate
and also on the average pricing side of corporate. So that is where the main change will
be also for the next couple of years, I think from an underlying claims development point
of view. The 40 to 50 basis points that we've seen is the trend that we expect to continue
to see. And that will then as we see it gradually improved our claims experience. And then
we will see how -- how our runoﬀ development develops, there's no change signals there,
but also as we have communicated a number of times, run-oﬀ is probably something you
should see in the more longer-term -- with a more longer-term classes and that the
development awards 3% to 5% area is a gradual development and not a shop deadline
with a shop date.

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay, understood, very clear, thank you.

Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Asbjorn Mork of Danske Bank.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Yes, good morning from my side. A couple of questions, if I start with Denmark, Morten
you said that organically you're growing 5% in Q1, and you also said that -- that is not
something we should extrapolate on considering Q1 '18. Could you just maybe elaborate
a bit on what is actually the true underlying -- Q2 underlying growth in Denmark and
where is that I mean are you taking market share? Is Denmark turning more benign what -how do you see the general growth for Denmark right now? Thanks

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Good Morning, Asbjorn. I think that the Danish growth is also underlying strong at the
moment, I think there are a number of factors impacting that growth that we cannot just
assume continues. It's quite clear that Denmark is getting a lot of support from the
membership bonus and extrapolating or ﬁguring out, how does that develop longer term
is of course diﬃcult exercise. Then you see all time high for instance in the private lines,
Denmark retention rates, which is something we're continuing to work on, but also
something that you cannot just assume continues upwards.
Page 6 of 20



FINAL

Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2019-04-10

And then it's quite clear that our Danish business is supported both buying the new
partnership agreements like FDM for instance, which is organic, but it gives us excess to a
new group of members and therefore a high growth and it is quite clear that a number of
our new products is supporting growth well and on your question on stealing market
shares or not. Take the new personal line packages, where we have combined classic
accident insurance now with health insurance for private individuals and dental insurance,
which no one else in the market has done. That product alone in Denmark has sold 9,000
policies in the month of March.
And you can add to that the children's health insurance that the sale of cyber insurance, et
cetera. So what that actually proves is that without stealing market share from the others,
we are going to actually grow the market, and as far as we can see the more we grow the
private market that is the healthiest part of our book and the more we grow the customer
brought us [ph] if you will, instead of trying to steal the market share from the others.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then we are growing and enhancing both the top-line and the bottom line without sort of
pushing the market. So I think that private lines actually both in Denmark and Norway is
clearly growing above guidance at the moment. We actually, see you that trend will
continue to grow above guidance. I think that commercial lines is also growing above
guidance, but it's perhaps less sustainable than in private lines. We still see that OBOS
helps commercial in Norway, Alka helps commercial in Denmark and then the big dark
horse is how much will corporate lines pull down the average, you see around very small
growth in corporate in this quarter. But actually the growth in corporate Norway is minus
4.4% in the quarter. The question is how was that number develop?
So if Corporate lines decline less, then actually the group growth will be well above
guidance, but we need to be willing to let the corporate book shrink, to reach the
proﬁtability levels we want to achieve in corporate. And that is a far more important topic
on target than the actual top- line growth. So, hopefully that gives you some new answer
on your question.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

It does -- but does that mean that basically ﬁrst you don't see yourself taking market
shares at the moment, at least not material market shares in Denmark? And secondly, I
guess your proﬁtability on the new private customers that you get and the growth to get
here, I guess that is all things equal higher than the corporate growth that you might lose.
And now your growth is clearly higher than you expected a couple of quarters ago. And
you reiterate the 3.3 billion technical proﬁts guidance for 2020. So my point is rather that,
are you not growing -- are you not making proﬁts when you grow at the moment or are
you just cautious on your generate guidance for 2020?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, I think it's important on the market share questions to say that, we do see that we are
growing slightly, slightly in the number of customers in private, but the majority of the
growth comes from all products, so clearly that's more the driver. We see that new
customers in private lines are by far more proﬁtable than customers in corporate, but
traditionally we can see in the numbers, the new customers have a slightly higher claims
Page 7 of 20



FINAL

ratio in the beginning of their life as an insurance customer and that pulls down a little bit,
but there's no doubt that every time we substitute some top-line from corporate to
private, we're strengthening the company, we're strengthening the future earnings and
therefore we're building more, if you will for eﬃciency [ph] into the future earnings
estimates. But I wouldn't get carried away with the growth are such because it's hard to
predict, how long time will we have this much support from FDM, from NITO, from OBOS
and can we continue to develop new products at the pace, that we're doing currently, but
it is of course very encouraging that we are able to grow our most proﬁtable business
segments, with new products to existing customers without stealing market share, and
without pushing the market.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay, clearly understood. Then on your -- on your underlying or if you look at the large
claims of course high for the group in Q1, but also you say that the vast majority is from
Norway. So I guess we can conclude this very small large claims in Denmark, and then I
guess it was something also to Sweden. So if you look at the underlying, which I guess
you don't really disclose fully, but can you just comment a bit on where is the underlying
develop thing for Denmark, Norway and Sweden on the diﬀerent countryside?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, I guess if you take Norway ﬁrst, which is a of course, what would be the important Q1
question. We have a combined ratio 104.5 in Norway, in the ﬁrst quarter of the 181 million
of large claims for the group roughly a 140 of that comes from Norway. So, of course that's
an important driver of understanding the development. Then we see the runoﬀs in
Norway is roughly half of what it was in Q1 last year, so we were close to 7% on runoﬀs in
Norway last year, we around 3.4, 3.5 this year. So all-in-all what we see is a stable slightly
positive underlying claims development in Norway, slightly less positive than the group
but positive. And then too many moving parts and too many large claims.
So on one hand, very satisﬁed that the underlying in Norway also improves. On the other
hand, clearly not satisﬁed that the large claims are too high and working hard to make
sure that we reduce the large claims exposure and more importantly, that the large claims
component of the premium paid by the corporate customer particularly in Norway but
also in Sweden does that increases.
If you do the math in Sweden, you come to the conclusion, that we have a strong
development in private line Sweden, but we have a combined ratio of corporate Sweden,
which is way above a 100 in the ﬁrst quarter. So, clearly as unacceptable as corporate
Norway. And that is why we see probably this more as a corporate question/large claims
question, then we see it as a Norway question. And we need to make sure that price
increases and corporate Sweden and Norway continue and that the large claims exposure
reduces further in Norway and Sweden. And that job is clearly not done yet. We're in the
process. We said goodbye to 4.4% of the Norwegian corporate book. We've said
goodbye to a lot of the ﬁsh farming in Norway. We said goodbye to most of the bus
customers in Norway, we've reduced the number of the liability customers in Sweden, so
we're producing large claims explosion and number of areas in corporate Sweden and
Norway, but it is not enough yet and the earnings is not acceptable in those two areas.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

FINAL

But, if you look at the weaken business and your retention is basically, as you also said on
the commercial side is up in Q1 and you have reprised. So I guess all things equal we
should expect tailwind going through 2019 and 2020 as it looks right now, is that fair to
assume?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think I would expect that the private lines of business in Norway continues a positive
development throughout the year, actually both top-line and bottom-line and in terms of
claims. I think, we will gradually start to see corporate beneﬁt from the higher prices 7% of
last year, 11% of this year. I'm not completely sure that the largest customers in commercial
Norway has -- had enough price increases to be honest. So it's perfect unlikely that we
need to do more price adjustments there, and that might have some negative drop of on
the top-line of commercial Norway.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

But positive and your technical proﬁts?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Positive on our technical proﬁts as we earn the price increases. Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Exactly, okay. And then a ﬁnal question from my side on Alka, the 21 million of synergies
for Q1 I guess if anything is slightly ahead of plan nothing material of course, but the point
is rather should be expect some sort of catch up eﬀect, I mean you guiding for 75 this year
another 75 next year. But you've got the keys ﬁve months ago, and already now you have
delivered 21. So, are you maybe a little bit more positive on the synergies than you were a
year ago or is it just a number of -- small numbers law?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well I guess, it's one quarter into a three year journey. So I guess on one hand we are very
positive that we've started well, we've started well both in terms of the synergies on the
actual performance of the business. We start with the cost ﬁrst, and then we will see more
and more on claims during the year, and I'm very happy that we have this very German
plan on claims requirements with a 700 contracts because that is running like a machine,
but is also a machine that takes a number of quarters ﬁrst to get into the market and then
to earn the impact as we go through all the claims. So I wouldn't get carried away by the
fact that we are a little bit ahead of the plan but of course it's reassuring with a large target
like 300 that we've started really well.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Alright, that's all from my side. Thanks a lot.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mads Thinggaard of ABG Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Yeah, hi this is Mads from ABG Thank you for taking my questions. The ﬁrst one would like
to slide a 15 in the stacked deck where you were -- you mentioned the large claims and
expected annual level 2019 of DKK550 million is that I mean including the very high large
claims in Q1 or is that more kind of a normal long-term average annual level, you punch
through here?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Good morning, Mads. It's a clearly normalized long-term level that we expect. If you look
at the -- it's quite clear that number is never correct, but it is the most sensible, long-term
trend that we can ﬁnd. So that is the answer.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Okay. And then I was thinking about the, I mean, now you have the high investment
beside Q1 and I don't know if you could kind of put a bit of light on the outlook for an
extraordinary dividend in 2019 on back of this very strong start to the investment results in
'19?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think if we could booked a ticket to three more quarters of investments like Q1, then we
will have a party at the end of the year. No, but seriously I think that the challenges of
course that while we have a very high investment income Q1. The political uncertainty ,
globally are still very high and I think that we're still headed for could be several years of
high uncertainties on investment income. So we would largely base our ordinary dividend
and future extraordinary dividends on the core business and not just the development on
investments. We will get back to you in due course when we come to the conclusion on
future dividends, and it will be too early days to talk about this now.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Okay, thanks. And then just a ﬁnal question from my end, you were kind of addressing the
3 to 5 percentage point one-oﬀ guidance for 2020 perhaps saying it would not
necessarily be a very sharp at dead line and a getting down to that level, is that kind of -- I
mean are you kind of implying at bit of new communication here. I mean, it's the 3
percentage point perhaps starting to look a bit too low or how should we interpret this?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

No. I think, we're not changing any communication and while I appreciate understanding
that fully is quite diﬃcult. What you need to bear in mind was that or is that some of our
claims development take workers gotten [ph] for instance that is runoﬀ development from
claims that are almost 20 years old. So predicting and precision where -- how would they
develop two years from now is completely impossible. So what we did in 2017 was to
make an estimate of the three to ﬁve from year 2020 and onwards. And we have no doubt

that is -- that will be the long-term trends. But it's also quite clear that given the nature and
the tail length of some of these reserves, you cannot just say that by Q1, 2020 or by Q4,
2020 this will be the result. That is not the level of precision that you could expect in runoﬀ gains. So I think, what you should expect is that we will longer-term moves towards the
3% to 5%, but there's not a mathematical precision on in which quarter that precisely will
happen. So, that's more the signaling.

Thanks very much. I just wanted -- ﬁrst one to have a little point of clariﬁcation on the new
private bundle products, you're selling. Should we assume that is what's driving the
additional products per customer? That's question one. And if not what is driving that and
what's the target product to drive that up. And sort of related to that you tell us 60% [ph]
of all inquiries are now digital. Is that helping push the new product through, is that's what
you're seeing, and also can you tell us whether there's going to be any more investment
needed in that digital push? Many thanks.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you. Well, ﬁrst of all on the additional products, it's fair to say that while it would be
nice to invents in the next motor insurance. And then with the one new product, and then
the average number of product goes up, that is not really what is going on. It is really
more master of selling lots of new small products and lots of news small coverages. If to
give you a couple of examples, so it's not one product, it's several as more than a handful,
but to give you a couple of examples, we now sale for instance content insurance
including an Alarm. So that's not a new product, but it adds to the average price of the
content insurance and therefore it adds to the top-line and the broadness of the customer
cover.
Then children's health insurance is for instance a new product, which is adding to the
number of products. The new personal lines package which then also includes for
instance dental insurance would be part of increasing the number of products per
customer. So it is a number of smaller initiatives, but the beneﬁt of all of them is that they
make the customer relationship broader to customers we already know, who are already
proﬁtable and then also in turn it enhances the retention rate, because we clearly see the
more products customers have the longer they stay with us. So there's a broad process
and other one single product covering that.
When it comes to the digital development, the 60% a digital approach is now helping us
get value out of our investments. It doesn't actually help the new product coverage, on

the contrary when people buy online they tend to buy one or two products so generally
there's a task of making sure that customers that buy one product online is then cross sold
on all of the other products, but largely what people do online is to report claims, is to
manage claims, and it needs to manage service. So let me give you a small example or
two small examples now 20% of all claims reported. I actually handle straight through
online, untouched by human hand in a few seconds. Of course that pulls down our
processing cost and pulls up the customer satisfaction. Then we made a survey that a ton
of the customer phone calls relate to the billing. But now we've made an online solution
where you can see, your billing and explanations to that billing. And we see that in Q1
alone 70,000 customers have used the online billing functionality instead of calling us. So
a lot of it has to do with less processing cost, less claims handling costs, and higher
customer satisfaction and not really new product sales.

Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Per Gronborg of SEB Please go ahead,
your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. Two topics from my side. First of all back to the large claims should states
that 140 million approximately came from Norway, if I look at the Sweden the diﬀerence
between segment Sweden and country Sweden is loss of 58 million, it must imply that
they are also having a quite signiﬁcant part of the large claims. Is it fair to assume that the
large claims in Denmark in Q1 has been pretty close to zero?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

That is fair to say the large claims area and corporate Sweden is 33 million in the quarter,
which leaves next to nothing to Denmark, so that is completely correct.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

If I look at your communication over the last not every quarter but many quarters, want to
sit in back with the perception that the run rate of large claims must be materially higher
in Norway and maybe also in Sweden compared to Denmark, if you want group level is
accounting for 2.5% of its large claims, is that the divided by 1 and 1.5 in Sweden and 3 to
4 Norway, how should we look at that?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, that's a very good question, Per. I think you know, we've tried to use this slide 6, to
give some illustration on how large claims have looked historically. That the problem of
course, insurance is paid based on huge amounts of data and empirical evidence on
claims frequency, and claim severity, and in any private lines and commercial lines that
works great, but the reality is that the empirical data on large claims is way too small,
Page 12 of 20



Company Name: Tryg A/S

FINAL

we've had some quarters now where Norway and Sweden is heavily overweight in the
large claims, but if you go back ﬁve, six years we can see periods what Denmark was
heavily overweight on the large claims. So there's another clear historical pattern if you
look at it in with the longer-term classes but there is a short-term pattern where Norway
and Sweden is the challenge on large claims.
And when we combine that with the fact that even the underlying claims trend in
corporate Sweden and Corporate Norway is not satisfying either. So there's no -- really no
doubt that Corporate Norway and Sweden is where we increase prices the most, is where
we reduce exposure to large claims the most but I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that
longer-term that's where we have the large claims, there's really no evidence to support
that.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay, thank you for putting light on that. My second question is your top-line was quite
impressive, the top-line
top on your show you have deducted the rebate, the rebates one way this quarter is very
high compared to what is it normally is. How should we look at this the 150 million
something that you have deducted in the rebate this quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, the trigger part is of course that from an accounting point of view. You have to take
typically when you've got partnership agreement. So agreements with unions or bigger
group of customers very often they are somehow tied to sharing some of the proﬁts. So
what actually happens is that when our private lines for instance is producing more and
more proﬁts, we share a proportion of that with the partner or the union or whomever it is,
an accounting wise you have to deduct that from premiums.
And then you can debate is that really a premium question, well, it's not a classical
premium question at least, but that is what is going on that we share, we don't share more
of the earnings, but as earnings grow in private the -- we keep on sharing the same
proportion with the partner and then the actual bonus and rebate increases somewhat. It
is somewhat volatile during the quarters. And to be honest we could perhaps be a bit
better at predicting that quarterly, but we're doing our best to try to make that number
correct, but that is the nature of the substance of the business. So if you see that number
growing is because earnings is growing.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay, but the very high level this number has basically reduced your earnings. If you say -what I hear you say between the lines it maybe they should only have been 100, there may
be a 25 then this has basically reduced your earnings this quarter because you have paid
every rebate to some of your group customers this quarter, which basically maybe
belongs to last year?

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

FINAL

But so -- that is that would clearly be part of the explanation Per. Because when you do the
full-year accounts, then often you end up that the estimate you did on the proﬁt sharing
with a partner was not completely correct. So then you have to adjust that in Q1 and that
happens almost all every year, either positive adjustment or negative adjustment. So that
is completely correct, and that can distort the quarter-on-quarter comparison somewhat.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect, I've got a better understanding what happens. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jakob Brink of Nordea. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Thank you. I have two questions please, or actually three questions. So coming back to
the what you said initially Morten, about the many times actually about the, that you're not
really taking too much market share, but you're just inventing new products or selling new
products to the customers. Now of course, we don't know exactly how much you're
making on these new products, but looking at the growth in Norway private for example,
it's up signiﬁcantly year-on-year from Q4 compared to Q4, '17 to now Q1 versus Q1. So, I
just ﬁnd it a bit diﬃcult to think that it's only due to new products and all of a sudden
making such a big increased in underlying numbers aﬀects adjusted and everything and
also in Denmark actually. So could you maybe give us a bit more detail on how much is
actually market share gains and how much is new products to the customers?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think to start on that question, Jakob, it's quite important that when you dig into the
country speciﬁc there's a lot of diﬀerence because clearly, if you look throughout our
business, private lines is the one driving the concept of more products, not commercial
lines. Within private lines, Denmark is clearly ahead of Norway, so if you look at it from a
private lines, Denmark point of view, I would say that we haven't put numbers on the split,
but the new products driver is higher than the new customers driver.
Then if you move to private lines Norway, we are trying to catch up with the new products
in Denmark, but we're clearly further behind. And in Norway there's clearly the impact
that the mutual agreement, the total [ph] agreement and the OBOS agreement, is not as
such inorganic, but it is new partnership agreements allowing us to tap into new
membership basis, which actually means that we are growing the number of customers in
private lines Norway. So, the split between new products and new customers is clearly
diﬀerent between Denmark private and Norway private. Again, we haven't given the split
but that is to give you some ones that the country development is quite diﬀerent.

FINAL

So, to reason I'm asking as, I mean the all those partnership agreements, as you said -- I
mean, it is really organic growth. You're taking the customers from someone else, it's not
like you've been buying a book of premiums. So, isn't there's a risk that you're growing so
much more than I was just checking last year the number of policies in Norway, was up 2%
for the whole market in both Morten and house and you're growing is it 9% you write in
your report, is no risk that competitors will somehow strike back or

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I understand your line of questioning, Jakob. But if you do the 5, 8 year history data
evaluation in Private lines Norway. What you would ﬁnd is that for the majority of those
years, we've lost market share in Private lines Norway. So when you compare for us, it
means that just adjusting getting to a balance, where we don't lose market share in
Norway, adding a little bit of new customers particularly in the Oslo and Eastern part of
Norway, where need to at all an OBOS is stronger represented than we have historically
been. So just getting up to a neutral and then a slight positive on the number of
customers is a rather big swing from a period, where we lost customers systematically
every year.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I wouldn't say that, we are increasing the number of customers dramatically, I'd rather
say that we came from a rather r large loss of customers, and the swing factor is quite
signiﬁcant. And I'm not seeing a development in a Norwegian market, where we are
pushing competition anywhere. I don't think we're large enough to do that in Norway. I
think the number of customers will winning in Norway is Norway EMEA large enough to
have such an impact.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay. It's just a Norway as well the merger of DnB and Spare bank [ph] and one insurance
is that anything to do with the high-growth that it's basically just easier to take market
share now?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

No. No I would say that -- well, if you look at for instance a new partnership agreement
was made with more of a natural, natural and always all the engineers in Norway, we've
had that similar agreement in Denmark for a number of years, and we've built a large
portfolio on several 100 million, with the engineers. So that's one example of growing
with a customer segment with a partner because we now cooperates with that union that
really has nothing to do with what DnB and (inaudible) Bank one is doing. I think the
whole market is waiting to see how will DnB and (inaudible) banking actually impact the
Norwegian market, I think consolidation generally leads to -- to more discipline. So that
would be my expectation, but I haven't seen any real impact on the Norwegian market
from that question yet.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. And then ﬁnal question. Gian, you mentioned in the solvency SCR walk
91 million that you used to mitigate the negatives, could you maybe give us a bit more

Page 15 of 20

detail on this and how much more mitigating actions do you have for -- for quarters like
this?

FINAL

A - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Well, I'm not sure if I can comment on more mitigating action, but this is actually a
relatively normal every time at year end we take a lean in depth look at the model, as you
know, we only do the partial internal model for insurance risk. So we look at all the
parameters and there's always basically some smaller adjustment you need to bear in
mind that we have 24 billion -- 25 billion a claims reserved and more than 20 billion of
premium so just small adjustment to the parameters, can give some moving parts and in
this case, it was more in the long retail part of the business. So I wouldn't mainly this age
anything recurrent or anything like this on a recurring basis year ago.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonny Urwin at UBS please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. Just two from me please. Firstly Norwegian large losses. Can you just give us a
bit more color and what drive those I guess what I'm getting at is this a market issue, or is
it just some bad luck on speciﬁc policies for you guys. And then secondly, retentions
obviously trending well, pretty much across the book. But in Denmark speciﬁcally, how
much more beneﬁts to come from the customer bonus model, please? thank you.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Good morning to you as well Jonny. Well, I think on the large claims one particular trend
which is quite clear is that this is a largely property issue. Not the other lines, I think if we
look at it last year, we had some problems with liability particularly out of Sweden but this
year is largely property claims, when you didn't look within the property claims we've
seen ﬁsh farming in Norway, which was a challenge in the fall but again a challenge this
year, it has to do with the actual handling of the ﬁsh after the farming, where we had a
large ﬁre and then we had ﬁres also in some of the large commercial exposures. So, if
anything it is the property segment, which is the billing.
We've now reduced our exposure in ﬁsh farming and general quite dramatically. We have
taken our exposure to ﬁsh farming down more than 50%, during the past six months and
increasing prices more than 20% on the remaining part. So I think we've taking some
quite harsh measures in that area, but we're not ﬁnished working on ensuring that the
corporate property customers pay enough premium to support the large claim risk. So
that is a bit of color on that. I think on the retention rates in Denmark, there is still more
potential from the customer bonus. It is still only 65%, 67% of the customers that
understand that they received a bonus, I think still that against those close to 90, so there
Page 16 of 20



Company Name: Tryg A/S

FINAL

should be more potential. It climbs every year, but it's still not at the level where it should
end.
So there should be more potential for next two, three years on that and then I think that
we retention also has to do with what you experience when you have a claim? How fast it - is it how satisfaction -- how satisﬁed are you with that. It's also linked to the number of
customers or number of products, because if you have more products to stay with us
longer. We can see that we're improving customer satisfaction in a number of areas, but
we've just implemented a new measurement system where we try to measure customer
satisfaction throughout all of the contact points. And to be honest we can ﬁnd lots of
contact points where the customers are not satisﬁed and where the solutions are not
good enough and for instance, we can measure some of the digital solutions where
satisfaction is clearly not as high as we want it to be. So our list of customer experience
areas that we would like to improve is a very long list.
So we continue to ﬁnd areas which can support the customer experience, which can
support the retention rate. But still predicting retention rate is extremely diﬃcult, but I
think, there's a general observation that the more we continuously work to push up
satisfaction. The more we at least pushing the retention rate in the right direction. And
then we cannot come --predict how competitors reacts or bad press or whatever which
could impact a retention negatively, but we can make sure we have a pipeline of positive
retention drivers and that is something we continuously working on.

Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on the large losses. I used on the property loss, they
used to seeing the market (inaudible) and step away as well?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think we're seeing the market increase prices and rates in the corporate book in Norway.
And that is very comforting to see of course, we cannot see competitors large claims that
there is no sort of public data on that so unfortunately I don't have visibility on that, but we
can see the competitors in corporate Norway are increasing prices as well. And if you look
at the results in corporate they should because they have the same challenge as we do.

Q - Phil Ross

{BIO 20618440 <GO>}

Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just a point of clariﬁcation for me,
on the composition of runoﬀ gains this quarter. I know you gave the example, Morten of

Page 17 of 20

the unpredictability of workers comp runoﬀ more, most when the medium to long term,
but I wasn't sure, if you suggesting that workers comparison part of the reason for the
high runoﬀ gains in this quarter or whether it came from other sources? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, I think generally that's a lot of the runoﬀ gains typically comes from the longer tails
lines, which means that their workers comp always play a lead role, motor liability always
plays the lead role, areas like health and sickness and the more longer tail lines player
lead role, the role, I don't think we have published the splits of runoﬀs, but clearly workers
comp for motor liability and those are some of the biggest areas, but that's quite -- quite
classic. And then I guess liability in corporate a little bit of property, but there's no -there's nothing new or particularly noteworthy on the trend or split of that. I think,
something like a third of the runoﬀs comes from motor, something like a quarter comes
from property , the churn from health and accident, but there's to be honest that looks
much like other quarters, there's nothing really new or special on that.

Q - Phil Ross

Q - Analyst
Yeah, good morning. (inaudible) from ABG, just two very quick follow-ups. The ﬁrst one
goes to large claims, have you done more mitigating eﬀect the to prevent the large claims

coincidence that it's higher in Norway and Sweden?

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I would love to say yes, but the reality is that we cannot say that. I think we work
consistently with requirements on sprinkling the properties of large exposures we were
systematically on containing or compartmentalizing the various factories, but there's really
no clear evidence that has been more eﬃcient in Denmark than in Norway and I can go
back in history and ﬁnd periods where Denmark was the villain, when it comes to large
claims and corporate. So, no we don't see a magical cure their but there is a cure, which is
to make sure that the average corporate customer pays a signiﬁcant higher proportion of
their premium to support large claims. So it is linked to the fact that the corporate
premiums are too low, but we are as I said reducing our exposure to for instance ﬁsh
farming because we see that they are over represented . We've also reduced our
exposure to the bus sector in Norway and Sweden because earnings were too low. So
every time we see a more structural component, we react to that by reducing exposure or
increasing a prices, but is not that Denmark has the magical to you on that.

Q - Analyst
Okay, thank you. Just to ﬁnd that among prices you say those slide 11, that your price on
house Norway is up by 3% is this whole system more than the underlying inﬂation? Or
how should you read that note? And ﬁnally, on the 2.2% for car or motor inﬂation, if you
put into a diﬀerent mix or car, more electric or a diﬀerent type of car in the year book this
year than last year?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think ﬁrst of all that when we show Slide 11, which we've been showing consistently for a
very long period of time, it has some pros and some cons, the pro is that it's transparent
and it's visible the (inaudible) is that it mixes price change and exposure mix change or
customer change. So for instance on average the price increases we're doing on house at
the moment should be slightly higher than what we see on claims inﬂation, on the other
hand, you would look at the number 2.2 on comp and Norway and say isn't that number
slightly too low and actually the composition of that is the some of our large partner
agreements in Norway falls down, the average price development on motor whereas our
average direct customers pull up this average and clearly if you look at the Tesla segment,
we are looking at a price increases closer to 10%. If you look at the average electrical cars,
we're looking more at sort of 5% to 7% and then the usual cars lower than that, so there's
a lot of variation underneath that number, but clearly direct customers pull up the average
and particularly one large partner agreement pulls down the 2.2%.

Q - Analyst
Okay, so you are out of the left electrical car to your portfolio stop to the type of from the
need to aﬀect?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, it's quite clear that while we have a lot of electrical cars in the portfolio and it's
increasing every day. We don't have a very high weight of this sort of Tesla segment,
which is the expensive electrical cars and they have a higher claims frequency and they
also have a higher claims average because the garage and repair structure for instance
Page 19 of 20

Tesla's is a lot more diﬃcult to get eﬃcient than repairing a -- if Volkswagen, which is a
hybrid or an electrical or Toyota for instance. So there's a lot of diﬀerence between the
two and we have more of the smaller traditional brand, electrical and hybrids and less of
the Tesla's which helps our development.
