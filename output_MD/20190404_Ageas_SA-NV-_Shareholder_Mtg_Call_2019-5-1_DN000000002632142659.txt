Presentation
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ageas Conference Call. I am pleased to present
you Mr. Christophe Boizard, Chief Financial Officer. For the first part of this call, let me
remind you that all participants will remain on a listen-only mode and afterwards there will
be a question-and-answer session.
I will now like to hand over to Mr. Christophe Boizard, CFO. Sir, please go ahead.

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Thank you very much and thank you for joining the call. The call is to give you some
explanation about reinsurance, and before starting the presentation, I'd like to introduce
the people who are with me. So first to the reinsurance team, Jan Van Rethy and Joachim
Racz who are responsible for managing the reinsurance operation at the holding level,
and then as usual I am joined by the IR team, Veerle, Anais, and Arnaud.
I hope all of you have the presentation and I will start with the first slide with a little bit of
history. If you look at -- but something really new, the reinsurance within Ageas. So we
started in 2015 with a rather simple concept. We wanted to increase our share in non-life
and a possible approach was to participate through the protection program of our
subsidiaries, either controlled or joint venture.

So with this we achieved several goals at the same time. So first, we improved the
protection of the group for the cat event. We aligned the cession with a group risk
appetite because before since we are a decentralized group, all the different entities
were responsible for putting in place their protection program there was no real
coordination at the group level. So we didn't have really a group approach. And with -- the
protection was not calibrated at the group level. So sometime we had some range effect,
meaning that we could have some accumulation of risk and we thought of in particular the
storm hitting the UK and Belgium, it is likely that when a storm arrives in the UK, it hits the
Belgium as well.
And then we achieved secondary goals like saving on the external placement because we
had the better purchasing power, putting everything into the same basket at the holding
level. So the principle were rather simple. We let the entity put in place their protection
program and the intervention at the holding level was only a participation in the allocation
of shares, and we put limits at 50%. So we didn't want to go beyond 50% of share in each
program. Why? So that we still maintain access to the reinsurance market and that we
ensure that the market conditions and the pricing conditions be respected.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then after this, I would say, successful implementation and all the risk were underwritten
through the vehicle which was holding [ph] Intreas directly 100% held by the holdings,
which was part of the holding function. But beyond this, we wanted to go further and to
play with a new concept, which is the capital fungibility. So the first step, the Intreas
approach more participating to the protection program and optimizing the protection of
the group, so there was an aspect -- risk management aspect there.
And the second idea -- second what I would call dimension, it was more a financial
approach and financing optimization and capital fungibility. And that's what we have called
internally the Apollo project. So the idea was the following: once all the entities are
protected locally, it has some very obvious advantage to move "part of the business to
the holding through the implementation of quota share. So quota share of contracted
business which means, by the way, that once we assume this risk at the holding level, we
don't need additional protection. So it can be done on a case-by-case basis, but the
principle is that we can accept this quota share without putting in place (inaudible). The
books accepted are already protected. So we have obvious advantages by doing this and
disadvantages relates to the capital fungibility when you put at the same place some
operation you have -- you put the capital in one place and you have a better capital
fungibility.
So if we go to the next slide, you have more details about -- on how it works. So obviously
we can put that in place quota share with controlled entity, with the Intreas approach, the
participation to the protection program with the scope was the controlled entity plus the
partnership. So it's the reason why, for instance, we have some shares in the Turkish
program and in the program in Thailand and in the future we will participate to the Indian
program through -- thanks to the new joint venture we have recently signed in India. So
the scope was controlled entity plus joint venture.
On the quota share, the scope is limited to controlled entity. So on slide 3 you have the
three entities who will be within this quota share arrangement, so starting with Belgium.

FINAL

We have put in place a 30% quota share with the non-life of Belgium. On Continental
Europe it will be a 20% cession plus LPT. I will come back on this. And on the UK, the
cession rate will be 30% as well, including the LPT, and Asia is put aside and there is no
quota share coming from Asia because there is no controlled entity.
This was possible since July of last year when we obtained the license from the National
Bank in Belgium. So formally as from the middle of the year 2018, Ageas SA/NV became
reinsurer. We started with pilot as from July 1st with Portugal only to ensure that the
administration and all the internal processes were aligned and ready. And we started at
full scale from January 1st, 2019.
So this activity comes in addition to the previous one, the one formerly underwritten by in
Intreas. Intreas will be moved and there will be -- the business of Intreas will be moved
within Ageas SA/NV. So as from 2019, all the reinsurance operation will be recognized
within Ageas SA/NV and Intreas will progressively disappear from the landscape and will
be liquidated before the end of the year. By the way, we will ask for the withdrawal of the
license in the Netherland. So everything will be in Ageas SA/NV.

Bloomberg Transcript

So maybe (inaudible) about the LPT and to explain the concept. So when we put on this
slide, quota share, we mean here quota share of new business. So it means that within
the scope of what we call quota share are all the contracts underwritten as from January
1st, 2019. But then if we limited ourselves to this, we have -- we would have a rather slow
intermediary period and rather long ramp-up period. Why? Because we have to build
scale and to obtain the steady-state status.
So if you want to be at the steady-state status in a quicker way, you have to take into
account the existing business and to transfer part of the existing business, and that's
precisely the purpose of this so-called LPT. So LPT stands for loss portfolio transfer. And
with this the underlying concept here is that we transfer the existing reserves. So when we
-- you take the balance sheet at the end of 2018, you take the existing claims, you take
the corresponding ceding rate, either 30% or 20% in Portugal and you transfer through a
kind of asset and liability transfer this, and in that case it means that as soon as January 1st
of the following year, so meaning 2019 for us, you have the new business plus all the
accounting effect of the past business, including the reserve release of reserve increases,
if any. So that's the explanation on the concept of LPT.
If we go to the next slide, slide 4, here we enter into more detail because for each
segment, Belgium, UK and Portugal, we have almost I would say specificity, and we think
that it is worth entering into some more detail. Starting with Belgium, so with Belgium, the
cession rate was set at 30%. The exact scope is non-life excluding healthcare. Why
excluding health care? No big reason except that it was more for operational reasons. It
would have been more difficult to include healthcare. So it was excluded for, I would say,
commodity [ph] and it is not a big business, and we indicated that big business in the
sense that it accounts for less than 3% of the operating result. So the inclusion of lot of
healthcare doesn't really change the picture, but it was much easier for us on an
administrative standpoint to exclude the healthcare business. So nothing beyond this.

Then there is a very specific element on Belgium is the fact that Ageas doesn't hold 100%
of the subsidiary that we have a very significant third-party shareholder BNP Paribas. So
what we did is we had a discussion with BNP Paribas to collect their agreement on the
participation to the scheme because for us the simple way of approaching this concept
was to obtain the participation of BNP Paribas. So that the perfect alignment of interest be
maintained. After a long negotiation, the BNP Paribas group accepted and 25% of this
quota share agreement will be underwritten by an insurance subsidiary of BNP Paribas,
Cardif Risques Divers.
So in a nutshell, we have a 30% cession and within this 30% cession, three-fourth will be
underwritten by us, one fourth will be underwritten by Cardif Risques Divers, and the
three-fourth, one fourth exactly corresponds to the shareholdership we have in AG. So
that was the first, I would say, important explanation.
The second one is why don't we have an LPT in Belgium. And LPT immediately implies, I
would say, large figures. I want to start with the quota share for new business, you start
with all your accounts at zero on January 1st and then you positively build up your portfolio
and you positively build up and increase accounting impact of this. When you transfer
existing business and when you put in place LPT, you are immediately faced with big
figures because you have to accommodate in your balance sheet, 30% of the claims and
the corresponding assets to cover these claims. And this was difficult for Cardif Risques
Divers to take its share. Why? Because Cardif is mainly a life group. Their non-life activity is
not huge, and they don't have a reinsurance license. So accepting reinsurance for them is
acceptable under the French regulation if it is something "minor or smaller" vis-a-vis the
rest of the business. So they had some limitation in size and it's the reason why we
decided with them to exclude LPT. The consequence is that the ramp-up period is longer.
But when we converge to the steady state, we are exactly in the same situation.
I would say it will take instead of being at a steady-state immediately, it will take three or
four year to be at full speed on Belgium. That's the explanation. So constraints coming
from the partner, but even you know we are modest people, but to put in place such an
arrangement when you have a 25% shareholder leaving the capital it's, I would say, a
rather decent achievement. So even if we had to give up on the LPT, ideally for us, it's a
very satisfactory outcome that we have reached on Belgium, which was -- you can get key
elements because since it is the bigger piece, putting in place the reinsurance
arrangements on Belgium was a key factor of success for the whole project.
Then the (inaudible) segment. UK, here we are at 100%. So it was an (inaudible)
negotiation, and we put in place a 30% quota share, including the LPT. So we are -- the full
idea was implemented. And to be precise on the scope, we limited to AIL, and we
excluded Tesco underwriting again for obvious reasons. It's a joint venture at 50%, and it
was difficult and we didn't even try to convince the partner because it was not, I would
say, relevant enough to spend too much effort on this. So we thought that limiting to AIL
was very sufficient and was satisfactory.
On Portugal, so since we are on the non-life segment, Portugal we own 100% of the
business. So as it was the case for the UK, it was an, I would say, internal negotiation. And
here we have a 20% cession rate, and we have the LPT. Two explanations here: why 20%
Page 4 of 20

and not 30%? I have to admit that I don't have strong explanation. We started with 20%
and then we let the negotiation go until it's end. We could have done 30%, but we were
very busy with negotiation with AG and let's say that we little bit -- I don't know if I should
use this word, but we overlooked Portugal in this. 20% was already quite an acceptable
starting point, and we left it at 20%. So no strong reason for the 20%, being but this
cession rate have to be seen as a starting point, and in the future it is not excluded that
we slightly increase the cession rate. And in that case, the ideal will be to align Portugal
with the others at least.
And second explanation about the exclusion of workmen comp for the LPT it is more with
protection against unexpected reserve development. You all know about workmen's
comp in Portugal is not the most profitable line of business. It's something where we really
acquired the scale when we bought the AXA portfolio, the workmen comp business. It is a
turnaround story and we have to improve the result on this. We are quite on track, but I
would say the visibility was not as good as it was on other lines of business. So we
excluded workmen comp from the LPT, but workmen comp is included in the quota share.
So we will have the ramp-up period on workmen comp but it is the inclusion of workmen
comp is I would say more progressive.
Going to the next slide, slide 5, what are the implications on the structure of the
reporting, which are not much. So under structure is not much, even if the figures will be
changed. So we will keep the present structure with the geographical segment starting
with Belgium, UK, Continental Europe, and Asia, the four traditional segments. We already
have reinsurance in our reporting but reinsurance so far has been limited to what we call
the Intreas scope. So the first approach, the participation to the protection program of the
(inaudible). Now the reinsurance segment will include the quota shares. Then we have the
General Account and the total will be the group.
Either way you can see here that insurance -- the insurance scope has disappeared. You'll
remember that with the fact that litigation are seen are now off the table. We think that
we can switch on the insurance view to the group view but we don't need now to
understand this sub perimeter, subtotal insurance. So the future presentation will consist
of the six segments: Belgium, UK, Continental Europe, Asia, Reinsurance, and the General
Account and then the total of the six segments will be the group.
On the General Account, the idea was to maintain the existing scope. So what we call
General Account, should be seen as the holding functions. So here you will have the costs
of the holding plus all the financing costs, all things related to the holding and the -- with
this we maintain homogeneity vis-a-vis the part. So when you will compare in 2019 the
General Account with former figures of the General Account in 2018-2017, you won't have
to put in place any scope restatement. It will be perfectly compatible because the that
attractive business will be recognized in the Reinsurance segment. But, having said that,
the "holding" consists of reinsurance plus General Account. So in the Reinsurance plus
General Account, you have Ageas SA/NV plus I would say the thing like RPI [ph] or either
small entities that on -- so the Reinsurance will be all the holding entities. Reinsurance will
be exact the reinsurance business out of the holding entity and General Account will be
the rest. And it is in that sense that we are perfectly in line with the previous definition of
the General Account. So I think it will be easy for you to track the change and the evolution
Page 5 of 20

FINAL

of the General Account and it will be easy as well to track the effect of this new activity of
reinsurance within the Reinsurance segment.
Now I'd like to go to the next slide on slide 6 where we have given illustrative example of
how it works with quota share, and please do note that these figures are not real figures
even if they are not very far from some reality, but please consider this as an illustrative
example and don't take these figures as any forecast or things like this. So I start with the
first line. So GWP stands for gross written premium. So when you have 1,000 at the -- at
the local segment, so we start with 1,000 on the gross written premium side. Then we
have the net earned premium. So net earned premium, here you have the effect of the
quota share. So when we have a 30% cession rate, we apply the simple 30% on the 900
of the net earned premium. So we cede 270. So at the end, the net earned premium
recognized at the segment level, the geographical segment like Belgium, Continental
Europe, or the UK, 630 and we have 270 in the Reinsurance segment.
On the net claim, net expenses, it's rather simple. We apply the 30% cession rate to all
this line. Then we have the overrider and profit commission. So doing your quota share
means that we take more or less a tranche, I would say, of the technical account of the
cedant and all this tranche is recognized in the Reinsurance segment, but there is one
difference is the recognition of this overrider and profit commission. We cannot claim that
we can acquire like this 30% of the portfolio without paying anything to the cedant. Why?
Because -- and the idea and the concept, well known in the reinsurance business is Ageas
SA/NV alone couldn't acquire by itself such a portfolio. So we have to recognize an extra
remuneration for having this portfolio available to be recognized within the accounts. And
that's the purpose of this overrider and profit commission is to recognize something on
top of the simple recognition of the general expenses plus commission to remunerate
the fact that we have access to a book of business.
And it is where I would say all the negotiation takes place. All the lines are straightforward.
You apply the 30% cession rate, and all the economics of the quota share is within this
overriding and profit commission. So when you discuss -- the discussion between the
cedant and the reinsurer is mainly apart from the contractual terms but all the accounting
effect, all the discussions and negotiation is on this overrider and profit commission.
That's where the tough discussion stands, and it is where we have to ensure that market
prices are used in this transaction. You know that the tax authorities are -- when you have
a tax inspection, the tax inspection within the group is very often on the so-called contract
[ph] prices. So you can say that it is here that we can make sure that market conditions are
used the overrider and profit commission. So it is on this line that we ensure that market
prices are used, and for this we used some advisors and we used some reinsurance
brokers. By the way, we each -- the cedants and us, each party had its own adviser so that
we really had, I would say, contradictory discussion and so that we have a very strong file
in case of a tax inspection.
With this we end up with the underwriting results. We have some investment result
because we will receive cash flows from the cedant at the holding level, and we will have
to invest this and we will receive some investment result. By the way, one interesting
feature here is that this quota share scheme are not aimed at changing the way the
assets are invested within the group. So with this I mean that at the holding level we will
Page 6 of 20

FINAL

replicate the asset allocation of the cedant. So Ageas SA/NV will run three different
investment portfolio, one corresponding to the Belgian cash flows, one for the UK cash
flow, one for the Portuguese cash flows, and we will invest this according to the strategic
and tactical asset allocation authorized and in place in local entities. And so it means
taking a precise example that we will advise on Portuguese debt at the holding level to
replicate the asset allocation of Portugal. So it means that on a consolidated basis there is
no change on the asset allocation. I think that's something to be noted.
Then we have on the following slide, slide 7, some explanation about the ramp up effect
on IFRS, and starting with the LPT impact in Portugal and in the UK, So and here I am trying
to give you some guidance about what the Q1 account will look like, without giving figures,
but at least the principles. So impact on the local segment. All the gross parameters will
be unchanged, either the gross written premium, the gross figure, everything will be
unchanged. Then what will appear is reinsurance share in the provision for outstanding
claims. So it means that when you take the balance sheet of the cedant, on the asset side
you will have the new line which is these provision for reinsurer's share in provision which
correspond to what is transferred through the LPT and then on the top of this, the new
claim recognized during the first quarter of activity for what we call the new business, the
regular quota share. So one quarter of new business plus the LPT if any, so in Portugal and
in the UK.
We have -- there are several ways of recognizing the LPT in the accounts and we chose to
-- we chose the so-called premium method which means that the compensation for the
move in the reserve will be done through premium. So with this concept let me elaborate
a little bit more. So on the cedant side we'll cede claim. So it's a big profit for him and this
big profit will be compensated by ceded premium, which will be a minus. So the two
minor cedes will compensate themselves, and then if you go on the Reinsurance
segment, that's contrary. So we acquire a liability on these claims and we are
"remunerated" or paid through premium.
The small issue we will be faced with at the end of Q1 is that will have a huge impact on
the net earned premium and the net earned premium are the denominator for the
technical KPIs non-life and in particular on the combined ratio. So the combined ratio will
have a strange look at the end of Q1 and of Q2, Q3, Q4. So that's something we will see
more over 2019, but we will provide you with restated figures, and we will give you pro
forma figures as if the loss portfolio transfer had been recognized with direct asset and
liability transfer which was the alternative. So we will give you a combined ratio which will
be comparable to the -- to the usual ones, but the direct calculation will give wrong
figures -- wrong figures in the sense that they will not give the right idea of the -- of the
result of the business.
Then on the next page, on the contrary, what will be the impact of the absence of LPT in
Belgium. Absence of LPT in Belgium means that you will have, I would say, less impact on
combined ratio which won't be as strong as it is for the UK and for Portugal. But you will
have some effect, effect being the following: all of that we usually have result coming
from past period. The previous year reserve release, which is the tradition within AG with
significant figures, and here we will have a small disalignment and it will be profitable to
AG. Why? Because since there is no LPT, AG will recognize the full reserve release on
Page 7 of 20

100% of its business, whereas on the current business, on the current book, they will be
exposed only on the profit side only to 70%, because of the 30% cession rate. And since
they have a cautious approach in the current year reserve methodology, you will have
more -- you will have more coming from the past because it will correspond to 100% of
the portfolio, and I would -- I would call this "burden" of (inaudible) will be less because it
will be ceded to the reinsurance. So it means that they will have better result. At the
holding level we will have, I would qualify them, starting result with maybe some starting
losses, but then what we expect is favorable development over time. But as a start the
effect will be that the -- in the script of the result it will be favorable to AG and slightly
unfavorable to the holding. But as it is rightly said in the title, it's a ramp-up effect. This will
disappear because with the way the current year reserve are set, it is expected that some
reserve release will happen, will take place, but it will be later on in -- later on and maybe
next year; we'll see.

Bloomberg Transcript

On a consolidated basis, no change, because all this is internal movement so all these
internal reinsurance will be mostly cancelled. So this is more to help you in interpreting the
result of the different segments, but not much at the end on the consolidated accounts
because these are internal movements.
So we are at the end of the presentation. So as you can see, we don't provide you
precise guidance on Q1 and on 2019 because that's our policy not to give very precise
and quantitative forecast. But with this call, we tried to give you overall to provide you with
all the necessary explanation so that you can first update your model and second
understand the results that will be disclosed in May and regarding Q1 where on this first
quarter we will have the full ramp-up effect. They will be diluted over time and the rampup effect will positively decrease in Q2 -- Q3, Q4 but we will have some significant one-off
effect in Q1. And to help you a little bit more, I have to flag the fact that in Belgium, we
had the exceptional event, a storm, which means that the technical result of AG on the
non-life side won't be, I would say, brilliant [ph] in Q1 because of the storm we had in
March. We have a lot of wind. It's a very, I would say, normal event. We are fully prepared
and all the protections are in place to face such events. So nothing really striking but -- on
Q1 some effects will be seen on the figures.
And with this, I would like to open the discussion, and I am ready with all my colleagues. As
I said at the start, the reinsurance team is with us. So we are ready to answer any
questions you may have.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) We have one first question from Mr. Jason Kalamboussis from KBC
Securities. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Yes. Hi, good morning. Thank you for the explanation. The first thing it is that I can
understand that you don't want to be very precise on the figures. But if you look at the

end of the day through all of this, the benefit is going to be zero tax rate until you cover
your holding costs and an 8% tax rate thereafter. If we look roughly through what you have
discussed, it is -- we're talking about a small number. So it is a -- let's call it EUR 10 million
possibly EUR 20 million. Is it -- am I correct in -- because at the end of the day, you must
have baked something in your EUR 800 million to EUR 900 million figure. And it does look
to be in general a minor number? That's my first question. The second one is could you
specify roughly the percentages for worker's comp in Portugal and in the UK again for AIL?
And the third one is looking at your example, the overrider looks like a 2% of NEPs. Is it
something that we should be using as a rough guidance going forward? Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Sorry. Say again the last question. I have --

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

The last one is like if I look at the overrider, it's 2% of net earned premiums. So on your
example, is it something that roughly we should be using?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Understood. So I will answer the first one on the tax benefit, what's the rationale behind,
and then I will let my colleague from the reinsurance team to answer on the workmen
comp and on the overrider. So first on the -- on the tax benefit. You are right, there's a tax
benefit, but please keep in mind that you have two approaches. First, if you take the
standalone Ageas SA/NV. So Ageas SA/NV doesn't pay taxes for several reasons. It only
receives dividends. So we are not taxable. We have all these past loss season. We will
have a positive income for reinsurance, but as long as we don't breach [ph] the holding
cost which are at around EUR 70 million, we won't even "eat" the past losses. So it means
that we will never pay taxes in Ageas SA/NV. And there is some gain even if the gain is not
huge, but it was indeed taken into account in the change of guidance that was given by
our CEO, but it was one element. Most hiking one at this stage. But then beyond the
statutory tax position on the IFRS side, on the IFRS, you can safely take into account the
tax benefit, because that is the first gain. You have the profit. So there is a small gain
under IFRS and there is a tax benefit in any case.
Then you said figures are not enormous. It's a first step. As I said, the view is to go slightly
farther in cession rate 20% and 30% but not the steady state. We want to increase a little
bit. And then keep in mind that we also have a life license. So please consider this as a
first step and hopefully there will be a second step by using the life reinsurance license as
well. So it is work-in-progress, so lot to see. But then apart from the tax which was not the
driving factor at all, the obvious benefit of this would be seen, for instance, yesterday
because all this reinsurance is part of a large action plan. And the fact that we obtain the
core statutes that we obtain the A rating for the whole thing, it was mainly thanks to the
implementation of (inaudible).
And you could see that yesterday for the first time after a long period of absence at the
holding level, we were able to issue sub debt at very convenient condition. And I was very
happy to see that we issued at a price -- at a lower price than AG, which completely

Page 9 of 20

FINAL

validates all this action plan. And so all this reinsurance makes this possible to have Ageas
SA/NV back to the normal hold of holding, meaning financing the group. You have the
immediate effect on the tax but not enormous but then you have override in terms of
financial flexibility, access to the financial market, et cetera, et cetera. So that's the answer
to the first question. And then on the overrider (inaudible) and on the workmen comp, my
colleague will give some more details because these are rather technical details. So Jan
or Joachim?

A - Jan Van Rethy
Jan. Jan Van Rethy. First of all, on your worker's comp, indeed the worker's comp claims
reserves from the past are, of course, an important part of the total claims reserves in
Portugal. They represent in the order of 50% of the total reserves. But as Mr. Boizard
already indicated, the profitability of the Portuguese worker's comp business is maybe a
bit lower than the average profitability of our businesses. And the total expected return
from the worker's comp business represents certainly less than 10% of the total profit
expected from the Portuguese business. Is this an answer to your question?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yes --

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

I'm sorry, on the percentage on the UK that means I presume it's more - if we exclude
Tesco.

A - Jan Van Rethy
It is not -- yeah, in the UK business there is no worker's comp.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

No workmen's comp in the UK. For the overrider --

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

But sorry, you have -- it is -- in the UK you have a percent. You exclude the Tesco
underwriting and it's only on AIL, correct?

So this is -- but this underwriting is very marginal I presume or no?

A - Unidentified Speaker
Yes, indeed Jason and you can find the split in our usual reporting. The consolidated
inflows in the UK are concerns in the quota share and the part not consolidated entities,
that's Tesco underwriting. So you can find that number easily in our usual reports.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Okay.

And the overrider but first before Joachim starts, it was an illustrative example.

A - Joachim Racz
Exactly.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

(inaudible). Yes.

A - Joachim Racz
And we want to point your attention to the fact that the line in the illustrative example is
called overrider and profit commission. So you need to be aware that we combine those
two in this illustration. So one element would be the overrider that you pay upfront to the
ceding company. And the other element would be profit commission that is only payable
after actual underwriting profits materialize. So -- and those overriders, as Christophe
Boizard said before, the result of an arm's length pricing exercise that we did and they
are different for each portfolio, representing the profitability and the volatility of the
underlying business.

Hi. It's Vikram, SocGen. Three questions from my side. Starting from what Intreas's
objective was initially? 50% participation in external cessions. So in a sense, Intreas was
one of the reinsurers on the panel, if you like. Now when you introduce this quota share,
just kind of clarifying how does this really work. And I think of it like this, Intreas or the
Reinsurance segment which is now -- the business is now to be performed by the
HoldCo, has two functions. First of all, continue to act as an external reinsurer for the
operating entities and then take the 30% or whatever 20% quota share of the net
business. And if so, the HoldCo is actually taking more than 30% as it's 30% of net plus
the entire excess of loss reinsurance. So that's question number one.
Question two is from an IFRS perspective, what is the impact on the capital of the
shareholders' equity for each of the operating companies and also the Reinsurance
segment? And thirdly, in terms of choosing the approach between the transfer of assets
and liabilities, what is being a premium and ceding the liabilities. Can you explain why you
choose the latter versus the former? That's all from my side.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. So on your first question, I would say you are completely correct. That's
exactly how it is. So we have on the one hand the former Intreas business, which has to do
with the group protection and here we take risk. We are part of the panel of the
reinsurers. When we take 50% of the cat, we are exposed and the real insurance
approach. And then on the second dimension, which is completely different, it is -- with
the quota share, it is more and capital optimization fungibility, and we move the part of
the business from the sitting entity to the center. But on a consolidated basis there is not
a lot of changes, whereas in Intreas, we do assume risk and we have additional premium,
additional risk, et cetera, et cetera. So you are right, we -- I gave two things which are of
complete different nature. These are two angles of approach with two rationales.
Then on your second question on the IFRS impact, first -- at first approach, there is no
change in shareholder equity. That's a technical operation. So there is no change in
shareholder equity then for later on in time, what you can anticipate is if you cede
business, your capital need will be less at some point because your underwriting risk
component should decrease on non-life. So in spite you should expect increased
insolvency. And in that case we will apply our capital management policy and I won't say
more, but you could have implication.
Since you are on this topic, I'd like to explain something. For instance, I'm taking AG. So on
the AG when you see 30% for sure, you cede 30% of the underwriting risk. But the nonlife portfolio goes diversification factor because AG has a huge operation in life. So what
we gain on the underwriting risk, we lose something on the diversification. So the solvency
of AG won't be dramatically changed on the solo basis, locally.
Then if we manage to put in place life cession, the effect will be taken in full in the
reduction of the SCR and benefiting the other entity Portugal and the UK for on the UK,
we only have non-life operations. There is no diversification effect. So the gain on the
solvency is more immediate on the UK, and you will -- we expect a jump in the solvency of
the UK. And in Portugal it's a little bit in between.

Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2019-04-04

Then having said that, these are the local solvencies and these could trigger some a
capital management operation but this is not contemplated today. We will -- I would
simply say that we will apply the capital management policy because all these things are in
writing. And then at the consolidated bases most of these things are eliminated since
they are internal movements. So the solvency of the group is broadly unaffected by all
these movements. You have small effect on eligible own funds and the fact that seems
there is a small tax benefit, there is a small increase in own fund by I would say negligible.
So first approach, no effect at consolidated basis on solvency and no shareholder equity
changes. And --

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Sorry. If I can just come back. Sorry to interrupt. If I can just come back on this point. So
Intreas where you had kind of initial funding was EUR 100 and now Intreas is no longer
going to be in its current shape by the end of the year, but the HoldCo will take up
whatever interest was doing plus the additional quota share. So that EUR 100 or whatever
the updated --

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

The EUR 100 million will be re-impacted within Ageas SA/NV when we liquidate Intreas.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

But it was full read, yeah. So the EUR 100 million will come back. They were in Intreas was
funded by the holding and we will have the money back.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Okay. So that EUR 100 million is enough to take on the quota share and the LPT business,
so it doesn't need more capital. And in any case the HoldCo has the excess cash. So that
should be enough. And then based on what you just said, I'm assuming you're trying to
say so we should not be expecting any one-off capital upstreaming from Belgium to the
group at the moment.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

No, not at the moment and at the holding level the solo solvency ratio is extremely high.
Yeah, we have calculated it at around 400% because you have all the wealth for the
group in the holding, so which means that to in front of the STR we have because we
have an STR with assumed operation, we have all the wealth of the group, meaning that
we own the 25% of Taiping Life, 75% of AG. So when you take all this into consideration,
the solvency ratio of the holding is 400%, the local one. So there is no need. We are
strong enough. And then your third question, sorry. It was --

(inaudible). We had the choice between the two. The two are possible and when we
presented the file to (inaudible) one key element was to show sufficient substance. And
with the premium method, we increased -- we have particularly increased the premium at
the Ageas SA/NV level. So it was more for presentation purpose. But I think it is broadly
indifferent, the two things, apart from the fact that we will be obliged to provide you with
restated combined ratio segmental.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Okay, okay, fine. So that's very, very helpful. Thanks a lot.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yes. At the end of equivalent month of premium is around EUR 1 billion. And with the LPT,
we had another, what EUR 600?

A - Unidentified Speaker
EUR500 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

EUR500 million. So optically you will read EUR 1.5 billion as gross written premium by the
holding, but only EUR 1 billion will be a recurrent corresponding to the quota share.

Thank you, sir. We have another question from Mr. Steven Haywood from HSBC. Sir,
please go ahead.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks very much. The debt you issued at the holding company recently, is that to fund
the reinsurance business that you're doing, or will you be downstreaming that to because
you were deemed an instrument at AG Insurance recently as well.
And then secondly, on the second and potentially third steps of your reinsurance, when
are you looking to increase the quota share? And when are you looking to do more of
reinsurance on the life books? Will that be this year or potentially next year? Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

So on the sub debt, it is completely disconnected. As I said the solvency ratio is still high at
400% but there is strictly no need to fund anything. So it is self-standing, no need. So the
sub debt was issued and the motivation was within the prospectus, and it was for general
corporate purposes. So it is to manage the group and to manage the solvency of the
group. The new thing we have acquired with it is that we have the flexibility among the
entities. In the past we issued out of the strongest entity, and we had -- and when you
look at the breakdown of the solvency ratio within the group, AG had 235% and other
entities at a much lower level. This was not a very sound situation. So we think that with
the issuance out of the holding, we are more free to allocate where there are needs.
And so that -- so the sub debt was really to manage the group from the financial
standpoint and there is no relation to the reinsurance which is already extremely well
capitalized when you take the solvency ratio. And then for the life book, for the life book
this is likely more complicated to put in place reinsurance arrangements on the life side. It
is on our -- the study of the file is on our desk for this year and our wish -- but at this stage
it is our -- the best case is to have something ready as from January 1st of next year to
January 1st of 2020. So that's our plan. We study this year and we put in place beginning

Page 15 of 20



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

of next year knowing that when you put in place quota share or the reinsurance
arrangement, January 1st is a good date.

FINAL

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay. That's very helpful. I just wanted to quickly follow up on the sub debt. You say you
can allocate it to whichever entity you wish to -- no, if you need to. But is there any entities
that you need to improve solvency, improve own funds?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

No, at this stage, there is no immediate need. All the entities are perfectly capitalized. So
my example was more to say improved flexibility and then M&A is not excluded. So
everything relating to the job of holding.

Thank you, sir. We have another question from Mr. Farquhar Murray from Autonomous
Research. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Sorry for dragging out the question a little bit. Just
one to two actually quick questions from me. Just I'm a little bit intrigued by the long
discussions with BNP around AG. I can obviously understand the reason that they don't
have a kind of non-life business and the imbalance there. But what were the kind of other
-- were there any other issues, and what were the kind of alternatives that were
potentially scoped out? And as a kind of subsidiary to that, is there any possibility that kind
of agreement evolves in the future in the way that perhaps you've indicated might be the
case on Portugal? And then secondly a very quick question, just on the storms in Belgium. I
might have missed it, but would you categorize that quarter is kind of a normal storm loss
experience? That was my kind of thinking. Obviously recent quarters have -- winters have
been relatively benign. So is 1Q '19 normal or was it abnormally large? Thanks.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

So I will answer the first question on the BNP Paribas discussion and then I will let my
technical colleagues review some of the insights on the storm we had in March in Belgium.
So on BNP Paribas, we had the long discussion for which reason, and you are right that we
could have expected short discussion in the sense that since there are shareholder at
25%, they already -- they hold a risk, which means that it is more moving something from
the right pocket to the left pocket, but big groups have intricate organization. So the stake
of within AG is held by BNP Paribas Fortis, and the assumption of the risk is done by the
insurance arm of BNP Paribas, the BNP Paribas Cardif. These are not the same people and
they want to make sure that they make a good deal. It is only at the very top of the
organization that things are the same. Not at local levels. That's the first thing.
Page 16 of 20

FINAL

Second, they have to follow their own procedures within the only possible (inaudible),
which is the Cardif Risques Divers. They have policies regarding underwriting. They have
to study. So all these things are long and they wanted to review the portfolio. They hired
an actuarial firm and all these things. So it's a reason why it was a long discussion, but I
would say from the beginning we had the positive behavior and positive advice from the
top management of BNP Paribas Cardif. So it was a long but all the management of Cardif
was supportive. So that's what I can say. And then Jan or Joachim on the storm in Belgium.

A - Jan Van Rethy
Okay. So when we evaluate storms or the cost of storms, we do that usually talking about
return periods. So we have through modeling a good idea on the cost for a storm that we
expect every 10 year, once every 10 years, for example, or once every 100 years, or even
once every 200 years. Now the storm of March was not in that order, but it's more a
storm that we expect to happen for Belgian territory once every six to seven years. So
was this a normal quarter for storm? It was unfortunately a quarter where we had the
storm that we expect once every six or seven years.

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

So it was not a very big event, but then when you only have one quarter and -- so it
means one fourth of the net earned premium, it -- that drives all the technical indicators
up. But then I think that on AG side and since they have aggregate cover, it means that for
the rest of the year we are very well protected. But being a quota share, we take the risk
upfront and we are not a reinsurer. So the group franchise at the first euro, we have to
follow (inaudible).

A - Jan Van Rethy
So the cost or the expected costs for this storm for AG Insurance is around EUR 45 million.
This will stay in their retention because they have -- or almost in their retention because
they have a reinsurance program that starts from EUR 42.5 million. And they are protected
as well for what we call cat events as for the aggregation of all events in the year.
Meaning that indeed if there would be further storms within 2019, this would be absorbed
almost completely by the reinsurance that AG Insurance has acquired.

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Great. Thanks for this update.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

(inaudible) on that because you're aware we participate in 50% on the cap protection of
AG Insurance, the lower layers, so this kind of loss that we would have seen in March is
not held in net retention at Ageas SA. So this is fully retroceded to the external
reinsurance market.

Thank you, sir. We have another question from Mr. (inaudible) from ABN AMRO. Sir, please
go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Unidentified Participant
Good morning. (inaudible) here, ABN AMRO. A few more questions. Firstly, you were
saying that you didn't do the -- what is it? The -- not quite sure, but the LPT, you didn't do
that in Belgium in AG because French regulation was restricted for BNP Cardif. At the
same point, you said that in a few years' time, you will be in exactly the same situation. So
how would the French regulation work in that case? Wouldn't it be as restrictive and
therefore should we expect a declining quota share for BNP Cardif in the next few years?
That's my first question. Secondly, coming back to life reinsurance quota share, what
would be the main limitations or the main issues that are being put in place? Is that the
same French regulation restriction on BNP Cardif ? Thank you very much.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So on the LPT for Belgium, indeed I said that the size was the triggering factor for
eliminating the LPT. And it is true that with the ramp-up period, this will increase. I don't
want to elaborate too much on the intentions of BNP Paribas, but I will give you this hint.
They are interested by this concept of internal quota share there so -- because we have
shared all the concepts, the ideas. They find the concept interesting and it could be
something they will consider in the future. But they say we'll have to adapt (technical
difficulty). But I don't want to elaborate much. But I think that was the acceptable solution
for them and it is on their side that they have to cope with it.
And then on the life side, the limitation is less, why, because it's a big insurer. So in terms
of size, the relative size of this kind of quota share would be more acceptable to them,
whereas their non-life operation is much smaller than the life operation. So they will have
less limitation in accepting your life portfolio.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Okay. That is clear. And if I may, could I also on the tax loss carryforward basically on the
holding company, for how long would you have those tax losses? Is there a limitation in
time that you can absorb those?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

No, there are no limitation (inaudible) there for forever. But as you know, there is a new
tax regulation saying that you cannot accept 100% of your positive tax base with past loss
season. So you have a threshold rather smaller one where you can offset 100% of this, but
after only a portion of your taxable income can be offset with past losses. But for the
losses themselves, there is no time bar.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Perfect. Thank you very much.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Hi. Sorry, I just have a quick follow up in terms of the potential expansion of the
reinsurance business in future to include the life element as well, I just wondered what's
your thinking around that since the traditional life reinsurance business that we generally
see in the market relates to mortality protection essentially. But as most of your life
business is the savings business. So just kind of it seems quite different to what the usual
life reinsurance business would be? That's all. Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

So on the life, as I said, we are presently starting the study on this, so we don't have
precise things to put on the books, but obviously the risk part of the life is the easy one,
but you don't have big volumes with this, and we will have to see what can be done on
the investment side as well. But you'll know that there are existing solutions you can
transfer and you can see on the market reinsurance arrangement involving the saving
portfolio. So we are studying all these things, but we cannot limit ourselves to the risk part
because of the volumes would be too small.
