Derek Bulas
Good morning and welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's 2019 second quarter results.
This call may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ perhaps
materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result of a variety
of uncertainties and risk factors. The most foreseeable of which are set out under risk
factors in our Base Shelf Prospectus, which has been filed with Canadian securities

Thank you, Derek. Good morning, everyone. This call is primarily meant for you, the
shareholders of Fairfax, although throughout the years many of our partners such as
analysts, auditors, regulators, rating agencies, lawyers, bankers, media, all listen to this
call. We also have many of our employees at Fairfax, Hamblin Watsa, FairVentures and
many hundreds of thousands of employees, not only in our insurance and reinsurance
companies, but also in our partner and investee companies around the world listening to
this call.
For many of us here at Fairfax, Sunday, May 19, was the darkest day of our professional
lives. It was the day we learned of the sudden death of David Bonham. David joined
Fairfax at roughly the same time as me 16 years ago, our careers developed together and
he was my partner on these earnings calls. More importantly, Dave was our friend. He was
a brilliant, dedicated, tireless, selfless, consummate professional and one of the youngest
CFOs of a multinational public company in Canada. His wit was irrepressible and poignant.
He was by far the funniest person in our office. He was a devoted husband and a loving
father to two, the life for young children. He was a private man who loved his job, love this
company and everyone who worked in it and everything it stands for. He asked for
nothing from Fairfax and he gave us his all. He was truly fair and friendly always. We miss
him dearly. His death was an untimely tragedy that none of us will forget. We want to
thank all of the hundreds of people who have expressed their sympathy and condolences
to us and ultimately to Dave's wife and two young children. Your support means so much
to us and more importantly to his family. At this time, I would like to take a brief moment
of silence to remember, Dave.
There is no question Dave would have liked us to move on for the company he loved to
drive forward and continue to grow and succeed. With heavy hearts we will continue on
this mission, building a great company, a fair and friendly company that with hard work and
good fortune survives us all and carries forward the memory of those like David Bonham
who help build this great organization called Fairfax.
Now the purpose of this earnings call for the results of our second quarter. I will discuss
some of the second quarter highlights and then pass the call to John Varnell, our Interim
Chief Financial Officer for additional financial and accounting details. Fairfax's net earnings
were $449 million in the second quarter versus $63 million in the second quarter of 2018,
which equates to net earnings per share of $17.18 versus $1.82 in 2018. For this first six
months of 2019, our net earnings were $1.26 billion versus $747 million for the first six
months of 2018.
Fairfax's book value per share increased $464.86 at June 30 compared to $432.46 at
December 31. An increase of 9.9% adjusted for the $10 dividend in the first quarter. Our
presidents generated another good quarter with an aggregate combined ratio below
100% with a combined ratio of 96.8% and strong reserves across the group while
producing an underwriting profit of $101 million in the second quarter. All of our major
insurance companies generated combined ratios less than one 100% with Zenith at
84.5%, Odyssey Group at 96.6%, Northbridge at 99.1%, Brit at 96%, Crum & Forster at
97.5%, and Allied World at 97.9%. It is fantastic to see Allied World hitting stride.

For the second quarter, operating income was strong at $330 million and our net gains on
investments for the second quarter were also solid at $449 million. Now some key
highlights to bring to your attention. First, our companies are continuing to see healthy,
hardening price increases across most lines of business in North America with the
exception of workers' compensation. This was demonstrated in the second quarter as our
insurance and reinsurance businesses' net written premium increased year-over-year by
6.8% after adjusting for the acquisition of ARCs insurance, which is the new name of our
Ukrainian company purchased from AXA, as well as the runoff of Advent. Principal areas of
growth were at Northbridge, Odyssey, Crum & Forster and Fairfax Asia. By company, the
change in net premiums written for the second quarter were as follows; Odyssey Group
up 8%, Crum & Forster up 17%, Northbridge up 13%, Brit was roughly flat, Allied World up
4.5%, and Zenith was down 5%. As we have said on prior calls, Kari and the team at Zenith
continue to do what they have done for decades, taking the long-term view and prudently
letting go of business that is inadequately priced.

Bloomberg Transcript

At the end of the second quarter, we have approximately $9.5 billion invested in shortterm US treasuries and short-term investment-grade corporate bonds. Given the
continued strength of the US economy and a potential longer term bias towards higher
interest rates, we continue to be positioned on the shorter end of the treasury curve for
the time being. That said, we continue our focus on growing interest and dividend income
which was $222 million in the second quarter versus $178 million in the second quarter of
2018.
In May, the Grivalia merger into Eurobank was completed and as a result shareholders of
Grivalia including Fairfax received 15.8 newly issued Eurobank shares in exchange for each
share of Grivalia. As a result of this transaction, we deconsolidated Grivalia, recognized a
non-cash gain of $171 million and reduced our non-controlling interest by $466 million. We
owned approximately 53% of Grivalia and 18% of Eurobank prior to the merger and now
own approximately 32% of Eurobank. We are very excited about the future of Eurobank
and the prospects for Greece with a very business-friendly majority government. Also in
May, IIFL Holdings spun off two of its subsidiaries and recognized a significant gain. Our
share of that gain primarily through Fairfax India was $116 million and recorded in share of
profit of associates.
In June, we completed a debt offering of CAD500 million of 4.23% unsecured senior
notes due 2029 with the proceeds to be used to repay near-term maturities. Subsequent
to June 30, we redeemed our remaining CAD395 million of 6.4% senior unsecured notes
due May 25, 2021, for cash consideration of CAD429 million. This pushes our next debt
maturity out to 2022 and our run rate aggregate average interest rate is now 4.6% versus
4.8% in 2018 and 5.8% in 2017.
On July 17, we announced that Scott Carmilani will be moving up to the Fairfax level
working with Andy Barnard and myself on organic growth initiatives for our Group globally.
Lou Iglesias Scott's chosen successor has moved into the CEO role at Allied World. Scott
built Allied World. He knows how to build businesses from scratch and we are looking for
him to accelerate our global multinational business Fairfax Worldwide, as well as to
expand our broker and client relationships around the world to bring us to the forefront as
a global insurance and reinsurance operation.

Our Hamblin Watsa investment team continues to cautiously observe and monitor global
events and economic indicators. We believe the US economy is robust and growing, the
job market continues to be from and gains appear to be broad based across industries
including rebounding manufacturing and construction. Likewise personal consumption in
US remains strong as does headline inflation. That said, the US Fed is cutting rates, and it
appears that the US Fed will continue with further rate cuts continuing a global trend with
over 23 central banks around the world cutting rates in the last year.
The entire Swiss sovereign curve is now below 0, the Greek tenure is now yielding only 3
basis points more than the US tenure and the tenured Italian bond is yielding 32 basis
points less. At the longer end of the US. 30-year is yielding only 19 basis points more than
the Fed funds rate. In this environment, we remain ever vigilant not to reach for yield and
continue to believe that stocks have ample room to appreciate but we must be cautious
and consider inexpensive ways to protect our investment returns.
I will now pass the call over to John Varnell, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. But before I
do, I want to thank John on behalf of all of us for jumping in with both hands to help us
during this interim period. One of the great things about Fairfax's culture is the loyalty and
long-serving tenure of our team. John embodies this culture having previously been
Fairfax's CFO, as well as previously as CFO of Northbridge and Fairfax India, John was
uniquely suited to help us in time of need. With tremendous bench strength internally and
we look to make announcement soon, but it would be remiss if I did not acknowledge,
John. John, thank you.

{BIO 5699703 <GO>}

Thank you, Paul. Speaking about our insurance operations, underwriting profits at our
insurance and reinsurance operations in the second quarter and first six months of 2019
decreased to $101 million and $189.4 million with combined ratios of 96.8% and 96.9% in
each of those respective periods, compared to underwriting profits of $115.8 million and
$224.9 million with combined ratios of 96.1% in each of those respective periods in 2018.
Our combined ratios benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development in the
second quarter and first six months of 2019 are $41 million and $90.8 million and that
translated into 1.3 and 1.5 combined ratio points in each of those periods compared to net
favorable prior year reserve development of $113 million and $199 million, which
represented 3.8 and 3.5 combined ratio points in both of those periods.
So turning to our operating company results, starting with Northbridge, Northbridge
reported underwriting profit of $2.6 million in the second quarter and $3.3 million in the
first six months of 2019 and had combined ratios of 99.1% and 99.4% in both of those
respective periods that compared to underwriting losses of $17 million and $14.7 million
and combined ratios of 106.2% and 102.7% in each of those same periods in 2018.
Northbridge's underwriting results in the second quarter and first six months of 2019
included the benefit of net favorable prior year reserve development of $9.1 million and
$32.4 million representing 3 and 5.6 combined ratio points.
This compared to higher net favorable prior year reserve development of $21.5 million
and $34.6 million, representing 7.8 and 6.4 combined ratio points in the second quarter

FINAL

and first six months of 2018. The underwriting results in the second quarter and first six
months of 2019 included $1.7 million and $7.5 million of current period catastrophe losses
compared to $13.8 million and $14.2 million of current period catastrophe losses in the
second quarter and first six months of 2018. In Canadian dollar terms, net premiums
written by Northbridge in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 increased by
17.6% and 15.8% in each of those respective periods, reflecting increased renewal
business and price increases across the group.
Turning to Odyssey Group, odyssey reported underwriting profits of $26.9 million and
$68.1 million with combined ratios of 96.6% and 95.5% in the second quarter and first 6
months of 2019 compared to underwriting profit of $60.9 million and $115.4 million and
combined ratios of 91.4% and 91.3% in both the second quarter and first 6 months of
2018. Current period catastrophe losses of $32.1 million and $67.9 million representing 4.1
and 4.5 combined ratio points in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 were
slightly higher than current period catastrophe losses of $26.9 million and $64.8 million
representing 3.8 and 4.9 combined ratio points in the second quarter and first six months
of 2018. Odyssey Group's combined ratios in the second quarter and first six months of
2019 also benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development of $4.2 million
and $40.1 million and that is 0.5% and 2.7 combined ratio points respectively. That
compared to net favorable prior year reserve development of $45.4 million and $85.9
million, which is 6.4 and 6.5 combined ratio points respectively in the second quarter and
six months of 2018. Odyssey Group wrote $856 million and $1.7 billion of net premiums in
the second quarter and first six months of 2019, increases of 8.4% in the second quarter
of 2019 and 11.8% in the first six months of 2019 with the increase principally reflecting
higher net premiums written across all divisions with the US insurance, Euro-Asia and
London market divisions accounting for the majority of the increase.
Moving on to Crum & Forster. Crum & Forster's underwriting profit improved to $13 million
and $24.2 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 with combined ratios
of 97.5% and 97.6% in both of those respective periods. That compared to underwriting
profit of $7.2 million and $8.5 million and combined ratios of 98.5% and 99.1% in the
second quarter and first six months of 2018. Net prior year reserve development was
nominal in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 and 2018. Crum & Forster's net
premiums written increased by 17.4% in the second quarter and 14% in the first six months
of 2019, primarily reflecting growth in surplus and specialty, accident and health, and
surety and programs lines of business.
Zenith National, Zenith reported underwriting profits in the second quarter and first six
months of 2019 of $28.4 million and $67.6 million and combined ratios of 84.5% and 81.4%
compared to underwriting profits of $22.7 million and $50 million with combined ratios of
88.6% and 87.4% in each of those respective periods in 2018. The combined ratios in the
second quarter and first six months of 2019 included 12 and 16.2 combined ratio points of
net favorable prior year reserve development which compared to 7.1 and 9.3 combined
ratio points in the second quarter and first six months of 2018. Zenith wrote $154 million
and $427 million of net premiums in the second quarter and first six months of 2019, which
was lower than the $162 million and $471 million of net premiums in those respective
periods in 2018. The decrease in net premiums written reflected price decreases.

On to Brit, in the second quarter and first six months of 2019, Brit produced underwriting
profits of $16.9 million and $28.7 million and combined ratios of 96% and 96.4% compared
to underwriting profits of $13.7 million and $17.6 million and combined ratios of 96.8% and
97.7% in each of those same periods in 2018. Net favorable prior year reserve
development at $1.9 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 was lower
compared to the $8.9 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018. Brit's net
premium written increased by 1.2% and 3.7% in the second quarter and first six months of
2019, the increase reflected growth in the core book of business and price increases
partially offset by reductions in non-core lines of business.
For Allied World, their underwriting profit decreased to $12.9 million and was flat with a
combined ratio of 97.9% and 100% in the second quarter of 2019 and break-even in the
first six months of 2019 compared to an underwriting profit of $28.6 million and $55.3
million and combined ratios of 94.9% in the same periods of 2018. Allied World's
underwriting profit in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 was impacted by
$24.8 million or 3.9 combined ratio points and $79.6 million or 6.7 combined ratio points of
net adverse development. The comparable periods in the prior year reflected net
favorable development of $11.2 million which is 2 combined ratio points and $15 million
which is 1.4 combined ratio points. Allied World wrote $656.5 million and $1.4 billion in net
premiums in the second quarter and first six months of 2019, representing a year-overyear increase of 4.5% and 1.5% respectively.
Fairfax Asia recorded underwriting profits of $1 million and $1.5 million and combined ratios
of 97.9% and 98.4% in the second quarter and first six months of 2019. This was better
than the underwriting profit of $0.3 million and the underwriting loss of $2 million with
combined ratios of 99.5% and 102.1% in those same periods in 2018. The combined ratios
in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 included $8.4 million and $13.4 million,
which is 17.5 and 14.3 combined ratio points of net favorable prior year reserve
development, that compared to $5.1 million and $10.6 million which is 11 combined ratio
points in each period of net favorable prior year reserve development in the second
quarter and first six months of 2018.
Insurance and Reinsurance Other, this segment produced underwriting losses of $0.7
million and $4 million and combined ratios of 100.3% and 100.8% in the second quarter
and first six months of 2019 compared to underwriting losses of $0.6 million and $5.2
million in combined ratios of 100.2% and 100.9% in those same periods in 2018. Runoff
reported operating losses of $12.8 million and $30.8 million in the second quarter and first
six months of 2019 compared to operating losses of $20 million to $53 million in those
same periods in 2018. The improvement in the operating loss in 2019 principally reflected
higher interest and dividends.
For the consolidated group, consolidated interest and dividend income increased yearover-year from $177 million in the second quarter of 2018 to $221 million in the second
quarter of 2019, primarily reflecting higher interest income earned on increased holdings
of short-dated US Treasury bonds and high quality corporate bonds, partially offset by
lower interest income earned as a result of a reduction in holdings of US municipal bonds.

For taxes, Fairfax recorded a provision for income taxes of $146.5 million at a 20.2%
effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2019 and a provision for income taxes of $329.6
million at a 19.1% effective tax rate in the first six months of 2019. Our total debt to total
capital ratio, excluding non-insurance operations increased to 28.3% at June 30, 2019,
from 25% at December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of the receipt of proceeds from the
debt issue in Q2. The ratio would have been 27.3% when you factor in the July 15, 2019,
senior notes redemption. We ended the second quarter of 2019 with an investment
portfolio which included holding company cash and investments of $41.4 billion, which was
a nice increase from the $38.8 billion held at December 31st, 2018.
And with that, I'll pass it back over to Paul.

Perfect, thank you so much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.
(Operator instructions). Our first question is from the line of Mr. Jaeme Gloyn of NBF. Mr.

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning.

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Hey, good morning, Jaeme.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Yeah, question is related to the invested asset portfolio, I noticed a shift this quarter from
higher rated bonds into some A and BBB rated bonds. I'm just looking for a little bit more
color around that strategy and how that impacts and other moving parts impacted your
previous sort of target or I guess guidance that run rate of a $1 billion of interest and
dividend income is achievable?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Thanks for the question, Jaeme. So we are still trying to get to that $1 billion, but being
mindful of wanting to stay on the short end of the curve. So, right now our term is about
1.9 years. So we're trying to stick tight. That said, we've been able to get interest income
up but we want to stay in good credits. There has been a little bit more of the BBB, but
we'll be very mindful, Brian and Wade and Prem, the tire team are looking at these credits

and very mindful not to go below investment grade, but staying on the very short end of
the curve.

FINAL

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Would this offset the impact of the lower yield curve at this time or what's going to be what's going to have more of an impact here? The shift that's going to offset that or is
the lower yields going to drive the yield on investment assets, lower them, what we saw
in Q2?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

No, I would expect that is going to, we have, we continue to have the longer dated
coming off, but we're managing to find that yield even on the short end, so we don't
expect it's going to go backwards. We may not accelerate towards the $1 billion as fast as
we thought, but we are, but we don't think we're going to be going back

Thank you so much. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Fenwick of Cormark

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

Hi, good morning everyone.

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Good morning, Jeff.

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

Just wanted to dig into the insurance operations, specifically Allied, and you mentioned it
is, you think pleased with the performance of that area there, it's had a couple of quarters
of a little weaker underwriting results on reserve development and at the same time we
did see a nice big uptick in gross premiums in the quarter, although you ceded, I guess, a
big chunk of that. So how do you feel that unit is positioned or the developments, the
negative development that we've seen, is that a transient thing in your mind, and is it a
position here to just capitalize upon being in North America and retain more of that
volume?

A - Paul Rivett

FINAL

Yeah, know, that's a good question. So they are hitting stride. So price increases are
significant, some lines as much as 30% up and month-over -month just continuing to
accelerate. So we're feeling very good about what they're getting as far as strong price
increases, which is leading to higher premiums generally. And we do think that the reserve
developments transient primarily related to the JV [ph] development that we're seeing in
the industry, but it's coming to an end, so, mostly good things coming from Allied in the
future.

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

And then maybe if you could talk a bit on leverage levels within Fairfax in general, I know
you had some moving parts here around some new debt you're reassuring and some of
the older stuff, how are you feeling about the run rate leverage level within this today, I
know it's one area that the ratings agencies kind of begin with in Fairfax and where should
we expect that to settle out versus where it was at the end of the quarter?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah, so we continue to work on keeping at worst leverage neutral. So we're -- and we're
trying to go the other way. I mean what we've done over the last 2 to 3 years by
diversifying our funding base going to Europe is we're getting the interest expense run
rate coming down fairly significantly, but what we're targeting is taking leverage down as
we grow our equity and not looking to increase leverage.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

And just generally, I know Allied was a factor of this, but in terms of reserve development
historically Fairfax, and I know you've taken a conservative approach to underwriting,
you've always benefited by I think they're roughly 5 to 8 points a year in terms of
favorable development and that seems to have tapered off for a couple of quarters, not
just Allied, but Odyssey is maybe the other standout there. Are we entering a period here
where maybe that favorable development starts to taper a bit in aggregate or what's
your view on that?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

So I think as an industry, we're starting to see, generally, maybe redundancies come down
a little bit, but within our portfolio, our reserves, we continue to be very prudently
reserving as we're adding new business and our reserve redundancies are still going to
be relatively strong and most of those redundancies come out in the third and fourth
quarter in any event. So we're feeling we're feeling good about it, but I think it's a fair
question. As an industry I think it is starting to become a little less redundant, but we still
have quite a bit in our portfolio and everything we're adding, we're being very prudent to
make sure that we will have those redundancies in the future.

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

Okay, thanks for the answers. I'll re-queue.

I noticed the cash component here, just a clarification, I think it's gone up from around
maybe 18% to 25%, is that correct? And is your Grivalia Holdings now, are they in the,
which would be maybe about $1 billion, are they in the common stock line that is about
$5.5 billion as well?

A - John Varnell

{BIO 5699703 <GO>}

So I'll do the last one first. So Grivalia is now in the common stock line.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Eurobank, I should say, right?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Varnell

{BIO 5699703 <GO>}

Sorry, yeah Eurobank now. Yes, it's, that's exactly where it is and that's as a result of us
going down below -- going below significant influence. So those will sit on our books on a
market-to-market basis at this point. On the cash, I think maybe up a little bit slightly, like
you said, but we're just being prudent as we move from coming off some of the fixed
income we've been in enrolling into shorter duration, fixed income in the future.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

And if I look at the stocks plus the investment in associates plus the Holdings in Fairfax,
India and Africa, they represent about 30% of your investment portfolio or probably
closer to the book value of the company as well. Would you think that you would go any
higher than that or is that about as high as you want to get in terms of concentration of
those elements?

A - John Varnell

{BIO 5699703 <GO>}

Yeah, I think you're directionally right and you're absolutely right, that's, we don't want to
go any higher than that.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

So the investment philosophy in terms of getting more yield would be to put some of that
cash back into fix, does that would?

That's right. So we're looking for things that we've done extremely well on. We're looking
to find buyers for those investments we've made over the years that are doing quite well
and we will put that into cash and more short-term fixed income to get us additional
operating income.

Thank you so much. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Paul Holden of CIBC. Your
line is now open.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Thanks, good morning. So first question I want to ask is with respect to Eurobank, Paul,
you highlighted that is now one of your largest Holdings and you're very positive on the
turnaround in the Greek economy but wanted to know what is it within management's
control there at Eurobank that can help surface value at this investment?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Well, so I mean, they're doing a number of things, first off at from a competitive
standpoint they are now the leading bank in Greece and with that economy growing again
and with investors looking for places to put their money, Eurobank being the strongest
bank in that country, we'll start to see loan growth over time as the economy expands.
And we also think that these transactions on the NPLs continue to see more of that. So
you'll see a strengthening balance sheet. It's going to go from strength to strength in that
economy and will continue to grow as, and start to start to get an expansion in its net
interest margin.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

I mean, you have held this investment for quite a number of years now, do you think,
hopefully, you don't have to own it for another 10 or so, do you think the past
monetization might be something more in the 3 to 5 year range, though a speculation
there, but just wondering what you are thinking of in terms of time-frame?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah, we don't like to put any time on things generally. But I think that we're going to see
in the next, for sure in the next 3 to 5 years as the economy grows and people start to
realize the strength of the Greek economy, particularly with the majority business friendly
government there now, we do really think that you're going to see people start to bring

the multiple up for Eurobank and it's trading at such a low price to book but there's going
to be I think a realization of value by the broader market that Eurobank is the bank to own
as you invest in Greece and people are, we're already seeing that people are attracted
now to Greece given you look around the world where you're going to find value and
Greece is the place to look right now.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Great, thanks. And a second question I'll sneak in here, it seems to be more, let's call it,
dislocation taking place in the insurance and reinsurance markets. Is that increasing in any
way M&A opportunities for Fairfax?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

No, not really. And from our perspective, we are very focused, and with this
announcement of Scott Carmilani, there is tremendous opportunity for us to grow
organically. So we see it with Fairfax Worldwide. We see it with the broker relationships
and distribution that Scott is going to help us take it to the next level organically. But that
said, to the extent we see tuck-ins in specialty lines in certain geographies we will look,
but we're not looking to add in any significant way from an acquisition perspective at this
time.

Q - Paul Holden

A - Paul Rivett

Thank you so much. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Mark Dwelle of RBC Capital
Markets. Your line is now open.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Yeah, good morning. I guess my first question and one that I'm a little surprised nobody
else has asked is, I guess, I was a little surprised at the level of share buybacks in the
quarter, particularly given where the stock traded throughout much of the quarter and the
cash and resources that you have available, I really don't see many ideas that are better
use of cash than buybacks. So maybe if you could just share a little bit more of your
thinking on how you're thinking about doing buybacks, obviously you keep doing them,
which is good, but just sort of the pace and cadence for that as we go forward?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah, no, a good question, it is something we're always asking ourselves, you can be
assured of that. But over the last 18 months to 24 months, we purchased about a 1.5
million shares and we do look at it, but what we have now is something we haven't seen

in about a decade, which is a hardening market and you've seen we've grown as a result
of growing our premiums, we're growing our investment portfolio coming up close to $4.2
billion and we really want to be supportive of our companies as they're growing in this
hardening market because we will be able to take advantage in the future as we're
growing our AUM here. So we are constantly looking at it. We want to be prudent at the
holding company. So we want to make sure we have the financial resources at the top of
the company as we always have. We are looking in the next 12 months to take out our
minority partners in Brit and in Eurolife. But that said, right now, we're really focused on
making sure we support our companies as they take advantage of this hardened market.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. Those were some good points. The other question I had was related to
the profit share gain on the spin-out of IIFL Holdings within Fairfax India, the amount that's
being recognized there, that is only the gain related to that transaction. You're not picking
up any potential profit share bonuses for the management of India at this point, are you?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

No, no, that's right, but I don't know, John, if you want to add anything to that.

A - John Varnell

{BIO 5699703 <GO>}

No, no, you are correct.

Q - Christopher Gable

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - Christopher Gable
Good morning. First question was partially addressed before but it raised another in
terms of opportunity cost, you mentioned that you're going to be supporting the growth
organically, which I certainly get. But you're also indicating you want to take out the
Page 13 of 17

minority interest in Brit and Eurolife. And I'm curious how do you compare those relative
opportunities in this much, from my perspective, just what I see, the publicly traded stock
seems to be a very compelling opportunities into selling it book and we get the float per
share for nothing, which is the bigger price?

FINAL

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

No, I agree with you, the unfortunate thing with respect to that though is that we do have
an obligation to these minority partners to take them out in the next 12 months. So that's
why we're doing it. We made a commitment, and we're going to execute on.

Q - Christopher Gable
Well, thank you. Appreciate the clarification.

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

You are welcome.

Operator
Thank you so much. We have one more question on queue and this time it is from the line
of Mr. Mikel Abasolo of Solo Capital Management. Your line is now open.

Q - Mikel Abasolo

{BIO 3756596 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, thank you for taking my question, and good morning everyone.

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - Mikel Abasolo

{BIO 3756596 <GO>}

Yes. My question goes back to your investments in India. I see that Fairfax Financial has
recently announced that you guys are buying a small share in Quess whereas if I look at
what's taking place at Fairfax India, I see that beyond the investment in the Bangalore
Airport, there is a big concentration of the Fairfax India portfolio on financials in India. Not
only why -- what IIFL but I believe that late last year you bought public securities in financial
companies, and then more recently, you've made the last payment on your 51% share in
Catholic Syrian Bank. I was wondering what's the criterion for placing investments within
Fairfax or within Fairfax India? And that would be one. And second one, I would like to hear
from you some comment on what's so attractive about the Indian financials. If you look at
what the market is saying is that - it is not the time for Indian financials, but of course that
may be more opportunity than a threat? If you could comment on those two things, I
would appreciate very much. Thanks.

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

No. Perfect. So I'll go with the last question first. So in a growing economy and India is one
of the fastest growing economies in the world, just by reason of demographics is nothing
Page 14 of 17

else, growing middle class, growing every few years at the rate of the size of the
population of Canada, basically it, in a growing economy like that, financials do better than
almost any other investment, so that's kind of from a macro perspective, but down in the
specifics we have some of the best bank folks in the country there. If you look at Deepak,
who is on our Board, we have the ability to get the best talent into these companies and
we believe CSB is a great bank with lots of room to run for instance. So that's why we
have the financials, we will always be mindful not to have too much concentration in the
fact that the Fairfax India set up with parameters that make sure that we don't have too
much concentration. So we work within those, so that's with respect to financials.
On your question with respect to Quess, Quess is not a financial company, but there
again, we have one of the best entrepreneurs, not only in India, but we think on the
planet, Ajit Isaac, and stock is way down, significantly underpriced we think, and you see
his announcements like his partnership with Amazon. He has incredible room to run and,
but your question is a good one, we did not buy that within Fairfax India, we purchased
those shares at the Fairfax level.

Q - Mikel Abasolo

{BIO 3756596 <GO>}

And why is that, Paul, is there a particular reason to place, I mean, is there a criterion or is
it just because it's a legacy investment that was taken -- took place at Thomas Cook at
the beginning and you follow-up on that, right?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

No. Yeah, you got it. It is because of the legacy investments. I don't know, John, if you
want to add to that.

A - John Varnell

{BIO 5699703 <GO>}

Yeah, when we first started Fairfax India, we had a rule that Fairfax Financial could invest in
India in anything they are already in prior to the start-up of Fairfax India. Fairfax India could
do anything else. So that was the reason we had the legacy investments that Fairfax
Financial and they've stuck to that and Fairfax India can go into the other areas. And that
just kept it clean from a corporate governance point of view.

Q - Mikel Abasolo

{BIO 3756596 <GO>}

Okay, thanks. This is excellent. If I may ask just one quick one. If you could comment a little
on your Runoff business, because I see that it does persistently give any losses and I know
that is logical in that type of business, but I see some persistency, if you could comment a
little on the Runoff business that would be very helpful? Thank you very much.

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Sure. No. Thanks for the question. So, on runoff, we continue to work through the tail on,
particularly on things like asbestos, but with RiverStone, we have one of the best Runoff
groups in the world and when we are seeing opportunities to grow in areas like in the
Lloyd's market, so over there in the UK, we're seeing opportunities to grow the book. The
reality is that we need to have investment gains that offset some of that run-off,
Page 15 of 17



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2019-08-02

particularly on the asbestos side. So that's, as our investment performance improve, so
too will the numbers at Runoff.

FINAL

A - John Varnell

{BIO 5699703 <GO>}

And the other thing is you'll see in the numbers that Runoff always shows up as an
underwriting loss because it isn't writing any premium. But the thing that gets excluded
from that is the interest and dividends, and the gains on the float. So it will appear as a
negative on the underwriting side, but you won't see the other side, which is the
investment income and what we try to do internally is run that as a break-even. So run it
with the investment returns on top of the underwriting losses of break-even, sometimes
we get there, sometimes we don't. But that's the target we go for. So that's the picture.

Q - Mikel Abasolo
