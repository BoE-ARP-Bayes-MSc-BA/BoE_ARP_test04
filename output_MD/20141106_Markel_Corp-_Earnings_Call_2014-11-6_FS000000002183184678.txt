Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Thank you, Tom. And good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that the positive
momentum that we experienced in the first half of 2014 has continued into the third
quarter. Our financial results for the first nine months of the year are very solid. We
produced underlying profits in all three ongoing insurance segments and continued to
align the legacy Alterra reserves with the Markel's reserving philosophy. Markel Ventures
completed the acquisition of Cottrell, Inc. during the period and continues to look for
profitable growth opportunities.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our total operating revenue grew 25% to $3.8 billion in 2014 compared to $3 billion in the
first nine months of 2013. The most significant drivers of this increase continue to be the
inclusion of nine months of underwriting revenues from legacy Alterra product offerings in
2014, higher revenue from the Hagerty business, and higher investment income due to
our larger investment portfolio. Also contributing to the increase, other revenues were up
25% to $630 million from $505 million last year, primarily due to revenue growth within
Markel Ventures.
Moving into the underwriting results, gross written premiums were $3.8 billion in 2014
compared to $2.9 billion in 2013, an increase of 30%. Net written premiums were $3.1
billion in the first nine months of 2014, up 28% from the prior year and earned premiums
increased 26% to $2.9 billion. These increases were driven by the inclusion of nine months
of premiums from the legacy Alterra product in 2014 compared to five months of legacy
Alterra premium in 2013.
Net retention was down slightly in 2014 at 82% compared to 83% in 2013. The slight
decrease, which is in line with our expectations, is primarily due to higher use of
reinsurance on certain insurance product previously underwritten by Alterra.
Our consolidated combined ratio for the first nine months was a 97 in both periods 2014
and 2013. As a reminder, the 2013 combined ratio included transaction and other
acquisition-related costs of approximately $70 million or three points related to the
acquisition of Alterra. The combined ratio in 2013 also included approximately $32 million
or one point of catastrophe losses.
Excluding the impact of catastrophe and transaction and acquisition-related costs from
the 2013 combined ratio, the combined ratio for 2014 increased four points compared to
the prior year. This increase was primarily due to less favorable development on prior year
loss reserves in 2014 compared to 2013.
The consolidated combined ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2014
included approximately $260 million of favorable development on prior year loss reserve

FINAL

compared to $281 million of favorable development for the same period in 2013. The
benefit of the favorable development on prior year loss reserves had less of an impact on
the combined ratio in 2014 than in 2013 due to higher earned premium volume in all three
of our ongoing underwriting segments in 2014.
In addition, the U.S. Insurance segment had less favorable development due in part to
adverse development on our architects and engineers product line in 2014 and less
favorable development on Hurricane Sandy in 2014 compared to 2013.
Now, I'll move to the results of Markel Ventures. During the first nine months of 2014,
revenues from Markel Ventures were $595 million compared to $486 million a year ago.
Net income to shareholders from Markel Ventures was just over $16 million in 2014
compared to $18 million for the same period in 2013. EBITDA was $66 million in 2014
compared to $64 million in 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, revenues were higher than the same
period a year ago due to our acquisitions of Cottrell in 2014 and Eagle Construction in
2013. Likewise, EBITDA from our Markel Ventures operations increased in 2014 compared
to 2013, primarily due to the acquisitions of Cottrell and Eagle, partially offset by less
favorable results in our existing manufacturing operations.
Moving to our investment results, investment income was $270 million for the first nine
months of 2014 compared to $229 million in the same period last year. The benefit of
holding a larger portfolio was partially offset by lower yields. Net realized investment gains
for the period were $29 million compared to $41 million a year ago. Included in net
realized gains were $3.9 million of other than temporary impairments as compared to $4.6
million in 2013.
Looking at our total results for the year, net cash provided by operating activities was
$537 million for the first nine months of 2014 compared to $543 million for the same
period of 2013. The decrease is due to higher tax payments for our international
operations, partially offset by higher tax pledge from investment income and underwriting
activities due to the inclusion of Alterra.
Our projected effective tax rate was 25% in the first nine months of 2014 compared to
28% a year ago. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2014 is primarily due to
anticipating a larger tax benefit related to tax exempt investment income and a decrease
in the estimated foreign earnings subject to U.S. tax in 2014 as compared to 2013.
We reported net income to shareholders of $204 million in the first nine months of 2014
compared to $182 million a year ago. Comprehensive income was $517 million for the first
nine months of 2014 compared to $253 million a year ago. Book value per share at the
end of September 2014 was $514, an increase of 8% since the end of 2013.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike to talk about the U.S. Insurance segment.

FINAL

Thanks, Anne. Good morning. The U.S. Insurance segment, as we pointed out before,
comprises all direct business written on our U.S. insurance companies and includes all of
the underwriting results of our wholesale and specialty divisions as well as certain
products written by our Global Insurance team.
For the third quarter, gross written premium was up 3% over prior year. Year-to-date,
gross written premiums have increased 13% over prior year. This increase was due in a
large part to the Alterra lines of business that are now included in this segment. Excluding
these lines, premium volume is up 5%.
Keep in mind that we have been exiting or reunderwriting some lines in our specialty and
wholesale divisions and this has impacted growth. The combined ratio for the quarter was
95% for both 2014 and 2013. The combined ratio for the year was 97% as compared to
94% in 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

As Anne pointed out, the higher insurance segment combined ratio was driven by less
favorable development of prior year losses due in part to adverse development in the
architects and engineers line of business. Partially offsetting this impact was a lower yearover-year expense ratio. The improvement in the expense ratio was due to higher
contribution of earned premium from the legacy Alterra in 2014 than in 2013 and due to
non-reoccurring transaction cost recorded in 2013 associated with the Alterra acquisition.
The rate environment in the U.S. segment remains competitive. However, we continue to
achieve modest single-digit rate increases on small to medium size risk across the various
divisions within the segment. Large accounts remained under competitive pressure and
prices for property and casualty lineson Fortune 1000 business remained soft.
Operationally during the quarter, we combined our Atlanta and Richmond specialty
program units under one management team and we expect this reorganization to
improve our results in 2015 from both an underwriting and expense perspective.
Also in the specialty division, year-to-date data revealed benefits from our initiatives to
cross-sell and round accounts between FirstComp and Markel Specialty programs, 566
accounts have added additional coverages through this rounding effort.
In our wholesales division, we continue to see strong growth in our binding P&C,
environmental and excess umbrella lines. Our E&S executive team had a very busy
NAPSLO, holding over 350 face-to-face meetings with our wholesales partners. We
continue to grow with our top wholesalers and this meeting provides the opportunity for
an intense few days of one-on-ones. All five wholesale regions volume is up year-to-date.
Also our specialty and global and executive teams attended the annual CIAB conference,
just like NAPSLO allows us to visit face-to-face with many of our key brokers and agents.
The broad array of Markel products both large and small accounts has made us an
attractive alternative for many agents.

FINAL

Gerry Albanese, our Executive Vice President and Chief Underwriting Officer, presided
over a number of product line leadership meetings during the quarter. These meetings
were attended by our most senior underwriters and they provide a platform for
communication between our underwriting leaders and our regional operations as we
finalize business plans and budgets for 2015.
In summary, we remained focused on those same key objectives that have driven us
throughout 2014, reassessment of some lines of business, expense reduction and
control, attraction of talent and aggressive sales and marketing.
I'll now turn the call over to Richie.

Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Following on from comments by Anne and
Mike, I'd sum up the first nine months of the year in Markel's underwriting operations as
solid or business as usual. I think this is a really important statement, when you consider
that we are establishing consistent with our historical practices, a loss reserve margin of
safety on legacy Alterra business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning specifically to the results of the International Insurance and Reinsurance
segments, the International Insurance segment which includes business written by our
Markel International division as well as that written by our Global Insurance division has
performed well so far this year.
During the nine months of 2014, gross written premiums in the International Insurance
segment increased 13% to $653 million. The combined ratio was 95% compared to 92%
in the prior year. The increase in premium writings is primarily due to the Global Insurance
division, which was created after the acquisition of Alterra and contributed nine months of
business in 2014, compared to only five months of business in 2013.
The higher segment combined ratio was driven by a higher current accident year loss
ratio, partially offset by a favorable expense ratio. The improvement in the expense ratio
was due to transaction cost of the Alterra merger back in 2013 and higher earned
premiums from the Global Insurance division which carry a lower expense ratio.
Now I'll turn to the Reinsurance segment, which includes reinsurance programs written by
our Global Reinsurance division, as well as that written by our Markel International division.
Gross written premiums for this segment were $999 million for the first nine months of
2014 and that was up from $443 million a year ago.
The increase in premium writings was primarily due to including nine months of writing
from product previously written by Alterra in 2014, compared to five months of writings in
2013.

FINAL

The combined ratio for the Reinsurance segment was a 97 as compared to 108 last year.
Last year's combined ratio included seven points of catastrophe losses, really very minor
catastrophe losses this year, really of the attritional nature, I would say, and approximately
10 points of non-recurring costs associated with the acquisition of Alterra.
Operationally, during the quarter and the first nine months of the year, we recently
announced that Dave Kalainoff will be retiring from Markel Re in June of next year and that
Jed Rhoads will be taking over responsibility for all of Markel Re.
I can't thank Dave enough for all that he has done to ensure the smooth transition of
Alterra Reinsurance operations into our Markel Re division. Also I know Jed will do a
fantastic job leading our reinsurance team into the future.
Markel International's integration of its Abbey acquisition continues to go well. We've
added marketing and sales resources as well as some new product capabilities to the
Abbey team. Abbey is a wonderful franchise and with the additional resources that Markel
can bring to the table, we believe that solid growth is possible.

Bloomberg Transcript

As Mike said, all areas of the P&C market remain competitive. The only difference really is
the degree to which they are competitive. The International Insurance and Reinsurance
segments are probably among the most competitive in the market today. We're in the
process of completing budgets and plans for 2015 and barring any significant market
changes, organic growth is going to be difficult to come by in 2015.
As a result, as Mike alluded to, we are focused on controlling our expenses, finding
efficiencies and emphasizing risk selection and portfolio management. In soft markets, we
will always choose underwriting discipline over growth. Despite these difficult market
conditions, we still believe there are great opportunity available to us and believe we
have built the platforms to pursue those opportunities.
With that, like to turn it over to Tom.

Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Thank you, Richie. My comments this morning will be brief, since our news is good and
straightforward. I am happy to answer any questions or cover any details when we get to
the Q&A. On the investment side of the house, we earned 7.3% on our equity
investments and 4.5% on our fixed income portfolio during the first nine months, which
produced a gross total return of 5.2%. In the equity portfolio, we continue to methodically
add to our holdings steadily throughout the year.
Between purchases of roughly $300 million so far as well as depreciation of the portfolio,
we've now got roughly 52% of our shareholders' capital invested in equities, compared to
48% at year-end 2013. We continue to have an unusual combination of investment ideas
that we're confident about, positive cash flows from our insurance and ventures business
and some sense of overall caution and wariness about investment markets overall.

FINAL

The net effect of these cross-currents is that we continue to steadily dollar cost average
our way into building positions. We think that approach prudently protects our balance
sheet and leaves us with the ability to be able to invest more money in equities as
opportunities present themselves, expect us to continue our steady, consistent approach
in building the equity portfolio.
In our fixed income operations, we earned a total return of 4.5% as low interest rates that
prevailed at the end of 2013 went under an even lower limbo stick by the time we got to
the end of September. Net-net we got some capital appreciation in the portfolio, in
addition to recurring interest income. We remain cautious as we have been for multiple
years about the balance between risk and reward in bonds.
Long-term rates just don't have that much room between where they are (18:16). They
have a lot of room between where they are and where I've seen them in my career.
Consequently, we keep the duration of our bond portfolio a bit shorter than the duration
of our insurance liabilities. Including cash, the duration stood at roughly 4.25 years at
September 30, and we do not plan to go longer than that in the current interest rate
environment.

Bloomberg Transcript

We also remain committed to safety first. In addition to not stretching for yield by
extending the duration, we don't stretch for it by reducing credit quality either. 97% of the
portfolio is rated A or better, but we don't stop there and rely solely on the rating
agencies. We do our own credit analysis on top of that to make sure that we are
comfortable with the credit risk we take, as always, safety first.
In Markel Ventures, we purchased Cottrell industries during the third quarter. Only five
weeks of their results are included in our third quarter numbers and you'll see more from
them as well as the rest of the Markel Ventures companies in the fourth quarter. Cottrell is
the leading manufacturer of car hauling trailers and equipment and we welcome them to
the Markel family.
As we stayed in the Markel Style, we seek to be a market leader in each of our pursuits. I
can assure you that Cottrell fits that description as well as other elements of the Markel
Style. For the nine months to-date, you could see imaginatively named other revenues on
our income statement of $630 million versus $459 million a year ago. Anne gave you the
portion for Markel Ventures and you can see the vast majority of those revenues indeed
relate to the Markel Ventures operations.
Our EBITDA from the group was $66 million versus $64 million in 2013, which is a much
smaller percentage increase than the increase in revenues. We got off to a slow start in
the first quarter of this year and have been making up ground ever since. I assure you that
I look forward to reporting the full year results.
When you add all of our activities together from insurance, investing in Markel Ventures,
you get to the bottom line of comprehensive income. Comprehensive income through
the first nine months at Markel exceeded $0.5 billion. As it shows in the Q in round
numbers the drivers of comprehensive income came from pre-tax underwriting profits of
Page 7 of 13

Date: 2014-11-06

FINAL

over $70 million, pre-tax investment income and gains of about $300 million, increased
pre-tax unrealized gains in the portfolio of almost $350 million, and pre-tax cash flows of
over $70 million from Markel Ventures in non-cash intangible amortization. We then paid
gobs of taxes and provided for the rest of what we have. Some of those items comes to
the $0.5 billion of comprehensive income we earned. We are pleased with that result and
we hope you are as well.
Looking forward, every insurance, investment, industrial and service business that we own
or operate in faces challenging and competitive markets. They always have and they
always will. Despite those facts, we continue to produce solid returns for you as our
shareholders and we expect to continue that to be the case over time. We're grateful for
the opportunity to do so and we now look forward to answering your questions.
With that, John, if you'd be so kind to open the Q&A period.

Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Vincent DeAugustino from KBW. You
may state your question.

Q - Vincent M. DeAugustino

{BIO 17976273 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Good morning, everyone.

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Good morning.

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - Vincent M. DeAugustino

{BIO 17976273 <GO>}

Just to start off. So last quarter you guys had talked about the reinsurance environment
kind of theoretically being at bottom if everybody was being disciplined. And I am just
wondering if at this point there is any change in kind of that assessment or if it's one of
these things where we have to really wait for 1/1 to play out before we can get a true test,
if that's going to kind of – if we are going to be at bottom and potentially rebound or go
lower?

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

This is Richie, Vincent. I think it's a little early to say. Like you say, I think we got to see what
happens with the 1/1 renewals, but a lot of people are talking about it being the bottom. I
wouldn't look for a bounce at this point. I think there is too much capital out there for it to
be any sort of bounce. If I had to guess, you might just see a little more reduction, but I
Page 8 of 13



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2014-11-06

just can't imagine the kinds of reductions we've seen the last two years. And certainly, if
people are looking for those kinds of reductions at 1/1, we'll probably be coming off of
some business. So it feels like we're getting close to a bottom, but I'd like to see those 1/1
renewals before I commit to that.

FINAL

Q - Vincent M. DeAugustino

{BIO 17976273 <GO>}

Okay. Good deal. And then just to switch over, two questions on the Markel Ventures side.
And Tom, sorry if I missed this. I know you said you look forward to kind of giving us the
full year numbers. But with Cottrell and Eagle, just where roughly with those two
businesses should that put us on an annualized EBITDA and net income basis?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Annualized run rate of the revenues should be a round number of $1 billion plus or minus;
there's cyclicality to that and that's looking into 2015, and we would expect double-digit
EBITDA earnings from that mix collection of business.

Q - Vincent M. DeAugustino

{BIO 17976273 <GO>}

Okay. Cool. Thank you. And then just...

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Round numbers with a lot of zeroes involved there.

Q - Vincent M. DeAugustino

{BIO 17976273 <GO>}

Good deal. Just a theoretical question between the split in terms of when you're speaking
with investors between Markel Ventures and the equity portfolio, do you feel that you get
more credit for the Ventures' income stream versus the public equity since on the
Ventures you don't have to do the whole equity look through your earnings add back?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

No.

Q - Vincent M. DeAugustino

{BIO 17976273 <GO>}

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Dwelle of RBC Capital Markets. Please
state your question.

FINAL

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning. Just a few sort of numbers questions, because as you said, it was a
pretty straightforward quarter. In the discontinued line segment, there was a $6.8 million
of adverse development. Was that just a true-up of the asbestos study from the second
quarter or was it something different?

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

That's actually some development that we saw on the discontinued businesses from the
Alterra acquisition that occurred during the quarter.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. The figure for the remaining amortization of the premiums in the investment – or
the premium in the investment portfolio, is that number somewhere in the 10-Q I haven't
found it, if it is.

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

It's not. But given the – and I don't have the number with me Mark. But given the amount
of the portfolio that we have turned over, the number that's left has gotten smaller, but I
don't have the specific number with me and it's not in the Q.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. And then finally, was there any meaningful amount of catastrophe loss across any of
the businesses? I know Rich you mentioned in the reinsurance there was not. Just asking
on the other units?

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Nothing to speak of.

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

No. We always have a bit of an attritional amount of catastrophes built into our
assumptions and I would say it was even probably a light attritional quarter from that
standpoint.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. Those are all my questions. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Please state your question.

FINAL

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. In the reinsurance segment, the expense ratio in the third quarter
dropped, I guess, about four points from the first half. In the Q, you suggest there was an
increase in experience-related funds or something, I forget exactly the phrase. But I am
wondering how much of an impact that had on the expense ratio in the quarter in the
reinsurance segment?

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Yeah. I would say the impact for the quarter was probably not significant.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

So do you see the third quarter number as a reasonable run rate going forward because
it's about 30% versus nearly 34% in the first half ?

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No. I do not think that this is reasonable run rate. I think you can take the earlier quarters
and use those. This would be a non-recurring one-time adjustment that we make and
then we'll trend it going forward, but I think you can use the earlier quarter's indication.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

That's helpful. And, I guess, for the overall company, when you think about the expense
ratio. Given the market conditions in internationally and in reinsurance, should we expect
any improvement at all in the expense ratio going forward or should we just kind of
assume it stays reasonably flat?

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Well, this is Richie, Jay. Obviously, we continue to work to reduce the expense ratio. But
it's fair to say we don't expect to have a whole lot of help in that effort from growth next
year as of growing the top line. If the market stay like this, that's going to be difficult, so
we're going to have do it the old fashion way, which is spending less. So immediately it's
going to be difficult – what did we have? Like 37%...

A - Anne G. Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

37%.

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

...a little over 37% this quarter. I think that's probably fair for next year and we're going to
work hard to see if we can reduce it.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

FINAL

That's great. If I could squeeze one more in. Markel Ventures, Tom as you had mentioned,
the improvement was pretty noticeable versus the first half and specifically in the
manufacturing segment where the net income or GAAP income went from a little above
$4.5 million in the first quarter up to $21 million this quarter, so pretty impressive. Does
seasonality play a role there? And should we think about the third quarter again as a
reasonable run rate going forward?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Seasonality plays a small role, but I would say it's much more economically cyclical than
what I would describe as seasonal. And frankly, the first quarter was low. We were in the
midst of integrating some acquisitions and there's always a little bit of ingestion and
process that's connected with that and as we've gone through the year, those issues are
starting to resolve themselves and we're getting to a more normal basis.
I really would steer you towards EBITDA because, given the amortization, purchase
accounting and that sort of stuff, the true cash that's being produced by the business is
best represented by the EBITDA and that's what we hold the managers accountable for,
