Thank you, Linda. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our first
quarter performance. For AXIS, the story of the first quarter is that our actions of the past
few years are starting to deliver meaningful results. I'm pleased by the quarterly results,
which, I believe, signal the start to a strong 2018 for AXIS.
I'm going to begin by putting our first quarter's results in the context of recent
transformation actions, and the ongoing evolution of our company. After which Pete will
provide a bit more detail on the numbers, and I'll close with our customary review of
pricing and outlook.
Over the past five years, AXIS has undergone a fundamental transformation from an
intelligent and opportunistic provider of large capacity for volatile lines in what was a hard
market, to a relevant and leading player in a select number of attractive markets, position
to deliver superior results across a wide range of market conditions.
In that time, we exited the number of lines in the markets where we did not see a clear
path to leadership or profitable growth, including the Australian retail market, Canadian
property, global excess casualty, retail distribution for property and casualty lines in the
U.S, and most recently, onshore energy. But we also invested in developing lines with
exciting potential, including A&H, renewable energy, cyber, agricultural reinsurance and
mortgage reinsurance.
We provided our underwriters with better tools and analytics, and achieved industry
leading claim service levels. We expanded geographically and completed the acquisitions
of Aviabel and Novae. We recruited strong talent. By the end of 2017, AXIS was a relevant
to top 10 player and substantially all of its chosen markets, including the U.S. E&S
wholesale business, North American professional lines, and the London and Lloyd's
market for international specialty lines.

This quarter's results provide some insight into the earnings potential of our progress todate. We reported operating income of a $1.46 per share and operating ROE of 10.8%.
However, our reported GAAP results understate the true profitability of our book, as the
PGAAP adjustments related to the Novae acquisition had a negative $14 million impact on
reported earnings. As Pete will discuss later, these PGAAP adjustments will substantially
run off by the end of the year. Thus, we believe a better indication of our underlying
profitability is on an ex-PGAAP basis. And on that basis, ex-PGAAP, our annual operating,
our annualized operating ROE was 12% in the quarter.
Let me add that the integration of Novae continues to proceed according to plan. Pete will
address our results with the Novae operations attributed separately to insurance and
reinsurance segments. But on a combined basis, the continuing business of Novae
delivered are running rate accident year combined ratio in the mid-90s for the quarter,
excluding any PGAAP adjustments. This performance still does not reflect the full benefit
of the recent and ongoing underwriting actions we've taken on the Novae portfolio, nor
the full synergies we expect to achieve from the integration of Novae. You'll recall we
announced revised synergy projections of $60 million by year end 2020. This quarter
reflects only $7 million of achieved synergies or $28 million on an annualized basis. So,
there's still more progress to come.
Separately, we've also earlier this year expanded our transformation program to include
the redesign of our operating model based on best practices utilized by forward thinking
companies both, within and outside our sector. You'll recall the highlights of the
organizational changes that we announced included the realignment of accidents and
health operations to the insurance and reinsurance segments, restructuring our finance
and IT functions around an integrated organizational structure, and the creation of a
global underwriting and analytics office. These actions put the company on a powerful
path forward as we accelerate our strategy to be a leader in specialty insurance and
reinsurance, while increasing our efficiency and profitability.
Simply put we aim to be better, smarter and faster in serving our clients and partners in
distribution. We will on the one hand to be more efficient in the delivery of our
differentiated services, and on the other, invest in greater analytics, technology and
development for our staff. We expect with these operational efficiencies and investments
in new initiatives and talent will make AXIS more agile and responsive and better position
our company to lead and win in today's markets and into the future.
In addition, we expect our ongoing transformation to deliver net additional expense
reductions of $40 million by year-end 2020, even as we invest in our people and in our
business. When added to the $60 million in synergies from the integration of Novae, total
expected cost savings should exceed $100 million by year-end 2020.
We're proud of our achievements to-date and keen to continue our progress to deliver
outstanding products and services to our customers and superior returns to our
shareholders. We have a clear runway to enhance profitability and are committed to a
journey that will provide substantial rewards to all our key stakeholders.

FINAL

Thank you, Albert and good morning, everyone.
During the quarter, we generated strong results, featuring net income of $63 million and
an annualized ROE of 5.5%. Our operating income for the quarter was $123 million and an
ex-PGAAP basis our operating income was $137 million, generating an ex-PGAAP
annualized ROE of 12%.
Net income this quarter benefited from good ex-cat underwriting results, a lower level of
catastrophe and weather related losses, continued favorable prior year reserve
development and strong investment income. These positive factors were partially offset
by net investment income losses and foreign exchange losses. Diluted book value per
share declined by 2% in the quarter to $52.57. The decline was principally driven by net
unrealized losses on investments. Before I get into specifics, I would like to provide an
update on a number of items.

Bloomberg Transcript

Firstly, with regard to the acquisition of Novae, in the quarter, we recognized $60 million
of intangible amortization, including $57 million of VOBA amortization. This expense
affected the company's operating income, but was not included in the results of the
company's insurance and reinsurance segments. As previously disclosed, the VOBA is
expected to be immaterial beyond mid-2019.
Underwriting income in the quarter continued to include the earnout of Novae's unearned
premium as of the closing date, without the recognition of the associated acquisition
costs, since the DAC asset was written off at closing. This DAC would normally been
amortized into acquisition expenses. We estimate that the consolidated acquisition costs
on an as-if basis would have been $40 million higher, resulting in an as-if acquisition cost
ratio of 23.1% versus the reported ratio of 19.6%.
As we have previously mentioned, we entered into a reinsurance to close agreement for
Novae's 2015 and all prior years' liabilities. The agreement effectively transfers
responsibility for discharging all liabilities associated with all business underwritten by
Novae in 2015 and prior years. The positive financial impact associated with this
transaction was reflected in the fair value of Novae's balance sheet at the closing date.
During the quarter, we recognized a reduction in reserves for losses and loss expenses,
representing the transfer of the liabilities to the reinsurer, consideration paid and a
payable representing consideration due to the reinsurer at March 31, 2018. The
transaction had no impact on our net income in the quarter.
Additionally, in the first quarter, we realigned our accident and health business units into
the insurance and reinsurance segments. Financial results relating to A&H were previously
included in the results of the insurance segment. As a result of the realignment, A&H
results are included in the results of both the insurance and reinsurance segments.

FINAL

In the investor information section of our website, we have supplemental historical
financial information presenting this alignment. Finally, non-operating transaction and
reorganization expenses of $13 million were recognized in the quarter. These expenses
are associated with the integration of Novae and our transformation program.
Moving into the details of the income statement. First quarter gross premiums written
increased by 39% with an increase in both reinsurance and insurance segments. The
reinsurance segment reported an increase in gross premiums written of $415 million in the
quarter compared to the same period last year. Approximately, a third of the increase is
due to the timing of renewals, primarily driven by multi-year contracts written in 2016 that
were not available to renew in 2017, but have renewed in the first quarter of 2018. These
contracts renewed for a one-year term.
$50 million of the increase is driven by the acquisition of Novae. Foreign exchange
movements contributed $80 million to the increase. And, lastly, we had good premium
growth in A&H and cat from new business and strong growth in the motor business,
driven by rate increases as well as new business.

Bloomberg Transcript

The insurance segment reported an increase in gross premiums written of $336 million in
the first quarter. The increase is mostly driven by $302 million of premium associated with
the acquisition of Novae. Year-over-year Novae's gross premiums written declined about
10%, with two-thirds of the decrease related to discontinued lines, and the remainder due
to the non-renewal of certain accounts, primarily those identified to be underperforming
within the property and marine lines.
The legacy AXIS insurance book was up 6%, primarily driven by aviation due to our
acquisition of Aviabel, professional lines in new business across a number of business
units, in an increasing liability lines due to new business and renewal rate increases.
Consolidated net premiums written increased year-over-year by 32%. Reinsurance net
premiums written increased by $286 million, compared to the same period in 2017,
including $19 million attributable to Novae. The additional increase of $267 million reflected
the increase in gross premiums written, partially offset by an increase in premiums ceded
in catastrophe lines. Insurance net premiums written increased by $191 million, compared
to the same period in 2017. The increase is almost all attributable to the acquisition of
Novae.
Consolidated net premiums earned increased by 24% year-over-year. Reinsurance net
premiums earned increased by $41 million, compared to the same period in 2017. $13
million of the increase is attributable to Novae, with the remaining increase due to strong
premium growth in catastrophe, motor and accident and health lines, partially offset by an
increase in ceded premiums earned in catastrophe lines.
Insurance net premiums are increased by $188 million, compared to the same period in
2017; a $178 million of the increase is attributable to Novae with the balance due to strong
premium growth in A&H, along with premium growth in aviation lines associated with the
acquisition of Aviabel.

FINAL

We reported a consolidated combined ratio of 90.8%, an 11.3 point improvement from for
the first quarter 2017 consolidated combined ratio of 102.1%. While this is our reported
numbers, these are not the most useful ratios to gain an insight into our business
performance. As I noted in my opening remarks this quarter benefits from a lack of DAC
amortization associated with the write-off with the Novae unearned premium, and the
same quarter last year does not include Novae results. So we are not comparing any likefor-like basis.
In order to provide better insight into the changes in the business, I will compare the first
quarter of this year reversing the PGAAP impact on acquisition costs and combining the
first quarter of 2017 AXIS results with the first quarter 2017 Novae results which we
provided in supplementary disclosure earlier this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

On this pro forma basis the current quarter consolidated combined ratio is 94.3% and is a
10.4 point improvement from for the first quarter 2017 AXIS-Novae consolidated
combined ratio of 104.7%. The 10.4 point improvement is driven by a 4.8 point
improvement in the current accident year loss ratio, ex-cat and weather, a favorable
increase in prior year development affecting the loss ratio by 4.4 points and decrease in
the G&A ratio of 1.8 points and lower Cat and weather losses, partially offset by a higher
acquisition cost ratio.
The current quarter consolidated current accident year loss ratio decreased by 5 points to
61.3%, compared to a pro forma first quarter 2017 of 66.3%. During the quarter, we
incurred catastrophe and weather-related losses of $35 million or 3 points. This is a
decrease of 0.2 point from pro forma 2017 catastrophe and weather losses of 3.2 points.
The first quarter losses were principally due to weather-related events.
The consolidated current year accident loss ratio, ex-cat and weather, of 58.3% is a 4.8
point decrease from pro forma first quarter 2017 ratio of 63.1%, both segments improved.
The reinsurance segment current accident year loss ratio ex-cat and weather of 62% is a
decrease of 5.9 points from a pro forma prior year ratio of 67.9%. The drivers of the
improvement are rate increases across a number of lines, reducing impact for the Ogden
Rate change, favorable experience in property and credit and surety and the positive
impact of mix resulting from our underwriting actions.
The insurance segment current accident year loss ratio, ex-cat and weather, of 54.5%
improved 3.8 points from a pro forma prior year ratio of 58.3%. The improvement was
driven by a 9.7 point improvement in the legacy Novae book, primarily driven by the
favorable impact from discontinued lines and a 1.2 point improvement in the legacy AXIS
book driven by favorable changes in business mix and the favorable impact of rate and
trend, partially offset by an increase in mid-sized and attritional loss experience in aviation
and marine lines.
Turning to loss reserves established in prior years. During the first quarter, our results
benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development of $54 million, including $32
million attributable to the reinsurance segment and $22 million attributable to the
insurance segment. Included in the $54 million is favorable development of our 2017

Page 6 of 22

catastrophe reserves of $26 million, split $19 million in the insurance segment and $7
million in the reinsurance segment.

FINAL

During the first quarter, the pro forma consolidated acquisition cost ratio of 23.1%
increased 0.7 point compared to the same period in 2017. There was no material change
in the insurance segment's ratio and a 1.5 point increase in the insurance segment's ratio
primarily related to changes in business mix.
On a year-over-year reported basis, we will continue to experience a higher acquisition
ratio and a lower current accident year loss ratio, ex-cat and weather, due to the mix of
business provided by the Novae acquisition, which consists of primarily smaller accounts.
The G&A expense ratio of 14.5% decrease by 1.8 points compared to the pro forma first
quarter 2017 G&A ratio of 16.3%. The decrease mainly related to realized synergies in
Novae acquisition and an elevated level of expenses in the first quarter of 2017, primarily
due to one-time separation costs and share-based compensation costs.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the first quarter, fee income from strategic capital partners was $13 million, up from $11
million last year. It consisted of $5 million in other insurance related income, primarily
attributable to profit commissions associated with third-party retrocessions, and $8 million
included as an offset to G&A expenses.
Net investment income was comparable to the fourth quarter of 2017 with an increase in
income from fixed maturity securities largely offset by a decrease in income from
alternative investments, in particular hedge funds which benefited from the stronger
performance in equity markets in the prior year quarter. In the quarter the total return on
cash and investments including the impact of foreign exchange was a negative 0.1 point
compared to a positive 1.1% last year.
The year-over-year decrease in total return was primarily driven by the increase in
unrealized investment losses on the fixed maturity securities primarily as a result of an
increase in U.S. Treasury rates. The balance sheet is strong, and today we have more
sources of capital available to us than we've ever had in our history. AXIS is wellpositioned to continue to support clients across its portfolio lines where we feel we can
get an appropriate return on capital.
The suspension of share repurchases has continued into 2018, as we continue to focus on
restoring capital to levels held prior to the major cat losses in 2017. With respect to the
integration of Novae, we are still comfortable that we will deliver $60 million in run rate
savings by 2020, with at least $30 million to $35 million in this year. As Albert noted
earlier, this integration combined with our ongoing enterprise-wide transformation
program is expect to deliver $100 million in run rate cost savings by 2020 even as we
continue to invest in our future-ready operating model.
Finally, we feel comfortable that various other underwriting and risk management
initiatives together with continued progress and targeted growth initiatives and continued
momentum in strategic capital partnership activities will continue to drive strong results.

FINAL

Thanks, Pete. Let's spend a few minutes going into detail on the market and recent price
changes we've seen across our business.
In our insurance book, we're seeing the continuation of the positive pricing momentum
that started after the record third quarter cat events of 2017. In this quarter, our average
renewal price change was up 5%. This compares to plus 3.5% in the fourth quarter of last
year and minus 1.4% in the first quarter of 2017.
For the moment at least, it seems to be gathering some steam, with the monthly rate
change increasing in succeeding months with average increases of 4% in January, 4.7% in
February, and 6.6% in March. In the first quarter, 89% of renewed premiums were flat to
up, while that figure was 72% in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Bloomberg Transcript

Similar to last quarter, the strongest improvements were observed in our U.S. division,
where we achieved average increases of 11.7% with solid double-digit improvements
across both E&S property, and AXIS casualty, while primary casualty and programs were
up in the mid-single digits to high single-digits.
In our important London-based International insurance division, the average rate change
for the first quarter was 4.3% with the strongest increases in the U.S. and Caribbean
exposed property lines. 90% of our premiums renewed were flat to up.
Our U.S. and Bermuda professionalized division was up a bit above 1% for the quarter. This
is noteworthy as it is the first time we saw a positive overall price change in some time for
professional lines, about 79% of the book renewed flat to up. The strongest increases are
in primary layers and D&O, while excess layers and E&O lines are closer to flat.
Across all insurance lines and geographies, we're seeing more submissions and achieving
growth where it makes sense. We're aggressive in pushing price increases where it's
warranted. This has resulted in lower retention ratios in some cases, but we're showing
growth and improved profitability, so we're satisfied that we're taking appropriate actions.
The reinsurance market is also seeing an improved tone, but it is more subdued as there
is still excess capacity.
In a quota share business, we're benefiting from the underlying price changes, but ceding
commissions are generally flat other than in treaties that have delivered poor
performance. In those cases, particularly in the U.S., one is likely to see ceding
commissions drop 1 point or 2 points. Otherwise it's generally renewal at expiring terms.
Excess of loss treaties are similarly stable except in the case of poor underlying
performance and there increases are generally in the low single-digits. Exceptions are of
course in the UK AXIS motor business which responded to the change in the Ogden Rate
Page 8 of 22

FINAL

last year and catastrophe where the markets are modestly up in the U.S., but generally flat
elsewhere. I think it's fair to say that cat markets have not responded to the extent hoped
for at the end of last year. The recent April 1 renewals were in large part focused on the
Asia-Pacific region. Rates and terms are very stable in Japan and flat to slightly negative
outside Japan.
Overall, in both our insurance and reinsurance portfolio, earned rates is on average
matching trends. On a written basis however, rate is ahead of trends, which should bode
well for future periods. I'm cautiously positive on the outlook despite the abundancy of
capacity in many lines. I believe the market is simply too stressed to give up any more
pricing. Nevertheless, there will be no tide to lift all boats, and meaningful underwriting
margin improvement will be dependent on individual company's ability to access
attractive risks and select among the best opportunities to create profitable portfolios.
In that regard, I'm bullish about our prospects. Our global diversified specialty hybrid
platform and top 10 positioning gives us significant flexibility over our competitors. And we
remain focused on improving our portfolios to deliver stronger results. Regardless of
market conditions, we will continue to strengthen our franchise, platform and capabilities
and leverage risk funding with the goal of delivering stronger performance.

Bloomberg Transcript

As I mentioned on the onset of our call, our actions for the past few years are starting to
deliver meaningful results. Perhaps the best way to illustrate this is to compare the results
of legacy AXIS business year-over-year without the impact of Aviabel and Novae
portfolios, which we've only recently started to influence.
Within the legacy AXIS portfolio, the ex-cat accident year combined ratio improved by 3.5
points in insurance and 6 points in reinsurance. We intend to continue our disciplined datadriven approach to portfolio construction to make the most of our recent acquisitions and
achieve further progress in underwriting performance.
The success we're seeing in our Novae integration work is encouraging, as we continue to
meet and exceed our objectives in delivering on this very important effort. The
organization is energized and we're making significant strides in cementing our leadership
role in the London International specialty insurance space.
In summation, I'm pleased with the quarterly results and feel it's a bright start to a strong
2018 for AXIS. Our differentiated market positioning, underwriting actions, and progress
along our targeted $100 million of cost savings by 2020, give us a clear path to improve
performance. I'm confident about our ability to deliver on our goals and we are as
committed as ever to the successful execution of our strategy in 2018 and beyond,
producing superior outcomes for all of our stakeholders.
Thank you for your attention. And, with that, we'd be happy to open the call for questions.

Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question
comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. My first question – Albert, I appreciate all the pricing color. In terms of
just outlook from here, do you think that the upward momentum you pointed to rate
increase is improving every month of the quarter? Do you see that that continuing?
And I guess, in your comment there, if we get to the June and July renewals and all the
capital that's been coming back into the reinsurance market potentially causes rates to
decline at the mid-year. Do you think that that will have an impact on the upward
momentum that you're seeing in the primary insurance market?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Elyse. So, I'm happy to provide the details on a monthly basis, but I would be
loathed to project that we will continue to add 1 point or 2 points of pricing increase per
month. I think the levels that we have are levels that are sustainable. I think they work well
for the customers, for the brokers and for the companies to try and maintain a wellfunctioning market. But I think we do need to keep these increases going forward.
We'd be, of course, very happy to see improved beyond that, but we're working on the
basis that if it stays at these levels, we need to build profitable portfolios at those levels. I
do want to differentiate our outlook from what we're seeing in our various insurance lines
and the reinsurance market. And as I mentioned, I think the reinsurance market is much
more subdued than what we're seeing at least in our markets for insurance lines.
There in the non-loss affected cat business, we've essentially seen flattish, maybe up a
couple of points, but really not much change. In loss affected portfolios, we've seen
mostly high-single-digits and in some cases double-digits. Again, I expect that to continue.
My expectation, of course, is that there will be more loss affected treaties renewing in the
May to July period. So, my expectation is that cat on average will probably show highsingle-digit on average, when you incorporate the higher preponderance of loss affected
treaties. And so, I think, that's where we are. I continue to hope that we will not see a
diminution of the current pricing, but I'm also not supporting a vision of substantial
improvement beyond the levels where we are today.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then in terms of reinsurance, the growth you saw in the quarter, Pete, you
highlighted there were some multi-year covers from 2016 that were new this first quarter.

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Are there multi-year covers in the back three quarters of 2016 that we should think about
in terms of modeling that are up for renewal this year?

FINAL

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah. That's a good question. I don't have that answer really off the top of my head. I'll
get back to you on that. But, I think most of it really occurred in the first quarter, but we
can follow-up on that.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then a couple other questions just related to the expense level. Is the
acquisition cost ratio that about 23% or so, excluding the purchase accounting
adjustments, is that the right level to assume going forward ex-purchase accounting?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

That's a good level to assume ex-purchase accounting. I think it's going to continue to
drift up towards that into that low-20s area as the purchase accounting impact goes away.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

And, Elyse, you know that we have in every quarter a little bit of up and down around the
loss sensitive factor. So, as reinsurance numbers develop well in certain lines of business
we give up a little bit more commission, so that was a little bit higher this quarter. So,
there's always going to be a little bit of up and down, but Peter is right. That's generally a
good level.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then in terms of the purchase accounting benefit for the remaining three
quarters, can you – is there any kind of color that you can give us about thinking on the
benefit that we should model going forward? And is the right way to think about it that
you get – you wrote-off about $209 million of deferred acquisition costs. Is that the level
that will come back as a benefit by the end of 2018 or can you just help us think through
the modeling there?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah. We expect in the modeling Elyse that through the course of 2018, you'll see about a
$120 million benefit. So, we got about $40 million of that in the first quarter, which I
mentioned. So $80 million for the rest of the year and that will decline throughout the
year. So, you'll see more of a benefit in 2Q, less in 3Q, even less in 4Q as that – as that
DAC amortization benefit runs off. But in total for this year, we're looking to – it's could
probably be about $120 million and the remaining $80 million will not be wrote-off evenly.

Page 11 of 22



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2018-04-26

Probably about 45% of that remaining will be written-off in the second quarter and then in
the last two quarters the rest maybe 30% and then 25%.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

FINAL

And then there is no benefit in 2019, so the only thing we need to think about 2019 is just
in terms of the intangible amortization running through the model?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

No, there will be a little bit, but it'll be de minimis. I think by the time we get to 2019 Elyse,
that will be about probably $19 million left and that will run-off in for the most part in the
first half of 2019.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. That's great. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color.

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

You're welcome.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

And of course that benefit will be offset by the amortization...

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah, the amortization VOBA.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

...which will be a negative. But we will be underwriting, yes.

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

So just to expand on that Elyse, we gave the schedule out for VOBA, and again we expect
that to be $171 billion of a drag this year, of which $57 million was amortized in the first
quarter and that will be down to about a $27 million drag in 2019, again most of it running
off in the first half of next year.

FINAL

Thank you and good morning. So, I just want to follow-up on these – your comments on
the underlying improvements of the loss ratio improved 5 points year-over-year. So, why
suddenly? I know you have done a lot of work in the past several years, why suddenly all
shown up in this quarter? I just wonder was this the sustainability of the 58% going
forward?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Hi, Kai. It's Peter. I would say that what we're seeing finally come through is at the last
three to five years of work on the underlying portfolios. We had good progress in the
areas we expected to see good progress, and it's coming through as we're actually
starting to earn it in this first quarter.
Again, there's always puts and takes in a quarter, I think the quarter benefited from a low
level of property activity on the reinsurance side this quarter. But by the same token, we
had a higher level of mid-size losses on the insurance side associated with our aviation
lines and marine. I'd say it was a really good quarter. I do think these levels can be
sustainable. But we did not do anything different this quarter, we're just continuing to see
the improvement that's taken a long time to turn the ship over the last three to five years
to start to earn through.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, if I can add to that, Kai. I mean, obviously we spend a lot of time analyzing results.
We go through the loss bridge. We identify factors like ceded and adjustment premiums,
rates trend, mix, experience, you name it. I think a couple of highlights.
Number one, we didn't have the adverse impact of Ogden, which is you know hurt us last
year, and that had a meaningful impact on the loss ratio. We continue to have growth in
the A&H business, which tends to have a lower loss ratio – a higher expense ratio, but
lower loss ratio through the business. We've had some ups and downs on the losses. So,
as Pete says, we didn't have any substantial large loss activity in the reinsurance division,
good property activity.
On the other hand you know we had a pretty poor aviation results this quarter. We had
some additional losses on marine. Obviously, the property book in the U.S. was affected
by the weather events. So, you know every quarter you're going to have something. But
by and large I think it's not unreasonable.
And of course, the addition of the Novae book makes a difference, because the Novae
book as Pete pointed out has a higher acquisition expense, but generally a lower loss
ratio and 2 – fully 2 points of the improvement in the loss ratio is the inclusion of the
Novae book in our consolidated results.
So, from our perspective, this really is consistent with the run-off of the discontinued lines
that we had. We cut out of retail property and retail casualty in the U.S. in the end of 2016.
But those lines hurt us in 2017 as those premiums ran off, you're now seeing a book which

Page 13 of 22



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2018-04-26

is less exposed to the discontinued line and more demonstrating the underlying profit
potential of the ongoing continuing business.

FINAL

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's great. Just follow-up on that, is there any seasonality in Novae's book through the
year? What I try to understand is that your historical AXIS accident year loss ratio has been
pretty consistent throughout the quarters. Is there going to be more seasonality with the
inclusion of Novae?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I would say twofold. By and large not really one of the good things about their book of
course and that we were very attracted to is that they have a lot of small accounts, very
diversified. They actually add diversity to our book of business, because they've more
European exposure and that adds balance, so those are good things.

Bloomberg Transcript

But I would say that when you think about cat exposure, you know our cat exposure was
predominantly around the – when it comes to wind, mostly around U.S. wind. Quite
happens every month if you want, but when you think of wind, it's predominantly in the
summer and early fall.
Novae has a much larger European property book, and so we're probably going to be
more exposed to European property wind losses. So I would say that it probably is going
to reduce the overall seasonality of our cat exposure because whereas we were low in
Europe before in the European wind season, we're not going to be higher. And we've
always been like everybody else higher exposure in the summer for U.S. wind, and we're
going to continue to have U.S. wind exposure. So yes, they have a different pattern, but I
think it probably levels out our pattern because of the rebalancing between Europe and
U.S.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's great. Then on the cost saving, the $100 million. So I just want to make sure that's –
like that's after potential reinvestment in the business, so there will be a flow through the
bottom line. And also could you provide a schedule in term of the annual cost saving like a
target, as well as the restructuring cost through the next three years?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Kai, thank you for bringing that question because it's actually very important. As much as
the numbers that we gave you, the $60 million and the $40 million, they're actually the
result of additional savings elsewhere, but we specifically allocated a good chunk of those
savings to investing in our people, to investing in development, investing in technology
and analytics. So the number that we give you is a net number after incremental
investments that we're going to do in our people and in our business.
That, of course, is going to be achieved off of the expense structure and the expense
base that we have in 2017 that will roll-through through 2020 and Peter you may have
Page 14 of 22



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td

Date: 2018-04-26

some insights on calendar year projections. But we feel pretty good that by the end of
2020 we will have eliminated those expenses.

FINAL

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah, Kai, we're very confident and still sticking with the estimates we gave you for the
$60 million associated with Novae. If you take our $7 million synergies actually experienced
in the first quarter of 2018 and annualize that, you can look at we've already got $28
million on an annualized run rate towards our $60 million. We do expect to get to up to
$35 million of that this year, so $30 million to $35 million and as we said $50 million to $55
million next year with the full $60 million coming in 2020.
For the additional $40 million that Albert mentioned, we do have end plans that suggest
that we will get to that additional $40 million also by the end of 2020. We have not gone
through the detailed scheduling on when all those actions will actually take place. I'd say
that the predominant will actually come through in 2019, and with the remainder coming
through in 2020.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

It's fair to say that we don't expect substantial amounts in 2018.

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

As we're working through it, we'll be rolling out the new organizational structure. There'll
be things that are done through the rest of this year, so we don't expect that there will be
any real savings from that incremental $40 million during this year and we'll see more of
that split between 2019 and 2020.

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

...2019 and 2020, yeah. Does that help, Kai?

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Great. Yes, very helpful. My last question about if I may is on industry consolidation. We've
seen an increase of M&A activities in this industry. I just wonder will that provide any
opportunities for AXIS or you will be solely focused on integration Novae and growing
organically?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

We're focused on integrating Novae I mean we've got a full project – list of projects in
front of us right now. We are doing a lot of work, we're very successful. And I think on
schedule, we're completing the integration of Aviabel. We're focused on the execution of
the strategy, the integrating of Novae and Aviabel and making plan.

Our next question comes from Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks, and good morning and congrats on the print. Two quick questions, if I may. The
first question obviously is going back to the discussion on Novae. In the opening remarks,
you mentioned that the number was mid-90's CR and there was sort of room to improve
on that. Can you just sort of update us as to where do you think that number settles on a
normalized basis?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

As you know, we're not really keen on guidance, Amit, but the reason I feel confident that
that mid-90's accident year combined ratio has room to grow is twofold. The first is, as
Peter mentioned, we're less than halfway through the synergies associated with the
Novae acquisition, so by definition that should help.
The second issue is that, although we like a lot of what Novae had done, in fact what
attracted us to Novae in the first place was that they had already taken a lot of the tough
decisions to focus their book of business on areas where they were profitable. But the
truth is there were still some parts of that portfolio that continued to use some action.
And I know that over the last six months, since we've been in that company, there's a
bunch of business that we chose to non-renew. And you still don't see the benefits of that
portfolio improvement.
Just in the first quarter, we probably non-renewed willingly, probably somewhere
between $30 million and $50 million of business that we said you know what, going
forward this is not business that necessarily meets what we want to do. Again, you won't
see any of that reflected in the results for several quarters. So, I feel good that we're
doing the right things, that we're continuing to do the right things. And as these actions
work their way through the earned premiums and the expense lines, I have confidence
that we're going to see further improvement in the Novae and the London book results,
as by the way I expect in the overall book of AXIS.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. That's helpful. The only other question I have is I guess going back to Kai's question
on consolidation. Probably I'll try to ask it in a bit more direct manner. Your name has been
reported in the press and there, obviously, has been a lot of discussions in the investment
community based on VR and XL and other franchises. And clearly there has been
Page 16 of 22



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2018-04-26

exuberance in the stock price based on that investment chatter. Based on your response
to Kai, should the takeaway be that you are more focused on the integration and hence
it's premature to think that anything could happen, or how should I sort of string those two
comments together?

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, let me start with the policy that we don't – our policy is not to talk about rumors. Our
top policy is not to talk about hypotheticals, what could happen in the industry or not
happen in the industry. My response to Kai and my response to you is that we're focusing
on things that we can do and that we can control. And right now we're focused 100% on
the execution of our strategy because we think that will deliver significant benefits to our
customers, our employees, and our shareholders.

Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks. Good morning.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

So, Albert, you talked I think very reasonably about disappointing property catastrophe
rate increases, despite record or near-record catastrophe losses last year. So, if we don't
have the same sort of historical uptick post-events, is the line of business still worth the
volatility?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, that's an excellent question and frankly that's the reason you'll notice that our net cat
premium has actually declined over the last five years. Cat is still an important component
of risk management for our customers on the reinsurance side. And I think it makes sense
that this should be an important component of our offering. As you know, many customers
continue to want to have cat protection through their traditional reinsurance program in
addition, of course, to taking advantage of alternative markets. And it's my belief that
customers are willing to pay a little bit more for the incremental benefit and service that
you get on reinsurance.
But net-net, I think that you will continue to see that our net cat exposure will decline if we
don't get the adequate compensation for it. But our strategy and it's our strategy that
Page 17 of 22



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2018-04-26

FINAL

we've put in place and executed now for quite some time is that we want to continue to
provide a full range of products and services to our customers. And then to the extent,
that it makes sense for us to partner with third-party capital and share those cat premiums
with our third-party capital partners, we will do so. It's a strategy that delivers fees in the
good years and that reduces the net losses in the bad years, and that's a policy that we
will continue to use.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. That's excellent. That's helpful. And second, I was hoping if you could talk a little bit
about net to gross ratios by line of business within insurance. In other words, whether
there are any changes in reinsurance purchasing by line of business?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

The short answer is, there always is, because every year we have an opportunity to
review the construct and consider attachment points, whether we're doing more quota
share, more excess, so on and so forth. I would say that, if you look at our numbers, we
have probably over the last two, three years increased our sessions in professional lines.
And so that's a pattern that's been there. I don't expect meaningful change to that
approach.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think that every year we look to optimize our property, the reinsurance purchases, and as
you know, we renew our property program including cat in early May. And so, we're
looking to optimize that structure, and we'll be reporting on that later on. But other than
that, we continue to maintain the patterns that we have in the past.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Is there anything you want to add to that? Hang on a second. Maybe Peter has something
that you want to add to that?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean the only thing I would add, Meyer, is we did actually buy some more
reinsurance in the cyber space. We actually have a really good quota share treaty that
actually Novae had on its cyber book. We had actually had a small quota share on our
book, and we actually have one more increase to our purchasing to help protect the cyber
book. We're a large player in cyber. We love the business. We think we're very good at it
and we've got a Cyber Center of Excellence. But in order to protect the unknown
unknowns, we've upped that quota share on our book as well. So you would have seen
some increased sessions coming out of the insurance side due to that new treaty. And we
feel good about it. It's a good treaty, good ceding commission and a good profit
commission if the business performs well.

Right. And to your earlier point, Meyer, our cat premiums we're increasing the sessions of
cat premiums this year. And you'll recall I mentioned earlier, in this year we're ceding
about half of our cat premium. That number was closer to 42% last year.

And our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hey, thanks. A couple quick ones here for you. First one, just curious on the investment
income and fixed income that you had in the quarter, given where we are right now with
current rates, should we expect that to start ramping up here going forward? Anything
you're doing with the invest portfolio to maybe take advantage of the higher interest rate
activity?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Well, Brian, a couple of things is just to give you a couple of points, I know this is always a
question, but the book yield at the end of the first quarter was 2.7% and that was up from
2.5% at the end of 2017, and our current new money yield is 3.2%. So that's considerably
above where our current book yield is. The other thing I'd point out is, we do have about
15% of our fixed income portfolio in floaters. So as rates tick up, we should be able to gain
that advantage a little bit quicker.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. And then any thoughts about kind of cash deployment stuff in the balance sheet or
with ADC I guess you've got cash flows going out here soon?

We can see – we've got finish – we'll finish that up in the second quarter with some cash,
but you may not see that totally come through in cash because we've actually been –
actually working with the reinsure to transfer securities across, which wouldn't show up in
cash flow. But we do have some cash there and we are keeping our eye on the timing of
the payments, we setup the reserves are up for the cat – for the 2017 cats.

Q - Brian Meredith

How much is that going to be from a cash perspective?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

With this year, if I think about that, I don't quite have a timing on that. I can tell you that the
total reserves at the end of the quarter for the cats as I mentioned they did come down a
little bit from where we were, but we were at about mid-700s in reserves for the cats of
2017.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. And then, Albert, I guess for you. Let's kind of turn around the whole M&A topic
we've had so far and maybe ask you what opportunities, not so much from buying
companies, but what opportunities you anticipate there may be in the marketplace for
you that have you seen any from some of the consolidation activity we've seen so far this
year?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, the issue is that whenever there's any kind of turmoil in any organization whether
that turmoil comes from M&A or anything else, there's always an opportunity to attract
talent or an opportunity to attract new pieces of business, because brokers would rather
deal with different people. And to that extent, you've seen this of course, I mean we
continue to be recruiting top quality talent. And we're looking at a couple of opportunities
right now that where brokers are thinking, we might want to move this, we might want to
move that because that that's the everyday job of our business is to try to take advantage
of those things. So we'll continue doing that.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. And just last question, can you just remind us, when you say you want capital levels
of return to kind of pre-hurricane levels before you look at buying back stock again. How
do you define that? Is it getting debt to capital ratios, is that back down getting
shareholders' equity or common equity up to the level prior to the hurricanes?

FINAL

Yeah, I think it's all those, look we said upfront that we have. So if you look at our numbers
and Peter you can jump in here. But our current leverage numbers are higher than our
target leverage numbers and there's two reasons for that. One is obviously that we took
a dip in the equity last year because of the cat losses and again at the very least we'd like
our equity numbers to be where they were prior to that. But more importantly, we've also
pre-funded the 2019 maturity and we fully expect and in fact we said so in the offering,
we fully expect that we will repay that in spring, is it of 2019?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yes. Spring of 2019.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

So you know so those things are going to get us back to a total leverage level, which is
below 30%, which is where we want to be, an equity above where it was. I have to tell
you, if we continue to see the kind of progress that we're seeing our book and in pricing,
you know, we're always going to get priority of the profitable growth.

Our next question comes from James Naklicki with Citi. Please go ahead.

Q - James Naklicki

{BIO 15041200 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks. My question is on the current accident year loss ratio. What was the
favorable impact of rate and trend during the quarter? I know you quantify that last year.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yeah, so as I mentioned, the only place, in most places the rate and trend is almost zero.
The place where it really change was in the UK motor, where we're now getting the
earnings increases above the trend, because it's frankly we're playing catch-up. Other
than that, I would say on any one line of business, you would have been no more than plus
0.2 or minus 0.2 on the ratio, is that correct?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah. I'd say in total year-over-year James, it's about 0.5 point in total and that 0.5 point is
really fundamentally driven by the changes we've got on the motor book, absent the
motor book, it would be right about where Albert said.

Q - James Naklicki
