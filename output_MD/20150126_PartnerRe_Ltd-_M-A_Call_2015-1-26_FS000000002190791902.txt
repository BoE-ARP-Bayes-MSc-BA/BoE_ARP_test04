I will remind everyone that the statements made during this call, including the questionand-answer session, which are not historical facts may be forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements
which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about PartnerRE and AXIS may
include projections of their respective future financial performance, their respective
anticipated growth strategies and anticipated trends in their respective businesses.

These statements are only predictions based on current expectations and projections
about future events. There are important factors that could cause actual results, level of
activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements,
including the risk factors set forth in PartnerRe's and AXIS' most recent reports on Form
10-K, Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC and the following factors:
Failure to obtain the approval of shareholders of PartnerRe or AXIS in connection with the
proposed transaction; the failure to consummate or delay in consummating the proposed
transaction for other reasons; the timing to consummate the proposed transaction; the
risk that a condition to closing of the proposed transaction may not be satisfied; the risk
that a regulatory approval that may be required for the proposed transaction is delayed,
is not obtained, or is obtained subject to the conditions that are not anticipated; AXIS' or
PartnerRe's ability to achieve the synergies and value creation contemplated by the
proposed transaction; the ability of either PartnerRe or AXIS to effectively integrate their
businesses; and the diversion of management time on transaction-related issues.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jean-Paul Montupet.

Jean-Paul L. Montupet

{BIO 1453648 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Rick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
As Rick said, I'm pleased to be here today with Michael Butt, Albert Benchimol, David
Zwiener and Bill Babcock and Joe Henry.
We are all extremely excited about the truly compelling transaction we announced
yesterday and I'm very pleased to be here this morning to share the details with you and
answer your questions. The simple fact is that the combination of PartnerRe and AXIS puts
together two extremely strong successful organizations, and the combined entity will be
Page 2 of 23

FINAL

one of the world's preeminent specialty insurance and reinsurance companies. We will
have a top five market position among reinsurers and a leading position among brokerbased reinsurers. We'll have a significant specialty insurance platform with compelling
growth prospects across the diversified area of product lines and a strong and growing
Life, Accident, and Health franchise.
As you are well aware, in the current competitive market, size, scale and breadth are
more important than ever. Although both PartnerRe and AXIS are well positioned on their
own, we believe that we will be better positioned to compete and excel in this evolving
new global marketplace as a combined entity. In many respects, the transaction
accelerates this company's strategy. For PartnerRe, it strengthens our reinsurance
franchise and gives us low-risk entry into the primary insurance market as well as Life. For
AXIS, this combination elevates its reinsurance business and enables incremental growth
in insurance in Accident, and Health.

Bloomberg Transcript

The financial resources of the combined company will allow us to reach new customers
and invest in strategically important growth areas. And the transaction is financially
compelling, being meaningfully accretive to both earnings per share and return on equity
for both companies, we are expected to have strong cash flows and capital efficiencies to
reinvest in its specialty franchises and grow businesses and to return capital to
shareholders. This is a unique fit. The two companies mesh well together from a business
and financial standpoint, but also from a cultural perspective.
Albert Benchimol has spent many years at PartnerRe, and the management teams know
each other well and respect each other immensely. There is a tremendous talent on
boards and management teams of both these companies and the combined entity will
have a deep bench of smart people making right decisions as the companies turn the
page on a new chapter.
As we indicated in our press release, in connection with the transaction, Costas Miranthis
stepped down as PartnerRe CEO yesterday. I want to stress the sincere thanks that I and
the entire board express to Costas for the exceptional job he has done as CEO. Under his
leadership, PartnerRe has enjoyed tremendous success and some of the strongest results
in our history. The facts are very straightforward here. Once both boards had determined
that Albert will be the CEO of the combined organization, we, along with Costas, felt that
it made sense for Costas to step down. We wish him well in his next endeavor.
Without question, we have an extremely capable management team in place as we drive
towards the close of the merger. Our board member, David Zwiener, has been appointed
Interim CEO of PartnerRe and will guide our company to the completion of the merger.
David has a wealth of experience in managing large financial services organization, and he
is extremely well prepared to step into this role.
So, with this quick overview, I'll now turn the call to Michael Butt. Albert will give you the
specifics on which this is such compelling transaction for both companies, and then David
will say a few words. So, Michael?

Michael A. Butt

{BIO 1497141 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Jean-Paul, and thank you all for joining us this morning. It's certainly
my great pleasure to be here today to discuss this transformative combination. As the
AXIS board, we've always been intently focused on addressing the challenges of today's
evolving markets and creating value for our shareholders. This merger is a tremendous
opportunity for both our companies and one which will benefit our clients, our brokers, our
shareholders and our employees.
Over the last 20 years, I've competed with and greatly admired what PartnerRe has
achieved and the great franchise it has built in the reinsurance business. These two
companies complement each other. And by leveraging their individual strengths, we'll
create a global leader in specialty, insurance and reinsurance with the resources, size,
products and strategic flexibility to maximize various opportunities and to overcome any
challenges in the current market. As the Chairman Emeritus, I am very much looking
forward to serving the combined company and working with our talented group of
leaders from both of these great organizations.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Albert who will discuss the transaction specifics.
Albert?

Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. First, let me join Jean-Paul and Michael
in expressing my excitement about this transformative combination we announced last
night. This is truly a merger of equals and represents a tremendous opportunity for our
two strong companies to get stronger and better together. We're really looking forward
to getting to work.
Now, I'd like to walk you through some of the structural aspects of this merger on slide six.
This 100% stock merger of equals is structured as an amalgamation and will create a
combined company with a pro forma market capitalization of approximately $11 billion. Per
the terms of the agreement, AXIS shareholders will receive one common share, and
PartnerRe shareholders will receive 2.18 common shares in the amalgamated company for
each share they own. Following the close of the transaction, PartnerRe shareholders will
own approximately 51.6% of the amalgamated company, while AXIS shareholders will own
approximately 48.4%.
The combined companies' board of directors will have 14 members, consisting of seven
AXIS appointees and seven PartnerRe appointees. And as described in the press release,
Jean-Paul will serve as the non-executive Chairman, and Michael will continue to serve as
Chairman Emeritus. I've worked with both Chairmans over the last several years, and I'm
looking very much forward to doing so again. We expect the transaction to close in the
second half of 2015, pending shareholder approval and customary regulatory approvals.
We believe that we have some of the strongest people in the industry, and as you can
see on slide seven, the new management team of the combined companies certainly
leverages the deep talent in both organizations. This is a team with whom I'm very

Page 4 of 23



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2015-01-26

familiar. It's also a team with a deep and complementary skill set that will work very well
together.

FINAL

On slide eight, this combination brings together two independently strong companies
with a shared focus and similar strengths. The new company will build on the independent
track records of excellent value creation, underpinned by underwriting excellence,
outstanding service and financial strength underscored by prudent reserving.
On slide nine, you can see that the strategic rationale is highly compelling. The
combination of our businesses with nearly $11 billion in total gross premiums provide
substantial strategic and marketplace benefits to our company. Upon completion of the
merger, P&C reinsurance will comprise about 62% of our business, insurance
approximately 24%, and Life, Accident and Health will represent 14%. The two reinsurance
businesses combine to form an impressive $7 billion global P&C reinsurance business, the
fifth largest P&C reinsurer, and a leading broker based reinsurer. The AXIS Insurance
business combined with PartnerRe's insurance Direct and Facultative operations will
exceed $2.6 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, the addition of AXIS Accident & Health operations to PartnerRe's Life and Health
units, create a meaningful $1.5 billion Life, Accident and Health business with a scale to
succeed. Our three major businesses will provide balance and diversification to growth
and earnings, as well as enhance capital efficiencies.
Moving on to slide 10, you can see that our merged company will be a global leader with
complementary geographic footprints and business segment coverage with operations
around the world, including North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Latin
America, the Caribbean, and Africa. As you might expect from established international
companies, we have overlapping offices in most key insurance centers and major markets.
We view this as an opportunity for savings without sacrificing critical local presence.
This combination significantly enhances our market position in reinsurance. As you can see
on slide 11, we will become a top five global reinsurer and a leading broker market
reinsurer. This increased relevance is particularly important against the backdrop of
consolidation in reinsurance buying. The merged companies will deliver leading positions
in specialty reinsurance lines. Both of our companies already have very highly regarded
underwriting capabilities and the manageable overlap in current portfolios should result in
reasonably modest attrition in the near term, which we expect we will fully recover over
time, given our enhanced market presence. We're looking forward to leveraging our
combined capabilities and strengths to channel third-party capital to deliver even more
solutions to our client base.
As you'll see on slide 12, the AXIS Insurance global specialty insurance platforms,
combined with PartnerRe's Direct and Facultative and wholesale insurance business, form
a business of $2.6 billion of combined premium, with very little business overlap in the
existing books. Our global insurance business will boast a balanced portfolio mix with a
strong focus on specialty lines and the potential to accelerate growth in desirable
segments as opportunities arise. There is no doubt in my mind that with our combined

Page 5 of 23

Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2015-01-26

FINAL

capital of $14 billion, greater visibility and resources and combined earnings power, we can
accelerate profitable growth in specialty insurance, both organically and through intelligent
acquisitions.
On slide 13, we turn to the Life, A&H operations, and you can see that the proposed
merger will have strategic impact for the combined Life, Accident and Health businesses
of our companies, both of whom have delivered very high growth in recent years. The
businesses are very complementary, with limited products and market overlap. PartnerRe
provides leadership in life and the certain U.S. health reinsurance, and AXIS is a leader in
accident, special risk, and U.S. Health. Our global reach would be expanded with AXIS's
strong presence in the U.S., London, UK, the Middle East, while PartnerRe is very strong in
the U.S. and on the continent.

Bloomberg Transcript

Additionally, we both have plans for growth in the Middle East, Latin America and Asia,
which would be accelerated and benefit from this merger. We expect that the combined
companies will be a top three competitor in the U.S. A&H market. And the integration of
both of our companies' product portfolios under the leadership of Chris DiSipio will be a
serious competitor to the large legacy global writers.
As you can see on slide 14, the merged companies will have a very strong balance sheet
with the potential to achieve significant capital synergies. We will have cash and
investments of $33 billion, shareholders' equity of nearly $13 billion and total capitalization
of over $14 billion, and a very manageable financial leverage of 22.4% including perpetual
preferred stock and senior debt. We will have one of the strongest balance sheets in the
industry with a high quality liquid investment portfolio and prudent reserves. So that is the
overview of the structure of the combined company and should hopefully give you a
better understanding of what our new combined company will look like and why we are so
excited about this transaction.
We see tremendous opportunity to create value through this combination. As you will see
on slide 16 – 15 I mean, with the increased scale, efficiencies and expanded product
capabilities, we anticipate sustainable long-term commercial growth prospects over and
above what they would have been for each of our independent companies. Our
combined company will be ideally positioned to compete and to win in the global market.
And as I've said before, we also see meaningful capital synergies that will generate
further flexibility to support growth and capital management initiatives.
Further, we're projecting at least $200 million in annual pre-tax cost synergies expected to
be realized within the first 18 months of operations. These are identifiable, concrete and
actionable. Both companies truly believe that the target integration savings are highly
achievable. It's been said before but it's true, this is a transformational merger. We're
bringing together two independently strong and well-established companies to create
one broadly diversified global specialty insurance and reinsurance company whose scale,
capital and enhanced market presence will form a powerhouse within the industry. I could
not be more thrilled to be part of a great team on this exciting road ahead of us.

David K. Zwiener

{BIO 1494662 <GO>}

Thank you, Albert. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I just had a few
comments before we open it up for questions. But I want to start by reiterating how
excited all of us are at PartnerRe to be merging with AXIS.
Speaking on behalf of the entire board, I can tell you that we have long admired the
organization and we're looking forward to working with their team and I personally am
looking forward to working with Albert again. I'll also say that I'm looking forward to
jumping into my new role as Interim CEO at PartnerRe. I have an understanding of and an
appreciation for the PartnerRe team and culture, and I'm really looking forward to working
more closely with some of the most talented people in our industry.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll wrap up with some comments on the financial implications and then we'll get to your
questions and I'll pick it up on page 16. As mentioned earlier, in addition to clear strategic
benefits, this transaction is financially very compelling. It will be accretive to EPS and ROE
in a very meaningful way. And importantly, we see execution risk as being very limited in
this transaction. When you combine two strong companies with solid financial profiles,
respected brands and talented leadership teams on both sides, they're already very
familiar with each other, it's about as good as it can be.
So in conclusion, turning to slide 17, what we're doing is building on strength to get even
stronger. This merger is a compelling opportunity to enhance our scale and also squarely
addresses the strategic imperatives that today's markets are demanding. We're not
changing our strategies; we're just accelerating them. And as we discussed, the financial
benefits are apparent. We believe we share a common vision for growth and risk
management and have some of the best talent in the industry. We believe this transaction
creates real growth opportunities and will have a significant positive impact on our
shareholders, our employees and our policyholders. We expect that you'll share our
enthusiasm.
Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?

Q&A
Operator
Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first
question comes from Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.

Q - Dan Farrell

{BIO 4935961 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you and good morning. Albert, a question for you with regard to stuff on AXIS
specifically. You've talked a lot about levers to improve AXIS's combined ratio on its own.
Page 7 of 23



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2015-01-26

I'm wondering when we look at the $200 million or at least $200 million of expense
synergies, how much of that might be exclusive or specific to the combination or is any of
the improvement that you've articulated in the past specifically for AXIS incorporated in
that? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That's a great question. The one thing that I want to go through here is the savings that
we've identified here are savings related to this merger. And I think probably it makes
sense to refresh the Street with what we were looking to achieve in our combined ratio
improvement program. Joe, would you want to take us through that, please?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. Good morning, Dan. So, if you remember, there were four things that we were
focused on to improve shareholder value. The first was the quality of the loss ratio.
Second was profitable growth. The third was expense ratio reduction, and the fourth was
optimal capital structure.
So, as far as each of those are concerned, on the profitable growth side, this is going to
help us with the maturity of our new initiatives: accident and health, new professional
lines, primary casualty and agriculture. So, this merger will give us an additional
ammunition to accelerate that, specifically accident and health and agriculture, for
example, and it also will not distract our insurance initiatives, which will help them grow.
Second, quality of the loss ratio. AXIS was investing, Dan, as you know in actuarial and
other talent to improve the use of data and analytics. Partner has even more actuarial
resources than we do. So, this will accelerate that part of the strategy.
Operational effectiveness, we had plans to bring our G&A expense ratio down from the
mid-15%s to 14% or below by 2017. We obviously are continuing with those efforts, but
through this process, working arm in arm with Partner, we feel we can achieve expense
efficiencies of at least $200 million, possibly more. And finally, as far as optimal capital
structure, the combined companies will have a very strong capital position. And while we
will suspend share repurchases until closing, we will be in a position to grow our business,
return excess capital to investors and/or have capital to pursue alternative investment
opportunities.

Q - Dan Farrell

{BIO 4935961 <GO>}

Thanks. That's very helpful, and congrats on the announcement.

Page 8 of 23

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. First question, if you can elaborate a little
more about basically how they come together with the deal? Are they each looking for
partners or there is other reason behind it?

FINAL

A - Jean-Paul L. Montupet

{BIO 1453648 <GO>}

Well, I will respond – Jean-Paul Montupet here. I will respond from the standpoint of
PartnerRe. As we are looking at our strategic opportunities, we were looking at two things.
We were looking at the trend towards consolidation in reinsurance particularly in Bermuda
and we were also looking at opportunities for us as a pure-play reinsurer to get into the
primary market.
And when you look at this transaction, you realize very quickly that it ticks the two boxes
for us. We participate in a very significant reinsurance consolidation that will be extremely
beneficial and we get into the primary business. If you add to that the fact that the two
companies know each other extremely well, are about the same size and are valued by
the market in a very similar way resulting in a very doable deal, frankly, you cannot think of
a better opportunity or better combination.
I agree with that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's great. Thank you. And Albert, for you. You have been leading AXIS for some time
and you've been at PartnerRe even longer than that. So what's your strategic vision for the
combined entity and what would you do differently?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

The vision is that we now have an opportunity to create a global powerhouse with very,
very strong market presence in three very, very good balanced, diversifying businesses. In
this business, if you want to be able to influence the market, if you want to be able to do
more for your clients, you absolutely need to have the right resources, the right talent,
you have to be able to invest in product development, in analytics, and as an industry
leader, we will be able to do all of that.
As you know, from the various conversations that we've had in the past, it's always been
very important to me that we have balance and diversification in our portfolio, and we
already had at AXIS three very good businesses, and we've shared with you our
satisfaction with their growth rates. And it's probably imperative that I say here, I don't
believe that either PartnerRe nor AXIS needed to do an acquisition or a merger or any
kind of transaction to continue down their path. But every once in a while there's an
opportunity that presents itself that just is so compelling that you've got to pursue it.
From our perspective, when we were doing strategic discussions with our board, we were
looking, of course, at a lot of potential combinations and you analyze all of those. But what
drove me here is that I'm not particularly interested in nondescript premium. Anybody can
Page 9 of 23

Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2015-01-26

FINAL

buy $1 billion of premium here or a $1 billion of premium there. If you want to be a global
leader, what you need are leading franchises. And what this combination does is it actually
promotes the growth of global leading franchises.
At AXIS, we had a top 15 reinsurer, and the creation of this company now gives us a top 5
global reinsurer and the leading broker reinsurer in the world. We're able to take our very,
very fast-growing A&H initiative that we've been so proud of and overnight turn it into a
$1.5 billion life, accident and health business. And while we have a very good, very strong
in specialty insurance operation, we can add to that with the P&C premiums that
PartnerRe writes, and have three very meaningful businesses. When you add to that the
earnings power, the cash flow, the visibility and the capital efficiencies available, we will
have a very strong budget to invest in growth, make acquisitions where it makes sense,
and return capital to our shareholders. I can't think of a better combination.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's great. Very thorough. Lastly, if I may, just a quick number question. Do you have
estimates for the restructuring cost to achieve the $200 million synergy?

A - William R. Babcock

{BIO 15310119 <GO>}

Hi, Kai. It's Bill. It's a little early in the process to estimate that with any precision and we
will give you a number at some point. But generally, with these types of transactions you
should think about 1 to 1.25 times the run rate savings.

Thank you. And the next question comes from Amit Kumar with Macquarie.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Thanks, and good morning, and congrats on the announcement. I wanted to go back to
Dan Farrell's question and get some clarity. So if I understand this correctly, are you saying
that expense ratio and other initiatives we've talked about on the past few AXIS
conference calls, is that included in this $200 million or is that excluded? I just want to get
some understanding on that.

Page 10 of 23

Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2015-01-26

A - David K. Zwiener

{BIO 1494662 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Let me go back to it. I think, in reading some of the reports, I was getting the
impression that when people were looking at the improvements in the combined ratio,
they were thinking that it was coming only from expense cuts and that might lead to some
misunderstanding.
The vast majority of the improvement in the combined ratio that we were looking for and
the plans that we were discussing with you last year were fundamentally with regards to
the balance of the portfolio, the analytics, the growth of existing businesses. And as you
know, if you grow existing businesses, you can grow expenses and still improve your
expense ratio. So, there were clearly certain expense ratio initiatives within that four
points to five points improvement plan, but the vast majority of it was driven by
improvements in the loss ratio.
Now if you look at our two businesses, the truth is there's truly overlap only in the
reinsurance space and the corporate space. And we believe that the benefits that we've
identified for you in the $200 million are substantially supported by the benefits of this
transaction. And that doesn't mean that we will not continue to invest in better efficiencies
within our insurance operations and elsewhere, but when we look at the incremental
benefits of this transaction, we believe that we can find $200 million of benefits from this
transaction.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it. That's actually very helpful. The only other question I have is, I guess in the timeline
of 18 months and will these cost saves be sort of front-loaded, i.e., will we see them in
2015 or would that be – how should we think about the timeline on the cost saves?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Look, we're not expecting to close this thing until probably the second half or maybe even
the third quarter of this year. So, I think if we close this year, what you'll very likely see is a
lot of PGAAP adjustment and consolidation so that we can start with a clean company in
2016. And whereas we can identify some savings, we cannot do anything until we in fact
combine the companies.
And as you can expect, there are some things that we may be able to do immediately,
but as we reduce staff, close offices, these things take a little bit of time to roll in. So, I
think the way we would think about it, we expect to see maybe half of the savings or a
little bit more than that in the first full year of operation. And by the second full year of
operation, we would expect to see all of the savings rolling through.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it. That is extremely helpful. That's all I have. Thanks for the answers.

Thank you. And the next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.

FINAL

Q - Jay H. Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thanks. First on sizing the potential for EPS and ROE accretion, it will be extremely helpful
if you could put some parameters around that. Thanks.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

The easiest thing to look at is this. As Jean-Paul said, we are two essentially equal
companies in terms of size and capital and valuation, and each of you have made some
independent evaluation of what our profitability should be. We've just told you that we're
about to each get in the aggregate $200 million of savings; each of our shareholder base
will be getting very close to half of that 51.6%, 48.4%.
So think about the fact that each of our shareholders is going to get the benefit of about
$100 million a piece on a pre-tax basis of savings over and above whatever it is that you
were estimating for each one of us.

I can tell you that on the AXIS side we have close to 100 million shares outstanding, and
so you can very easily estimate some of potential on the savings. And none of this EPS
accretion that I've just identified for you speaks to the capital efficiency that we can obtain
so that we can improve our ROE and, in my mind, significant incremental growth
opportunities that derives from putting these two great companies together.

Q - Jay H. Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Okay. That's a good starting point. The other question I've been getting is with the
amalgamation structure, the exit value for both companies is only one times tangible
book. So why do you feel investors should support a transaction with no premium?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I really appreciate what you just said. And you said the exit value for these companies.
There's no exit here. This is building something great. This is not a sale. We're not buying
them. They're not buying us. We are both, each of us contributing our operation, our
potential and our tangible book value to create what we believe will be one of the
preeminent insurance and reinsurance companies. And to the extent that our
shareholders were happy to hold either PartnerRe or AXIS as a standalone basis, I would
have difficulty in understanding why they wouldn't be ecstatic in owning the combined
entity.

Q - Jay H. Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Okay. My final question is, is there anything to prevent another bidder coming in with a
potentially higher valuation for either AXIS or Partner?

Thank you. And the next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore ISI.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, good morning. Sorry to beat a dead horse but just wanted to be sure. So for the $200
million in cost savings, I mean my sense is that most of it is from the deal. But that some
of it might also have been contemplated by AXIS before. Is that correct?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Look, when we were looking at – we communicated with you that one of the things that
we were looking to do was to transform our IT operations into a much more efficient
outsourced operation. There's no question that now we're going to be combining our IT
operation with their IT operations. Some of the savings that we thought would happen are
no longer available to us but new savings are also available.
So it's hard to say that they're 100% additive, but what we can tell you is we still have
opportunities for cost saves in other parts of our company. But when we sat down during
due diligence, it was really about what is it that we can do with regard to our overlapping
operation that we can have cost saves.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. Fair enough. The second piece is on lost business. I mean, historically, these
transactions maybe generate maybe about 10%, maybe still little higher of lost
reinsurance business. I mean is that the right ballpark that you guys were thinking about
when you were looking at the merger?

Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td

I think the way to look at it is there will certainly be some loss of business where both AXIS
and PartnerRe were very successful at garnering leading market shares with certain of our
clients and there maybe, in fact, one or two areas where we believe that we would prefer
a slightly smaller allocation. But again, I'll go back to the logic behind this transaction. To
the extent that clients were happy to do business with each one of us, they should be
happy to do business with the combined entity because we're keeping the talent and
we're keeping the capital to make this work. That said, certainly, there will be some
business lost. On the other hand, we also need to consider what kind of incremental
business we will get as a result of our improved positioning.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure.

A - Jean-Paul L. Montupet

{BIO 1453648 <GO>}

And just...

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Yes, sorry, go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jean-Paul L. Montupet

{BIO 1453648 <GO>}

I would add that the way you should look at this is that the cost reductions are very real
and will continue forever. We expect maybe a little bit of reduction in the reinsurance total
premiums but those will be offset by all the upside that we have as a result of the
synergies coming from the combination of the two companies. So you cannot put the
same in the same bucket. They are two very different things.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. Fair enough. And the last question was on the capital synergies. My sense with AXIS
was that you have a primary insurance operation, a reinsurance operation, so fairly well
diversified. PartnerRe, on the other hand, was an extremely well-diversified reinsurer; of
course, didn't have any primary insurance operations. So, I'm struggling here a little bit
with trying to figure how much of capital synergies this transaction will generate.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Our estimate is that it will, in fact, generate substantial synergies. So, if you look at our
position, we're not yet getting the full benefits of having a meaningful accident and health
operation. And so just the fact that from our perspective if you simply added the growing
A&H book, you'd get some efficiencies there.
From the PartnerRe perspective, it's a diversified book, but they had no access to the
insurance market or to some of our A&H business. So, both of our companies are, in fact,
adding diversifying risk to their initial portfolios. But even within the reinsurance portfolios,
we don't have a direct overlap between PartnerRe and AXIS and there are significant
benefits in putting together the cat book also. So, we think there are several sources of

Page 14 of 23



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2015-01-26

diversification benefit, both within the reinsurance business but also when you put the
three businesses together, the better balance between those three businesses.

Q - Vinay Misquith

So, do you have a number that you can share with us?

Okay. Thank you. And the next question comes from Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good morning. I would love to hear a little bit how you came to the proportion that
would be owned by PartnerRe shareholders versus AXIS shareholders. As I calculate it,
PartnerRe is contributing more of the tangible equity and earnings power than the
proportion they're getting in the company. Is that correct?

A - David K. Zwiener

{BIO 1494662 <GO>}

Well, if we look at the history here, as I mentioned, both of our companies, at least in the
last several months, have traded reasonably close to tangible book value. There's always
going to be a little bit of volatility in the stock price and a little bit of volatility in the ratios
between the two organizations. But if you look at it, right now, in the recent past, it's close
to tangible book value. And then when you look at the tangible book value that we both
bring to the organization, I believe that the calculation that we achieved is consistent with
the relative fit of tangible book value of the two companies over the recent past. Did you
want to add to that?

A - Jean-Paul L. Montupet

{BIO 1453648 <GO>}

That's exactly right. As I said earlier, the two companies are valued about the same way
and at about the same multiple of tangible book and that's pretty much what's reflected
in our exchange ratio.

A - David K. Zwiener

{BIO 1494662 <GO>}

Correct.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And then historically, Partner's earnings have been heavily weighted towards prior year
favorable reserve development, which has benefited also AXIS's earnings, while AXIS has

FINAL

made more money on the current accident years. This suggests to me, maybe other
investors, that historically PartnerRe's reserves have a potential to be extremely
redundant. Albert, you used to be the CFO of PartnerRe. You know how they think about
it. Is there any benefit in the valuation gain, potential for the reserves at one of the
companies to have a different philosophy that might enable it to be contributing shadow
equity into the equation?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, the way that I would say is that there is a lot of commonality in management and
philosophy and thinking. Both PartnerRe and AXIS have demonstrated over a long period
of time very prudent reserving and a desire to release reserves when it makes sense to
do so and not before that. I've got to tell you that I believe that is one of the
underpinnings of that financial stability of being able to survive through cycles and take
advantage of opportunities and that philosophy will not change.
And I will go back and say that – repeat what Jean-Paul said, we were both bringing in all
of our value and all of our assets and all of our ideas and talents into this organization.
And I dare say that PartnerRe has very prudent reserves and I would argue that AXIS has
very prudent reserves. And so, therefore, both of us again have put what we have into
this company. And this company is a unique combination of organizations with very strong
balance sheets, very prudent reserves and complementary businesses. I don't think that
you could find a better fit anywhere right now.

And I'll just ask what the next steps are for shareholder approval, timing and what's
required and then I'll pass the phone to the next questioner.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, this is a standard amalgamation and merger of equals. We will be working with our
lawyers to prepare proxy documents to get a shareholder vote. We will be working to file
various regulatory approvals. It is my hope that either late spring or early summer our
documentation will be ready, so that we can have that shareholder vote. And at that point,
we would simply be awaiting the various regulatory approvals to consummate the merger
and close, which we would hope would be some time in the third quarter. It could drag a
little bit into the fourth, but certainly our intention and expectation is that this would be a
2015 event and we look forward to start in 2016 as a combined company with all of the
strengths and benefits that we discussed with you.

FINAL

Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Thank you. Yes, Albert, just quickly here. So, as an AXIS shareholder, basically, we're
making a bigger bet on reinsurance now going forward. So, I guess, my question is, why
should we be comfortable with that given it's a business where we've seen returns
compressing, the whole reinsurance pie has been shrinking. Can you just give us more
comfort as to why that should be the strategy here?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Brian, that's a very good question and I'm very grateful in fact that you raised it. If you look
at AXIS today, our shareholders have approximately 50% of their capital and revenues
coming in from P&C reinsurance. However, that 50% of the capital that they have is in a $2
billion top-15 reinsurer. In the combined company, our shareholders will have 62%, so not a
meaningful increase in terms of the amount of business in the P&C side, but now that
62% is not in a top-15 reinsurer but in a top-5 reinsurer and the leading broker distributed
reinsurer in the world.
In addition to that, we will be getting significant efficiencies here. And as you know with
what's happening in the industry, to succeed in the reinsurance world, you have to have
scale, you have to have products, but you also have to be very efficient from a cost
perspective. And so, again, you're getting a broader, better positioned reinsurer, and
you're going to get one that's going to have a better chance of succeeding in this
environment.
And finally, I would say that whereas today 62% of the premiums will come from P&C
reinsurance. As you've heard us say, it is our intention to continue to grow and invest the
insurance business and the Life, Accident and Health business. And so I would not be
surprised that, relatively quickly, we would find ourselves with the mix that is equivalent to
what we had previously at AXIS Re or, depending on the opportunities, a more optimal
mix that that made sense.
So, overall, we will be better prepared to win in the reinsurance space. We will have more
assets, more people, more cash flow, more capital availability to invest and grow the
specialty insurance in the Life and Health space. So, overall, I think that our shareholders
will be much better positioned with this company than they were before. And again, I'm
certainly not saying that we weren't a successful company with a bright future as a
standalone company, but the future is even brighter as a combined entity.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Thanks. And then just one quick follow-up here. So, it sounds like the merger will
probably close sometime in the third quarter. That's right in the heart of hurricane season.

I guess what your thoughts are and what are your plans to prevent a situation where
you've got concentrations of risk or something happens and we get something like a
PARIS RE, like it happened in (46:42)?

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think that's a very fair question, and as you might imagine, Brian, we spent a very, very
large amount of time making sure that we understood where the aggregations were and
so on and so forth. And I will tell you that without doing anything, the combined loss
curves of the combined company are actually as good, or not better than they were for
the individual companies. That said, we obviously will be spending some time over the
next several months looking at opportunities if necessary to buy some protection, to
hedge our portfolio and of course to take advantage of the very strong appetite in the
third party capital market to share some of these risks with our third party capital partners.
But, Brian, be assured we were very much aware of that issue as we did the due diligence
and structured this transaction.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. Albert, you talked not today, recently about the desire for
about $300 million of annual Accident and Health premiums to be sort of a scale that
could generate profitability. Does the creation of the combined Life, Accident and Health
unit mean that you're at scale now for that segment?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, the good news is that we were right on track with our independent Accident and
Health effort. That team has done a great job and we look forward to sharing details of
that when we have our earnings call next week. But there is no question that we now have
scale to be a meaningful player and to achieve – to be able to spread our expenses of
our broader base. So, yes, it does accelerate our efficiency targets for the Life, Accident
and Health space.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Q - Cliff H. Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

This is sort of an awkward question, but when I think about some of the big global
reinsurers out there relative to what PartnerRe and AXIS have been in the past; I think of
them as a bit – forgive its crudeness, but a bit clunky not very nimble; that you guys have
always been able to very quickly seize on market opportunities. When you think about the
combined entity, how do you structure the company to maintain some of that
nimbleness? Have you thought about the organizational structure of how the integration
will go?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, I don't particularly feel insulted because it wasn't us that you would accuse of being
clunky, so I'm okay with that. I think that, in fact, one of the benefits of what we have is the
culture that we bring to this business which is, in fact, a real desire to be proactive in the
market and to add to it. Cliff, I'm going to ask for a little patience from you. Obviously, the
senior management teams got together. We have some visions of what we want to
achieve here. But I think it would be premature to have a fixed idea of the entire structure
until we engage more of our teams and truly visualize what it is that we can achieve in
terms of the potential of this organization. We will be doing so in the days and weeks to
come, and we will be very pleased to share that with you as soon as we have a product
that we believe is shareable.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. Thanks, guys. I had a question from a strategic point of view from AXIS.
Did AXIS potentially look at doing a deal to get more into the primary insurance market?
Just wanted to see what the strategic options were.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Look, I'm not going to go and list all of the things that we looked at. But I can assure you
that our executive committee and our board has spent several months and several board
meetings discussing the pros and cons of different directions. And that's not to say that
there weren't some alternatives that had some benefits in one part or the other. But at
the end of the day, when we looked at what this merger of equals could achieve
compared to a number of other areas that we were looking at, this just came out as just
so compelling that it convinced both boards to move forward with this transaction.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then just the other question is again looking at some of the Schedule F,
it looks like there is a lot of overlap with some U.S. clients on the reinsurance side. I'm just
trying to figure out what kind of slippage there or kind of dissynergy should we be thinking
about going forward?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

So here's the good news is that we actually share a lot of clients. But in many areas, we're
actually not on the same treaties. And so to me, the reason that this is really good is
because what we're doing is we've got some very strong relationships on both of our
parts and we can leverage the strength of that relationship and we can actually have a
more balanced portfolio with each of these large accounts, which is why we feel very, very
positive about this.

Again, there will likely be some losses. There may be some areas where we've been so
successful as independent companies that we may have to step back. But by and large,
we think it's very manageable, and to repeat what Jean-Paul said earlier, any short-term
loss of business, we are confident will be easily recoverable with the enhanced market
presence, scale and talent that we will bring to the market.

Okay. Thank you. The next question comes from Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Could you tell us what you view as run rate ROE for the combined
entity and then also on book value, you mentioned there would be some PGAAP
adjustments, what is that pro forma book value per share?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think this is all information that we want to tie down and make sure that we have
properly. I believe a lot of that information will be made available to you in the proxy
documents. But I think fundamentally, again, one of the real benefits of this is each one of
us is bringing our tangible book value to the party. And I think you can very easily add the
tangible book value of each of the two companies.
You can take the standalone profits that you already assumed for us and you take the
benefits of these $200 million worth of synergies on a pre-GAAP tax basis, and although I
feel very optimistic about the market benefits and the growth that will be derived from
this, we're not providing guidance on that right now. So I think that the basics of the
analysis are relatively straightforward.
With regard to the PGAAP adjustments, obviously that is a work in process. But that does
not really affect the viability of this entity. PGAAP adjustments will run through the book
over a couple of years, and after that, we will still remain with one of the preeminent
insurance and reinsurance franchises in the world.

Q - Charles J. Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you. I guess I want to, Albert, follow-up on I guess a question Brian
Meredith had and just sort of conceptually I'm still having a little bit of trouble with the
reinsurance strategy given the things that are going on in the marketplace. I guess from a
PartnerRe perspective, I can understand the necessity of this transaction; but I guess from
Page 21 of 23



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2015-01-26

AXIS' perspective, I'm a little surprised at the seemingly doubling down into reinsurance
given all of the things that are going on unless it opens up greater opportunity for AXIS
ventures or other – the transition in reinsurance market.

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, you're absolutely right, but again, I take exception with doubling down. To the extent
that currently we have about 50% of our book of business in P&C reinsurance and we're
going to go to 62%, yes, there is incremental growth. But to me, there is a huge
difference between having half of your capital in the number 12 or 13 reinsurer in the world
and having a little bit more of your capital exposed in the top 5.
Our ability to succeed and take advantage of market disruption is much stronger as a
combined company than we would have with our current reinsurance business. So, I see it
really as increasing the likelihood of success in this industry. And again, if we could take a
couple of expense ratio points out of the reinsurance business in a competitive
environment, it just makes us so much more competitive in the reinsurance business.
And I'll go back to what I mentioned earlier. I'm very, very confident that within a very short
period of time, we'll find ourselves back to the same mix we had before or whatever is
appropriate at that time. But you also caught it right, I fully expect that we will be much
more active in managing our growth portfolio in partnership with third-party capital
providers.
