Presentation
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to today's Hannover Re International
conference call on interim results (technical difficulty). For your information, this conference
is being recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today Mr.
Ulrich Wallin, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.

Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Thank you. Yes. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for joining the
Hannover RE conference call. As usual, I'm joined by our CFO Roland Vogel and we are
pleased to present to you the figures for the first half-year 2016. With a net income of
EUR486 million, the business development in the first half-year supports the full-year
guidance. However, the Second Quarter on a standalone basis did not perform quite as
well as expected. In addition to a high level of large losses in the quarter, we also saw a
spike in the frequency of the underlying losses and some reserve increases on loss
reserves from previous years.

FINAL

As a result, the combined ratio for the quarter was 96.1%, somewhat higher than
expected. Despite the fact that the combined ratio benefited from reserve releases over
and above the level of the normally expected run of profit. Roland will dwell on this in
more detail.
In addition, the tax rate for the quarter and indeed the half-year has been a little higher
than normally because the majority of the losses from the Canadian wildfires impacted
the results of our P&C subsidiary in Bermuda.
The premium income developed much in line with expectation considering the soft P&C
reinsurance market with a slight reduction of the gross written premiums and some
modest growth of the net earned premiums. Despite the fact that we have paid EUR573
million in dividend to our shareholders, the Second Quarter saw the shareholders' equity
nonetheless increase by 4.4%. This to a large extent was due to the interest rates
dropping even further following the Brexit vote in the UK and thus boosting the unrealized
gains on the balance sheet. Naturally, this puts the ROE under some pressure but at 11.8%,
it still remains above the minimum target.

Bloomberg Transcript

Having already commented on the property and casualty reinsurance business, I would
like to add something on the life and health results for the first half-year. These results
have been quite solid. We have seen growth in particular from our UK longevity business
which more than offset the premiums lost from some larger single premium transactions
which we have not renewed. As a result, the premiums, both gross and net, saw some
growth.
The underlying earnings of the business have developed quite favorable. However, we
continue to see some negative claims experience from yearly renewable term business
from some older underwriting years of our US mortality business. We deal with this
problem by increasing rates where necessary and appropriate.
The results from our investments under management are fully in line with expectations
with an ROI of 2.9%. On this note, I will hand over to Roland our CFO who will explain the
figures to you in more detail.

Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Good morning, thank you, Ulrich. And as usual I will focus on the half-year figures and try
to keep my comments as brief as possible. However, I think in some cases further
explanations to the quarterly development might be useful this time. The slight decrease
in the top line is in line with our expectations for the full year especially in light of the
strong growth we recorded in the previous year. Net income increased favorably by 4.5%.
As already explained on the occasion of our Q1 conference call, the main reason for this
seemingly contradictory development is the change in unearned premium, the retention
actually only increased marginally.
Investment income in line with our expectation and excluding the EUR39 million positive
on; off effect in life and health reinsurance in Q1 2015, investment income from assets

under own management is on the level of the previous year, which can be seen I think as
a success in the current yield environment.

FINAL

Other income and expenses decreased mainly due to less positive effects -- currency
effects -- in the life and health reinsurance. However, we are still in positive territory here.
At 27.5% the tax ratio was slightly higher than in the previous year. Ulrich mentioned that
mainly due to a less positive result from our subsidiaries in Bermuda. Even if we assume
that large losses will exhaust the budget also by year-end, we expect that to level out to
some extent for the full year.
Shareholders' equity increased by 4.4% despite paying dividends of (EUR573 million)
(corrected by company after the call) in the Second Quarter. And on the right-hand side of
this slide you can see that especially the capital contribution from valuation reserves in our
investments increased by nearly EUR600 million as a result of interest rates declining
even further and thereby overcompensating the dividend payment.

Bloomberg Transcript

With realized gains only slightly above last year's, we did not harvest from such
extraordinary gains and this unforeseeable effects here in the first half. On the one hand,
of course improves the capital strength of the Company even more. On the other hand, it
had diluted the ROE by nearly 50 basis points. Of course, this development should also
have a positive effect on our already high solvency ratio going forward.
Cash flow continues to be very positive in the first half year. You might remember that
some EUR500 million received from the Chinese financial solution treaty inflated last
year's cash flow. And EUR300 million from that amount have now been forwarded to Re
concessionaires in the First Quarter of this yea hence depressing the formally reported
number for operating cash flow. Excluding this effect and as demonstrated on this slide,
cash flow for the first half of 2016 was again over and above EUR1 billion positive and with
that fully in line with expectations.
Assets under own management increased by 1% to a level close to EUR50 billion -EUR40 billion, sorry. Increased valuation reserves had a positive effect of around EUR850
million while there was a negative impact from the currency exchange rates effect on the
hand and that was around EUR550 million.
As a result of our strict margin-oriented underwriting approach, P&C gross premium
decreased by 5.6% on an FX-adjusted basis. Please bear in mind that we have been
growing strongly in 2015 and that the previous year's premium was additionally influenced
by a non-recurring effect associated with the accounting of our facultative business where
we booked almost EUR100 million in premium -- in additional premium last year.
Moreover, we scaled back our involvement in Chinese motor business as well as in our
specialty lines., particularly in aviation where rates no longer justify a continued
participation.
Nevertheless, net earned premium was stable on an FX adjusted basis as mentioned but
is not the result of a higher retention, which actually decreased slightly. But it is due to the
Page 3 of 27

FINAL

change in unearned premium driven by the strong growth in 2015.
As you all know, following a very benign First Quarter, the loss activity increased
remarkably at 9.2% of net premium income. The budget for the first half year was almost
entirely exhausted. And in the standalone Second Quarter we actually recorded the
highest net loss -- large loss expenditures for an individual quarter since the First Quarter
of 2011. The budget was therefore clearly exceeded on a standalone basis; however, this
was compensated for by the unused portion of the large loss budget from the First
Quarter.
Moreover, also the frequency of various smaller claims was higher than expected in
various lines of business around the world. This development was mitigated by an overall
higher-than-usual positive run-off result. Here we, on the one hand saw some negative
run-offs from single claims also but these were more than offset by positive reserve
developments, particularly in marine. Some cases developed very favorably and also the
expected ultimate loss ratios could be taken down.

Bloomberg Transcript

And as you will remember, the expected regular positive run-off result is around EUR50
million plus per quarter in the first half-year. This amount was exceeded by around EUR150
million and with that more than mitigating the negative developments I've mentioned
before.
Over the course of the year, of course, we do not have a fully-fledged reserve analysis
available. But we should expect that the positive run-off result has slightly affected the
confidence level of loss reserves downwards as compared to year-end 2015. We will
publish the final numbers of the reserve study for 2015 at the occasion of our Investors
Day in October as usual. But with the increase of redundant reserves we have
experienced by the end of 2015, it is fair to say that even with the potential reduction of
this year, we should still be remarkably above the level we had published last year. You
might remember these were EUR1.56 billion and again we should still be remarkably over
that number.
Ordinary investment income was in line with expectations. Total net investment income
decreased only slightly. I will explain the reason for this development when it comes to the
details of the investment income in a few minutes.
The tax rate increased compared to last year mainly as a result of less positive results
from Bermuda. As already mentioned, this should not come as a surprise considering the
significant cat losses in Q2. Altogether, with an EBIT margin of more than 14.6%, the P&C
segment performed still satisfactorily in the light of a still changing market environment.
As already mentioned, the large loss situation was exactly in line with budget for the first
half year even though the loss occurrence is distributed quite unevenly between the first
and the Second Quarter. The important message after the extraordinarily high large
losses in the Second Quarter is that our budget for the second half year of 2016, which
amounts to EUR472 million, is fully available, which is somewhat reassuring given that the
Atlantic hurricane season has just begun.

FINAL

After six months, 11 major losses are showing up on the large loss list. They include
significant events. Also on the nat cat as well as on the manmade side -- sorry. With a net
loss of EUR132 million, the wildfires in Canada were by far the largest loss in the first half
year and at our Q1 results we had already flagged the fact that Hannover RE has a
particularly high market share in Ecuador and accordingly the net loss from the earthquake
there is EUR57 million for our own account.
Looking at the overall numbers, it's good to see that our retrocession protection is
working well, resulting in a relief of around EUR140 million.
Looking at the technical profitability of our P&C book by lines of business, the combined
ratio in marine is, as already mentioned, outstanding. Here I already mentioned the
positive ru; off of reserves at roughly EUR50 million in total in the Second Quarter.
Combined with an overall favorable loss situation this led to this remarkable combined
ratio of just 12%.
So our business for North American in particular contributes favorably very -- or very
positively to our results. The cat XL combined ratio is now over and above the MtCR
having been especially hit hard by the wildfires in Canada.

Bloomberg Transcript

The earthquake loss in Ecuador on the other hand is mainly accounted under worldwide
treaty business hence explaining the rather high combined ratio in this segment.
Credit and surety was mainly affected by one large claim and it's still good to see that
with all these effects, the P&C portfolio as a whole remains to perform lower than
maximum tolerable combined ratio overall.
With currency-adjusted growth of 4.6% in the top line, development of our life and health
business is even a bit above expectations for the -- for the first half year. Q4 and -- Q3
and Q4 2015 have been particularly strong in last year. So this increase might be slightly
lower by the year-end.
The growth is mainly driven by continued demand in UK longevity. Net premium earned
increased remarkably by almost 10% adjusted for currency effects. The increased
retention is reflecting first and foremost, the reduced gross premium volume from a large
contract in Australia for which we had previously bought significant retrocession
protection.
Adjusted for the EUR39 million positive one-off effect in the previous year, the EBIT for
the first half-year 2016 would have increased compared to 2015 and, well, this is still in line
with our overall expectations for 2016.
Really already -- as Ulrich already mentioned the result from our US mortality business is
again somewhat below our expectation with mortality higher than anticipated. Apart from
that, the measures we had implemented with regards to a reduction in collateral costs

Page 5 of 27



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2016-08-04

FINAL

and in rate increases for selected underperforming treaties, well, these measures have
materialized as expected.
Our financial solution business continues to show excellent profitability with an EBIT
margin of more than 16%. Longevity is satisfactory with an EBIT margin slightly above the
2% target. And as explained, the somewhat unfavorable development in the US mortality
experience is the main reason for the miss in mortality and morbidity. Nevertheless, the
4.3% figure is still an improvement as compared to 2015.
Ordinary investment income also here was in line with our expectation. The net effect
from our ModCo derivative was a negative EUR1.6 billion -- million of course -- sorry million
-- in the first half year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking at the investments, the development is very satisfactory. Investment income
exactly in line with our expectation. A decrease in ordinary investment income is due to
the last year's one-off effect from the termination fee in life and health. Realization, I
mentioned that before, only slightly above last year's level with the majority driven by
structural changes within our private equity portfolio. In line with our investment strategy
as a hold-to-maturity fixed income investor, we did not harvest sharply increased
unrealized gains on our fixed income portfolio which is up by more than EUR850 million
since the beginning of the year.
As a result of the volatility of the equity market of the volatile -- sorry, the volatile equity
markets following the Brexit referendum, we had some impairments on individual stocks
within our equity portfolio. In total, that amounts to EUR25 million. As you know, we had
made a moderate start into building up a diversified equity portfolio in 2015. And we
continued this in January -- in 2016. Looking at our equity portfolio as a whole also
including the write-downs, the development is actually positive. So also here, we have
built up valuation reserves as a buffer for future volatility.
Overall investment return was 2.9%, exactly the return we are targeting for the full year,
even in light of the reduced investment yields we have to face right now.
The next slide shows an overview of how the different asset classes contributed to the
ordinary investment income compared to where we are invested. On the right-hand side,
you can see that we have kept our asset allocation rather stable. When it comes to new
investments, we are still following a strategy of investing in highly liquid government
bonds in combination with some higher yielding bonds while maintaining an overall stable
risk appetite as we think that an increased liquidity overall is helpful in the volatile market
environment.
At 39%, corporates have still by far the highest share in our investment income. Real
estate and private equity are contributing significantly more than their respective share in
the asset allocation.
I think this should conclude my remarks and I leave the target matrix as always to you
Ulrich.

FINAL

Thank you, Roland. Well the target matrix you can see that beside the prevailing difficult
trading conditions, we continue to see ticks on almost all of our profitability targets. The
premium income, however, developed short of our growth targets, particular in property
and casualty reinsurance business because of our selective underwriting approach during
the current soft market.
This slide -- this shows you the renewals throughout the year of our P&C book excluding
our facultative business, our structured reinsurance business as well as our ILS business.
You can see during the Second Quarter 16% of the traditional P&C reinsurance business is
up for renewal. In absolute terms, it's (EUR1.5 billion) (corrected by company after the call).
You may recall that for January 1 renewals we saw a decline of our premiums of 1.5%
followed by a rise of our premiums in the Second Quarter -- Third Quarter renewals of
9.1%. And as you will see on the next slide, the Second Quarter renewals saw a growth of
8% meaning that on a year-to-date basis and on -- based on constant exchange rate -we saw renewal premiums increase by EUR101 million equal to 1.6%.

Bloomberg Transcript

This slide shows you the details of the Second Quarter renewals and as you can see -- I
mean there is that 8% increase despite the fact that the market in general has continued
to be soft. This in fact is for this business the fourth consecutive year where these
renewals were subject to soft market conditions. As a result, the rate reductions slowed
down considerably which one may take as indication of a bottoming out of the
reinsurance rates.
Based on our longstanding good relationships with our existing clients we nevertheless
managed to increase our premium volume at terms and conditions which in our judgment
still fulfill our marginal requirements. We achieved this growth without writing single large
transactions from a larger number of new business opportunities and to some extent
from increased shares of existing business.
The growth came mainly from North America, here from the shorter tail classes as well as
some growth on credit and surety. And on the agricultural business we saw a good growth
of our Chinese portfolio.
Our guidance for 2016 remains unchanged as we feel that the business development so
far this year as I already mentioned fully supports that guidance.
Considering the development of our IFRS capital, it is likely that we will again be in the
position at year-end to pay an extraordinary dividend like last year provided that the large
losses remain within budget and there are no contortions on the capital market.
Looking at the individual areas of our P&C reinsurance portfolio, you can see that the
profitability overall is still expected to continue to be above cost of capital. Due to the soft
market, this however is not true for classes like aviation or property and catastrophe
excess of loss, where based on the expected loss levels, the cost of capital will not be
Page 7 of 27



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2016-08-04

fully earned. On the other hand, we continue to see good profitability on our North
American business as well as on our marine business due to the high quality of those
portfolios.

FINAL

Furthermore, we have seen some premium growth, for example, in North America. But on
the other hand, a steep decline of volume on classes like aviation where we have to
restructure the book of business to be a soft market book of business.
On structured reinsurance and ILS business, we believe that the volume will be stable to
slightly up for the full year. The results -- this is -- will be the result of some new (service
relief ) transactions or capital management transactions from Eastern Europe as well as
from the US which are effective July 1. And these should more than offset the lost
transactions on service relief motor treaties from China where we saw on premium
incomes last year in excess of EUR200 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

On our life and health business, we expect to continue to see very attractive profits from
our financial solutions business even without the positive one-off effects that we saw last
year. Our mortality business continued to show good underlying profitability so that
despite the fact that we have to assume that some of the older underwriting years of our
US mortality business will continue to develop adversely, we overall expect to earn the
cost of capital on our mortality business.
From a volume point of view, we continue to see good growth on our longevity business,
particularly from the UK. Whilst this business has become significantly more competitive,
we still are in the position to proactively write transactions which fulfill our profit
requirements.
In line with our strategy, we are confident that we will be able to safeguard a successful
development of our business even in the current difficult trading environment. We
continue to see an underlying increase in profitability of our life and health business. On
the P&C side, we are benefiting from our longstanding relationships with our clients which
allow us to protect the quality of our portfolio. In addition, also due to the very good year
that we enjoyed in 2015 and at the current year even higher reserve buffers than we ever
had in the past.
With our continued positive cash flow we expect that the assets under management will
continue to grow and will allow us to achieve in absolute terms a net investment income
which is in line with the previous years.
As we saw a decrease -- actually a welcome decrease of our admin expenses in the first
half year of 2016, we are confident that we will be able to maintain our competitive
advantage regarding the level of admin expenses.
This concludes the remarks on the first half year of 2016, ladies and gentlemen. And we
would be more than happy to answer your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator

FINAL

(Operator Instructions) Xinmei Wang, Morgan Stanley.

Q - Xinmei Wang

{BIO 17860767 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, Xinmei Wang from Morgan Stanley. I have two questions please. First is
just a bit more clarity on the reserving please. Could you give some detail on the single
claims in Q2 so the one-off recurring, maybe some color as well on the years and
geographies? Then also on the higher frequency basic losses again which years, which
regions. I just wanted to -- which geographies. I just want to understand a bit better where
the reserve charges are coming from.
Then secondly, is how you think about the large loss budget for the next year. I guess you
don't have the same effect as you had in 2015 in terms of the FX impact on the budget.
But in light of the comment on increased frequency would you increase your large loss
budget on the back of that? Then maybe some commentary on the severity side of things
as well. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Well yes, thank you for your questions. I mean on the large loss budget it's a little bit early
to say. I doubt if we will increase it significantly. But certainly on the catastrophe loss side
it's basically the result of an actuarial analysis that we look at our cat-exposed business
and calculate simply the expected losses based on the natural catastrophe models.
For the manmade losses, it's more an estimate based on the average of the previous
year. So I mean -- and that can go either way. But I mean the pressure that might increase
a little bit on the manmade losses purely because the business has grown in the last
couple of years and our lines have grown a little bit as well.
If I comment on the frequency of losses that we saw in the Second Quarter and also the -some of the loss reserves development, if you -- if I look at the loss reserve, I mean
versus actually not paid off, it's just individual losses, for example, some Argentinean
business and some business -- some casualty losses from Asia. But we have new
information and so we actually then increased the reserves partly as a matter of caution.
Whether or not we will actually need that, we have to wait and see. But it is in line with our
cautious results -- cautious approach to reserving individual losses. And is not only the
case on newly occurring losses but also on -- as we get new information on existing losses
we take that into account as well naturally.
Otherwise the underlying frequency clearly has been higher this -- in Second Quarter. If
you look at the first half overall it's not so remarkable. First half overall is probably quite in
line with expectation. But Second Quarter was clearly a spike there. And it happens that if
you look at the business on a quarterly basis, that you might have some quarters which

Page 9 of 27



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2016-08-04

are very benign and others which are seeing -- more activity. On the reserving releases I
will hand that over to Roland.

FINAL

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

So I think we -- the one thing I'd like to add is that as Ulrich mentioned what we have been
seeing came from various lines of business all around the world there was no
accumulation up to now. We have not at all any indication that this is not just a coincidence
accumulation, that there is any underlying trend or whatever.
On the other hand, when it comes to the redundant reserves we already mentioned that
in 2015 we have increased redundant reserves remarkably. You will hear about the
numbers in October. So the last year we had published was I think EUR1.56 billion for the
end of 2014. That number has increased over the course of 2015 remarkably. We might
have a slight downwards effect this year but we will still be remarkably above the EUR1.56
billion which was the last number we had published. So in this regard, I would echo what
Ulrich mentioned.
It is something which we are expecting. We have mentioned for quite some time that we
do no longer expect to add to redundant reserves in this respect. 2016 was a very
extraordinary year -- 2015 sorry was an extraordinary year and now we are there at -- fully
in line with expectations.

Q - Anasuya Iyer

{BIO 18981555 <GO>}

Hi, thanks for taking my question. My first question was just on Life Re. I just wonder given
the mortality losses is there anything you might do differently from here to manage the
losses on these books and what the challenges might be particularly in asking cedants to
recapture some of that business.
My second question also on life re on the longevity EBIT margin, which was around 2.1%.
And I think in several of the previous quarters I've seen it higher than that, maybe close to
4% or higher than 3% at least. Just wondered if there's a change in the market there that
we should note? Thank you.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you for those questions. If I look on the -- on our US mortality business the only
area where we have problems is the large ING block that we acquired at the end of 2008.
And here we have two parts of the business. One is so-called modified co-insurance
business where we just -- and I mean get the premiums and reserves off our feeding
Page 10 of 27



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2016-08-04

FINAL

companies. Here the XXX reserving and AXXX reserving means that we have to post
rather high letters of credit. We have reduced the letters of credit cost so much this part
of the block is -- it's a -- actually with reduced collateral cost pretty much developing in line
with expectation.
So that leaves then the yearly renewable term business where the reinsurer sets the rate
on its own, somewhat dislocated of the rates of the feeding company. That of course
means that the rates would increase then with age and also the rates are increasing with
the expected payout so that the reserving and therefore the requirements of LCs on this
business is significantly less.
Here, therefore the, say savings on the collateral cost have limited effect and we have to
say that some of these treaties develop adversely. But we have seen the opportunity of
those to increase rates. And in case that -- this is in line with the terms and conditions of
the treaty which it normally is and it is justified by the development of the claims like other
reinsurers we are actually doing that. Of course, there is a time lag because you have to
have the evidence first and we are not doing that lightheartedly. Therefore, only after a
very thorough actual analysis we would approach our clients with rate increases. That's
why I say only where appropriate and necessary.

Bloomberg Transcript

And -- that of course means that if your claims move -- more adversely than expected so
will the rate increases from a client point of view. But as I said, it has a lag of 18 months to
two years and therefore it is -- and in the mid-term we expect that we would be able to
compensate that problem but it has a short-term negative effect.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Longevity.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Yes, on the longevity -- on the longevity business, most of that business, if you look at the
large longevity blocks which is the majority of the business -- other part of the business is
the single premium enhanced annuity business. But if you look at the block business, the
initial margins that we book here is around just the 2% mark. Because I would say all of
these transactions are still rather new. Maybe with the -- or rather green with the
exception of the very old ones which are not many. Because what we are really doing, we
are guaranteeing the pension payouts -- inflation adjusted -- for fixed premium.
And of course in the initial years, as I mentioned on previous calls, you are not expecting
that your pensioners you are paying the pension for will reduce in number to a larger
extent. And therefore , the opportunities that the actual payout and expected payouts will
deviate I would say in the first five years is extremely limited. And that of course increases
in the later years and should earn our margin accordingly. But none of the -- but maybe
bar one -- of those treaties are in the phase where according to our (inaudible) and
margins they earn the full margin as yet.

Page 11 of 27



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2016-08-04

So we put -- the best part of the margin in reserve at this point in time. That's the reason
why on the longevity unless there is a development on the enhanced annuity you will see
for the next couple of years that the margin will be around, say 2% mark. The deviation
comes from the enhanced annuities.

Can you please go ahead with your question?

Thank you very much. So just a few clarifications please. On the frequency losses where
you have said there is no pattern and you also mentioned that some of these were not
new losses but more new information on existing losses and there you are reserving
conservatively, could you please give us some more clarity or some more numbers to use
here or some idea of how much is new losses how much is just reserve conservatism?
Then secondly on, Ulrich, your comments on you know the usual disclaimer on the
extraordinary dividend is large loss within budget and no distortion on capital markets.
Can we assume that what we have seen in the recent few weeks does not count as
distortion in capital market? Just a very quick clarification.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thank you. So profitability on the cost of capital metric on the worldwide treaty
seems to have fallen between 1Q and 2Q. Is it just because the budgets have been just
met. Is that the driver of this?
And lastly on the life, it's a little confusing, is the underlying versus last year still expected
to increase as was written on your slide? Or as from your comments just now, it's likely to
be flattish? If you can just please clarify that. Thank you very much, Ulrich.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

As far as the development on the life goes, Vinit, we expect that the underlying
profitability is still going to increase but only when you exclude, of course, the one-off
effect from last year. You can see that we had about EUR180 million in the first half. If we
have a similar result in the second half that would be in line. Because we are never quite
sure on individual loss claims, you're never quite sure on how the problem business on -of US mortality actually develops on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But the mid-term trend we
are very confident that it's fully intact.

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean what we have recently seen distortion of the capital market, well, I might say so
but certainly not that it will have a negative effect on this year's results. Because, yes,
there is some new money that we have to invest also in the second half and it will, of
course, be not all that easy to find low-risk, high-yield investment opportunities here. But
that's the smaller part of it.
And at the same time, of course, to the extent that if movement in the portfolio with the
increase valuation reserves, of course, there is a possibility that we will see some further
realized gains. It's, of course, for us our business model not good is that the interest rates
are so low. But that is more a medium-term rather than a 2016 problem.
If you look at the worldwide treaty why the combined ratio has increased in the Second
Quarter. What we report on the property catastrophe excessive loss is what we write and
(inaudible) to be written in our Bermuda subsidiary. The Ecuador loss has been absorbed
in the worldwide treaty reinsurance business. And also, some of the reserves that we put
up say in Asia where we had an increase in the loss reserve and also in Latin America on
some of the business, we just put further prudence in the reserves in the Second Quarter.
That also has been done in the worldwide treaty reinsurance
We do expect that by yearend this number, if the large losses behave -- will improve
again. But if you look, for example at Ecuador, yes, we had some losses but, of course, we
have seen quite significant rate increases on that business as well.
Then on the frequency of losses, it's difficult to give you more color on that, because it
just has been, as Roland said, from a rather wide variety of individual lines of business. We
had, for example, if you look at some of our German business we had a large, very large
treaty which is (inaudible) not too far from home. We had a great result in the First

Page 13 of 27



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2016-08-04

Quarter. We had a very bad result in the Second Quarter. But the half year is absolutely
fine. So it's these kind of movements that we have seen in the Second Quarter.

FINAL

And as far as -- the question should we have dipped even a little bit deeper in our loss
reserve? Well of course, we could have but on a quarter-by-quarter basis, we are
relatively protective of our position there. And therefore, we did improve the combined
ratio to some extent but maybe not quite to the level of expectation.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Maybe, Vinit, if I can add here. So if we look at the number I did mention the extraordinary
one-off positive of EUR150 million with the large loss but it fully exhausted. This gives you
a little bit of an indication of the overall amount of developments below expectations.
And your question how is this distributed when it comes to negative run-off or higher
frequency. If you -- so we are looking at an overall number of EUR100 million plus. But you
could divide that by two. But to put that into perspective we are looking at a reserve
portfolio of more than EUR22 billion so in this regard we are not overly excited.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I can also add that, of course, under IFRS we book our IBNR what we call segment reverse.
And they are actually up, after the first half year this year if you compared with the first
half year last year. So the IBNR reserves compared to the same period last year has
actually increased rather than decreased.
I'm not fully alarmed even though I think it also has to be said that with the continued soft
market the business does not, at least our business, does not have the margins to absorb
a lot of negative development without resorting to the -- what we've done with the loss
reserves. I think we have to accept that. We don't have to (press) it but it's a fact.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. The reason -- the market is obviously worried as you can see in the share price is
that, they are worried that -- whether this is the pattern from previous low prices or low
terms and conditions. But you have said there is no pattern. And equally just probably just
to conclude you have said that half of this negative effect was reserving and half was
actual loss. Is that correct understanding?

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

I don't have the number with me. But if I look at what we know today I think this should
give you a guidance. And again, it's distributed around the world in lines of business so
this is a little bit the indication that we do not see a real pattern here.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

And it is largely reserves that you can see from the cash flow. It hasn't impacted the cash
flow you might say as yet. But it definitely has -- it is pretty much in the reserves rather

than in extra paid losses.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Morning all. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two from me please. So firstly just
thinking about how the retro program is working. You've obviously made some recoveries
in the quarter. I just wondered given peak hurricane season is ahead of us starting midAugust time. How well covered are you? Have you burned through a lot of retentions on
some lines? I know that the (k-session) kicks in from the first dollar loss. But on reinsurance
programs elsewhere, how much is still to go before you make material recoveries after a
Q2 spike in losses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly on pricing, there are lots of comments around bottoming out here as we've
seen from peers earlier in the Q2 reporting period. I'd be interested to get a bit more
color on where you think we are in the pricing cycle. Do you think we are about to turn? It
seems to me that we need a real loss to turn the market and if we don't get that we'll just
sort of bump along on the bottom. So I'd be interested to get your comments there.
Thank you very much.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. If I look at our retro program, the recoveries are largely from the ksession. The vertical programs that we buy is un-impacted. Of course, the vertical
program puts a ceiling on the Canadian situation so that will -- this is contained I would say
from that.
But pretty much, most of it if you look at k it's not a negative territory as a result of the
losses. So we have eaten in and part of the premium but overall I think the k-session is still
pretty fine. Of course, it has less room now if it wants to be profitable for some major
hurricane losses or something like that. So no concern here.
If you look at the pricing, I would say overall the -- well, we haven't seen a change in the
sentiment I would say. Of course, there is increasing concerns with the reinsurer told to
reduce their prices further because we all have predictive modeling and of course, the
rating models and rating tools, even if you tweak them, would probably say that the prices
are rather slim that we are currently charge. And therefore, these rate reductions are
slowing. I would expect that that will continue to happen if the trend of reported results
from the reinsurance business and the reinsurance continues as is currently being seen.

Page 15 of 27



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2016-08-04

FINAL

But I don't see a change, a fundamental change in the cycle at this point in time I must say.
And of course, again I couldn't mention it often enough. The business that came for
renewal in the Second Quarter this year had, in some cases, seen rate reductions already
in three times consecutively in previous renewals. So it's not great.
Additional, if you look at the primary business that also sees some pressure on rates
particularly on the specialty lines, a little bit more than say one or two years ago. And of
course, as there is more proportionate reinsurance premium being seeded at this point in
time rather than excessive loss and facultative, those rating pressures on the primary
business will eventually also filter through to the reinsurance business even though -- even
if we don't change say terms and conditions from the reinsurance.
So I would say we have a reinsurance market that's reasonably concerned with the low
pricing but there is no fundamental turn at this point in time. That's an observation. And
from -- that's why I say we are safeguarding to the extent we can our loss reserve buffers,
because it is quite comfortable in the current market to have that.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Okay. I've one clarification and two questions. The first one is just to cover some of
Roland's points as a clarification. I'm not sure whether I heard it correctly or whether I
missed something. But did you said that in terms of how we should think about the
reserve for redundancy we should expect 2015 to go up and 2016 in absolute levels come
down. So that's the clarification.
The second question, again so I'm going to probably stick on this reserve redundancy
point, what was the thought process behind using the redundancy at this point in the
year? So you take EUR150 million out of the redundancy versus doing it later in the year.
We still have -- you said you have EUR472 million of budget left for the year. We don't
know what happens for the remainder of the year. So not just the opportunity to true this
up at the year end.

Page 16 of 27



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE

Date: 2016-08-04

FINAL

And I guess the second part of that question is if we have a light hurricane season will you
look to build that redundant cat reserve back into the overall redundancy?
Then the third part I wanted to talk about is, given your -- you've been willing to use
reserve surplus to produce earnings or you will be looking to that going forward. What's
your overall confidence on forward earnings from here as a result of using quite a large
chunk of overall redundancy? Sorry to stick on the one subject but it's kind of my highlight
for this morning. Thanks.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

No. That's fine. First of all, I would say the development of the reserve redundancies in
2015 was quite unexpected from us. And the reason for that was not that -- the rating
quality of the business in 2015 was great. The reason was that we saw on our books
losses develop significantly below expectation. And that is the reason why we saw this
development.

Bloomberg Transcript

I would say from that point of view we also reached a point where on the -- even with our
auditors under IFRS we would be hard pressed and probably be not possible for us to
further increase the redundancies here anyhow. And therefore, we were willing to use a
little bit of that.
Also, where we used this has rather been from older underwriting years on shorter tail
lines where it would have been difficult to defend some at year end anyhow. A good
example for that is our marine business where we have seen a remarkable 12% combined
ratio in the first half. This is all underwriting here. So 2011 and prior where we had reserves
just sitting there.
But the tail, marine is mid tail and therefore clearly because it was also pretty much taken
from excess of loss rather than proportionate. Clearly, at one point in time these loss
reserves have to be released anyhow because the losses are simply not there. And yes,
we could have done that at year end but considering the spike in losses that we have
seen in the Second Quarter in line with what we said for some while now we used that for
-- really even out that a little bit in the Second Quarter.
If you look at the overall redundancy level in 2016, it's a little bit too early to comment.
And because that -- its dependant also on the losses as we develop on the current year.
And that will be taken into account in the loss reserves study at year end.
But one thing I should mention that on the new underwriting years 2016 and underwriting
year 2015 we kept the loss ratio PEGs entirely unchanged. And they would still -- there we
still book combined ratios excess of 100. So there if expectations in the end come to
fruition we would probably have to set some further prudence in our reserves on the new
underwriting years.

And in terms of what this means for looking forwards and confidence on earnings are we
still in the position -- I got the feeling at year-end and in Q1, you were still fairly confident
not just about 2016 but about the medium-term based on the balance sheet buffers. Is
that still the position internally?

FINAL

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Yes. On the P&C underwriting result we feel that that is for the coming years pretty well
safeguarded, as long as the losses are not over the large loss budget.
Of course, from a strategic point of view, we believe that eventually the market will turn
and we will see better rates again, which allow lower underlying combined ratios. Of
course, we think that this will happen at a time, at least that's the plan, when we still have
some reserve buffers left.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Perfect. That's really --

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

But I think you should also be very clear, the current pricing level that we see in the
reinsurance market, does not necessarily support combined ratios at the expected loss
levels in the low 90s. We just don't see that.

Thank you. So much. I probably missed it. And apologies, I'm sure I did. What is the
underlying combined ratios. So if you stripped out these reserve movements on the nat
cat in Q1, in Q2 and the first half ?
Then are you also tempted, like your peers, to move to quarterly accounting, which I
guess would iron out some this (move).
Then on the solvency, I wonder if you can -- you said it would be likely up. I wonder if you
can give a feel for how much up?
Then on the reserving, just to go back a little bit. And I'm sure you gave the number. But I
missed it. What is the amount of reserve additions within the total reserve movement?
Thank you.

FINAL

Well if I start with the Solvency II ratio, as you know, we had to report it based on year-end
numbers that 120% -- sorry, 221%. This is due to the increase in capital up to 227 now. So
this refers to the increased bid.
If you look at the underlying combined ratio, in our books that would be based on
expected cat losses and based on the loss ratio PEGs that we have on the newer
underwriting years, would be, I would say, around 98%, 99%. However, if you then take
into account to the high initial loss ratio PEG (C) normally expected run of profit, we are
still, I would say, in the region I would say of around 96%.

Does that answer all the questions then or is it more?

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Was there a number -- yes, it was just a number, because you were talking about adding
to reserves for Argentina and casualty in Asia. Do you have -- is there a figure? Is the
EUR150 million net of these? And how much are these?

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

I don't think we have a concrete figure there.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

(No), I think we tried to explain that quite some time. And Ulrich mentioned the loss ratio
fixed for the current year. So what I'd mention is that again in 2015 the redundant reserves
went up remarkably. We now see an extraordinary run-off which I have quantified with
EUR150 million.
So now it depends as to whether we have built up new redundancies for the current years
in the amount of EUR150 million, then the confidence level would remain exactly where it
Page 19 of 27



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2016-08-04

was. Or as to whether we have built up a lower or a higher number. We will only know that
for sure after the next reserve analysis, which is by year-end. I did mention that our
assumption right now is that the redundancy level as compared to the end of 2015 has
decreased slightly.

FINAL

A - Ulrich Wallin

Hello, thank you very much. Just one question, sort of following up to the earlier)one. I'm
trying to just be clear about what your message is for the US mortality business. We know
it's already been a problem area. Your margin's been bouncing around a bit. It was low in
the Second Quarter. But it wasn't really disastrously low. And if you hadn't actually
mentioned US mortality, I at least wouldn't really have focused on it as much of a point.
So are you trying to tell us that US mortality has started to deviate again from your
expectations. And it may require further remedial action? Or can you just be clear about
whether there really is a problem here and whether -- what's going on. Because to me,
the headline numbers, unless there's something offsetting US mortality within your 4.3%,
doesn't actually seem to be too bad a result.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Well the US mortality on the new business that we write since 2009, which we call organic
business is actually performing head of expectation. This is a growing part of the book
and the same is true for some of the smaller blocks that we acquired. So that's why the
overall number is not looking all that bad.
The large block that we bought, there again, it's the YRT business where we continue to
see some loss emergence which is above our revised view on the most likely outcome.
That's the reason why we will impose further rate increases in order to combat that
problem.
In the actual numbers, it's not always easy to define, because of course it's in one line
with all the rest of the mortality business and there the development is actually positive.
But when I look for the difference in the EBIT on the first and Second Quarter, that is
exactly from this YRT business I just mentioned.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Hello, thank you for taking my questions. Just two very quick ones, hopefully. Firstly, just
could you update us on what your reinvestment yield is?

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly on the July renewals, most of the growth seems to have come from the new
business, I think, from your existing clients in the US. Just a quick word on what's driving
growth there. And is it just increased demand on some of your specifics or are there
common themes behind this? Thank you.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Yes. If I take the first one -- the second one first and then Roland take the other one.
Yes. Where we grow in the US, as I said, it's more the short-tail lines, it's increased
demand from existing clients, which we are able to write some business which we feel is
very attractive. That's where the growth in the US comes from. It's not a large US excess
casualty quota shares, because we still are shying away from them, mainly because of the
experience that we had in the last soft market.
So we are not, despite the overall soft market, we are not unhappy with that growth. We
think it's proper growth.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

With regard to the reinvestment yield, you know that we usually do comment on two
numbers, one of which is very easy to calculate, which is why I have it very concrete. This is
exactly what is the reinvestments yield on the portfolio, which I have today, if I would
reinvest an additional euro or dollar exactly in the portfolio composition as it is today. That
amount is on at least for the time of my responsibility on an all-time low of 1.37%. You also
know that we do not exactly reinvest into the composition where we are today. So the real
investment yield, or reinvestment yield should be a little bit higher than that, I would
assume, it's a little bit above 1.5%.
Page 21 of 27



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2016-08-04

FINAL

Let me give you some additional remarks to that. So right now, I would have to expect
that the dilution of the ROI is a little bit higher than it was before. So I usually say it's 10 to
15 basis points but maybe it is right now 15 to 20 basis points.
On the other hand, you should also still bear in mind that with the barbell strategy we
have been entertaining for a good year now, we see that a portion of our government
bonds has gone up, which of course also means that with the rate decreases we have
been seeing, this is where valuation reserves come from. So the value of these
investments, the relative value of these investments, have increased.
Moreover, it was also interesting to see the sterling going down. Also with the sterling -the euro going down slightly as well, at least after the Brexit and in this regard we saw
some positive developments from the US dollar and the Aussie)dollar and whatever.
So overall the message is -- yes, the reinvestment yield has gone down slightly again. Also
again the valuation reserves have gone up drastically. We have not harvested any of that
and the buffer has increased to EUR2.5 million in variation reserves right now.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Thank you, everybody. I have two questions. My first question is on the investment
income, there specifically on the realized gains also on a net level, if you take realized
gains and realized losses into account then yes, they are on a similar level. However, if you
only look into the realized gains, I think they are quite high in Q2. You mentioned that this
is coming from private equity. However, could you comment again on where this high level
of realized gains if you only focused on these come from? What the drivers were to have
these specifically in Q2?
Then my second question is on your portfolio, also on the renewals. Do you see some
pressure on your combined ratio from a shift mix within your portfolios (say) higher
proportional share. But also a shift mix in other lines?

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Well I'll take the second one first. I would say to some extent the portfolio shifts a little bit
towards some higher combined ratios because a proportion of pro rata business is
increasing and the proportion of excess of loss is slightly going down, even though it's
relatively large.

Page 22 of 27



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2016-08-04

FINAL

In addition, of course, on the excess of loss, it depends on the way the losses are actually
-- develop and happen. But if you just purely take the expected loss values that are
calculated from the rating tools, then of course also on the excess of loss business, take
lower pricing, the combined ratios would increase at a level of expected losses. It would
still be even at a level of expected losses, the combined ratio would still be lower on
excess of loss than on pro rata, because of the higher volatility of the results there.
There is a tendency in our book. And I would say overall in the market, with the shift to the
pro rata book that there will also be a shift that the underlying combined ratios will
probably increase.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Let me comment on the realized gains losses. We had realized losses of around EUR5
million. So the realized gains against it were then EUR85 million and the balance was
EUR80 million. The contribution from the private equity side is before the background that
we are a long-term private equity investor. So we also always have some old, no longer
really actively investing funds in our portfolio. We put them together to a portfolio sold to
prepare that last year and this deal was closed this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

So this was all private equity funds which then resulted in an extraordinary profit of EUR31
million in the first half year. So a good EUR30 million out of the EUR80 million came from
that transaction.
Apart from that I think realizations were just normal course of business in the portfolio.
You sometimes have to sell something because you have to pay dividends or claims or
whatsoever. Right now, everything is -- every sale is -- or nearly every sale is associated
with the realization. If you indicate that we had increased the realized losses to mitigate a
little bit the lower income in Q2, this is not the case.
So for instance, in my equity portfolio right now, I'm up 6%. We have depreciations on
equities of EUR24 million. So including these EUR24 million, the portfolio is still up by 6%.
So it would have been easy to mitigate that by just selling some of the equities and
thereby mitigating the write-offs. We didn't do that. We still have these valuation reserves
in the portfolio.

can you shed some light on which lines and geographies led to the year-on-year decline in

Secondly, on slide 17, I see the volume there of the financial solutions business now points
to a flattish growth. I just wanted to get your thoughts around that. And if that relates to
the finalization of principle-based reserving in the US?
Lastly, if you can clarify if the EUR150 million number that you mentioned as the usage of
the redundancy relates to the first-half or the Second Quarter standalone? The
227percentage solvency ratio, is that the solvency at the end of first half ?

A - Ulrich Wallin

Well the solvency ratio -- thank you for the questions -- is based on the number at the end
of the First Quarter. At the end of the Second Quarter, it's expected to be quite stable,
because we saw an increase in capital due to the significant increase in valuation reserves.

Bloomberg Transcript

At the same time that would have meant some of the discounting values would go the
other way because of the low interest rate. The capital requirement is probably slightly
down because business is slightly down. So I would say on average I expect that to stay
stable at the end of this year. But we are just in the process of running all the models and
then calculating that.
You've said the financial solutions business premium would be rather flat because of
principal-based reserving. Well the premium on the financial solutions is not a very telling
line, because a number of the businesses that are deposit accounted. And as we saw last
year, some of this is even accounted as a swap. The principal-based reserving, of course,
reduces the opportunities to finance Triple-X and AXXX reserving.
However, (that's) only for new business and not for the i; force business. And as far as the
transactions that we have on the books, the average duration is something like 20 years.
So it's a -- they we will continue to be there and we will be adding new ones because
transactions are a little bit more diverse now than financing a Triple-X and AXXX reserves.
We have a broader scale of transactions there, particularly in the US.
So on the financial solutions in the US, premium, as I said, is not so important but we
expect it with the profits will further increase.
Then you are asking on the P&C business, where we are -- where we have lost some
income. Yes. We have, as you rightly say, the lost income on the Chinese motor quota
share because of C-Ross, they are not quite sufficient any longer. But that is booked in the
end, the financial solution segment, because these were surplus relief treaties with
financial reinsurance bells and whistles to it.
But we have made up for this by 1/7 because we had another kind of service release
transaction in a different country, this time in the US which was newly written at 1/7 which

together with some Eastern European business that we wrote in the first half should
actually even out that.
Other areas where we see premium dropping, for example, is available where we had
the largest dropp, this is just because we have reduced our involvement in the
proportionate treaties, in particular covering a (inaudible) airline book, because most of
them, their declines would require higher commissions. We just don't feel that considering
the airline ratings that that is justified. Well at least it's not what we would like to support. It
doesn't mean that those higher commissions are not supported in the market. Quite to
the contrary, they are.
So other lines, also on our non-German, continental European business, we have also
seen some reduced volumes, again because of very competitive pricing. So selective
underwriting dictates that we would reduce our volume. But other areas, as I said, like
North America, like the Far East, we still see growth opportunities and also in lines like
agriculture has continued to grow.

The EUR150 million, I would hand over to Roland.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

I can only reiterate, I think, this is what we usually do. We make a comment as to whether
our run-off result was in the normal region of EUR50 million plus per quarter or as to
whether we are higher than that. Technically we are EUR150 million higher than that.
As to what that exactly means for the redundant reserves and redundancy level, I
mentioned before we will only find that out after a new in-depth analysis. Our assumption
right now is that it has gone slightly down. But only slightly down. I mention one more time
it will -- or it should still be remarkably higher. The overall level or the absolute level of
redundancies, then the EUR1.5 billion, which we mentioned October last year for year-end
2014. So we are still over and above that, which leaves us with a remarkable buffer even
after -- we didn't increase and we have slightly decreased.

FINAL

Thank you. Good afternoon. I have two questions. First of all, Mr. Wallin, you've touched
already a bit on this topic. What are your expectations for the impact from the major
claims which we saw in Q2 on the future price development in reinsurance?
Secondly, on investment income, ordinary investment income in (distinct) Q2 increased
year over year and my question is were there any non-recurring items included in that
line? For example, dividends from private equity? Or what's the driver behind that? Thank
you.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Well the claims have a positive effect on pricing. But pretty much only where they occur. So
we see very significant increases in Ecuador and in Canada for CAT business or for CATexposed business. This is purely a reaction on the losses.
The panels of reinsurers largely remain unchanged, because as all three insurers that
currently write that business, like, for example, us, we are happy to write the business at
higher rates. But there is no -- none of the market players exiting that -- those lines. So
there's no opportunity for new players to get in.

Bloomberg Transcript

That has been the case all along, I would say, also in the losses in 2010 and some of the
losses we saw 2011 outside the Taiwanese flood. The overall market still sees rate
increases as an opportunity, not as a threat. Therefore, their losses are rate increases but
they are normally taken by those reinsured that also took the losses.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

When it comes to the ordinary investment result you mentioned, why this has gone up in
this competitive)or in this low-yield environment. No. There are, apart from one a little bit
complicated effect, there are no extraordinary effects. The one a little bit more
complicated effect as compared to the first half last year, it is in the private equity
portfolio we had a conservative approach to accrue for running profits up to the sale of
the portfolio we mentioned, in line with this conservative approach which is associated
with distribution, has been in line with accounting requirements being changed.
This will also happen going forward so there is no -- not a recurring item in the ordinary
investment income this year. I think it was good; it was okay, the volumes especially in the
higher yielding areas had been growing. We had pursued our barbell strategy and also
invested into lower quality regions and that has had a positive impact.

FINAL

Yes. Good morning. Two remaining questions, more questions on the life re slide again
and the US mortality book. Roland, could you please quantify the negative impact on the
EBIT in the quarter two? Could you -- I'm still a bit confused on what we should expect
Q3/Q4. Should we expect the same magnitude of drag to be repeated in Q3/Q4, until
you're putting higher rates? Or what you will quantify for Q2 is really a one-off ? Thank you.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Well I would say the effect in Q2 was around $25 million to $30 million. We see the same
thing in Q3? Possibly. Of course, we don't know as yet, it would also depend. We didn't
see as much in Q1 because one of the ceding companies where we increased rates have
just recaptured the business. So we had a positive effect from that recapture.
I would say from a -- from trend, I wouldn't be surprised if you see some further negative
development in Q3 and Q4 built from those particular portfolios. But again, this is -- will be
to some extent you won't see it that clearly in the figures, because the rest of the
business is trending pretty positively.
