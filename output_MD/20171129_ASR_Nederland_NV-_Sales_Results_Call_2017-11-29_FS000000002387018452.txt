Good day and welcome to the a.s.r. Conference Call on the Nine Months Trading Update.
Today's conference is being recorded. Before we start, I would like to ask you attention for
the disclaimer on slide 12.
Now, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Figee, CFO of a.s.r. Go ahead
please, sir.

Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. Welcome to the conference call corresponding to the a.s.r.
Q3 trading update. As you've experienced, luckily a.s.r. is better in selling proﬁtable
insurance contracts than organizing conference calls. Although I can assure you that our
client contact center is slightly more eﬀective than the call today. So rest assure this is not
normal practice for a.s.r. Anyways, having said that, let's talk about the third quarter or
nine months results of a.s.r. As you will be aware, this is a trading update, a relatively light
set of reports. We don't report full IFRS proﬁts in a quarter or quarterly numbers. And
we're also a bit more light on the depth on solvency reports, but we'll give a little bit more
color on the voice line along the way.
Q3 was a fascinating quarter in a sense that a lot of signiﬁcant strategic events happened
in that quarter. We may have already forgotten but, yes, we did announce the acquisition
of Generali in the third quarter. We announced the acquisition of First Pensions

Investments (sic) [First Investments] (01:32) in the third quarter, and we managed to sell
the ﬁnal stake of the Dutch Government in the third quarter. And on the brink of the
fourth quarter, we launched and placed a €300 million inaugural Euro Tier 1 insurance. So
on the strategic side, lots of things going on but a good development at a.s.r. On the
business side, a reasonably ordinary quarter where things happened as planned,
happened as we envisaged, and the business has continued to work its way through our
plans.
If you go to page 2 on the presentation, which I hope you'll be able to see on our website,
if you could see the numbers, operating results year-to-date, €550 million, up almost 24%
versus last year. Result in the quarter €165 million, up about 13% versus last year.
Operating ROE north of 16%, still well above our target of up to 12%. A robust Solvency
ratio, 193%. We'll give you a little bit more color on that later on. In that number, we
absorbed 3 points worth of our share buyback at the ﬁnal sell-down of the State. So we
believe a continued set of solid results, a.s.r. to operate structurally at an elevated level.
Even in the Q3 where we tend to have more claims in Non-life, more claims especially in
the travel and leisure insurance business, in that quarter elevated performance versus last
year, up 23% on the year-to-date.
If you ﬂip to page 2 (sic) [page 3] (03:19), you can see the results on a quarterly basis, the
quarter 2016 and the quarter 2017. As you know this last year and this year, Q3 is the result
indeed where our travel and leisure insurance business tends to receive its claims. As a
matter of fact, Dutch people do take out their caravans in the summer. They drive around.
There's a time when they have their claims, and they have no claims in the winter. So that's
a very peculiar Dutch phenomenon in the travel and leisure insurance business. That's
something you have to reckon with. So think about 8 million of additional claims due to
the seasonality eﬀect in the summer.
There's a few interesting points to note on that very business. For example, due to the
lower roaming charges, we see actually more people taking their phones with them on
holidays, actually receiving more claims on damaged phones along the way. So you can
see some of the societal developments being reﬂected ultimately in the insurance
business. But again, typically in the third quarter, we incurred the claims on the (04:25),
the travel business, and they no longer reoccur in Q4. Also in Q2 to Q3 from a
development from the second to the third quarter, second quarter we always have our
dividend reporting season, so the dividends ﬂow into the operating earnings. So that's
about €20 million of seasonal plus seasonal beneﬁts in the second quarter.
So if you look at the year that we've gone through so far, the movement of Q2 to Q3
actually is a loss or relatively disappearance of €20 million of dividends that we only have
in Q2 and the typical Q3 occurrence of €8 million of travel and leisure claims. That
together explains and drives of the movement in Q2, Q3 in this year. And as compared to
last year, same time, both years have similar claims in travel and leisure. But 2017, we
report about €19 million higher earnings predominantly in the Life business where the
impact of our more yieldy investment portfolio is structural and is there on an elevated
level. So €19 million more versus last year where you have a seasonally-adjusted
comparison. So as from our perspective, you can see the developments in the quarter
during the year and versus last year.

Let's move to page 4. You can see the segmental results. All segments drive a strong
increase in operating results. All our business segments continue to do better than last
year, most notably the core businesses, Non-Life and Life. Totally €104 million up versus
last year in the ﬁrst three quarters. In the quarter itself, Q3-to-Q3, we ﬁnd Non-life stable
versus last year and we ﬁnd Life elevated by about €20 million, €22 million to be precise
in terms of elevated earnings in the quarter. Oﬀ slightly in the Holding where in Q3, as in
most quarters, we do have slightly higher pension charges. As you may be aware, the
annual current net service cost is, to some extent, driven by the level of interest rates,
lower interest rates increased for this year, the current net service cost.
So in Q3, stable in Non-life; up signiﬁcantly in Life; and like-for-like slightly higher Holding
costs, slightly higher pension charges, reducing the Holding & Other/Eliminations (06:58)
in our P&L. But overall, all segments continue to do better than last year, €104 million up
in the core segments and about €5 million up in our growth segments, Banking and Asset
Management and Distribution. So we feel very comfortable and conﬁdent with the
amount of trading that this group actually shows and displays.
Moving to page 5, premiums. If you exclude one-oﬀs, so one-oﬀ single Life premiums,
premiums up 3% on the year. In Life, declined a bit, 2%. Though in Life, we're observing
that of course our Life book is gradually declining, set to decline to (07:41), is reﬂective in
the development of the Life premiums, countered by signiﬁcant growth in deﬁned
contribution business, albeit from a relatively lower base. Today, DC makes up about
three-quarters of our new pensions business, and it's very attractive. A low-margin but
zero capital requirement business. So from a return of capital perspective, you can see an
ongoing growth in attractive businesses. So in Life, the decline of the back book
countered by growth in deﬁned contribution, and that's exactly strategically the shift that
we want to make for not but a small decline in Life premiums.
In P&C premiums versus last year, up about 5% versus the last nine months of 2016. We
continue to see good growth in new production in P&C. Although we are actually on the
process of sanitizing our portfolio somewhat if you double click, if you zoom in on the
P&C volumes, you'll see a couple of developments, I think a general gaining in market
share in the intermediary channel. Sanitize is a plus. There's gradual sanitizing of our
business portfolio using the current conducive market circumstances to support our
margins and selectively grow our business. And ﬁnally, you will see gradually feeding in
some tariﬀ increases that we announced and put through in autumn, and that will
gradually feed into our premium levels as policies are renewed. So overall, we see that
the healthy development in premiums in line with our value over volume mantra towards
DC, towards high return on capital business intentions, and towards proﬁtable new
business in P&C.
Talking about Non-life, moving to page 6, shows you the results in the Non-life business.
You will be able to read the text on the right-hand side, but let me give you some color on
the diﬀerent business lines. Disability, actually premiums in disability are recovering.
Remember, in the ﬁrst quarter of the year, we had some headwinds where the new
BeZaVa market shaved oﬀ some volumes in disability. That is recovering. We see some
business ﬂowing back to us. So actually, premiums are stable to slightly up last year where
we were looking at a small decline in the beginning of the year. So a top-line recovery on
Page 3 of 20

FINAL

the disability side. Q3 was a very good quarter for disability. Combined ratio year-to-date
is still at the 90s. In Q3, we'll actually go below 90 combined ratio in disability. Very strong
and very stable when it comes to inﬂow of new claims. So comfortable on disability
business, very proﬁtable, and Q3 was actually very pretty strong.
In property and casualty, premiums up signiﬁcantly from €844 million to €887 million.
Continue to gain market share as we said. You will see going forward some further
support for top line from tariﬀ increases as they will gradually feed into the business. In
terms of claims performance, bulk claims very strong. Bulk claims, I mean, the ordinary
guy who put his car against a tree, someone who loses a phone, (11:12), really small
average claims. Our bulk claims ratio continues to hover around 45%, so that's a very
attractive level and that's unabated Q1, Q2, Q3. Good performance on bulk. We just
(11:28) the bulk of the claims that we have.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have some larger claims in the quarters, in Q3. Some larger claims for a total of about
€8 million. There were no top claims but mid-size ﬁres. To give some color, that was not
addition to the bodily injury reserves. It was just a number of property claims, ﬁre claims
that we have to absorb. And it's part of our business that happened in the summer. The
month of October, already normalized. So that's a couple of one-oﬀ events in claims in
property and casualty, no sign of a trend there.
So, if you think about our Non-life business in the quarter, in Q3, think about an uptick in
earnings from disability of about €8 million, think about €8 million higher claims in travel
and leisure, think about €8 million in higher claims due to large ﬁres. And those travel and
leisure and large ﬁres are typical issues for that season (12:29) and appear not to be
continuing in Q4. So overall, we feel very comfortable with the underlying performance of
the Non-life business especially as our bulk claims ratio, which is the majority of our
claims, is still every quarter now around 45%, 46%. So comfortable on that business line.
Moving to Life, page 7, the Life segment. Operating results year-to-date up 15%, driven
mostly by the investment margin. Investment margin up €85 million in the year. As you
can see, part of it was due to we call management actions. Before, so if you claim that's a
one-oﬀ event, now this management action actually is a dedicated rerisking of our
investment portfolio to create structurally higher direct investment returns, so the €34
million (13:23) seen I guess in the ﬁrst quarter and it's here to stay. A more elevated level
of direct investment income due to allocation to real estate, allocation to more of this,
allocation to credits, and a high release of the capital gains reserve of €51 million.
Our capital gains reserve was €3.5 billion at the beginning of the quarter and about €3.5
billion at the end of the quarter. So no erosion yet of the capital gains reserve. So this
makes us feel comfortable of adding more elevated level of trading in the Life business
with, most notably, good €30 million of actually higher cash investment income from
higher coupons, dividends, rental income and what have you. Capital gains reserve,
stable at €3.5 billion. Other good thing to note, in the ﬁrst and a half quarters, we had a
lower result on mortality due to an inﬂuenza wave in the winter. That actually appears to
be an inﬂuenza wave in the winter that not continued in the summer. So in the third
quarter, we saw the result on mortality stabilize, conﬁrming that this was actually an
incidental (14:35).

And ﬁnally, again, in terms of new business, no pursuit or relevant pursuit of large single
premium business. We have very strict value criteria before we write single premium
products. And if you don't meet our value hurdles, we just don't underwrite these
contracts. But a lot of good movement in the deﬁned contribution business, which is now
75% of our new business. We have upped our DC target and are already meeting that
upped target even if it's only November. So we're very pleased with the development of
our deﬁned contribution business. Even if it's from a low base, the development of the
growth is actually quite promising.
Solvency ratio, page number 8, the number you probably all been waiting for. Standard
model, 193%. We do not provide you the full bridge in the quarter simply because those
numbers are not a supposed look in our quarterly basis, but let me give you some color
on where we are. Please note that the own funds of a.s.r. before share buyback increased
by €92 million, so there's a continued and lasting growth in own funds, out of which we've
got €101 million back to our shareholders as part of the government sell-down.

Bloomberg Transcript

Organic capital creation in line with our earlier guidance. And in terms of the bridge, you
guys have all pen and paper ready, so think about the following developments. Start the
quarter with 194%, organic capital creation adds about 2.5% in the quarter, the net of
market movement and mobile movement adds about 2%. The VA declined in the quarter
that caused to drop shave up (16:25) about 2%, slightly higher SCR due to increase to rate
eﬀect, increasing the longevity charge shave up (16:34) about 0.5%, will give you a growth
movement of plus 2%. You buy back shares for 3%, and then you get back to 193% to
where we were.
Just to repeat, 194% start plus 2.5% OCC, plus 2% net markets and mobile adjustments,
minus 2% VA contraction, minus 0.5% higher capital charge due to longevity risk gives
you a growth of the plus 2% and we paid back 3% which brings the number back to 193%.
So, the results we've seen is fully, as far as we can see, in line with the guidance as
suggested we get before and supports a very stable and predictable organic capital
generation. The organic capital generation, itself, was slightly lower in the P&C side
because we had some large claims. So, that feeds into the organic capital generation in
the quarter, but higher from an investment side. The re-risking that we engage in during
the year actually starts to feed into the OCC. That's compensating the higher claims in the
third quarter. Also, good to notice, solvency of our main subsidiaries, the life insurance
Solvency II north of 190%, the P&C life Solvency II north of 180%. So, very solid solvency
level across the board, and consistent and predictable capital generation.
We did place the inaugural RT1 in October. So, technically speaking, it's not part of our
trading update, but we mentioned it here, had a pre-tax coupon of 4.625%. So, it was
something we're very, very pleased with, partially used to fund the cash payment of the
Generali acquisitions.
On the Generali itself, we announced the transaction. In the quarter, we spent lots of time
on that transaction around the sell-down. Please remember, we provided to you with a
guidance of €30 million proﬁts over a €200 million of fungible capital contribution for

Page 5 of 20

FINAL

about a 15%-ish ROE. If you were to allocate €100 million from the hybrid to the Generali
deal, that'll actually boost your ROE in the transaction a lot more simply because of the
very attractive cost of capital of the RT1.
Brings me quick to page 9 rounding oﬀ that presentation. Not before except in Generali
integration as far as it comes to the preparation of this integration, it's still fully on track.
We have submitted the request for a DNO, a declaration of new objection. When do we
expected that? We don't know. It's now in the hands of our regulator. But it's safe to say
that we expect the closing of this transaction to be happening in the ﬁrst quarter of the
year. Somewhere between the ﬁrst working day and our full-year results presentation, we
expect the closing. End of January, early September is where we'd see the closing to take
place. And the integration preparation work that we've done so far suggests that what
we're seeing is in line with the assumption that we made when we embarked on the
acquisition altogether. So, we feel comfortable and conﬁdent on the deal.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, where does it leave within the quarter? Well, a reasonably uneventful quarter when
you look at the numbers, eventful when it came to strategic developments, uneventful
because the numbers conﬁrmed the trends that we've been displaying so far when it
comes to proﬁt. When it comes to capital generation, some seasonality eﬀects, the
diﬀerent season is unfortunately over in the summer. We have some higher claims on
travel and leisure. Some large claims in the P&C business countered by continued strong
performance and even better performance in the visibility business. Leaves us with a
result, €550 million, about 24% up versus last year, an ROE of 16% and a solvency level of
193%. So, we are still proud of the robust and positive result that this group was able to
deliver.
Having said that, back to you, and happy to take your questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we will start the question-and-answer
session now. The ﬁrst question is from Mr. Cor Kluis from ABN AMRO. Go ahead, please,
sir.

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Good morning. Cor Kluis, ABN. I've got a few questions. First of all, about the premium
growth in Disability because as we calculated this, there was a 13% premium growth in the
third quarter year-on-year. And then in H1, it was minus 2%. You explained, of course, that
it was due to the less headwind from the BeZaVa legislation. What can we expect on
Disability premium growth going forward, at Q4 but also going into 2018? Will we see a
structural growth improvement there? Could you give some comments on that one?
And also about premium, the Health premium was quite high in the ﬁrst year – ﬁrst half of
the year, 90% growth. I think in Q3, it was ﬂat Health premium. Could you also comment

Page 6 of 20



Company Name: ASR Nederland NV
Company Ticker: ASRNL NA Equity
Date: 2017-11-29

on that, why is there certainly lower growth on Health premium? Are you becoming more
selective or there's something technical change there?

FINAL

And second question is about the solvency ratio. You've got 193% plus the 8% or 9% for
the hybrid, so you're around 201% and 202%. Could you give a little bit more update on
your Solvency II-ratio in the fourth quarter? You're already two months in the quarter, of
course, given the market circumstances and other developments.
And last question is about Generali. I don't know if you're already have a full (22:38) to the
books, et cetera. But could you give some comments about how are the resources are
developing over there? Those are my questions.

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Very good. Cor, thanks. In terms of premium growth with Disability, indeed, in the ﬁrst
quarter we lost some business due to these BeZaVa developments, but then actually
reversed or is much less pronounced in the – as the year progressed. So, actually, we have
seen the resumption of some growth in Disability. But it has to do mostly with, I think,
some of the BeZaVa trends not following through and some of the clients who speaks –
speaking to the private sector and rather than going back to the public sector.
What's the long-term growth outlook? I would reckon generally speaking growing in line
with GDP is the safest way to predict it. Although in one particular segment called
absenteeism, verzuim in Dutch, we would expect to see for us and the markets some
premium increases in the coming year which is 2018. So, in the long run, grow with GDP
with some uplift for price increases, tariﬀ increases in the verzuim, absenteeism business.
In Health, well, premium level in Health during the year only varies because of
technicalities. I mean, last year's sales season in Health gave us about 20,000 new
customers. That is the uptick in the gross written premiums, but there are also various
elements that had to do with the Health equalization system that actually ﬂow through the
premium line item. So, movements during the year tend to have a technical nature. So,
there could be some volatility, but there's nothing to do with us underwriting more timely
or not. Your underwriting loans is once a year. We gained 20,000 customers last year and
that was it. Not sure we'll return or keep going on at that level. If you look at the pricing
level in Health, we're partly pretty strict and moved to our (24:41) valuable volume. So, I
don't think going forward, you'll see the same level of growth in Health. But during the
year, there could be ﬂuctuations that are more technical in nature.
Third question on the SCR, you pointed out (24:54) plus RT1, where does it go to from
here? In principle, our solvency ratio is developing as planned. You need to be aware,
however, that the VA is declining during the quarter. The VA lost about 4 points or 5
points quarter-to-date. And then, there's a technical thing that provides a bit of a
headwind in our solvency. If you look at the VA reference portfolio, our ﬁxed income
portfolio compared to the reference portfolio is a bit overweight in Dutch and German
govies. It's a bit underweight in corporate, most notably ﬁnancials and a bit underweight
in peripherals. So, when spreads tighten, paradoxically speaking, we have some
headwind because the VA premium declines a bit faster than the spreads on our actual
Page 7 of 20

Date: 2017-11-29

FINAL

portfolio. And rule of thumb, 1 point VA is 1 point of solvency. But again, this spreads
widen if the market is (25:54) works at around (25:56) for us.
So, the VA is a bit of dampener in both directions. So, it takes away the fungible when the
part is getting up. But again, it provides (26:05) when the market is turning against us. So,
in Q4, we still have months to go. Take the SCR at your RT1, but adjust for the
technicalities from the VA. And of course, in the ﬁnal year number, we're also putting
number ex-dividend. But we'll give you full disclosure on that and the fourth quarter
numbers.
As far as the Generali Nederland is concerned, we have not closed. We're in this interbalance between signing and closing. There is interaction, but we're very careful on not
sharing undue information on the business whilst we're not oﬃcially the owner. So, we're
preparing the integration, but don't have control on the business. And this is not the time
and the place to report on the results of Generali NL. I think it's something for Generali to
report. But again, there's nothing there yet that keeps me awake at night, if that could
help you answer the question.

Absolutely. Thank you.

The next question is from Albert Ploegh from ING. Go ahead, please sir. Oh, one moment.
(27:19)

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

...from my end. First, looking at the investment portfolio and the re-risking budget
potentially for Q4, yeah, should we expect any re-risking of investment book in Q4 or
maybe the ﬁrst half of next year? So, maybe there are some guidance around a couple of
consumption of that. And the second question is on the cost result in Life. I think that it
was clearly down year-on-year. You're ﬂagging cost discipline. Can you maybe give some
color on potential additional measures to address the cost base on the Life side?
And the third question is a bit more the top-down on the – let's say, on the target set at
the time of the IPO where you're clearly ahead on many. I know Q3 is probably not a
(28:09) stage to come back on the targets, but how are you looking at your, let's say,
overall combined ratio group targets that was set at the IPO and where you're currently
running and also on your, let's say, return on equity as well. So, should we expect some
sharpening of targets maybe at the full-year stage? Thank you.

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

All right. Albert, thank you. On the investment portfolio, we've gone through a signiﬁcant
re-risking program that is by and large now completed. So, don't expect a re-risking run in

Page 8 of 20



Company Name: ASR Nederland NV
Company Ticker: ASRNL NA Equity
Date: 2017-11-29

FINAL

Q4. That's not something that will add or take away – so, it will add solvency but not take
away solvency because the re-risking basically is done. At this very point, we are actually
running the strategic asset allocation studies. It's going to be on the board's agenda in
the coming weeks.
So, early to say whether we'll continue to re-risk. My last (29:06) tells me there is some
opportunity to continue to re-risk during the year given our solvency base. But it hasn't
been formally decided yet. That's something we'll give you more color and when we do
the full-year results because by that time, we'll have the formal decision making around it.
But there could be some opportunity there, but not in Q4. And we need to weigh your
core (29:28) development in the market as well.
In terms of cost that's been in Life, you will see – I guess, what you saw in the year is a
short decline on the cost result on Life, the result on cost which is a function of the
declining Life book. We are countering that by migrating all our policies to variable cost
platforms and by taking down staﬀ costs as well, shrinking the cost base. I think that is
going in line. The migrations are happening as planned. You will see the majority of the
migrations behind us in 2018. So, we've done a couple of complicated ones and that
we've been successful in that.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, with that, I think, our cost countering measures in terms of migration and shedding
individual staﬀ are going as planned. So, I would believe that the cost results from here, I
think the worse is behind us and you'll see some stability at least for the coming period.
Perhaps in the long run, if the book really declines further, we'll need to take further
measures, measures within the medium term, we're comfortable with the measure we're
taking on the cost side. And you'll gradually see more stable cost results in Life.
In terms of our targets, as you rightly point out, a trading update is not the venue, the
place, the time to revisit the oﬃcial targets. But actually, if you look at the results today, it
would be hard to argue that we would not be comfortable where we are. It would be very
complicated where we're saying, actually we're doing well, we're doing very good on our
targets. But the trading update is not really the moment to go into details on that. But the
business is doing better than that.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Good. Maybe one brief follow-up on the cost result, you mentioned the migration to the
more variable cost platforms, and by and large, that seems incompleted. So, are you
basically ready and maybe – and then, the second question will be also willing to consider
maybe to add some small cluster books on your existing platforms or is that not yet on the
agenda?

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Okay. Actually, we're doing it. There's again – if you look at the Generali business, it has a
small- to mid-sized Life business, €100 million premium equivalent life insurance book.
So, the Generali deal was actually will be the ﬁrst test on the actual integration. I mean,
Page 9 of 20

FINAL

there's a bit of pensions in there, but the Generali Life Insurance business de facto is a
small closed life lock.
So, I think sneakily we started doing that on the back of what a – basically with a Non-life
oriented transaction. There's a life closed lock that comes along. That will be interesting
ﬁrst test to see how we manage that migration. I think the teams are conﬁdent that they
can actually pull oﬀ this migration in parallel to the existing migration that was so hard to
do. And when that's in progress, then we know for sure how good we are about it and we
have got to yield proof point. But the Generali one eﬀectively, Albert, is the ﬁrst life closed
lock transaction that we're adding on our Life business.

Good morning. Thank you very, very much for taking my question. Firstly, there's
obviously been a very, very big merger in the Netherlands between two companies
involved in pensions and also Life and Non-life. In the context of the Non-life business,
ﬁrstly, I mean what impact is this having on the landscape in the short term while these
guys are busy trying to integrate? But in the longer term, what do you think it might do to
tariﬀ increases, generally the market? Do you think this could be a positive development?
That's kind of question one.
And question two, on the DB business speciﬁcally, what do you think is outstanding in
terms of generically in terms of acquisition opportunities from others that want to shut
down or leave either that market? Do you think that there is still quite a lot of potential
both in bulk and in companies in the DB space to acquire? Thank you.

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

On the larger merger, I think generally, we applaud consolidation in the Dutch insurance
market. So, here let me say, it's a bit like the French Revolution, right? We can't say if this is
successful or not. But in principle, the merger between NN and Delta Lloyd takes out a
competitor. So, we think, in general, it's good. We do expect it to support rational pricing
in the market. We do expect it to support healthier developments whether it will lead to
increased tariﬀ increases. But I think there is a trend of hardening in a market today which
is happening kind of independent from the NN-Delta Lloyd merger. I mean if you – we're
seeing competitors that have unproﬁtable books and increasing prices no matter what
happens in The Hague or not.
So, it's a bit disconnected. I think in general, we're seeing a hardening market. We have
seen a hardening market. I personally believe that you will now see a slight pause when it
comes to tariﬀ increases because most of our peers have gone through a signiﬁcant

round of price increases and people will see – want to see how the dust settles before we
resume that trend. So, I would expect healthier market going forward possibly to be
continuing to next year. But a little pause today because most of our peers and as
everybody wants to see, if you have come through a 10% price increase, what does that
do?
Secondly, taking out a competitor is always a good thing. So, we think this will support a
more structural rational pricing in the market. When it comes to volumes, hard to see. I
mean, there is volumes coming our way, isn't always easy to see where it actually comes
from.
When it comes to deﬁned beneﬁt books, I think very few people today write new DB
business. We see some competitors coming up with interesting pricing on DB contracts.
And we're happy to let go of those. So, on deﬁned beneﬁt and bulk annuities, the market
is fairly quiet. Most customers that we see are contemplating deﬁned contribution or APF
solutions from new business and seeing what to do with the existing business. Little
volumes today, little appetite from competitors as far as I can see.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, that market – that part of market relatively slow. There could be opportunities, but we
are very conﬁdent of the capital consumption of bulk annuities. They tend to be more
capital-intensive business. So, we've got very strict return hurdles. We'll try to do them on
a reinsured basis, and that could be our ﬁrst perspective is always reinsure the deal to
limit capital consumption in our book. And that's how we look at it. At this point, the
market is actually very quiet and the action is actually in the DC space. That's where the
excitement is on the pensions market.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

If I may, just quickly return on that topic, I mean, do you think you need the DB book to
write DC?

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

No, we don't.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

A bigger one. Okay.

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

It helps – it don't – you don't. If you look at the DC business either various DC players that
have – do not have a DB business to write this. I think DC, the name of the game is scale.
One is scale, you get good pricing and get margins. Second is portals. So, clients for
some reason still want workstation, workplace marketing and also to portals. Surprisingly,
there were usage of the actual portals, but still customers want to see it.
So, I think the success factor in DC is more volume, is durability – ability and willingness to
invest in portals and systems, and then it's good decent investment results, that together

drives success in DC. Having a deﬁned beneﬁt book on the side helps, but it's not the
determining factor. I mean, it helps to say to their client, look, if you bring your DC
business to me, we're willing to consider your DB book as well, but that that's – that is the
order of the discussion that we're having, not the other way around. And I think having a
deﬁned beneﬁt book helps, but if we – it doesn't necessarily change the outcome of the
selection process in deﬁned contribution.

The next question is from Robin van den Broek, Mediobanca. Go ahead, please, sir.

Q - Robin van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good morning, everybody. My ﬁrst question is on the impact of UFR coming through
as of next year. I was just wondering if you can share your thoughts how this might speed
up the consolidation in the funeral insurance business given the fact that that business will
have a quite long duration, so maybe your thoughts there.
Second, with the H1 results, you were very helpful in giving some color on the
outperformance of the long-term investment margins. And I was wondering if the run rate
you mentioned with H1 basically saying that if you would align assumptions with peers
and you would get a gun against your head, capital generation could be €50 million to
€100 million higher. Is that the similar run rate you would see in Q3?
And thirdly is on the pending standard formula revision which is quite a lengthy
document. I was just wondering if you could share maybe some initial thoughts on the
potential impact for ASR. Seems that, in particular, NHG mortgages could get a more
favorable treatment which for you guys is about, I think, 10% of the asset mix. So, that
could be quite a big positive move for you. That's it for me. Thank you.

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Thank you, Robin. (39:50). Well, as you are about to point a gun to my head, I'm very glad
we're doing this (39:55) rather than a physical meeting. But in any case, I'll still answer
your question even without the gun, Robin.
Now, when it comes to the UFR lowering, as far as the lowering of the UFR, we'll shave
about 3 points of solvency given where the development is, which for us is a not so much
a material – it's an immaterial event. It will take us from solvency and add back some ﬂow.
So, it's a trade of moving stock, stock and ﬂow. What does it do to funeral insurance
companies? You'd have to ask them. I think it's – for funeral insurance companies, it's a
lower UFR could be a challenge. If you refer to the EIOPA consultation paper, there is a
discussion on mortality charges which might be diﬃcult for any funeral business.

Page 12 of 20

FINAL

Generally speaking, I would say, whatever happens in Solvency II, and I make a step to
your third question, the more diversiﬁed you are, the better your shield is against changes
in models, changes in regulation. So, what does it do to funeral insurance companies?
Deﬁnitely it will be a challenge for them to absorb a lower UFR, to absorb a higher
mortality charge. But what does it do strategically, I mean I don't know. You'd have to –
really you'd have to ask them. But it helps deﬁnitely a diversiﬁed business.
When it comes to the EIOPA consultation paper, if I jump on that. It is a consultation
paper. And if you look at the past – I mean, from consultation paper to ﬁnal
recommendation has seen signiﬁcant movement and shifts. In terms of timing, we expect
end of Feb advice (41:37) to the European Commission. Then, the European Commission
will debate, discuss, and then, convert some or all of it into law. And we expect the ﬁnal to
be introduced kind of January 1, 2020.
In that document, with just 200 pages of hard work through all of that stuﬀ – I mean, there
are still really many, many moving parts. It's kind of hard to say what the outcome will be.
If you look at the document and you actually manage to reach the large – last page, which
is an achievement per se, there are – a couple of points that – let me share with you (42:18)
we look at without giving you a ﬁnal conclusion (42:23), I mean, we look at the
recalibration of premium risk, that's a piece on premium risk recalibration. There's a
discussion of recalibration of mortality risk which is of interest.

Bloomberg Transcript

Indeed, the document recognizes that any de-mortgages, government guarantee product
should have a lower counterparty charge. There's a portion on interest rate risk where
EIOPA discusses a number of alternatives downward shocks.
And ﬁnally, there's a PFD thesis (42:57) on LACDT where you ﬁnd interestingly that for
most elements, the document gives options and recommendations or emerging
recommendations. LACDT is the only component whereas there's no blue box (43:11) with
a clear advice. EIOPA just makes notes of diﬀerent applications across Europe. So, those
are the ﬁve points that we've been and we are studying and trying to get through.
There are many moving parts. Each of those ﬁve parts can move individually, so – but
some of those parts can also move signiﬁcantly. So, this is – it's too early to draw a
conclusion from it. But our view is – if I go through it and look at all those moving parts
and see what the upsides and the downsides are, note ﬁrst is, having a diversiﬁed
business helps, the monoline business are much more vulnerable to a single change and
diversiﬁcation – diversiﬁed businesses.
Secondly, I feel pretty conﬁdent with this. I mean, I lie awake from the line of work that
comes from this, we do not get lie awake from the outcomes of those results. But also we
know that at this point, it's mere speculation and we don't know what the ultimate
outcome will be. So, I've given you the ﬁve matter of substance that we look at that could
have each individually an impact. But collectively, they might diversify, might mitigate and
might result in a reasonably ﬂat outcome. And that's kind of the best where we hope for at
this point in time. And the more we – can we say more when we see the ﬁnal results.

FINAL

And when it comes to your question on OCC, indeed if you look at the long-term
investment margin in the actual spreads that we have, you'll ﬁnd that the entire ﬁxed
income book, (44:51) govies including mortgages is about ﬂat versus the LTIM. So, as the
beginning of the year, our LTIM assumption on governance actually overstates the actual
returns on the mortgages. It understates the actual returns, but the ﬁxed income book is
relatively ﬂat.
The accrual of liability still assumes a VA of 20 (45:10) . Well, I think that actually is an
understatement of the actual – understatement of the actual VA and thereby
understatement of the actual OCC. And equities and real estate have done well. So, in the
quarter, our organic capital generation added about 2.5 points, and then the net of all the
other points added another 2 points to our solvency, to 2 points of market movements.

Bloomberg Transcript

And if you zoom in on that 2 points of market – actually the market movement was a bit
higher than 2 points. But during the quarter or during the year, we are observing a higher
level of lapses in the life insurance business. Dutch people are redeeming their policies,
most notably to pay down mortgages. So, we've modeled through a structurally higher
lapse level. We think it's fair to see these observations are there for nine months. You'd
have to put them through in your best estimates.
So, in the bucket other, when it comes to solvency movements, the net eﬀect is 2 points,
but there's a gross eﬀect that's market a plus and a small minus for models to lapses that
gives you 2 points. So, that illustrate that we believe that the ultimate assumption we've
used are still reasonably conservative, and there's a structure continued adding to
solvency from that. So, it's a very long-winded answer, but I want it to be as complete as
possible.

{BIO 20166878 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. A few questions remaining. First is on P&C, can you be a bit more
speciﬁc on the quantum of the rate increases you've implemented there, ﬁrst of all? And I
also wonder, to what extent, the hardening of the markets you referred to, to what extent
that's a reﬂection of higher claims inﬂation that could be expected going forward. So,
yeah, should we, in other words, expect the combined ratios to beneﬁt or not from the
higher rates? Secondly, just to continue on regulation. Next to EIOPA, there was also a
DNB document on supervision, supervisory outlook. Just eager to get your thoughts on
whether or not there was anything impactful or worth mentioning there?
And then lastly, on capital. As I look at your solvency position pro forma for the AT1 and
Generali, it still looks quite strong. So can you elaborate on how you plan to spend any

On P&C tariﬀ increases, think order of magnitude 5% on generic motor house, what have
you. So think about the 5% is order of magnitude in terms of price increases. That would,
by the way, feed in gradually, right? It's 5% on new business and then the same 5% on
renewals, and that will take about 12 months to be fully factored in before the existing
client base is completely renewed. I don't think, at this point, it's a function of claims
inﬂation. It's a function of the combined ratios and claims ratios as they were, as they are
today. So if you look at the Dutch P&C market, the cohort of P&C insurers, that is a – at the
low margins on P&C business.
So I think tariﬀ increases are more a function of proﬁt as it is today than a reﬂection on
expected in claims inﬂation or tariﬀ inﬂation in general. So that's not in the cards yet. And
honestly, we don't see at this point major claims inﬂation. There is some upward push in
the bodily injury side, less so which is not so much claims inﬂation but more a regulatory
change. We've seen some action in the market there. Again, we have looked carefully and
are also looking carefully at our portfolio. There's no reason to add to (49:48) reserves
there. But on bodily injuries, the only area where you can see prices moving up in
response to general claims inﬂation but at a speciﬁc market segment.
Nothing for us with the existing book; it's just this is where we are very careful in pricing
new business. DNB supervisory outlook, nothing to report there. I mean, we are taking
note of the EIOPA documentations. We are taking note of the exit value discussions of
DNB, but nothing that concerns us in particular.
When it comes to Solvency, indeed you will see in the coming months adding the RT1,
taking out Generali, would give still a relatively high number on the standard model. What
do we do with all of this? Our strict criteria is the cost of capital, the cost of equity. To be
very precise, the cost of unrestricted Tier 1, to be fully still compliant in Solvency speak, we
consider to be 10%. So anything we view need to exceed 10%, ideally 12%. So the four
areas we have to deploy this capital is market risk, which is most straightforward and
simple to execute where we also look at the return on capital applied should also be
substantially north of 10%. And secondly, we would like our market risk budget to stay less
than 50% of our total risk because, after all, we're an insurance company, not an
investment ﬁrm. So there could be deployment in market risk as long as the return on
additional market risk capital exceeds 10% by a margin and as long as the total market risk
does not exceed 50%.

Then we'll be looking at acquisitions. And as we continue to do, we believe there are
opportunities in the Dutch markets. They will take time to develop, will take time to
mature, and we'll also be very much aware that P&C and individual life business is
probably busy during the year integrating, and you can't load acquisitions on
acquisitions. You want to make sure that what you acquire is fully and eﬀectively
integrated. So if we do something else, you probably see it more in the adjacent
businesses than in the P&C and life business as such. So we also look – and our return
hurdle is 12%, return on tangible capital, and that's pretty clear for us.
And then there is giving capital back to shareholders through dividends, share buybacks,
is something that we add always on the cart. Don't expect a share buyback in the
remaining four weeks of this year. But next year, we'll look at our distribution policy where
we look at the actual dividend. We'll also be looking at an interim dividend next year, safe
to say, and that will together make up a decent amount of capital distribution to
shareholders. And then, Matthias, it depends a bit on how the acquisition space develop
and what we see there.

Your next question is from Ashik Musaddi, JPMorgan. Go ahead please, sir.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Thank you. Just a couple of question. First of all, after you raised those recent debt, it
looks like your IFRS leverage ratio is more or less around 30%, maybe a couple of points
lower. So how do we think about that IFRS leverage, how hard (53:33) of 30%? Is that
relevant or you can be at around 30%, 40% for a longer term as well. So that's something.
One question.
The second question is how should we think about this realized gains that you book on
the Life earnings because for the past three years this number has gone up. So is it fair to
say that next year also this number could go up because you have a lot of reserves in that
or is it a formula as to how this number moves because based on my understanding,
shadow accounting means your total investment income should not move up, your direct
income goes down but your realized gains as well goes up. But it looks like the realized
gains is obviously going up every quarter. So any thoughts on those formula?
And thirdly, it would be a bit simple if we can move to a bit more market consistent
assumption on the ﬁxed income assets for OCC just because to see what is the real
number versus the assumed numbers. So just a suggestion but totally up to you. Thank
you.

All right. Very good, Ashik. When it comes to the leverage ratio on IFRS, basically it moves
towards the 30%. I think we'll end the year still below 30% as far as I can see if I have a
look at our balance sheet. So it will be south of 30%. I think 30% is a decent number. I
think we – in the ratings space that we have in our own (55:05). We could move up to
40%, but 40% we consider to be a relatively high number. So something at around 30% is
something that we feel very comfortable with. End of the year, we'll probably be
somewhere below 30% given what I know, what I can see today. Depends a bit how book
equity develops. I mean, you can also look at – it depends a bit on how you deﬁne your
book equity, right?
We don't have realized capital gains in our book equity. We did have unrealized capital
gains in our book equity. So if you will look at our leverage ratio compared to book
equity, 30% to 40% is actually pretty ﬁne. If you look at it compared to our own funds, our
leverage is still relatively low. So I'm pretty comfortable with where we are, and I think the
headline number will drop a bit in the last couple of months of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

When it comes to the realized capital gains reserve, actually, interestingly I have no
control on this number. I mean, it's a formulaic approach. When you realize a capital gain
because you change an asset, actually the capital gain is amortized over the lifetime of the
corresponding liability. So it's a given. I mean, the only way I could tweak it is by realizing
huge amounts of capital gains, then the number would go up. But then you would
immediately see it in my IFRS equity when equity goes up because of capital gains
realizations, and that's something you do not see at this point. So it's not that we're
gaming or playing. It's a bit...

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

No, no. I mean this is what I'm not able to understand is why will it go up. I mean, I get
your point that you're not tweaking anything. But then you mentioned that you can realize
more capital gain, put it in the reserve, and then that number will go up. This is what I'm
not able to understand. Why could it go up even in that scenario. So anyways, maybe we
can take it oﬄine.

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

(56:58) that number goes up but, I mean, there's something else goes down. I mean – so
in principle, you're right. Then if the numbers goes up, your direct investment income
should go down and the sum of the two stays (57:11). What you ﬁnd today is that the direct
investment income has gone up because we risk and move to other more yieldy asset
classes. So that actually compensates that development. Where we are today, it's about
€3.5 billion in terms of reserves. I would expect this number to be relatively stable in the
coming year. I mean, this year has gone up due to a variety of reasons, mostly technical in
nature. But going forward, expect the release of the capital gains reserve to be stable.
That is the way I planned it.

interesting point. We also include the hybrid expenses and hybrid charges in the OCC.
We did about €50 million a year which others I think do not. See, there is no one
consistent OCC deﬁnition. Your point is noted. Something to chew on. We'll try to give
you as much color as we can, but also not (58:20) change them all over time. And in

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks. Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions. Just in terms of the cash in
the holding company, I guess at the ﬁrst half you had cash in the holding that stood
around about €200 million, and that was before the buyback and the acquisition, so
you've obviously raised money. So where are you in terms of cash? And then also, just in
terms of the operating proﬁt. In terms of some of your assets that are mark-to-market
through the P&L, is there any mark-to-marketing of some of those assets through the P&L
in the operating line or not? And then ﬁnally, just in terms of, again, the realized gains
were higher than it has been. So how much higher is it above the normalized level? Thank
you.

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Can you repeat the last question? I didn't get your last question completely.

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

Just in terms of the realized gains. You made a note in the press release that the realized
gains were a little bit higher than normal. So how much higher than normal is it?

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Okay. When it comes to cash at holding company, Johnny, it's not a metric we stew on a
lot. I think you are aware. But they are – indeed the holding company has got the
proceeds of the RT1 issuance. What you see during the year, there will be a combination
of things where we will continue to upstream cash on the OpCos. I just told you, the Life
OpCo solvency is above 190 and P&C above 180. So expect a couple of points. Expect
some further upstreaming from the OpCos during the year. We'll end the year with a cash
level north of €350 million. I'm pretty comfortable with that. But it's not something we
spend a lot of time on. We rather have the cash in the OpCos but it will be north of €350
million by the end of the year for sure. But if anything, it's played there. I mean, there is
Page 18 of 20

tax payment, there is pension charges, there's upstream, et cetera. So we'll feed them into
– together. If you think about the capital – in the operating results, there is no real mark-tomarket. That means all the mark-to-market that are not in the operating results. The
operating results really contain the direct investment income.

FINAL

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Finally, when it comes to the realized gains, while there's a release of the realized gains
reserve, which is €51 million during the year, (01:01:10) that's kind of a given. I think that
we'll be at that level going forward as a reasonable continuation of that (01:01:17). I can
see what the model spits out. I can see what the model spits out. So if you look at the
investment margin in Life, there are €34 million really higher direct investment income
which is yields, coupons, yields, dividends that are coming in in cash, and it is €51 million
of increased capital gains reserve release. That's (01:01:39) there going to stay.
