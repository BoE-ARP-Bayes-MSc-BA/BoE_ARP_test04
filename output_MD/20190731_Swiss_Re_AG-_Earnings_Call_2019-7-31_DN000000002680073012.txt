Good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to Swiss Re's Half-Year 2019 Results
Conference Call. Please note that today's conference call is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Christian Mumenthaler, Group
CEO. Please go ahead.

Christian Mumenthaler

{BIO 6479864 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good morning and good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to
our half-year 2019 results Q&A call. I'm here with John Dacey, our Group CFO; Edi Schmid,
our Group Chief Underwriting Officer; Andreas Berger, the CEO of Corporate Solutions;
and Philippe Brahin, our Head of Investor Relations.

Before we go to Q&A, I will make a few comments to put today's reported information
into context. Andreas will complement this by adding some additional color on Corporate
Solutions. The Group reported a net income of USD953 million for the first half of 2019,
supported by the strong results of our Reinsurance business unit and reflecting an
excellent investment result. I want to emphasize the very strong performance of P&C Re,
despite significant adverse claims development of Typhoon Jebi in Q1. The enhanced
earnings power of P&C Re, is an improved -- in an improved pricing environment, is
supported by our core strengths: the scale of the business, coupled with a flat expense
base, the diversification via Life & Health Re, our unparalleled client access and the
expertise and risk knowledge built over many decades.
In the year-to-date renewals, we found attractive opportunities to deploy capital and
expect our pretax earnings to increase by more than USD350 million as premiums are
earned. Life & Health Reinsurance continues to deliver very good results, supported by
improved mortality experience in the Americas and portfolio management actions. In
Corporate Solutions, we have now completed the previously announced business and
reserve review, implementing decisive management actions to put the business unit back
on track to profitability. The Group has contributed USD600 million of capital into
Corporate Solutions, restoring its SST capital position to a level, which we consider
adequate. Andreas will tell you more about Corporate Solutions in a few moments.

On to Life Capital. We obviously spent a lot of time and effort in H1 preparing for the
ReAssure IPO. Unfortunately, market conditions were not favorable, and we decided to
suspend the process. We still aim to consolidate this business -- to deconsolidate this
business and we will continue to act in shareholders' best interest.
And with that, I'll hand over to Andreas.

Andreas Berger

{BIO 15171017 <GO>}

Thanks, Christian, and good afternoon to everyone also from my side. I'd like to make a
few remarks on the work undertaken at Corporate Solutions since I took over on 1st of
March this year. We conducted a comprehensive review of our portfolio and left no stone
unturned. Specifically, we looked at historic profitability and volatility both for Corporate
Solutions and for the market; potential market size; legal trends; as well as our ability to
efficiently service customers and provide a product that is differentiated from
competitors.
Through this thorough review, we identified the business lines where we wanted to focus
our profitability growth and those, which needed to be addressed. The pruning actions
focused on 35% of the book and are expected to decrease our premiums by
approximately 20% of our book. The remaining portfolio is in much better shape, and we
also benefit from the positive rate momentum observed in commercial insurance. In the
first half of 2019, the risk-adjusted price quality of Corporate Solutions portfolio improved
by 9%. We expect pricing momentum to continue in the second half, but also beyond that.

FINAL

As part of our detailed reserve review, we analyzed case reserves mostly related to prior
accident year large losses and strengthened reserves where appropriate. The majority of
the development was in recent accident years 2017 and 2018. From a line of business
perspective, liability, predominantly North America liability, and property were the most
impacted. In order to protect Corporate Solutions back book, an adverse development
cover was put in place with P&C Reinsurance business unit, and we have set up our
tactical and strategic reinsurance protection to reduce volatility going forward.
As another outcome of our strategic review, I have installed a new management team,
our executive committee for CorSo, ensuring all parts of our business are represented at
our leadership table. This ensures that our decisions taken are based on input from all
relevant areas and that we deliver to our customers quickly and consistently across
geographies. We're confident that these decisive actions will drive a turnaround in the
performance of Corporate Solutions and expect to achieve 98% combined ratio in 2021.
With that, I'll hand over to Philippe to introduce the Q&A session.

Thank you, Andreas, and good day to all of you also from my side. So as usual, before we
start the Q&A, I'd like to remind you to please restrict yourselves to two questions each
and then register again if you have follow-up questions. So with that, operator, could we
please take the first question?

Questions And Answers
Operator
The first question comes from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi, there. I think the first question is for Eddie. Could you give us a sense as to what the
nominal rate increase was year-to-date and in July if you didn't allow for higher loss costs?
Because I think your plus one and plus two has some reflection of higher loss costs in it.
And on renewal, are you playing in the very high layers? Because I noticed your Nat Cat
PML went up considerably again from the year-end, but obviously that's not matched by
the sort of volume of Nat Cat premium. So where exactly is the best-priced Nat Cat
business in the US now, what layer? Is it being found that?
And secondly, on CorSo, I'm still not sure of the longer-term ambition. Is it still to generate
a 10% to 15% ROE? It doesn't look like the 98% combined in today's interest rate
environment with a book that's becoming shorter tail is enough to get you there. And also
on the strategy, is it still the aim to expand into Global Master and, generally, just further
down the layers from excess. Is that still the long-term ambition? Thanks.

Thanks, Andrew. I think it's more, like, four questions, but that's okay. Go ahead, Edi.

FINAL

A - Edi Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Okay. On the first one, Andrew, regarding the price increase and how does this relate to,
let's say, adjustment to models, that's basically what you were asking about. So yeah, we
have adjusted our loss models in some part of the business, where we had new learnings.
In Japan, out of Jebi, we adjusted the model to some extent, and obviously there was the
experience with the wildfires in California, where we also took action and made the loss
model a bit more conservative. So the 1% does actually reflect this. So without these
adjustments, the price increase would look a bit better. But it's fair to say this would not
make a huge difference.

Bloomberg Transcript

Obviously, we need to see -- this 1% is across a very broad-based portfolio, which has a
lot of cat business, but also a big quota share business. So the 1% really needs to be seen
in that context. So it would be a bit better, but even, I think 1% across these weighted
average portfolio is a significant improvement, which also explains why our combined ratio
estimate moved from 100% two years ago, 99% last year, and now we are comfortable
to get to the 98%.
And the second part of your question is regarding the Nat Cat growth. It's fair to say that
this is geared more towards the peak perils: hurricane US, earthquake. So the increase in
exposure measured in valued risk, which we disclose externally, is more pronounced than
the increase in premium and expected loss. So that explains why it's not moving in sync. I
don't think you can put out any, let's say, layers which we prefer. It's really across the
board. We look at it on a client and deal by deal basis. Also, quite a few of these cat deals
are structured in the form of a transaction. So it's not really possible to point to any one
area.
There's a lot of factors that really come together and boil down to what we think is now a
very adequately priced cat portfolio. That's why we felt very comfortable to deploy more
capital. We are confident it will turn into an attractive return on capital because we have all
the diversification and it will boil down to significant contribution to earnings at the end of
the day.

A - John Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Okay. I'll take the CorSo question, Andrew. First of all, on your ROE target, we have no
reason to change the ROE target for CorSo, which stands at 10% to 15%. With our
ambition and target for 2021 [ph] with 98%, we think we should end up at the lower end
of our target corridor. So we're pretty comfortable on that one. On the longer-term
ambition, first of all, the focus this time here for the half-year results is profitability, restore
profitability to set the foundation for future growth. And we'll come back in November,
obviously, at the Investor Day to be a bit more specific on our strategy, going forward,
with a strategic vision. We call it Strategic Vision '23 Plus.
Now on your Primary Lead, all I can say is, yes, this is the right move. It's quite logical that
for a company like Swiss Re and Swiss Re Corporate Solutions, with the expertise, the risk

FINAL

knowledge and everything on technical capabilities that we have, we should drop down
from excess positions. We should go down from wholesale markets more to where the
risk is to primary layers, because that's where we can differentiate and where you also get
the premium levels that you require in order to sustainably meet also your target on the
ROE side. I think we can declare victory in penetrating the Primary Lead markets. We've
invested a lot of money into people, into capabilities, and I think this is a tick in a box for
us.
On the Global Master program business, this is sort of my home turf, I truly believe that
there are very few players, who really can play in this segment. We are probably one of
the few ones that have identified a key differentiator, which is the delivery of the program.
A lot of competitors in this segment struggle due to IT legacy. We've developed a stateof-the-art technology platform to deliver Global Master programs. I think this is something
we're going to capitalize on and you will hear much more on our November Investor Day,
but I'm very comfortable and very confident that we would have success with this one.
That's the feedback that we get from clients and from brokers.

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Great. Thanks, Andrew, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please.

Bloomberg Transcript

The next question comes from Kamran Hossain from RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon everyone. Three questions. The first one, coming back to CorSo. I
mean, my read of it is that it looks like an exceptionally good job there and I'm really
pleased you're addressing it. But when you think about CorSo, it might not be one for
Andreas, it might be one for Christian, but could you maybe talk about the similarities
between the Life & Health changes a few years ago and the Corporate Solutions
restructuring changes that actually you've announced today? Is this -- what's your degree
of confidence in -- here we make changes here and then we can move on and anticipate
much better results? So that's the first question. The second question, I saw the
comments about ReAssure and committed to reducing the stake. You didn't make any
comment about the second tranche of the buyback. How should we think about that for
now? Thank you.

A - Christian Mumenthaler

{BIO 6479864 <GO>}

Thanks, Kamran. So on the comparison of [ph] Life & Health it's actually an interesting
question. So to me there's some parallels and some differences. I think the parallel I
would drive is that when a business starts to get into trouble it's not a good idea to bleed
it out over many years, even though that might be the first instinct because it's too hard
to face reality. So I think clearly, my aim was to take on the learnings from Life & Health
and apply them to Corporate Solutions, which is why so much work has gone into these
two quarters, right, on all different aspects, and the choices we made are painful. I think
the difference is that obviously Life & Health is a much less volatile business. And CorSo,
whatever we do, if there's a big Nat Cat, it's going to hit CorSo, and there's not much I

FINAL

can do, whereas in Life & Health, I think some of these results are much smoother and
easier to predict.
What's also difficult to predict is ultimately where will the trends go in US casualty, in
particular, where we saw some underlying trends increase. We had to make some
assumptions, but obviously nothing is ever certain. So I'd say we tried our best. We also
through the ADC cover protect some of the old reserves. I wanted to make sure the
team has a real chance to start from here. But I'm also aware that there are some, and
you are aware that there are some, risk factors, which could affect them. But I would hope
that the underlying program that Andreas has come up with to me is very plausible and
executable because of price increase in the market. I mean, we can prune; pruning is part
of it. But I think, frankly, it's the price increases, which are really, really needed and
necessary and coming through at this stage, which make this plan in my view executable.
Do you want to -- John do you want the second one?

A - John Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. And with respect to the share buyback, first of all, just reiterate that the first tranche
of 1 billion is well on track. As of yesterday we've completed about 45% of it and look to
continue to execute that over the coming months. As we said before, the second tranche
is not dependent necessarily on the ReAssure IPO; but rather, more broadly, on the
excess capital position during the course of the year and the second half of the year, in
particular.
Unambiguously, I think it's safe to say that not doing the ReAssure IPO will make it a little
less likely that we find ourselves with excess capital after we finish the first tranche of the
buyback. But let's see how the next three months go, and we will give you an update I
think on October 31st when we release our Q3 results. Obviously, there's a lot of moving
parts here. The good news is, we're finding the ability to deploy real capital in the P&C Re
business, as well as in Life and Health. But with a fairly strong first half and expectations of
a strong second half of the year, we'll build back up the earnings and, therefore, the
overall capital of the Group.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Thanks, Kamran for your questions. Can we have the next question, please.

Operator
Our next question is from the line of Vikram Gandhi from Societe Generale. Please go
ahead.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Hi, it's Vikram, SocGen. Thank your for taking my questions. Firstly, on CorSo, referring to
slides 17 and 19, I'm a bit confused as to how should we integrate the 9% rate increase in
the first half alone against the 6 percentage points combined ratio improvement from

Page 6 of 23



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2019-07-31

FINAL

rate increases by 2021? Is it just because the expected losses has changed? Or is there
something else?
And secondly, on P&C Re, on the one hand it's -- the slides 30 and 31 say the price
increases for the Nat Cat business were mostly flat, apart from the loss-affected treaties,
while on the other hand we see that the Nat Cat exposure has increased significantly. So
just wondered why the sudden increase in appetite despite the rating momentum clearly
not that strong. Thank you very much.

A - John Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

So on CorSo, the 9% rate increase, this is a risk-adjusted increase. The 9% in first half of
2019 reflects the year-on-year increase in risk-adjusted price quality of Corporate
Solutions on the total portfolio. That also includes 2% pruning and business mix changes
and 7% pure rate changes. The 7% rate changes is only for the first half of the year. So
what you find in this walk, in the combined ratio walk, this is obviously then projected also
to the three years until 2021. That's the difference.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Edi, do you want to take the P&C Re question?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Edi Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Yeah. So the question is that the Nat Cat price increases this year seem rather moderate
while we grow a lot. I think that's the gist of the question. If you look at it a bit over two
years, I think out of the record loss year '17, we pushed a lot of price increases into '18,
and we could achieve a significant quality improvement of the book, but we also let go
quite a bit of shares. Into this year now, in a further improving pricing environment, even
though not massively, it made a lot of sense for us to recapture share, but also grow the
Nat Cat business because the quality we have in our book and we can achieve in the
market, clearly is attractive. Given our global diversification and Life & Health
diversification, this Nat Cat business achieves a very attractive return on capital. What
we've seen in this year, that business that has been significantly loss affected, like wind
business in Japan or Florida business, we saw significant rate increases, 15%.
But it's fair to say in a lot of other places pricing line was more flattish. But the quality of
the business we've put on board is very adequate, and that's why it made a lot of sense
to deploy more capital into that space. What we've also done, we seeded a bit more to
serve the capital investors, so the business that goes beyond our appetite cannot be
readily diversified. We see it more towards some long-term, third-party capital providers
to make sure, over all, we keep a balanced book and always in our risk appetite. But it's a
very attractive space, the Nat Cat area, where we have demonstrated over many years
that we understand this risk very well. So we feel very comfortable to deploy more capital,
and we are confident it will turn into good contribution to earnings.

The next question is from Edward Morris from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. The first is just on the $350 million that you
talk about the increase in net earnings from renewals achieved so far year-to-date. I
wonder if you could just help us in thinking about how quickly that is likely to earn through
into the results. And also if we take into account how interest rates have evolved over the
course of the year, where does that put you relative to your 10% to 15% ROE ambition in
P&C?
And then, secondly, Edi, just picking up on that point about the increased use of thirdparty capital for Nat Cat business, something that Swiss Re hasn't in the past done a huge
amount of. I wonder if you could just elaborate on why now you've decided to do more of
that. Is it because you're getting closer to your thresholds of what you would like in Nat
Cat? Or if you could just talk a bit more about that strategic change? Thanks.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

John, do you want to take the first slot [ph].

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Sure. So on the $350 million, you should expect that gets earned I think largely over the
next two years. There might be a little bit of a tail into a third year. But the business that's
come on starting with January 1, April, June, July renewals all we expect to help out here.
Also, don't forget that part of the strength of this portfolio was some relatively short-tail,
SME-focused casualty underwriting that we put in place with a publicly identified
transaction with AmTrust at the beginning of the year. So net-net, we're comfortable with
these new earnings. The point you mention about a decrease in interest rates is a
challenge for us. It's a challenge for the industry.
We're pretty proud of being able to maintain the running yield at 2.9% in the first half of
this year. We'll be challenged to keep that up going into 2020 if rates continue their
recent path here. But in the meantime I think we're comfortably in place with our target
return on equity in P&C Re when we get our combined ratio delivering at a 98%. If the
price rises that we've seen coming through during the course of this year continue, I think
we should be comfortable also in 2020 with the underwriting of the book. With respect to
the retrocessions, I'd argue that this is not necessarily a change of strategy, just an
expansion of some capabilities that we've always had. But Edi, why don't you explain
where we are?

A - Edi Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks, John for leading. I mean, it's fair to say P&C Re was at the forefront to
establish third-party capital maybe 20 years ago by introducing ILS and so on and so forth.
And it's fair to say we have always been using third-party capital, but we didn't make a big
fuss about it as maybe other players have done. But it's -- clearly, we believe Nat Cat is a
Page 8 of 23

FINAL

very attractive business for the Swiss Re balance sheet, given the diversification, our client
franchise, the proprietary risk modeling we have. We are the natural home. So it's clearly
our ambition to remain a leader in the Nat Cat business. And given the growth by just all
the risk factors, the concentration of values in exposed areas, all this together just means
this is a growing risk pool where we want to play in substantially.
And we already have a certain maximum appetite for hurricane U.S. and some other peak
perils. So we get for some of these perils close to these levels. So for us it makes sense
then to get as much of this attractive business on our balance sheet and diversify it.
Where it becomes too big, there it makes sense to share it with some long-term, thirdparty capital investors. We've done that in the past, and given the growth outlook which
just be paid that we can also use more of that as we see fit.

A - John Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

And just for the absence of doubt, the vast majority of the business we write gross
remains on our balance sheet net.

The next question comes from the line of Jon Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thanks for taking my questions. Just focusing on reserves. So did you spot
anything in P&C Re reserving that weren't intentional discussion during the CorSo reserve
review? What drove the P&C Re reserve additions in casualty in the period? And what's
your expectations for casualty reserve development from here in the context of some
peers' flagging higher social inflation? Thank you.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Edi, you want to take it there?

A - Edi Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Yes. I can take the P&C Re reserving question. So as we have said, prior viewed
development, over all, was negative, by 5.1%, in terms of combined ratio points. The
majority of that comes from the Jebi strengthening, which we did in Q1. Otherwise, if you
break it down to lines of business there was some positive on special lines. Property
obviously was quite negative, driven by Jebi, compensated a bit by some favorable from
the hurricanes in 2017. And then you have the casualty reserves, which developed slightly
negatively during the first half of the year. That was stemming from U.S., but only from two
isolated client cases. Over all, we feel very comfortable with the reserve level, also the US
one. As we have explained in the past, we reflected old play strengths and everything in

Page 9 of 23



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2019-07-31

the U.S. So what we have put up now as the reserves there is, in our view, adequate. I
think that's on the reserves.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

FINAL

And I think part of the question was also the look-through from CorSo, the learnings from
CorSo, both underwriting and claims side. Maybe you can say a few words?

A - Edi Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Yes. Obviously, it's important to always compare the two parts. I think one clear element
of the CorSo learning is that we were overexposed to US liability, particularly the large
corporate risk. I think we have flagged that already in the past that we have clearly
spotted that as a general industry trend, that large corporate risk, the development of the
core decisions to settlement just have exploded over the last few years. That's clearly an
area we have addressed on both sides. On CorSo, we have taken significant actions to
reduce that part, but also in Reinsurance we moderate this.

Bloomberg Transcript

What we can say, the Reinsurance casualty portfolio is a much more diversified business.
So it's much more global, much less US focused, and it has a much broader underlying risk
basis. So it's much less focused on these large corporate risks. It has a lot of mid-market
and also SME business. That's why the reserve base also in Reinsurance is much more
diversified and not exposed to these, let's say, very large individual large limits. And you
can also see it in the loss triangles we publish that the Reinsurance reserves are much
more predictable and robust in nature.

A - Philippe Brahin

Okay, good. Thank you, Jonny for your questions. Can we have the next question, please?

The next question comes from the line of Sami Taipalus from Goldman Sachs. Please go
ahead.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Yes. Hi, everyone. The first one, it's just on the SST ratio. I know you haven't disclosed a
number for H1, but is it possible to give -- there's a lot of moving parts. Is it possible to
give some sort of steer on where you are there? And can you just remind us the second
buyback, would that be to avoid building the ratio versus where it was at year-end? Or
should we think about it relative to your target levels of capital? That's number one. And
number two, it seems like your business is getting a bit more capital intensive as you
move into more Nat Cat business. And obviously, the duration of the casualty book has
shrunk, as well. So should we expect that there's a mix shift impact on the combined ratio
going into 2020 as well as a sort of tailwind on pricing? Thank you.

Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2019-07-31

Sure, Sami. So let me start with the SST. As you say, there are a lot of moving parts here,
and we will give you the July 1st estimate of the SST when we report our Q3 results on
October 31st. To help you a little bit with direction, obviously, the capital we deployed in
P&C Re has been or will have ceteris paribus reduced the SST ratio. The first 1 billion of
growth was already in on the January 1 renewals, and so that would have been in the 251%
number that we published. As of January 1, the second billion would be worked through,
and you should think of that to be a reduction of available capital for us or a utilization of
capital. I think on market movements we've got countervailing forces. Credit spreads have
tightened in the US and UK and that's probably positive for us, somewhere between 30
basis points and 40 basis points depending on the market.
On the other hand, interest rates moving down by 60 basis points to 70 basis points will
reduce the SST numbers for us. And that second one is probably going to be a larger
impact, at least in the first 6 months, than the credit spread. So financial markets, net-net,
will be negative. The deployment in P&C Re will also be a reduction. We've had the
earnings, which are reasonable I think for the first half of the year, but as we continue to
deploy capital you should not necessarily expect a lot of other positive moves, absent
something in the markets. So I think we'll see where we are and we'll also see what
happens during the next three months of the hurricane season.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Edi Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

The second part of the question was around the business mix and kind of impact on
duration. I think that's the question. I think it's fair to say looking at the growth we've
achieved this year in P&C Re so far, Nat Cat was a driver and a lot of casualty transactions.
But the underlying business is mainly short-duration, SME type, which is also shortduration. So there is a bit of shift to shorter tail. And it's also fair to say in our portfolio
outlook, given we see the attractiveness of Nat Cat and some other short-tail lines, that
will be a bit of a shift. Given the broad diversification of the book, I think the mix and also
duration is quite robust. So it doesn't change rapidly over time. But a slight shift to a bit
shorter tail, that is a fair assumption into next year.

Good afternoon. It's Simon. First question is for John, I guess. Can you elaborate what you
think is the return on investment on the capital injection into ReAssure and also the 600
million that you invest into CorSo? And the second question I guess goes to Andreas. On
the reserve addition that you're taking in CorSo, is this a, shall we say, academically
actuarial reserve addition? Or did you put in a little bit of a safety cushion there?

Thanks, Simon. Look, I think our belief is the 600 million that we injected into the
Corporate Solutions business positions that business to be successful in the future. As
Andreas mentioned earlier, we expect in 2021 to return not only to an underwriting profit,
but to a return on equity that's within the range, probably a bit at the lower end of that
range, of profitability. So when we think about the IRR of this capital, it's linked to the longterm earnings capability of CorSo, and I think we're pretty comfortable that that's a
reasonably robust return. On the capital put into ReAssure, I think that is a little different
story. Again, in preparation for the IPO we moved the Solvency II capital level from where
it had been, at around 120%, up to something close to 145%. That required a total
injection of GBP480 million, of which we put in 75%, about GBP360 million.
Again, in the long-term value creation of ReAssure, we're confident that this will have a
fine return. To give you a sense of what that could look like, the dividend yield that we
calculated for ReAssure, had it priced at the lower end of the IPO range, would have been
a 9.5% dividend yield, to give you one parameter of the kinds of returns that this business
is capable of. We obviously didn't do the IPO, but we're confident about the business'
ability to deliver. We talk in the document sent out this morning about the GBP2.1 billion
that we expect ReAssure to generate in gross cash generation over the next five years,
2019 included. And with that kind of cash generation we think the GBP265 million of
dividend that they committed to is entirely feasible. If we own 75% of that, that will be a
nice return.

Okay. I'll take the case reserve question whether there's some cushion or buffer built in.
Again, I can only repeat. As we did the strategic review we looked at the portfolio and at
all cases. And here, I must say we looked at all the rules that we had in place, the
timeliness, the accuracy of the claims reserves. And in the roundtables, we looked at the
low, the high point, the midpoint. And all available information that was at hand led us then
to a best estimate, and this is exactly what we have seen here in the numbers in Q2.
In general, we can say that we already saw a trend that started a couple of quarters
before; that was a trend that we acknowledged. And we saw an increased number of
claims, not only at the large end now but also at actually the medium-size one, meaning
the claims between the $5 million and $10 million range. So before we only predominantly
looked at the large ones, and then we saw that below the $10 million range we saw an
increased number of claims closer to the $8 million to $10 million. And I think that's a
reflection of what we have done here. So, best estimate is exactly the right term here.

Hi there. Good afternoon everybody. Just going to the adverse development cover. To
give us a sense or some confidence on whether that will feed through into P&C Re, can
you give us an idea maybe of the confidence level that you price that at? Or perhaps a
size of reserves that the $100 million pertains to? Just so we get an idea maybe of if
you're charging an arms-length price what is that risk as a percentage of the book that
you are pricing in.
And maybe, secondly, going back to the GBP2.1 billion capital generation in sterling in
ReAssure, if I remember correctly that included re-risking benefits, which under SST were
difficult to put into place. Are you going to be willing to let that business unit now run and
price on a Solvency II basis and maybe take some short-term pain on an SST basis to allow
them to sort of continue with the plan that they had before anyway, including re-risking?
Thank you.

Okay. I can give a bit of color around the ADC. I mean, the starting was really what
Andreas has been explaining, that we did a lot of diligence to review the case reserves in
Corporate Solutions. And the ADC now attaches at what we think is really a prudent level
of reserves in the CorSo back book. And that was also again, as we always do it, reviewed
in an independent matter by Group actual have control and also confirming that the new
reserve base is really at the prudent level. And then on that level, Reinsurance P&C was
comfortable to provide that ADC cover. And then also we structured it in a way that only
80% of the risk goes to P&C Re.
So Andreas Berger and team is still on the hook with 20%, to have some alignment of
interest. And what is important that as for any other transaction between two business
units, this has to be obviously done at arms length. So on the P&C Re side, this goes
through the normal underwriting and transactional review process, as any other deal. So
they come up with their own view, and in the end they felt comfortable at this price that
this makes sense to be put on their balance sheet.
And also of this reserve strengthening and CorSo putting it at a prudent level if it did
make actually sense to them, keep the residual reserve risk within the group. Otherwise,
again, we would just see some marching out of the firm. But we have the capital to hold
that residual risk. But at the end of the day, this is a transaction that is at arms length, and
P&C Reinsurance felt comfortable at that price to take the risk with the structuring and
everything we have put in place.

A - John Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

And just for the absence of doubt, there is a certain asymmetry to this cover, where P&C
Re is responsible for 80% of any deterioration, should there be deterioration. But CorSo
will actually get 80% of the upside if we find that our reserves are, in some cases,
redundant. So I think there's a balance here. But the underlying point is we believe the
reserves are well set as a starting point. With respect to the ReAssure gross cash, the
GBP2.1 billion, you're exactly right. There is a belief that there would be a re-risking
component to that. I'd make a couple of observations. One, I mentioned before the

FINAL

capital that we've injected into ReAssure. Most of that actually came over from Life
Capital, which had the capital already in the business unit.
A relatively small amount came from the group. But that provides them with a stronger
capital base to be able to manage a couple of things, including the potential adjustment
of asset risks for the company. Your larger point I think is as we consolidate it up to the
group SST, are we prepared for that hit. And I think within reasonable bounds, probably
yes. But again this is a five-year plan and, as we've said, our midterm objective is to find
the means to reduce our stake from the current 75% to 49%. I hope that doesn't take five
years. If we don't see any good answer and we're getting our dividends, we may hold on
to it. But my expectation is that in this time horizon we will become a minority owner and
the freedom on the asset risk side will be unmitigated.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity. Just two questions, please. So one is
a follow-up, if you like, on buyback. And the second one is on CorSo, please. So on the
buyback, just it's obvious that SST is a bit lower than the 250% you last reported. If we
think of a scenario where interest rates remain where they are the next 3 months and if
the hurricanes or large losses are within the budget, does that make this buyback a bit
more likely? Or there's no such probability equations? So, I just want to understand how
you think of it, because basically the interest rates and the hurricanes are the two
unknowns.
Secondly, just on the Corporate Solutions, this concept of pruning is obviously needed.
But in the past we've also heard from Christian that we are not trying to slow this business
too much or not "shrink it to greatness," was the phrase I think. And also seeing a 7%, 8%
growth rate now. So Andreas, are we looking at actually a lower volume base in CorSo,
going forward? Or are you saying that there is the shrinkage in this 20% of the $900
million, but you will be very open to finding the growth, arguably, open to making it up
somewhere else? Thank you very much.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

John, you take the first question.

A - John Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Yes, I'll try. So with respect to the buyback, I'd say we'll look at the comprehensive capital
position of the group towards the end of the third quarter. Those two items that you
mentioned, interest rates and large losses or Nat Cat losses, will be part of the factors.

FINAL

We haven't changed our long-term target for the SST of 220%. Our starting point in the
beginning of the year was 251%. We built the optionality of the second buyback to deal
with the situation where we found ourselves with unambiguously excess capital. I think, as I
mentioned before, the absence of the IPO reduces the probability, but let's see where
we are towards the end of Q3. And as I said, we'll give you clarity on our intentions on
October 31st.

A - Christian Mumenthaler

{BIO 6479864 <GO>}

I think it may be worthwhile repeating what I said before on why do we have the second
potential tranche. It came from last November. We had a SST ratio of 280%, which is really
very high, the highest we had in a long time. And as we did the business plan, we were
worried that it was clear that this year there could be a series of factors, including
recovery in financial market, IPO, low nat cat, et cetera, that could be a combination which
would lead a year later to an even higher one, which is not really acceptable. So we said
we would like to have this instrument at hand to avoid this situation, for this particular
case.

Bloomberg Transcript

And the time we want to take a decision is really in November, because that's when we
have all the facts together. So I think it's very hard at this stage to say if this, but that.
There's no formula in our head. We're not on autopilot. There's a real business decision to
be taken in view of all the factors we will have there. So it's not like we try to be difficult;
it's really more that I try to make it clear what our intent was with this second buyback. So
the goal is certainly not to be above 280%. The risks are much lower right now with the
IPO and the capital we could deploy. But who knows? And again, we're not on autopilot.

A - Andreas Berger

{BIO 15171017 <GO>}

I'll take the pruning question on CorSo. No, we don't want to shrink to greatness. But what
we did in our strategic review, we looked at the portfolio and created 3 different buckets.
One bucket was portfolios where it will not see sustainable improvement of our risk
exposure and price to risk. So those areas, we said to ourselves, we will not be able to
influence this market. We don't have the size and the leadership position to influence this
market. So we will have to take action here. So that's where we reduced significantly our
engagement. That's bucket number one.
And number two is the bucket where we said we're so sub-scale in this market. We will in
the foreseeable future not reach a position of a leader, a market leader, to also bring in
our strengths to differentiate, as well. So that's another area we said if you don't make
money in those areas and can't scale up properly, so why be in there? Because we can't
bring in our strength. And the third area are risk sub-portfolios where we believe it might
be an attractive market, but the way we are trading and handling the risk is not efficient.
So it could be a market inefficiency; it could be ourselves. So that's something we look in
detail into it.
And marine, for instance, is such a market, where we say we'd like to be in the marine
market, but not in the way it is traded today. So you can't operate with an almost, like,
40% expense ratio in that market. That's not sustainable. Here, we would like to redefine
how marine can be done, mostly digitally, in future. And you've seen that we have created

a Chief Innovation and Transformation Officer. That's a signal already for the future
strategy.
Now the risk landscape is changing dramatically, and I think now is the time to address
profitability, to restore profitability, in order to set the foundation for future growth. And I
think it requires really fresh thinking and fresh ideas and solutions to bring to the party.
The clients welcome if we have the right positioning, we have the right ingredients and
assets to bring to the party to really address the risk management changes in the industry.
And we're very confident that we can do this. I already mentioned one area with the
global program platform that we are providing. But I'd like to give this detail more in our
November Investor Day, if you may.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon everybody. My first question, again on CorSo. So you show the bridge
on the combined ratio from a normalized level of 110% in 2018 down to the 98%. I think
about the portfolio pruning, the rate increases and the expense savings. Most of those
will be earning through in the sort of second half of '19, into '20, and into 2021. The slide
on slide 15, though, is showing that the combined ratio for CorSo, excluding the kind of
management actions and the impact from the ADC, is actually running at 101% in H1 2019.
So can you just help me square that as a starting point, versus 110% as a starting point?
The second question, thinking about the group ROE targets. So CorSo, we're now looking
at an ROE at the lower end of the 10% to 15%. You'll be holding on to ReAssure for the
foreseeable future, which obviously has a low-single-digit ROE. It looks like you've
deployed $2 billion of capital in the period just gone, for $350 million of earnings pretax
over two years, which looks like a net-of-tax return on solvency capital around 7%. I guess
when I put all that together and think about your target for 700 basis points over US riskfree, which is currently around 2%, I'm sort of looking at that and thinking it looks a little bit
challenging in order to hit that as an across-the-cycle target. So maybe you could just give
an update on how you see that group ROE target, please. Thank you.

A - Andreas Berger

{BIO 15171017 <GO>}

Okay. I'll handle the first part of the question, on the combined ratio on slide 15. It's fair to
say that in Q1 and Q2 I think we had the underlying business that we brought on book is
actually very good. We had a benign Nat Cat situation. So over all, I think we were very
happy; also, in particular, with the rate increases that we could generate. So we are very
healthy as far as the new business, and I think, going forward, it will look very good. So the
point we tried to make here on page 15 and the gap between the 132.8% and 101.2% is

Page 16 of 23



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2019-07-31

FINAL

really the management actions. And here, it's fair to say we had two buckets of
management actions is Q1 and Q2.
And as we said, in Q2 we had a reserve impact after the review of $328 million. This is
subdivided into prior years reserving and in current year reserving. So those are the 2
buckets. Now if you look at the first half-year and only look at the prior-year development,
then you take the Q1 $225 million and now the Q2 $264 million, which brings you then to
the $489 million as first half-year prior-year development. So that's the situation. And then
if you add again the adverse cover development, the $100 million, this will bring you then
to an H1 2019 management actions number of $653 million. So that sort of gives you the
overall picture of that slide 15.

A - John Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And James, my quick answer to the question is, yes, the first half was actually pretty
benign, and that's where Andreas started with, for CorSo's core business; nat cat,
especially. So the 110% is the right place to start this walk. We expect a glide path through
2020 to get to the 21x target of a 98 combined ratio. With respect to the group ROE, the
continued ownership of 75%, not 100%, of ReAssure will be a drag on ROE.
But as I suggested before, the price firming that we see both in P&C Re as well as CorSo
lead us to think that the opportunities to make money in these lines is significant on a
going-forward basis. I'm not concerned about the group's target of 700 basis points over
the 10-year risk-free. And as you say, right now we're diving down to something very close
to 2% for that U.S. benchmark. We will work through the asset side of the balance sheet as
best we can, but those financial targets I think are entirely achievable by the business mix
we have.

A - Christian Mumenthaler

{BIO 6479864 <GO>}

If I may add, because I think it's an important question, we are fully committed to this
group ROE target and we think it's feasible. You can see the underlying, with 98%, is
maybe 11.5% ROE in P&C Re, but hopefully that's not the end of it. We still see some price
increases. Over all, the P&C Re market is still in the softer side of the cycle. So I think you
can expect a bit more there. Then CorSo, we have to get certainly to the lower end of this
range by 2021.
Clearly, we need to do something about ReAssure. That's a key focus. And I think it would
be wrong to assume just because we didn't an IPO now that we're going to have it for
five years. As we said, the goal is clear and it's midterm, and I think we talk about one
year, two years. But in my view -- if we can do it for the right price for the shareholders,
obviously. But it's clear there's a focus on that. And then the excess capital is being
deployed as we talk. The earnings are on top. The GAAP capital doesn't change. So I think
we're very focused on that. It just takes time from where we are. It's clearly 2 businesses
have now just crossed a bad soft cycle.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon everybody. I have two questions. My first question, is there -on ReAssure and coming back to your point, Christian, on the potential environment
you're looking for to restart this project again. We are potentially at peak equity levels and
bond yields are potentially further declining from here. So what could be the environment
you're looking at? Or what would be the catalyst here?
And then, secondly, on Corporate Solutions, in the past whenever you presented
combined ratios you always pointed also to a track of 3 to 4 percentage points coming
from your investment expenses. How should we look, think about those in the context of
this new 98% target? Are they also reflected in? Or you don't have any more investment
expenses anymore so you have a 3% to 4% release? How are they reflected?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christian Mumenthaler

{BIO 6479864 <GO>}

Good. So I'll take, I guess, the ReAssure question. I think about 70% of the work has been
done now for the IPO preparation. It is something we can use anyway because it allowed
us to extract ReAssure from the Swiss Re group but in a much bigger extent. So all the
functions were folded in. We have a new CEO. We have a board. We have basically a new
management team. We recapitalized it at a standalone level, and all of that. And so that's
precious work and we won't bring that back. So I think what needs to happen now is that
the new management team needs to execute on the plan they have. There's a
perspective. There's planned dividends. A lot of things. Some of the investor feedback
was that it's not a -- the management team is new and they are not proven.
So I think they have now a good opportunity to prove themselves. We decided clearly not
to go for an IPO at the second half of the year because this is a new time window in the
second half. But I think in view of the political situation right now that will be unwise to kill
everybody in the work to do that. So I think the next date to look at it is probably early
2020, to see where the markets are, what is here.
I think an asset yielding 9.5% in a market like the UK with pension funds and local investors
who are not caring about the pound, for example, is not a completely unreasonable -- I
think it's an attractive opportunity, honestly, for local investors. So I'm not particularly
worried about the value of this asset over a medium term. So I think it's only a question of
time. And obviously, should there be any other opportunities we will also look at other
opportunities. But I think we have several potential ways to continue the deconsolidation
of this asset, and we're going to pursue them.

A - John Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

And Frank, maybe the one thing I would say, what we found in the marketplace, while
equity markets, broadly, and in the UK specifically, seemed to be functioning fine at the
Page 18 of 23



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2019-07-31

FINAL

end of June, early July, the primary market was a different story. And the combination of a
couple of other IPOs which had gone out the door and performed badly and an emerging
concern by institutional investors about putting new money into the UK just created an
environment where this appeared very, very difficult. You can claim that our aspirations on
price might have been too high. We'll evaluate that over time.
But I do think that the weakness in the pound that we've seen in the subsequent weeks is
indicative of concerns that were emerging as we were trying to build the book for the IPO,
in the first case. With the second case, on CorSo, maybe I'll jump in first and then Andreas
can talk about a bit, but a lot of this comes from before Andreas' time. You're exactly
right. We have been making these investments both in the Primary Lead capabilities as
well as some other technologies. Most of that will, in fact, finish by 2021, but I don't expect
CorSo to not invest. There will be important technology-related moves that we will expect
to continue. Having said that, the 98% is a firm number and doesn't have caveats around
it. It's not 98%, plus 2 points. It's 98%.

A - Andreas Berger

{BIO 15171017 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. I mean, just to maybe elaborate on that, when we did the review we obviously
looked also into the expenses, and investments were always singled out as 3 percentage
points to 4 percentage points. And we saw that the investments went mainly into the
Primary Lead initiative. And the Primary Lead initiative had again 3 buckets. One was
domestic primary leads. So we hired people. We developed the skills and the capabilities.
And I think this went actually quite well. So you see a much stronger engagement in
primary leads. And so not everything is bad. So those lines of business is where we are
very strong. That's primarily due to the Primary Lead investment.
And the second bucket was additional lines of businesses. For instance, Accident &
Health, we acquired a company and portfolios in this area. So those are all initiatives that
were under the flag or under the heading of Primary Lead. And the third bucket was the
international program platform, the international business program platform. Now the first
2 that I mentioned, I would say let's declare victory. Those are basically running up as
investments and they as business as usual.
The third one, that's an area where we are going to drill deeper. We still continue to
invest. So what you see in the walk of the combined ratio slide, you will see 2% expense
savings, and this is on a gross basis actually 2.5%. And then you get back to the
investments, in particular, on this side of the technology platform, and that brings you then
to the 2%. So we continue to invest. And again, in our Investor Day in November we're
going to be a bit more specific about what that means for the strategy, going forward.

Hi. Thank you very much. Just one small one. Can you update us on where the absolute

From memory, the last time you gave us a P&C Re figure it was 103%, at the beginning of
last year. So given that you've had 1 points or 2 points of rate increase, I'm guessing that
figure is quite easily 104%, 105%. But I have no idea where CorSo is. It's good you've had
the 9% rate increase, but I don't know where that actually takes you absolutely? Thank

I think we stopped disclosing it. On price adequately used in the past. Because the main
point we always want to make is what is really the price change, comparing the renewal
basis and the basis we put on our books. And then I think the big change to new measure,
which we explained, is a more simple measure, which would be more comparable to also
what peers disclose. And on that measure we now say for the first half of year the basis
of renewal this is 1 point better than the expiring is. But it's fair to say that it is an
improvement in price quality. It does not reflect some capital allocation and other things.
But I would also then say this internal measure, this long-term price legacy, is up a bit. But
it's not a number that we disclose, going forward.

The CorSo normalized loss ratio has a large Nat Cat budget of $190 million for the full
year 2019. We expect something north of 45%, or something, 46%, expected in the first
half of this year. That's the main part of the combined ratio normalized.

Vikram, what is the second part of your question. Can you remind us?

FINAL

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

The couple of actions, which is one is the aggressive pruning in lines of businesses, while
growing in others where there is good pricing. I'm assuming there must be a natural limit
to doing this, as continuing this would reduce the diversification in the portfolio at some
point. So any thoughts around that would be helpful.

A - John Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Maybe I'll jump in. I think there's both in terms of geographies but also in lines of business,
there remains a robust diversification, even within CorSo. And then when we think about
within the group, the concentration on some of the more profitable lines is not going to
be a problem for us.
So I don't expect any particular issues with respect to either capital charges and/or
earnings concentration to be the issue here as the CorSo portfolio gets rebalanced. I think
the important thing you see on one of the pages when we talk about pruning, there's a
number of lines where we're going to significantly reduce, but not exit. And part of that is
due to be able to serve clients, let's say, that might be great clients for our property book
and still ask for some covers, which we're prepared to do for those better clients.

Well, we actually came to the conclusion that the CorSo portfolio was too concentrated,
for example, in U.S. liability. So it was not enough protected by Reinsurance. So going
forward, with better insurance protection and a bit less, let's say, U.S. liability focus actually
becomes a better average in that portfolio. But the diversification may be managed then
as a group, and we can use Reinsurance for CorSo to get it all in balance.

Thanks Vikram for your questions. Can we take the next question, please?

Operator
The next question is a follow-up from the James Shuck. Please go ahead.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just a question on the new money rate, really. So can
you just give us an idea of as of today what the new money rate is and what you're
actually investing in? Obviously, US rates are higher, but in Europe the situation is very
different. And you're seeing yields around 50 basis points. So how are you thinking about
risk-adjusted returns on investments? And what does this mean for your strategic asset
allocation, please?

Sure. So you've correctly identified a challenge for us. The majority of our assets are
dollar-related, reflecting the majority of our liabilities. And so the matching, the estimate
new money rate that we've got for the reinvestments is something close to 2%. That's
below the running yield of 2.9% and, obviously, something we're going to have to
manage. I would say that the Asset Management team has been able in a challenging
environment to maintain that 2.9%, in part by going into some alternative investments,
infrastructure, other plays, increasing in some cases parts of the real estate portfolio,
which are providing solid yields; nothing exceptional, but adequate.
The quality of the portfolio has not changed. We maintain a fairly conservative positioning
on the credit book, in particular. And I think that's also reflected in the de minimis level of
impairments that we've had in the last quarters. So this will be a challenge to us, going
forward, as it will be a challenge to everyone in the industry. Let's see how we work
through it.

Thank you, James for your follow-up question. Next question please?

Operator
The next question is a follow-up from Edward Morris. Please go ahead.

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Thank you. Just a quick follow-up please. The reinsurance purchasing strategy, going
forward, for CorSo, could you just confirm whether you intend to consider buying
reinsurance externally? Or are you likely to continue just buying it from P&C Re? Thank
you.

A - Andreas Berger

{BIO 15171017 <GO>}

So in principle, we prefer to buy internally via P&C Reinsurance business unit. But we're
not excluding external markets. Going forward, we are strategically positioning ourselves
in buying reinsurance, and we will use external markets, as well. But obviously, we prefer
to use internal markets.

A - Christian Mumenthaler

{BIO 6479864 <GO>}

Yes. Has all already been in the past a combination. It's a business we like and if it was
within our overall risk tolerance should, as a first priority, stay on either the CorSo or the
Reinsurance balance sheet. And only if it gets above what we can digest within our own
balance sheet we go externally. But it's important also for CorSo to be a bit more direct in
the market. It's also feedback signals. So it's both. But the first priority is to keep the risk
we can diversify in our balance sheet internally.
