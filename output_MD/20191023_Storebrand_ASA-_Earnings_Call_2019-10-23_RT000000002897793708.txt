presentation on Slide 2.

Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Thank you, Kjetil. Storebrand presented solid group result of NOK 700 million in the third
quarter and NOK 2 billion year-to-date. For the quarter, we have booked performance
related costs of NOK 49 million without the corresponding NOK 99 million in
performance related income being booked -- without this income being booked this
quarter.
Year-to-date the performance related costs are NOK 111 million and the corresponding
income not booked NOK 265 million. As you know, the performance related income will
be booked just at the end of the year at the fourth quarter.
Storebrand are succeeding in our core markets. According to the NKB, the Norwegian
customer survey we have the most satisﬁed customers within occupational pension. The
drive -- this drives the solid growth in our unit linked business as well as asset under
management within our asset management business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our solvency ratio is strengthened during the quarter from 167% to 177%. If we then move
to slide number 3, this is our two-fold strategy that is well known. We plan to release
capital overtime to our shareholders through active management of our guaranteed
products that are in long-term runoﬀ.
In addition, we are well positioned for capital light growth within occupational pension
and the individual markets for savings and insurance in Norway and in asset management.
At the same time, we operate in markets in constant change. And there are now several
regulatory processes running both in Europe and in Norway, that can aﬀect our business
but EIOPA to each their consultation paper, they will give their ﬁnal recommendation to
the commission around sometime next year. For Storebrand, the most important topics
are interest rate stretch, the ultimate forward rates and the volatility adjustments.
We're also preparing for the new International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS 17, that
entails new accounting rules for insurance contracts. The preparations are well enrooted
in Storebrand, for the implementation in 2022.
In Norway, we are expecting a consultation around the proposed changes to the
framework for managing the guaranteed pension products, and lastly, I want to mention
that the Ministry of Finance has proposed changes to the rules regarding transfer of
customer buﬀers within public pensions. Expected implementation is estimated 2019, and
this is good news for increased competition and market dynamics within public pension
going forward. And as you know, this is a market where we were allowed to challenge
changes to KLP going forward.
If you then move to slide number 4. The growth in savings continues. Compared to third
quarter last year, we see a growth of 11% in our Unit Linked assets both in Norway and in
Page 2 of 13

FINAL

Sweden. Our asset management has strengthened its position as the best leading
Norwegian asset manager, with a growth of 8% in assets under management, now
amounting to NOK 786 billion.
Our banking business sees moderate growth but has strengthened its margin. Growth in
our retail lending is continuously being weighted against proﬁtability. As previously
announced, we see positive development in our insurance business. Within P&C and
health insurance, we now have a 10% growth while areas within corporate insurance have
had more moderate growth rates. In total the insurance business grew by 4%.
Moving to slide 5. As a means to elaborate on growth in our unit linked business. I wish to
give you a bit close look into the development of our Swedish subsidiary SPP. SPP is
taking a position as the fastest-growing provider of occupational pension in Sweden.
So this is illustrated through a 40% growth in new sales, a 22% growth in premiums and a
strong net transfer from our competitors. In fact, in a report, Swedish krone moved in the
non-unionized occupational pension is now moved to SPP. This is making SPP to aspire to
be the largest player within non-unionized occupational pension in Sweden, too.

Bloomberg Transcript

An important factor high sustainability, has been its digitalization strategy providing
several new digital and truly optimized services to its customers.
Then moving to Slide 6. This quarter Storebrand further strengthened its position as a
leader within sustainable investments. We have been acknowledged by PRI, the world's
leading sustainable investment organization, as an investor with excellent responsible
investment practice and as the only Norwegian asset owner included in the PRI global
leaders group. The heavy ﬁres in Amazonas has brought reinforced attention to the
problem of deforestation. And in August, Storebrand committed to an investment policy,
strengthening our position as an active owner. Our goal is an investment portfolio with
zero contribution to deforestation and we have joined forces with 230 other investors in
this work.
During the UN Climate Action Summit in September, we as one of 12 founding members
of the US-backed Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, committed to carbon neutral
investment portfolios by 2050. On this backdrop, it is encouraging to see an increasing
demand for fossil free investments from our customers. We now have 19 fossil free funds
and NOK 100 billion invested in fossil free portfolios and that is actually 13% of our total
asset under management.
And with that I give the word to Lars.

FINAL

I'm happy to present numbers with the operating proﬁt, once again exceed NOK 600
million a quarter . We have had two quarters with somewhat weaker results, but with no
signiﬁcant surprises, positive ﬁnancial markets and continued growth in the business. The
proper development is now back on track. The solvency has been signiﬁcantly
strengthened since the second quarter, and with satisfactory ﬁnancial returns buﬀer
building continues.
The returns from good equity markets and falling interest rates are reﬂected in balance
sheet growth and strengthen buﬀers.
Moving over to page 8, showing the solvency movement between the second quarter
and the third quarter. As for the second quarter, the solvency was 165% without
transitional capital and 167% with transitional capital.
During the third quarter, we've done the following. One, further model improvements
and updated assumptions. This is something we do every quarter, combined contribution
just below neutral. There has been a signiﬁcant drop in rates in the quarter, which leads to
6 percentage points drop in solvency.

Bloomberg Transcript

The fall in the 10 year swap rates, they were - sorry, were 16 basis points in Norway and 30
basis points in Sweden. This drop in interest-rates has largely been reversed so far in this
fourth quarter.
Increased volatility adjustment and reduced equity stress in the standard model have
contributed a positive 4 percentage points in the quarter. Volatility adjustment is oﬀ by 5
bps in Norway and 2 bps in Sweden. Please note that volatility adjustment in the Norway
now stands at 45 bps. This is a historically high level. Business mix and asset allocation
contributes positively with two percentage points. This is the result of optimized risk
management actions in the guaranteed portfolios. Furthermore, old and higher
guarantees are maturing and new guarantees come in at much lower guarantees and with
better buﬀers.
Operating earnings after reserving for 50% business contributes a little more than one
percentage point. This quarter, we have optimized our lapse reinsurance program by
reducing coverage in Norway and increasing coverage in Sweden. This gives a three
percentage points positive contribution.
Finally, we have issued a subordinated loan of SEK 1 billion. This gives a positive three
percentage points. Please note that this loan may be used to repay a loan that comes to
call in March 2020, in which case it will be taken out of the solvency capital by the end of
this quarter. This gives us a solvency without transitional of 172%. With a fall in interest
rates that we saw during the third quarter, we once again get transitional capital from
interest rates, and the transitional rules gives us ﬁve percentage points in additional
regulatory capital and a regulatory solvency capital overall of 177%.
Moving over to the next page called Solvency position Storebrand Group, page 9. This
picture shows our conditional overview of solvency sensitivity. In many of the sensitivities,
Page 4 of 13



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2019-10-23

FINAL

we are close to or about 180%. With normal operating proﬁts and market development,
end counting in the fact that the three are -- counting that the three percentage points
solvency capital derived from the recently issued subordinated loan is likely to be
excluded in the fourth quarter. We do not expect to reach 180% this year.
At our capital markets day in 2018, we stated that we expect to reach 180% in 2021. And
following this we estimated that we would be able to return a total of NOK 10 billion up
until 2028.
With the volatility in interest rates seen over the last few months, it has been speculated
that the start of the capital release could start earlier or later than 2021. Rest assured that
we work hard to deliver on stated targets.
Moving over to the following page, as in Storebrand Group. Fee and administrative
income shows a positive development with a 4% growth year-on-year. Results from
insurance is down from last year, primarily due to runoﬀ gains and reserve releases last
year. There is still good cost control in the group, even when including costs relating to
portfolio management bonuses because of good relative performance.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you are well aware, we are not allowed to account for the earned performance fees
before year end. Tax is estimated at NOK 124 million or 21% in the quarter.
Moving over to the following page the Storebrand Group at Page 11. In order to further
illustrate the consequences of current accounting rules, we have included a new picture
showing our operating results, excluding the performance related cost and income from
bonuses, showing operating earnings of NOK 635 million in the quarter. That's the middle
table in this -- on this page.
We have also included the table including all bonus related income and cost estimated
which gives us an estimated result of NOK 685 million in the quarter. The latter a number
could be called actual value creation in the quarter. We think the number is NOK 635
million in adjusted operating earnings is the most accurate number but at the same time,
we have built signiﬁcant contingent performances that will be booked at the end of the
year and included in the fourth quarter accounts
Moving over to page 12. This picture is basically the same as the last Q1, but we see it here
the split between the results-segment, savings, insurance and guaranteed. Within savings,
we have good proﬁtability growth when adjusting for the NOK 49 million in performancerelated cost in the quarter.
In fact, I think it is the best underling results for the segment ever. The insurance segment
has been hit by some larger claims in the quarter during (inaudible) results. We do not
however see this is the tranche and we do not envisage any signiﬁcant changes in
reserves caused by the recorder claim. Guaranteed pensions continue at gradual decline
according to plan and previous communications.

Questions And Answers

FINAL

Operator
(Question And Answer)
(Operator Instructions) And the ﬁrst question comes from the line of Peter Elliot from
Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. I have three questions, please. The ﬁrst one was you mentioned the
EIOPA consultation at the start of the call. And I guess one of the key points of that was
then consulting on moving the last liquid point. I'm just wondering if you can give any
sensitivities of your ratio to that?

Bloomberg Transcript

And the second question was on the reinsurance deal that you did and I guess that's
similar to the one you did in Norway a couple of years-ago and you'd ﬂagged that you
had reinsurance as a key tool to use for solvency. I guess too many questions on that.
One, are you able to share what the cost was? I mean the Norwegian one, you're one of
only two players, so it's very easy win for both yourselves and the reinsurance companies.
I'm just wondering if the sort of economics work just as well in Sweden. And secondly, are
you able to share if you still have sort of further tools in the toolbox as it were.
Final question was on the consolidation ratio. SPP I mean, you're at 107% still. Could you
just sort of share what that means in terms of fees that you can take if you're still there at
year end and what the possible upside or downside risk is? Thank you very much.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Okay, Peter. that can give you -- give us the shock. On the area of consolidation paper, last
liquid point was there have been many diﬀerent proposals there and we are trying to
calculate the diﬀerent proposals and the impact and it's too early to give you an impact
analysis as of now.
However, it's quite obvious that the interest rate market in Norway is quite limited
compared to European markets. So the actual last liquid point is not very much diﬀerent
from what you see today.
from what you see today.
Secondly, on reinsurance cost, what we look at is, this is luxury insurance, and the cost for
the luxury insurance has to be competitive to taking of subordinated loans and other tools
that we have in the toolbox. And the pricing has fallen since we started doing this initially

Page 6 of 13

Date: 2019-10-23

FINAL

as everyone are getting more familiar with the structures, and the Swedish reinsurance
was very competitive compared to what we've done previously.
On consolidation in Sweden, you're right in saying that this is now slightly above 170%,
and we have indeed been able to book a consolidation fee of NOK10 million for the
quarter. And we do expect this to be -- go slightly upwards from here on a quarterly basis.
But there will be some volatility in that going forward. Yes. And I think just our comment
on that is, we have a roughly 40 basis point higher expected return on the assets than the
liabilities in that portfolio, meaning that you will slowly build up towards little bit more
than 108% level. That means at that level you can take full indexation.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thanks. Thanks very much.

Operator
The next question comes from the line of the Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please go
ahead.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions. Firstly, continuing on the mass lapse insurances. Is
this toolbox now utilized in full or do you see kind of potential to increase it. And also on
the same note, what was the reason for you kind of deciding to use this tool in Q3? Was it
just the pricing thing? Or was it related to the interest rates?
The second question is regarding as Lars you mentioned that or was it Odd Arild that you
don't expect to reach the 180% solvency margin at the end of the year. Is this based on
the current interest rates? Or is this what do you base the view on? Thanks.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Okay. Let me start with the reinsurance. On one hand, we can do more. And there is a
constant evaluation of the tools in the toolbox and how much we want to use at any point
in time. What I actually said was that it's an optimization. We reduced the coverage in
Norway, and we've built it up in Sweden. So this is the way to get more bang for the buck
by making these ships. And there is a possibility to do more, and we always have to trade
it towards the cost.

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Yeah. I can take the 180 solvency movement. I think it's fair to say that, ﬁrst of all, you have
to take out as Lars has said, the subordinate debt, that's 3% and also any increased
interest rate as we have seen so far this quarter have washed out again, the transitional
rules. Then we are just well maybe 1% to 2% points in transitional room that arrives from
the equity element but that is also supposed to move out. So we are very close to being
out of the transitional rules by year end with the interest rates we already see in the

Page 7 of 13



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2019-10-23

market. And there is a need to augment on normal operation of the solvency capital in the
fourth quarter. We guide that we are below the NOK 180 million at the end of this year.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

FINAL

Great.

Operator
The next question comes from the line of Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Please go
ahead.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good afternoon, thank you. I've got three questions. Firstly, on the EIOPA Solvency II
review. Have you -- can you make any comment around the interest rate stress? That
seems to be one thing that will deﬁnitely be changed. Then just you could perhaps
remind us what interest rate levels you assume, do you assume negative interest rates, for
example, which is one thing that EIOPA's talked about. I realized that's maybe not quite as
big an issue in Norway, but it would be interesting to hear your thoughts around the
interest rate stress scenario and just the issue, in general.
The second question is you talked, Odd Arild, about a new framework for managing
guarantees within the Norwegian markets, which is being looked at by the regulator.
Could you give us an indication to what's going on there? And what the likely timing is?
And ﬁnally, just the comment you made, Lars, on the volatility adjuster and it stands at 45
basis points, which is a historically high level. I just wondered why that was. Have you
been changing your actual assets against the reference portfolio? Or what's actually
driving that increase in the volatility adjuster? Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Thank you, Blair. I can start on the interest rate question. Today, we have negative interest
rates in our base calculation but with -- as according to the standard model, we don't
stress negative interest rates. I guess the general comment here is that all increases in
interest rate stress are in isolation, a negative aspect. And then, of course, there's a long
political process here before we get to the end result.
When it comes to the proposals around the guaranteed products in Norway, you have -- I
think we have touched upon that earlier. And you should bear in mind that this was made
to make these products better for the customers to give a better capital return over time.
So it's a lot of diﬀerent elements in it. Some of them are absolutely positive. Some might
be negative. But in some, we expect this to be a positive development, making it possible
to give surplus return to our policyholders over time. And that is also a positive for
Storebrand.

Sorry, Odd Arild, what's the timing on that review What was the timing on that review?

FINAL

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

We wait now for the Minister of Finance to give out a hearing process in the market. And
we just have to see what that moves out and when it's actually going to be -- could be
ineﬀective with the uncertainly actually.
And on the VAs, it comes out of the calculation in EIOPA, which is published by the EIOPA
every month. So we basically take into account what comes there. We just made the
comment that it's historically high now. So there's an implicit. I guess there's more
downside than upside from this level compared to many other countries. But it's
approaching normals --

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

So it's nothing that you've done, it's just what comes out from EIOPA. Okay, very clear
Thank you very much.

The next question comes from the line of the Jackie (inaudible) from JP Morgan. from JP
Morgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

This is Ashik. I'm just using Jackey's [ph] line. I just have a couple of questions. First of all,
with respect to the 180%, I mean, if you just remind us, is this 180% that you had guided
earlier -- I remember that it's including transitionals, right? And I mean, it looks like you
will be there again by mid-next year, if things don't change, if interest rates don't change,
you will be there mid-next year. So what's the visibility of additional capital return to be
announced around, say, mid-next year or later next year? So that would be my ﬁrst
question.
Secondly, any thoughts on your spread that you are making -- asset spread you're making
on the guaranteed book in Norway because interest rates have gone down, so that must
have put some pressure on the duration mismatch portfolio. So do you have any negative
spread book at the moment and the Norwegian book or you still believe that, in Norway,
you still have a positive spread book? So any thoughts on that would be great.
And last question would be about P&C results. P&C results were a bit weak in this quarter.
I mean group life clearly improved quite a lot, but P&C was a bit weak. What was the
reason behind it and any thoughts on outlook for that?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Page 9 of 13



Company Name: Storebrand ASA

FINAL

Okay. Should I start on the 180%. As I said the -- in mind that both subordinated just hand
the transitional rules will in most well we expect to be out of this transitional by year end.
So then we are down at the level without these two factors and it's based on that means
that the unexpected the normal generation of solvency capital. And I think, we have
guided about the forth and back on this issue of the timing, I think as Lars said in our
Capital Markets Day, we said 2021, and we want and we are working hard to make that
come true of course.
Talk about the results half of the year, I think what you should just bear in mind is that we
will use a combination of dividends and share buybacks. And that, of course, make it
more attractive for us to use these tools also during the year. And most likely, the board
will look at this at the end of the year, not at -- in the middle of the year.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And with respect to the asset spread, it's still positive on an average basis, and we can still
invest above the interest rate guaranteed on the vendors' basis. But clearly, the lower
interest rates fall, this has a negative eﬀect on solvency and a negative eﬀect on
reinvestment levels. But as I said, it'll stay positive. And just to add on that, we also, of
course, have long customer buﬀers both in Norway and Sweden and in the Norwegian
portfolio speciﬁcally, we don't expect to make any IFRS losses or anything like that with
the current buﬀer levels and the current Minister of Finance.
And on P&C, we did have some large claims in diﬀerent business lines this quarter, but
none that changes our -- in any signiﬁcant way, changes our view on the future. And you
said that the reserves were weak, but I don't think the reserves are weak. I think we just
had weaker results in certain P&C lines.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.

The next question comes from the line of Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go
ahead.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thanks for allowing, two follow-ups. Maybe just a couple on the numbers. I mean,
obviously, a great set of results. If I was being picky, maybe there was only one small item
that I thought was a little bit negative which was the SPP risk result. I'm just wondering, if
you can talk about that at all, whether it was a one-oﬀ or anything.

Page 10 of 13

FINAL

And then second, obviously, you've mentioned that it's great that you're seeing growth in
the P&C division. I mean, I just wondering whether you can talk a little bit more about that
in terms of the growth we see in this quarter is that something we should expect to
continue in future quarters? Yes, if you could comment on that, that would be great.
Thanks very much.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Okay. On the SPP risk result, it's longevity that is weak in the quarter. However, unlike the
Norwegian longevity risk, the Swedish longevity can be repriced on an annual basis. And
we are constantly doing adjustments to make that recently proﬁtable on an ongoing
basis. So this is a quarterly weak results, but this is not a reserve risk or anything else. It's
just a repricing issue.

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Yes. When it comes to the P&C market that both -- Storebrand has a very strong brand
name in the market when it comes to P&C. We also due to our business have huge capital
eﬀects, positive capital eﬀects compared to other companies when it comes to insurance
business. So we have appetite for growing our insurance business. We are very happy to
see the growth now coming through, and we'll work, of course, to make sure that the
growth in insurance comes through as we have guided on.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thanks a lot.

Operator
Next question comes from the line of Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Please go head.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Just two follow-ups. Just on decisions with regards to capital return, would that be right in
thinking that you would want to wait for clarity from the Solvency II review before you
would make any decisions on capital return? And we talked -- you talked about maybe the
summer of next year before the EIOPA results are out. What -- do you expect to have
enough clarity at that point in time to be making appropriate decisions on capital return?
Or will it take longer than that?
And secondly, just on the NOK 10 billion that you talked about at the last capital Markets
Day. I think you indicated at that time that the release of that capital would be somewhat
back-end loaded within the 21 to 27 timeframe. I just wonder if your views on that have
changed at all. Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

First of all, when it comes to our decision around 180%, I think, of course, we'll wait. The
Board needs to make views on their knowledge, their insights, the situation and forwardlooking view of the company, when they should -- and dividends. They have to do that
Page 11 of 13



Company Name: Storebrand ASA

Date: 2019-10-23

FINAL

also when this comes into a situation where we are above 180%. But saying that, I think,
we feel very comfortable about our guidings. We use our subprocesses to set these limits,
both for being overcapitalized and setting limits for our capital situation. And due to that,
we have, put forward this level of 180%, and we are very committed to, of course, fulﬁll
that in the market.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Are you saying Odd Arild, that, that's somewhat independent of what the Solvency II
review then brings out? I would have thought that the solvency review would be integral
of this.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I think it's fair to say that we and the Board needs to take into account all the knowledge
we have when we are making decisions around dividends. I don't have that kind of
knowledge now, but if I do get new knowledge about, this is a kind of situation, of course,
we need to take that into account.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yes. I guess the question is if there's too much uncertainty as to what the impact from the
Solvency II review is going to be then, I guess, that would be a problem.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

That might be a problem. But I think also, it's fair to say that Storebrand's business will be
all the same. It's just the way you measure it into Solvency II, that is done diﬀerent. And we
have to look at that situation, look at our business, what is our re-capital situation as we
view it and make new decisions based on that together with the Board.

A - Lars Aasulv Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Yes, hopefully, there are other NOK10 billion. I think it's still the same message there that
is back-end loaded, the released assets.
