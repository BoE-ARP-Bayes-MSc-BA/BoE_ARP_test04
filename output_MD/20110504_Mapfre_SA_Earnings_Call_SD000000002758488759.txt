{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to apologize for the
rescheduling of our conference call due to technical problems with our providers of
technical advice.
Welcome to MAPFRE's First Quarter 2011 results presentation. As usual, I'll give an
overview of the results in the main business developments, and later Mr. Lubelli will
explain the financials in greater detail.
Finally, we will take your questions.
Please let's now move to slide number three. The performance in this First Quarter of
2011 reflects several traditional strengths of MAPFRE. Diversification with the foreign
business driving group growth, proven underwriting with exceptional results in spite of
large catastrophe claims and recurring financial income.
As you can see in the slide, the revenues grew by 4%. The premiums went up by 3.7%.
Funds under management grew by 12%, due primarily to the consolidation of the business
of CATALUNYACAIXA which compensates for the fall in the market value of the assets.
And the combined ratio fell nearly 1percentage point, and both profits and earnings per
share grew by 13.5% and 10.2% respectively, which is a significant improvement.

Going to slide four, we have here the highlights of our results. In non-life we have
sustained growth of the international business, as is usual in the last quarters.

FINAL

And a larger market share in motor and home insurance in Spain. Even in the situation in
Spain from the point of view of growth is not good in general, we were able to grow 0.2%
in motor insurance against a decline of the market of 2.2%.
And in home insurance we had the growth in home owner's multi risk of more than 8%.
In Life there is a lower issuance in Spain as a result of the different schedules for sales
campaigns in bancassurance channels, primarily due to the situation of the interest rate in
Spain.
As you remember, last year in this period we had a very significant campaign coming from
Caja Madrid due to the different situation of the interest rate at that moment in 2010. And
this was offset partially by the business growth in Latin America.

Bloomberg Transcript

The technical results from non-life had a favorable development, especially in Spain, and
even if we had to absorb the impact of the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand.
As I announced in the 2010 final results presentation, MAPFRE continue to focus this
activity in insurance operations and we have reached, during the quarter, an agreement
with Caja Madrid to transfer our shareholding on MAPFRE Banco do Servicios Financieros
Caja Madrid-MAPFRE. So we continue focusing our activity in insurance, which is our
specialty.
There is also news in this quarter, is the authorization for the establishment of the joint
venture with Banco do News has been granted at the end of the quarter. So we will be
able to consolidate these operations in the Second Quarter of this year.
Let's move on to the following slide where you can see the evolution of profits and
earnings per share. As I have already note, both grew significantly against the same
period of 2010.
In slide number six we explain the terms of the operation with Caja Madrid in order to
transfer -- to acquire the 12.5% shareholding held by the savings bank in MAPFRE
Internacional. And the operation is completed by the selling of our stake in Banco Caja
Madrid-MAPFRE of 49% roughly. And this operation includes a payment of EUR188.6
million to CAJA Madrid in compensation for our acquisition of the 12.5% in MAPFRE
Internacional.
It's important to note that this agreement maintains our strategic alliance for both the
groups signed in 1998, and the cooperation between our respective distribution networks
will continue.

Page 2 of 20

I would like to remember here that it's not only a bancassurance agreement, but also an
agreement to sell banking products through the network of branches of MAPFRE.

FINAL

As a result of the transaction, an impairment of the EUR40.8 million before taxes has
been accounted in our First Quarter results, which is reduced to EUR3.4 million after taxes
and minorities due to the tax deductibility of the losses generated by the bank so far.
So after this operation has been authorized in these ways, we will complete the operation
in the next weeks and Banco Caja Madrid-MAPFRE will disappear off our perimeter of
consolidation.
Let's now move on the following slide where, after the meeting of the Board of Directors
this morning, the Board approved a scrip dividend operation in order to finance the
acquisition of the 12.5% stake in MAPFRE Internacional which is the percent as I note
before, payment of EUR188m. The operation is in the same scheme that the previous
ones and the issuance price will be fixed at the end of May.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide eight we explain how the consolidation of operations with Banco Do Brasil and
the conclusion of agreement and the subsequent authorization in place for us the
necessity of recognizing our result corresponding to the cancellation of market value of
the put option we held on the 51% shareholding in MAPFRE Nossa Caixa Vida E
Previdencia and was granted to MAPFRE upon its acquisition.
This result amounts a contribution to the consolidating result after taxes and minorities of
EUR96.8m.
In page nine there is a breakdown of the main non-recurring or extraordinary items in
2010 and 2011. In both years, accounting results contain exceptionally large earthquake
losses and financial gains.
The good news is that adjusting for these, the profit of the insurance business continues
to grow about 10% and that non-insurance losses have decreased significantly reinforcing
our stated intention to focus on our insurance operation as I said before.
If we move to the following slide you can see the main figures of our Group in this quarter
compared with the same quarter 2010.
I will now hand over the call to Mr. Lubelli who will explain our financial in greater detail.

Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Thank you, Esteban. Good afternoon, to you all. Let us move to slide number 12 where we
find the usual breakdown of premiums and profit by region and business.

FINAL

As is to be expected, taking into account growth differentials, the weight of the foreign
business went up again bringing in 54% of premiums against 49% in the same period of
2010.
Conversely, adjusting for the non-recurring items and earthquakes claims in both years,
the contribution to insurance profits of the foreign business has fallen from 50% roughly in
2010 to about 40% this year due to the strong improvement in underwriting profits in
Spain.
On the next slide number 13 we see a summary of premiums growth. It has come
primarily from Latin America with increases of 24% in non-life and 10% in Life over there.
Brazil remains the main contributor and brought in 11% of MAPFRE's total consolidated
premiums.
Among the main drivers of the growth was the commercial insurance business, as well as
the success of several sales initiatives, and a distribution agreements undertaking in the
past quarters.

Bloomberg Transcript

Growth was also remarkable at MAPFRE Asistenica thanks to the travel insurance business
written through Insure And Go, the company we acquired last year in the UK and organic
growth in Latin America.
Growth was also significant in MAPFRE Re, reflecting a successful renewal campaign and
at MAPFRE Internacional, owing to larger business volumes and tariff hikes in the US and
Turkey.
The Spanish business shows a contraction that is concentrated primarily in Life, due to a
different timing of sales campaigns in the bancassurance channel.
The fall in the non-Life business reflects primarily the slow growth of the economy.
Moving on to the next slide number 14, we find the breakdown of sales by distribution
channel in Spain. Agent sales in the Life business fell modestly in Spain due to the intense
competition for savings, especially from banks.
The fall in non-Life came primarily from the motor and commercial line.
Life bancassurance sales fell, as I said before, due to the different timing of sales
campaigns. Non-Life sales on the contrary grew, primarily due to the consolidation of
insurance business of CATALUNYACAIXA which brought in premiums for slightly over
EUR9m.
On slide number 15 we find the development of technical results. Mr. Tejera already spoke
about that. The combined ratio shows a considerable improvement compared to the
same period of the previous year. More specifically, the loss ratio fell 2.7percentage

FINAL

points, which reflects primarily the impact of the Chilean earthquake in the same quarter
of the previous year which affected very strongly MAPFRE Re and MAPFRE Global Risk and
MAPFRE America.
This year we also have two earthquakes; the Japanese and the New Zealand
earthquakes, which only affect MAPFRE Re, and also have a very large impact but an
impact which however, is comparatively smaller to the impact of the Chilean earthquake
which is then a positive effect.
MAPFRE Familiar had a strong performance thanks to a much smaller weight of weather
related and civil servant claims. As you remember, last year we had especially bad
weather in Spain and we still had in our books the civil servant's business. This was
reinforced by a very benign experience in household and peril insurance this year, as well
as strong growth in net premiums earned.
MAPFRE Empresas benefitted from exceptionally low frequency and severity.
And MAPFRE Re from very good result, resulting from the closure of the previous year
accounts.

Bloomberg Transcript

This was very strong positive impact overall which compensated for the significant spike
at MAPFRE Internacional where we suffered from severe weather related claims in the US.
On the contrary, the expense ratio went up, mainly due to the impact of reorganization
costs of the Spanish distribution network, the costs linked to the launch of Verti and the
rise of VAT in Spain which was especially noted at MAPFRE Familiar.
The acquisition expenses went up at MAPFRE Global Risk, basically because of the relative
growth of Internacional business which is mostly intermediated through brokers.
On slide number 16 we find the explanation of the non-Life accounts. I think I have already
covered at length the drivers of premium growth and the combined ratios. I will not
repeat that again. Only to note that the financial income decreased compared to the First
Quarter of 2010 due to smaller realization gains last year. As you can remember, the
amount was quite large.
On slide number 17 we have the Life accounts. Here, as I have already said twice, we have
different schedule for sales campaigns in Spain. That's really the most significant impact
and leads to a contraction of premiums. With respect to the previous year, that was partly
compensated by business growth in Latin America.
We see a material increase in the underwriting and financial result. This is because the
gains in Brazil Mr. Tejera was referring to previously, are reflected in this line and they
compensated for lower underwriting results in Brazil and smaller business volume in the
quarter in Spain.

FINAL

All these figures include the consolidation of the operations of CATALUNYACAIXA which
last year were not there.
On slide 18 we have the other business activities. Here we see that both revenues and
expenses fall considerably. That has an explanation. MAPFRE Quavitae is reclassified as a
discontinued operation, so we no longer show their figures here but just as a line before
the very bottom line. Then a decrease in business volumes as we know in insurance
operations of MAPFRE Familiar.
The net financial income, you see that shows a much larger net negative balance than the
previous year and that's because it includes the impairment from Banco De Servicios
Financieros Caja Madrid-MAPFRE that Mr. Tejera referred to.
If you adjust for that, the figure is broadly similar to that of the figures here.
The results from minority interests, on the contrary, improved notably because of an
improvement once again in Banco De Servicios Financieros Caja Madrid-MAPFRE.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide 19 we see the variation in profit at the operating companies. There is a very large
improvement in MAPFRE America which, once again, reflects the gains in Brazil we already
cited. If you were to exclude that, the profit would grow about 10%.
The MAPFRE Familiar shows a contraction on the other hand. This is because last year they
had realization gains. They actually have realization gains also this year but on a much
smaller scale.
If you adjust for both in both years, net income would have grown roughly 25%, about
EUR20 million more.
As I said, MAPFRE Internacional suffered from large weather related claims in the US which
explains the fall in its profit.
MAPFRE Re also shows a fall due to earthquake related claims in Japan and New Zealand.
They also had some impact from the floods in Australia.
MAPFRE Global Risk was significantly affected by the Chilean earthquake in 2010. Given
that they no longer have that this year, they have a strong improvement.
And as I said before, MAPFRE Empresas is benefitting from lower claims frequency and
severity.
On slide number 20 we find the bottom line. As Mr. Tejera pointed out, we have an
underlying result growth of 2.2%. We have the restatement of the financial accounts in
Venezuela which basically is a comparable impact. It's not material.

Page 6 of 20



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2011-05-04

We have a larger income tax because of the rate applied to the results recognized in
Brazil. Last year, conversely we had a comparatively lower tax rate because of the
significant weight of realization gains in Spain.

FINAL

As we have seen in other quarters, the minority shareholders grow faster than the net
result because of the growing contribution from bancassurance JVs in Spain and from the
international operations in which we have minorities.
On slide number 21 we have the balance sheet. The page shows the main explanations.
We clearly have been affected by the depreciation of the US dollar and generally
speaking of the American currencies.
You will notice a decrease in the cash balances. That is mainly due to the fact that we have
decided to reinvest part of them in longer dated assets. As was to be expected, the
market value of investments has fallen due to the volatility in the markets I believe you are
all aware of.

Bloomberg Transcript

And in terms of magnitude, compared to the same period over the previous year, we
have the consolidation of CATALUNYACAIXA and of Insure And Go; primarily
CATALUNYACAIXA.
Finally, we find on slide 22 the changes in equity. We see a decrease from the close of the
previous year. As I said before, we are negatively impacted by the volatility in financial
markets, although, as usual, we are shadow accounting compensating to a large extent
for that.
We have negative translation differences. Last year we have a gain. The overall, the net
balance is quite large. It's more than EUR330m. Of course, there is a dividend approved
by the AGM and the results of the quarter.
That is all from me. I'm handing the call back to Mr. Tejera for the Q&A.

Company N ame: M apfre SA

Yes hello. I have a couple of questions. First is on the rationale for returning to the scrip
dividend. You mentioned that this is to finance the position of the minorities in MAPFRE
Internacional. So I would like to understand what's the impact on the solvency ratios from
this acquisition because I understand the goodwill of this acquisition is bringing is small, is
limited whereas the impairment for the sale of the banking business is small, and you are
also having a material capital gain in your Brazilian operations to the capital base. So in
other words, why a capital increase for such a small acquisition? I mean there is anything
new in the capital models, in Solvency II? You are more concerned with the risk of your
investment portfolio at this point in time? So this would be the first question.
Shall I make the second question?

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Francisco, if you want we can reply to the first question. Well it's true that our situation
capital was comfortable and the amount of the operation is not so big. But in any case,
there is a necessity of paying EUR188m. That's a cash problem, not a capital one. But
there have been some changes in the last year in the requirements of capital in the
(technical difficulty) of (604) that would require more investment for the same -- more
capital for the same investments, mainly the investment located in Spain in real estate.
There is also some concerns about the possible evolutions of the split in this month
mainly in Portugal.
So we can't survive without dividends obviously. But we feel that these operations will
have a impact -- positive impact in the future in our stake in MAPFRE, in the Banco De
Servicios Financieros Caja Madrid-MAPFRE, and at the same time, we had more
requirements of capital even in the same situation than before.
But the 12.5% of the MAPFRE Internacional also introduced a little bit more requirements
from the insurance risk in our capital model even if we have now goodwill in this operation.
Summarizing, we can do or not do this scrip dividend, but the final decision of the Board
this morning has been to make these scrip dividends.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

If I may add Paco, there is a technical element. The minority shareholders are one of the
components of the economic capital. So to the extent that we are losing a part of that,
that basically makes up for the loss.
As far as the Brazilian impact is concerned, you are right there is also a negative foreign
exchange impact in our accounts. So basically, one kills out the other. So they are
compensated for one another. So it's basically a way of maintaining capital, economic
capital levels where they are.
Have we answered your question Paco or do you need further clarification?

Q - Francisco Riquel

{BIO 3050316 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes it is very clear, thank you. I will now proceed to the second question which is now that
you have already the regulatory approval for the Brazilian JV, if you could please update
us with some numbers and the impact from the consolidation of Brazil. What would be the
pro forma income that you would consolidate?
The impact on the combined ratio, I have seen that you are approaching 100% combined
ratio already in your Latin American operations. Would it have fallen below 100% if
consolidating Brazil?
Impact in net profit would it be accretive or not?
ROE, Latin America, how would it look like?
So updates on the impact on Brazil.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Paco, we have not released any figures basically because we think/hope that the
consolidation will take place in the Second Quarter of this year. So hopefully, with the
figures of June -- from June onwards, you will see the contribution of the JV coming into
our accounts.
I think the latest pro formas we gave about this were last year. I think it was with the
Goldman Sachs conference presentation. So I wouldn't be able to give you more
information.
At that time -- I mean historically the combined ratio of the operations of Banco Do Brasil
was below, slightly below the level of the operations of MAPFRE. So theoretically, it should
dilute the combined ratio down if things stay as they were. But as I say, we don't have
updated pro formas for that.

Q - Francisco Riquel

{BIO 3050316 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Your next question comes from (Masish Vasilovich) of Morgan Stanley. Please ask your
question.

Q - Masish Vasilovich
Hi, Masish from Morgan Stanley. I'll take two questions if that's possible.
The first question I'd ask is on just whether or not you can reveal whether or not reserve
releases played a material role in your combined ratio overall or in particular markets this
Page 9 of 20



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity

quarter.

FINAL

And also a request that, if possible, it would be useful to get that reserve release
information perhaps in the presentation in the future. So that's I guess a request.
The second question, I just want to ask is to do with the Bankia situation. Whether or not
there's any further statements you can make about what you know about the intentions
with MAPFRE stake. Whether it might be transferred into various different organisms
within the Bankia restructure, or alternatively also what MAPFRE's intensions are; whether
or not MAPFRE can categorically rule out supporting a Bankia IPO?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Okay. Good afternoon Masish. As you rightly point out, we have not given the figures for
the reserve releases, so that amount we cannot give you.
What we can tell you from a qualitative standpoint is that they were not material in these
accounts. So they were not significant.
With regards to the second question, perhaps Esteban will.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Well our relationship with Caja Madrid allow us to be very
comfortable for the future as partners of Bankia in the bancassurance business. But it's
very early to know how this actually where we are at from the point of view of the
evolution of this business where a lot of (inaudible) should be done in the near future
inside this operation where our partners have more than 50% of the operation as you
know.
From the point of view taking a stake in the capital of Bankia it will depend on how this
operation will be planned in the future and from an independent approach from MAPFRE
because if the conditions of the operation are good, we are the original investors and we
can take a stake. In any case this stake will be as investor and not as a stake as a position
of the reference partners of the operation.
So from the point of view of our position as bancassurance, our -- the evolution of the
business will mark our position there and I think that we must wait for the future.
As possible shareholders of the Bankia we are insurers and we are institutional investors
and we will invest in Bankia as far as the conditions of the issue of the new capital in
Bankia provides us the rationale of a good investment from the point of view of the
profitability. And this, in any case, would be within the limits of our prudent investment
policy in MAPFRE in stocks.

Q - Masish Vasilovich
Page 10 of 20



Company N ame: M apfre SA

FINAL

So would it be correct to say then, based on the fact that you invest as an investor rather
than a strategic partner, that the size of any stake that you purchase in Bankia would be
relatively small? Would that be fair to say? I guess you can't put a figure no it but I guess if
you're just an investor, you wouldn't take a $0.5 billion stake or anything like that would
you?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Just a second Masish.

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Yes, our position will be more as an institutional investor than a preferential partner as a
general rule. But it will be depend obviously on the conditions of the issuance.

Q - Masish Vasilovich
Yes. Thank you.

Operator
The next question comes from Giulia Raffo of Autonomous. Please ask your question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon. My first question relates again to the rationale for
the dividend reinvestment plan. I understand what you said beforehand about maintaining
your capital level unchanged, but it has to be said that when we look at the cash flow of
EUR188m, EUR189m, that you have to pay as a compensation, that should be around the
level of a quarterly free cash flow generation from your part. So I would have expected
you to be able to fully compensate that with internal capital generation since you are
making profit. So I was wondering why did you not take into account the fact that you are
only distributing 50% of your earnings in dividend, and therefore ever year you are
retaining free cash flow.
My second question relates, sorry, as a follow-up on that, should we then expect that if
future acquisition opportunities will present themselves in the coming months you would
like to maintain your capital unchanged at current levels and therefore we should expect
either scrip or capital issuance to finance those?
My third question relates to the gain of EUR90 million plus that you book in Q1 for the
Banco do Brasil. I was wondering whether you can clarify the nature of that capital gain.
Am I right in thinking there is just this simply a write-up on your current book of business
that you will contribute in the joint venture and that is going to be contributed with a
valuation higher than its current book value? And if that is the case, should we expect an
intangible item to come in the balance sheet to offset that EUR90 million capital gain.
Thank you very much.

FINAL

Good afternoon, Giulia. Okay let's go one-by-one. You are right in your initial conclusion.
The fact is that things to do no stand still in the sense that it is true that we are earning a
profit every quarter, but it's also true that the risks we have to cover move. As the volume
of business grows, also the risks we have to cover grow and they require capital, so the
capital that is generated is employed.
There are reasons for which we don't pay the full amount of our profits in dividends is
because we need that capital and we need that cash for the operations. So that is
essential liquidity. It seems that we're only accumulating profits, but as a matter of fact,
we're using those profits.

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Sorry, on that, it's true that you've grown by, if I look at the last 18 months your main
growth has been external. I mean organically, your Spanish business has been in a decline,
so your risks there have not increased and where you've grown in Spain is because you
bought things and what you bought in Spain you financed with scrip. So South America is
the only area where you've had genuine organic growth. I can see that not 100% of your
profit of free cash flow, but I would have expected 70% of your earnings to be free cash
flow. Therefore the delta between the 45% payout and the 70% it should be there to
finance those small deals. But as I said, this is just my view. Maybe I'm completely wrong in
that.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

No, you're not completely wrong Giulia. The fact is that I'm afraid it's, you're directionally
correct, but then when it comes to the interplay of the various factors and loadings things
are not that straightforward. So it depends. Some risks require more capital than others.
Then as Esteban just pointed out before, on the Standard & Poor's side there's also been
a, I would say quite substantial increase of loadings on some risks based in Spain which
has somehow changed the equation. So you could even say that we've been
parsimonious in the use of capital for that purpose. So yes, but no. Your initial conclusion is
right, but when you get into the reality of the various loadings, it is more complex than this
scrip dividend was warranted and it was not, frankly, such a substantial increase of our
economic capital at the end of the day relative to the risk we have to cover I mean.

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

So should we expect that you're happy with the current level of capital. Therefore any
future deal, if it comes, should be financed in a similar way?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

The fact is you're looking for a sworn declaration of our future capital raising plans which I
cannot give you. That depends, jokes aside. You're very well linking it to your second
question. You know this probably better than we do; it's very difficult to say prior how
you're going to finance an acquisition. It very much depends on what you are buying and it
especially depends on the profile of the cash flows that the asset you're buying
generates. It's not the same, and I'm not telling you anything you don't already know, an
Page 12 of 20



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2011-05-04

asset which does not generate cash immediately perhaps has a higher equity content
than an asset which is immediately cash generating a large amount. So I cannot tell you.
That's an answer I cannot give you. It depends on what you're buying.

FINAL

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

If you thought that EUR190 million investment warranted a scrip, it's fair to say that you
would not like to deviate materially from your current solvency situation. Is that fair?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Well we're trying to preserve it, as we said before, where we clearly, we don't want to
weaken our capital position and also, as you also know very well, this a moment of great
uncertainty with respect to Solvency II and how it can affect you. So doing funny things with
your capital structure at this time perhaps is not the most sensible approach.
As I said before here, the models have plugs and one of the plugs in the model is the
minorities. In this case, it was very clear. You extract a certain amount of minorities so your
capital is left limping, if you wish, on that side and the replacement plug is the scrip
dividend in this case.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then we also have to see how much money is raised through this scrip dividend. We know
how much money we have lost. I wouldn't assume that penny by penny or cent by cent
we're actually going to raise exactly the same money, but broadly that's kind of the
thinking behind that because this case you have like-for-like. If it were an acquisition, it
would have to be dealt with in a different way.
Does this clarify your -- does this answer your question Giulia?

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Yes, yes, very much.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

And do I take it that I also answered your question on future acquisition opportunities?

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Yes, yes, fair enough. I wasn't expecting more on that.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

And in terms of the option, basically this is a bit contorted but I'll try to explain it. In many, if
not in every, bancassurance agreements there's always put options granted on both sides
for those instances in which, for some reason, one of the two partners has to leave the
JV. And so we had it in the case of Nossa Caixa.

So given the fact that there was change in ownership due to the movements of assets
because of the alliance with Banco do Brasil, that option had a value and we could have
exercised that option. However, given that we have agreed to contribute this asset along
with other assets to the JV --

FINAL

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

You're not cashing in anything?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

It's not a matter of cashing in, but basically you're relinquishing an option which has a,
which is in the money, and it's part of several asset movements that you're doing as part
of the transaction. So this value becomes recognized as part of the transaction, together
with other values.

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Right, so am I right that there will be an intangible compensation for it at some point in Q2
when you're going to consolidate?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

I heard your question on intangibles. With respect to that one, I will hold my answer until
the next quarter because this transaction is so complex and there are so many
movements from an accounting standpoint, because true there are movements on the
intangibles, but true also there are movements on the reserves. So in order to get the
whole picture and which, by the way, we don't have because it's been done just now. I
mean it's being processed now. I would ask you to wait to the next quarter, supposing,
you mean, this finally takes place, as we hope and expect in the next quarter you will be
getting much more precise information on this one. Presently we don't have it.

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Thank you. Just a very, very quick one. Can you tell us the net/net contribution of
CATALUNYACAIXA, because you highlight EUR16.5 million pretax, pre-minority. I assume
the net number should be between EUR7 million and EUR8m, but I would just be curious
to have the net/net figure.

A - Jesus Amadori Carrillo

{BIO 17699282 <GO>}

Sorry, I'm Jesus. The calculation is pretty simple. It's 16 times 50 times 70%. So net/net it
would be pretty much what you said, EUR5m.

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

EUR6m, yes okay. So are you still satisfied about that transaction with EUR24m, EUR25
million earnings power against EUR450 million spent 12 months ago.

Giulia, I'm Esteban. We are just starting. We are just starting and this quarter has been
very, very tough for everybody in bancassurance in Spain. Especially in CATALUNYACAIXA
they have had a lot of other problems.
But in any case ,the way they are working is a very professional one and I think that in the
near future they condition of the interest rate change for better, from the point of view of
launching these kinds of products, the figures will improve. In any case, in non-life they are
working very well and we will see the fruits of this in the near future, I hope.

question.

Q - Marcus Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just two questions for me. Could you give some sort of
sense about the cash position of the holding company given the sort of requirements for
cash over the coming months? You've got the dividend obviously in June. There's some
debt repayment coming up in July. The minorities, I guess we have to wait for when the
authorizations occur, but obviously the consolidated numbers you've given, it's roughly
about EUR980 million something like that, and this is potentially an outgoing of over
EUR700m. Granted there's obviously the scrip option in there as well.
Then just giving some further clarification about your intentions about that July senior debt
repayment as well please.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Good afternoon, Marcus. Thank you for the question. I think it's relevant for everybody. As
I was telling Giulia before, when we decide both the dividend payments and we make our
capital budgeting we take into account all of these aspects.
The -- clearly we have incoming and outgoing cash at the holding company, plus we're
have in lines. So taking into account, if you're asking, basically I take it that these two
questions are linked. If your question is whether we are planning to raise additional
funding in order to repay the EUR270 million maturing bond on the July 11, the answer is
no. We believe we have enough cash resources through the dividends we're going to
receive and through uncommitted or unused credit facilities to be able to repay that
amount without going to the markets. Am I answering both questions or am I leaving
anything out?

No I think that is exactly right It's obviously uncommitted credit. Could you just clarify
exactly what the headroom under that is at the moment please?

FINAL

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Well you will find it in the presentation on slide, now I'm telling you on which slide you'll
find it on, it's at the beginning of the Appendix and it's slide 45. So we have a syndicated
credit facility which matures in 2013 which at the close of March had EUR260 million drawn,
so it had EUR240 million undrawn.

Q - Marcus Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

EUR240 million undrawn, okay, sorry. I beg your pardon.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Plus the incoming cash etc, etc, etc.

(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Atanasio Pantarrotas of
Cheuvreux. Please ask your question.

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

{BIO 5933123 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon to everybody. I have two questions. The first related on the financial
income in the Non-life business. Can you provide in the slide number 16 which part of the
EUR193.5 million of revenues came from the financial income and the related figure in Q1
'10?
The second question, again, on the joint venture in Brazil. Just to clarify, the realized gain
of EUR98m, is it linked to the disposal of part of the Life business to your partner or it's a
different story? Thank you.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Good afternoon, Atanasio. I believe you will find the information you're looking for
regarding the Non-life accounts, otherwise you can tell me if it's not on slide 50, where
you have a breakdown of the financial income. There you should have enough information
to compare these two quarters. I wonder if you can check it out whether that provides the
information you're looking for?

{BIO 5933123 <GO>}

Okay.

FINAL

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

So you have the financial income and then we show you how much is realized capital gains
and how much is ForEx. So deducting those you get the underlying in both years. And if
you will, your net/net balance will be a growing financial income because of larger financial
income in Latin America and higher returns in Spain. The average reinvestment rate is
higher last year than it was last year.

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

{BIO 5933123 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And the second question, well of course, it is in the sense that it's not as if we, we
wouldn't have been able to recognize this amount had it not been for the granting of the
authorizations. So yes it's a gain that is recognized within the framework of the -- but it has
to be understood it's not because of the option itself. It's recognized in the framework of
the whole transaction with the bank.
As you remember, when we announced it the first time there also will be a cash payment
by Banco do Brasil reflecting the differences in the -- the net amount of all the differences
that go into this one. Unfortunately this is a very complex transaction. That was part of my
answer to Giulia. It is very difficult to say this item precisely is valued this much. It's a
combination of many movements of assets which leads to net balances.

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

Your next question comes from Andreas Van Embden of JPMorgan. Please ask your
question.

Q - Andreas Van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. I've a question about MAPFRE Re. Are you able to describe what
type of exposures you have in Japan and how much of the EUR150 million net cat loss for
the quarter was Japan and how much was New Zealand and/or Australia?
The second question as well on Japan is what is the maximum loss, or your peak
exposure, for the Japanese quake?
And the last question is this year did you also underwrite hurricane risk in the US or quake
risk in the US? Thank you.

FINAL

Okay, very detailed questions. Marcus let's see. The nature of the exposure is essentially
property the one we have. I cannot give you, because it's not disclosed, the precise
amount of Japan. Also bear in mind one thing, Japan is an amount that is being assessed.
The devastation was significant so also the information that's coming from the receiving
companies is yet to be collected in full.
What I can tell you is that we have tried to be as prudent as we could possibly be. So we'd
rather approach it conservatively, and in that respect, although the maximum amount
which we could lose is not disclosed, I can tell you that we're not that far away from that
amount. So we've tried to be prudent in this regard with any information that is scant to
some extent. Now I think everyone is trying to make their best efforts to tell exactly what
their exposure is but you can only get that far.
In terms of quake exposure to the US I don't have that information with me. I don't know. It
doesn't ring a bell as one of the biggest exposures we have in MAPFRE quake to the US.
Hurricanes is part of the exposures we have and it's priced according to market. We do
have that exposure. Quakes I'm not that sure. But I know in MAPFRE what is most likely to
affect us would be a quake in Latin America as was the case last year in Chile. They would
be among the top PMLs, but the US does not ring a bell as one of them.

Q - Andreas Van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, but is the US PML, is that more or less the same as Japan or LatAm or well below?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

That amount, you're asking me amounts which are not disclosed so I cannot answer your
question, but I can tell you in terms of qualitative exposures. MAPFRE, because of the
business it writes and because of the countries where it is present is primarily exposed to
events of that nature, let's say, in Latin America. It is evident that we have been affected
by Japan, so there it's there. But the largest ones would still be, the largest PMLs would
still be there. I think it is difficult to see one that is larger than Chile last year, so that gives
you perhaps a benchmark in order to gauge to what extent we are exposed.

Q - Andreas Van Embden

Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Masish Vasilovich of Morgan Stanley. Please ask your
question.

Q - Masish Vasilovich
Hi, it's me again. Thanks for taking the second question from me. Well I guess the third
and fourth question actually, because my third question would be just on the Caja Madrid
situation again, we know that there's break clauses that tie up various distribution
Page 18 of 20



Company N ame: M apfre SA

Date: 2011-05-04

FINAL

agreements within the Bankia structure at the moment such, and we've heard from some
of your competitors that those break clauses are extremely punitive in that actually
leveraging a competitor out of Bankia could be an extraordinarily expensive move. I guess
I'm just wondering whether or not you can, in any way quantify what we can expect from
there, or alternatively, give us some kind of a timeline as to when we might be able to get
a little bit more information on that front?
And I guess the last question I'll ask is just whether or not it might be possible to publish
PMLs in the future for the Reinsurance business given that it's now becoming a very, very
significant -- well a more significant part, of your overall business.

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you. We are not tied for all the agreements that we sign. So if Bankia had previous
agreements, it's a question that Bankia must solve. We, as possible or future partners in
this kind of business, will assess this business according to the business plan they prepare
in the future. But how to solve previous problems is not our concern in this case.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I think that the situation now is that we must wait for several months to know exactly
how the situation evolves in Bankia and in other, these kinds of agreements with other
banks and institutions. And I think that part of the process is to restructure the commercial
networks and to solve this kind of previous agreement they have with different partners.
Then, when the situation is clarified, we can talk about a new business plan, how these
business plans affect the future evolution of the business and then be able to assess a
value for this kind of business. Talking now is too early for that.

Q - Masish Vasilovich
Okay.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

With regard to your question on the P&L Masish, I take note of your
suggestion/recommendation. I classify it along the requirements with the reserve
releases. This is something we will have to speak to our reinsurance people.
At times I'm under the impression that you feel that we actually are not releasing
information because we like to be opaque. In reality is that some informations are
sensitive from a business standpoint. So we will have to see to what extent they feel
comfortable with revealing that information without that being detrimental to their
commercial interests. But for the moment we have no intentions, we have no plans to
release the PMLs.

Q - Masish Vasilovich
Okay. Thank you.
