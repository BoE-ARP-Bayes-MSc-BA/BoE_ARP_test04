{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Thanks, Sabra, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. The Hartford is
off to a very good start in 2017. Core earnings per diluted share increased 5% in the first
quarter and we returned over $400 million to shareholders through repurchases and
common dividends. Underlying P&C results were strong, however, catastrophe losses
were exceptionally high due to elevated seasonal wind and hail activity in the Central U.S.
Starting with personal auto, the pricing, underwriting and distribution actions we have
implemented over the past 18 months are gaining traction. The underlying combined ratio
improved over 5 points when adjusting first quarter 2016 loss ratios for the adverse
development we recognized during calendar year 2016.
We know written price increases have been in the high-single-digit range over the past
several quarters and exceeded 10% this quarter, while our accident year loss ratio picks
for 2015 and 2016 are holding. While the top line is down, our ARP relationship is a
competitive advantage for The Hartford and our deep knowledge of this customer
segment positions us well for growth in personal auto as margins continued to improve.
All in, I'm pleased with the progress and remain confident that we will achieve improved
results in 2017 and continuing into 2018.
Commercial Lines achieved a 90.9 underlying combined ratio, reflecting disciplined
underwriting in a competitive market. Small Commercial posted outstanding performance
with 6% written premium growth and excellent margins, but competition remains robust.
We're intently focused on advancing our leadership in this market by innovating and
enhancing our best-in-class capabilities. We're doing this by leveraging our technology,
data and underwriting expertise, deep agency relationships and leading customer service
centers.

FINAL

Middle Market delivered good performance with 4% growth in written premiums and a
93.8 underlying combined ratio. In this challenging middle market environment, we remain
committed to disciplined risk selection. The overall Commercial Lines results reflect the
investments we've made over the past several years, which have enabled us to become
a substantially broader and deeper risk player with expanded product capabilities in new
industry verticals.
In addition, our acquisition of Maxum is already contributing as our new E&S capabilities
have given us the opportunity to participate in the wholesale marketplace. Group Benefits
delivered excellent core earnings this quarter excluding a charge for the previously
disclosed Penn Treaty liquidation. Top-line growth picked up to 4% and loss experience
continues to be excellent, reflecting our claims expertise and the improvements we've
made in our book of business over the years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Group Benefits is a core strategic business for The Hartford with a well-established brand
and a Top Five market position. The business has momentum with good traction and
voluntary sales activities with our enhanced product suite and a total sales pipeline that's
up significantly over the prior year. Mutual Funds had a great quarter with total assets
under management now exceeding $100 billion. Strong market conditions and investment
performance led to sales of over $7 billion and net positive flows of $1.3 billion, including
significant sales and flows from the Schroeder sub-advised funds.
As we look forward in 2017, our strategic priorities remain consistent: organic growth,
improved customer experience and developing new operating capabilities. The priority
for our excess capital is to support these strategic objectives, particularly in areas such as
Small Commercial, specialty risk products, A&H, Benefits in industry verticals that expand
our underwriting appetite.
We want to provide agents and policyholders with insurance solutions for more of their
risk needs and be an easier company for them to do business with. As I've said before,
we have an organic growth orientation, but we will consider acquisitions that make
financial sense and accelerate the achievement of our strategic objectives.
In closing, I am pleased with our execution in navigating very competitive market
conditions in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits and with the progress we've made in
personal auto. I'm optimistic about the initiatives we have underway to continue to
profitably grow our businesses and to create long-term shareholder value.
Now I'll turn the call over to Doug.

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. First quarter results for Property &
Casualty and Group Benefits, excluding catastrophes, were very good and consistent with
our expectations. Our Commercial Line businesses posted strong underlying
performance in a competitive market. Personal Lines auto lost cost trends were in line with
the full-year outlook we shared in February. And after a very challenging 2016, we're
Page 3 of 20

FINAL

pleased with our progress. And Group Benefits posted another quarter of strong
earnings, excluding the Penn Treaty guaranteed fund assessment.
Before I get into the details of our performance, let me touch on catastrophe losses,
which were $150 million pre-tax for the quarter. Wind, hail and tornado activity across the
South, Southeast and Midwest was higher than normal. First quarter catastrophes typically
involve winter storm events, which were not as significant this year. Compared to first
quarter 2016, our catastrophe losses were up $59 million pre-tax. However, last year,
several catastrophes hit near the close of the quarter. We subsequently received a
number of late reported commercial losses that drove our estimate for the quarter up to
$131 million by year-end. On this basis, catastrophe losses for first quarter 2017 increased
by $19 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let me now share some additional details on the performance of our business units. The
first quarter 2017 combined ratio for Commercial Lines was 96, up 4.9 points from 2016.
The increase was primarily due to higher catastrophe losses, as I just mentioned, and a
change to slightly adverse prior-year development versus favorable development last
year. Prior-year development for the quarter includes favorable development in worker's
compensation, where our loss trends remain excellent. Frequency trends continue to run
better than expectations, particularly in the more recent accident years. Bond was also
favorable as trends in both contract and commercial surety continued to emerge better
than expected.
On the other hand, commercial auto remains a hotspot for us as well as the industry, and
we increased prior-year reserves in Small Commercial and National Accounts to ensure
that we're proactively responding to the latest signals of higher bodily injury severity and
increased litigation. Although the prior-year development is disappointing, we continued
to achieve high-single-digit written price increases and execute on our underwriting
actions. Our new business and retentions across Commercial is down, which we expect to
continue into 2017.
The underlying combined ratio for Commercial Lines, which excludes catastrophes and
prior-year development, was very good at 90.9 for the first quarter, up 1.3 points from
2016, in line with our expectations. Given competitive market conditions, I'm very pleased
with our execution across all our Commercial businesses, recognizing that we have more
work to do in commercial auto. Renewal written pricing in Standard Commercial Lines was
3.3% for the first quarter, up 90 basis points from fourth quarter 2016.
Small Commercial was up in all lines versus prior year and sequentially. This speaks to the
strength of our value proposition in the marketplace and the ability of our team to
execute in product, sales and underwriting. In Middle Market, renewal written pricing
turned positive from flat in fourth quarter 2016. This is a market segment where price
competition has been notable. I'm encouraged by our disciplined pricing actions,
particularly in workers' compensation. Our underwriting teams continue to hold the line,
exercising sound judgment on a case-by-case basis.

Company Ticker: H I G US Equity

Small Commercial had an excellent first quarter, with an underlying combined ratio of 87.3.
Written premium grew 6%, driven by strong retentions and $154 million of new business
including $15 million from Maxum. Middle Market delivered a solid underlying combined
ratio of 93.8 for the first quarter, deteriorating 1.8 points from 2016. Slight margin
compression in several lines, including general liability and auto, was partially offset by
favorable non-catastrophe property losses. Expenses were higher due to increased
technology and other operating costs. Written premium increased 4% based on solid
retentions and strong new business production of $128 million, up 24% versus last year.
Our new business growth was driven primarily from our industry verticals and specialized
practice teams, which we've been steadily gaining traction over the last three to four
years.
In Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio of 97.5 for the first quarter
deteriorated 3.2 points from 2016. This was driven by higher operating costs and margin
compression and excess auto liability. Written premium in Specialty Commercial was up
5% for the quarter, largely the result of strong new and renewal premium and bond.

Bloomberg Transcript

Shifting over to Personal Lines, we posted a combined ratio of 99.3 for the first quarter
2017, improving 0.6 point from a year ago. Higher catastrophe losses in 2017 were more
than offset by a change from unfavorable prior-year development in 2016 to slightly
favorable development this year. The underlying combined ratio of 91.2 deteriorated 1.5
points from last year. This was heavily driven by homeowners, where the underlying
combined ratio for the first quarter was 78.9, deteriorating 3.8 points versus last year due
to higher non-catastrophe weather and fire losses.
In Personal Lines auto, the underlying combined ratio for first quarter 2017 was 96.6 with a
loss ratio of 75.6 versus a 2016 reported loss ratio of 72.1. However, by year-end 2016, we
had increased the accident year auto loss ratio for first quarter 2016 by approximately 6
points. Compared to this adjusted loss ratio, first quarter 2017 has improved 2.6 points, as
noted in the slide presentation. We're closely monitoring the effects of our pricing,
underwriting and agency management actions on our overall loss costs and are very
pleased with the improving trends we see. Auto frequency moderated considerably in the
first quarter and severity returned to more historical levels.
The Personal Lines auto expense ratio for the first quarter was lower this year by
approximately 3 points due primarily to reduced new business acquisition expenses. The
first quarter auto loss ratio improvement is consistent with our expectations and in line
with the full year 2017 auto combined ratio outlook of 101 to 103 that we shared with you
back in February. That outlook includes approximately 1 point for catastrophes. Written
premium for Personal Lines was down 7% versus first quarter of last year. New business
has decreased as we have continued to address our rate needs with added filings and
improved underwriting segmentation. We're pleased with our progress to-date, as our
actions and results continued to track closely with our expectations. Given our improving
trends and higher rate levels, we expect to increase our ARP new business marketing
efforts during the second half of the year.
Now let me turn to Group Benefits. Core earnings for the first quarter was $40 million with
a margin of 4.3%. This includes a guaranteed fund assessment of $13 million after tax for
Page 5 of 20

FINAL

Penn Treaty, which we noted last quarter. Excluding this assessment, core earnings was up
$5 million, primarily due to favorable net investment income with an adjusted margin of
5.8%, reflecting very strong underlying performance in this business. The group life and
disability loss ratios this quarter were largely consistent with prior year. Group life trends
have been slightly favorable and very stable relative to the volatility we experienced in
2016. Group disability, although slightly elevated this quarter, continues to perform within
our expected range and we feel very positive about our trends.
Looking at the top line, first quarter fully ensured ongoing premium increased 4%. Overall
book persistency on our employer group block of business was approximately 90% and
fully insured ongoing sales were $211 million. Overall, it was a healthy sales quarter and
we're pleased with our competitive positioning in the market.
In summary, first quarter 2017 represents a solid start to the year for all our Property,
Casualty and Group Benefit businesses. Overall, we remain disciplined and balanced in
our execution to deliver profitable growth.
Let me now turn the call over to Beth.

Bloomberg Transcript

Beth Ann Bombara
Thank you, Doug. I'm going to cover the other segments, our investment performance,
and provide an update on the execution of our capital management plan. Strong
investment performance, net flows and rising equity markets led to Mutual Funds' core
earnings increasing to $23 million this quarter compared with $20 million in the first
quarter of 2016. At least 70% of our funds are beating their peers over the one-year,
three-year and five-year period. Sales of $7.2 billion generated positive net flows of $1.3
billion in the quarter compared to $4.7 billion of sales and approximately $200 million of
net outflows during first quarter of 2016. Strong equity markets and the adoption of the
Schroeder's funds in October 2016 drove total segment AUM to $103.2 billion, a 14%
increase from the same period in 2016.
Talcott continues to perform well. Core earnings were $83 million, up from $77 million in
the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to higher returns on limited partnerships. Over the
past four quarters, VA contract counts decreased 10% and fixed annuity contracts
decreased 6%. As a reminder, Talcott paid a dividend of $300 million to the holding
company in January and we expect another $300 million in the second half of the year.
Talcott ended the quarter with $4.1 billion in statutory surplus.
The investment portfolio also continues to perform well. Total LP investment income was
$70 million before tax compared to $8 million in the first quarter of 2016, which included
losses on hedge funds. Excluding LPs, the total before tax annualized portfolio yield was
4% this quarter, slightly lower than the 4.1% last year, largely due to the impact of lower
reinvestment rates versus the yield on sales and maturities over the past year. For the
P&C portfolio, the annualized yield excluding LPs was 3.7%, down from 3.8% in first
quarter 2016. Credit experience remains very good, with total impairments and mortgage

FINAL

loan valuation reserve charges of only $1 million before tax, down from $23 million in the
first quarter of 2016, which included energy impairments of $16 million.
To conclude on earnings, first quarter core earnings per diluted share was $1.00, up 5%
from $0.95 in first quarter f 2016 as the impact of our share repurchase program more
than offset the 2% decrease in core earnings. The 12-month core earnings ROE was 7.6%
and the core earnings ROE excluding Talcott was 8.6%, both of which include the impact
of prior development on our A&E exposures prior to the purchase of the loss
development cover. Excluding the A&E charge, the 12-month core earnings ROE excluding
Talcott was 10%. Turning to shareholders' equity, book value per diluted share, excluding
AOCI at March 31, 2017, was up 3% compared to a year ago.

Bloomberg Transcript

Before taking questions, I want to provide an update on the execution of our capital
management plan. During the quarter, we repurchased $325 million of stock. During the
month of April through the 25th, we repurchased about 1.9 million shares for $92 million.
This leaves approximately $883 million available under the $1.3 billion equity repurchase
authorization for 2017. With respect to debt management, in March, we repaid $416 million
of senior notes, which is our only 2017 debt maturity. We also exercised the option on the
Glen Meadow contingent capital facility, which resulted in the issuance of $500 million of
junior subordinated debt. As a reminder, we intend to use the proceeds to call our 8 1/8%
$500 million junior subordinated debentures when they become redeemable at par in
June 2018.
To conclude, we are off to a good start in 2017. The actions that we have taken in Personal
Lines are taking hold and we expect further improvement in 2017 and 2018. Underlying
results remain strong for Commercial Lines, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds, and we are
very pleased with our investment performance.
I will now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session.

Sabra Rose Purtill

FINAL

Yeah, thank you. A couple of quick ones here. First, Chris and Doug, I'm just curious, the
underlying combined ratio development that we saw in the Commercial Lines area,
particularly related to GL and commercial auto, is that something that you guys are
anticipating as you laid out guidance for the year kind of within where your expectations
are?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Brian, from a guidance side, Doug could give you a little more color on what we're really
seeing and feeling, but we don't guide for prior year adverse or positive development.
So, Doug, I know we've been watching commercial auto trends specifically. Do you mind
giving Brian a little more color?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

We have. So I guess couple of points. One is relative to general liability, a little bit of
pressure from a prior program, but we are watching the GL line overall. First quarter's
essentially in line with a little pressure from a program that we had had several years ago.
On the auto side, we've been underwriting, re-underwriting and working pricing the last
couple of years. A little bit of pressure in our excess National Account book and also in
Small Commercial. So feel good about the work we've done in Middle, but we did feel a
little bit of prior year pressure in Small, and we felt like we needed to address both that
and our National Account book.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great, thanks. And then second question is, Chris, there's a bill, I believe it's in the senate
right now, Connecticut senate, that would enable, I guess, you guys to break up Talcott
into separate pieces. Could you give us the status of kind of where you know that bill is
right now, kind of timeline it, and what would it mean for your kind of desires to get rid of
Talcott?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah, I think the bill you're referring to is we call it the divisions bill. I would share with you
it's something that we have sponsored. Really, from all our restructuring activities over the
last couple of years, Brian, we observed some better practices in different parts of the
country, or the world, in fact. And we have worked with the Connecticut department to
sponsor it. I would say sponsoring it and reading anything into what it means from a
possible transaction, I would not do that. I think what we viewed it as a piece of legislation
and rules and regulations that we thought our leading regulator, the Connecticut
Department of Insurance, should avail itself and avail all Connecticut companies with the
opportunity to separate businesses and legal entities and transact those types of
activities that are aligned to their go-forward transactions.
So the bill is in Congress right now. It's come out of Congress. The legislature side of
Connecticut – it needs to go to the senate side. It then needs to be signed by the
governor. The legislature is in session I think through late June, and we're optimistic that it
will get passed and signed by the governor.

Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your line is open.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thank you. I had a couple of questions first on personal auto. The magnitude of rate
increase, 10.5% in the current quarter, it's probably among the highest of any of the
companies I track. Just wanted to get your perspective on what kind of impact that's
having on Hartford within the market.

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Jay, thanks, this is Doug. Last quarter, I believe, on the call I did give you a little bit of a
forward lean into what we expected to see over the first three to four quarters of 2017
and this 10.5% is largely in line with that commentary. So yes, we're pleased. Obviously,
this is the written element, so it's got to earn its way in, but we feel like there's forward
traction on our actions, including pricing in our first line's book and encouraged by the
start to 2017.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Okay, and then on claims inflation personal auto, in the deck, it was mentioned that
there's less impact from personal auto frequency and severity. Can you provide some
more insight in terms of what you're seeing on the trends there?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Sure. On the frequency side, Jay, our numbers have essentially flattened out. So as we go
back over the prior couple of years, we had some small-single-digit moving to mid-singledigit pressure on frequency, and as we look back over this quarter and the last several
quarters, we feel very good and it's essentially flat.
On the severity side, as we've talked on prior calls, our plans were in the mid-single-digits,
maybe in the 4 to 5 range on severity, and first quarter essentially came in as expected.
So pleased that our view of the year is playing out as we had hoped. Very watchful – 90
days does not make a final outcome, but relative to the path we've carved and our goal
of over these two years to make the improvements financially that are required, very
good start to 2017.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Good to hear. And then separately, there's been some persistent press reports about a
potential Talcott transaction, and I'm just looking at the difference between statutory
capital, $4 billion and GAAP equity, ex AOCI, of $7.3 billion. If a transaction were to come in
below stack capital, how should we think about the financial implications of that?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Jay, it's Chris. I don't know what you mean. To me, it's math, right? I mean, you've got stat
and GAAP. You've got cash, and really, I don't feel comfortable speculating too much here
with you on any potential transaction. So to me, I just would tell you it'll be math, but I
mean, we've always said we're comfortable running Talcott off over a longer period of
time. We've shrunken its risk profile and that any transaction that we would consider has
to be first economic for us and our shareholders, it needs to be provable, a clean break,
potential parties need to take care of our customers and employees. So I mean, we know
the conditions that we're looking for, and beyond that, I just would ask you to do the math
yourself and you make your judgments on what you think it means.

Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your line is
open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I guess, was for Chris and just hearing him
emphasize Group Benefits as a core business. How do you think about weighing M&A
opportunities when you think about P&C, Commercial versus Group? And I guess more
specifically, you mentioned you're a Top 5 player. What would be the benefits, I guess, of
becoming even bigger than that? Thanks.

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Ryan, thanks for the question. I would just say from a business and capital allocation
perspective, Commercial Benefits, Personal Lines, Mutual Funds, I mean, we're
comfortable deploying capital into those businesses that make financial and strategic
sense. So specifically, if there is a Benefits opportunity in the marketplace, it's something
we would consider seriously looking at. We like our Group Benefits businesses. You can
see the returns, its earning. It has a concentration a little bit in the large national account
space of over 5,000 lives.
So Doug's leadership, we've been trying to grow the small to middle size of that. We've
completed our voluntary products suite. We think about A&H more broadly. So it would be
a business that we would want to continue to invest in and we think we have capabilities
and the brand to effectively compete over the long term.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Thanks, and then I just had a couple for Doug. I guess the first one, growth was good in
Small Commercial, but again emphasizing the competitive dynamic in the marketplace. Is
there potentially a need for another investment cycle, I guess, in that business in the near
to medium term just given what you're seeing coming out of peers?

FINAL

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Well, I guess I would answer it this way. I'm not sure we've ever stopped investing in Small
Commercial. There's no question there are a lot of interested parties looking at that
segment, trying to participate in that segment; we've been at it a long time. Very pleased
with last several years of progress, had an excellent quarter, but this year and next, big
priority around digital. The capabilities we have in the service center are selling skills, et
cetera, so I would like you to think about our investment in Small as ongoing and doubling
down as we move forward.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Okay. And then in Middle Market. Seeing the growth there in new business. If you could
just talk a little bit more about what was driving that and how you can see the momentum
there playing out throughout the rest of the year. Thanks.

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, good question, Ryan, and a little outsized and certainly quite a bit different than last
year first quarter, largely, as I mentioned in my script around our verticals. Construction
had an excellent first quarter as did marine and some of the other verticals. So we are still
grinding our way in the generalist space of Middle and the growth there was clearly not as
robust as it was in these other areas. Our momentum in construction has been very
positive over the last couple of years and in the first quarter, we were awarded two very
large athletic arenas in the United States. So feel good about some of the wins. Again, I
think it was a little outside, I don't expect to have four quarters of growth like that in those
verticals, but I am pleased with the progress.

Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Your line is open.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Thank you. A couple of questions. First, you talked about non-cat weather in the two
different segments having sort of offsetting impacts. Can you characterize the non-cat
weather in either segment as not relative to last year, but relative to expectations? Was it
unusual? Either bigger or less?

Sure Jay, I will try to do that for you. When we think about homeowners as I talked about
it, in that non-cat weather category and fire, we were essentially 3.5 points high than our
three- to five-year average over a period of time. I'd remind you that the early part of the
quarter had a lot of West Coast water activity, not just California but really up through the
Northwest. Got a sizeable part of our book on the West Coast. So we were impacted by
that water and also in our commercial book as well. So a little bit of out of pattern. We felt
the pressure from weather, but I think things will snap back in as we go forward.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

So homeowners, about 3.5 points above a normalized level, is that fair?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

That's correct. Driving essentially the 3.8% variance that I chatted about in our
homeowners XX.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yeah, that's helpful, thanks. And then the other question. Personal auto, acquisition cost
being down, is that a function of lower commissions? Less advertising through the AARP
channel? What really drives those lower costs?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Yeah. What was driving fundamentally this quarter change was lower marketing activities
associated with our personal auto book. So as I commented, as we feel and continue to
feel better about rate adequacy, which is going to be a quarter-to-quarter March moving
through this year and next, we will adjust accordingly, Jay, turning back on those, very
specific state-by-state basis, but I do think that run rate, we will not be able to continue at
that. You should expect to see some more marketing expense as we feel better about
our rate adequacy.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yes, that makes sense. Thanks, Doug.

Q - Gary Kent Ransom

{BIO 3446828 <GO>}

Good morning. There's been an increasing discussion on the impact of the plaintiff's bar
on loss trends. Either more lawyers working for cases, or more willing to go to trial, or
simply more legal representation. Are you seeing anything on that front?

FINAL

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Gary, we've looked hard at that issue, hard at that data, and with our new claims system
that we brought onboard the last couple of years, better visibility. As I look at the
representation rate, it's up slightly, but not in big numbers, so I feel slight representation
numbers up. What I do see, though, in our data is a higher, quicker trigger to litigation,
particularly at the moment around auto liability, and also GL. So we're watching very
quickly those cases that are with representation, and how quickly they're going to
litigation, and how that is working through our book of business.

Q - Gary Kent Ransom

{BIO 3446828 <GO>}

Just as a follow-up, if that is broad based, do you think the industry is responding in
pricing? And obviously they are in commercial auto, but maybe in GL, is there some
upward pressure on pricing because of those trends?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

It's a really good point. I do think the industry is responding to auto. I would absolutely
agree with you. I think GL, other liability is an area that needs more attention and would
benefit by a bit more discipline across the industry. It's a line that has our attention,
probably differently than a year or two years ago. I look at what we've been able to
achieve on the pricing side in middle in that core middle, and I think the line over time will
demand more rate so that we offset some of the trends that we will feel. I don't think
these litigation trends that others and we are talking about are going away anytime soon.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

It's Chris. I just would add, particularly given our book of business more in the middle, we
get exposed through our primary lines. We're not big umbrella or excess players. In fact,
as we think about the future and expanding our risk appetite, it's one area that really
causes us pause on the umbrella, the excess lines. Can we get paid and earn an
adequate return? So until we see a little more correction and realism in price and
exposure, I don't think we're going to deploy too much capital into excess umbrella lines
in GL.

Q - Gary Kent Ransom

{BIO 3446828 <GO>}

Right. Okay. Should I read anything into the little uptick in renewal pricing that we saw in
the first quarter versus last year?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Certainly, I'd ask you to read something in on Small Commercial, and that is we are
leaning into some of the signs in our book, first auto, which we've chatted about, but also
GL. We had some slip and fall-type classes over the last three to four quarters that, Gary,
we have tuned up our pricing around. And so those changes are real and they are
necessary.
As we step back in our middle market book and we look at trends, generally we feel
pretty good, Gary, about frequency across our core commercial middle market lines, but
Page 13 of 20

FINAL

there's a debate and discussion we're having about severity. And as I think about GL, it's a
line that I think you'll see us be thoughtful and lean into a bit more on the pricing side. We
expect that trends are not going to be in the 0-2 range out 2017 and 2018. I think it's more
likely that we feel a 4-5 range, and that is clearly not where the market is pricing that line
at the moment.

Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Pardon me. Great, thank you. Good morning. Doug, can you give us an indication of how
the adjusted auto loss ratio played out over 2016 so we can use that as a base for 2017?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Beth Ann Bombara
Yeah, Meyer, it's Beth. I'll take that question. So when you think about 2016, we increased
our loss picks for accident year 2016 both in the second quarter and in the fourth quarter.
And you may recall that in the fourth quarter, we talked about the fact that it was probably
about 6 points that we booked in Q4 that related to earlier quarters. So you can kind of
think about how you'd adjust the fourth quarter loss ratio. So it really leaves second and
third quarter, and the way we look at it, I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, is
that it's probably around 1 point to 2 points of difference you'd expect from what we
reported.
So in second quarter, the number we reported would be a little bit high because, again,
we had strength in the first quarter at that point. And then third quarter, the reported
number is probably a little bit low by that amount. And when we kind of put all of that
together, as Doug said, we do expect to see the improvement that was embedded in our
overall combined ratios that we gave as an outlook back in February.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. That's certainly helpful, thanks. Then second question. You talked about flattening
frequency. Again, I'm talking about personal auto. What have you been assuming in the
price changes that you've been filing and implementing?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Well, our 2017 plan had essentially a mid-single-digit total trend outlook. And the reason I
say we're encouraged by first quarter with flat frequency and in the 3, 3.5 range of
severity, feel like we're just underneath that. So a good start to the year. We'll see as we
go forward, again, next couple of quarters, but mid single digits is where the entire sector
has been running. Fast-track data is now out on fourth quarter, so you get a peek at that,
and that has been our Lean plus experience into our filings state by state, and there's a

Your next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Your line is open.

Q - Robert Glasspiegel

{BIO 1764160 <GO>}

Good morning, Hartford. Following up a little bit on Gary's question. So I think what you're
saying is that the sort of rates that you're taking, 3% or so in Standard Commercial, aren't
quite keeping up with underlying trend which you thought might be closer to 5%. I mean, I
give you credit – you're one of the few companies publicly sort of saying that our
underlying commercial will be deteriorating this year in your guidance. Are we still at a
point where looking out 12 months, margins are coming down, or can you sort of offset
that with better risk selection?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Yeah, I guess, Bob – this is Doug. First thing I would say is when we think about our
operating margins, I'd separate small from middle, just to – they're very different
marketplaces. But overall, our theme – my comments back 90 days ago, as I look out
across, in general, pricing has been at or slightly below loss trends for some period of
time, several quarters at least. And the math on that, as you roll into 2017, unless you're
predicting very encouraging severity signs across auto, GL and compensation on the
medical, it's hard for the math to work in any other direction but pressure on core
margins.
So that's my own personal view. This is several cycles for me. I'm encouraged by our
pricing lift in the first quarter, though. So the other side of that is the 90 basis point lift in
pricing both in small and a little bit of benefit in middle. I'm encouraged, encouraged with
our discipline, and maybe we have a bottoming, if you will, on the pricing side in
commercial. That would be a good thing because we've worked hard to achieve the
operating levels we're at. Very pleased about those levels, but I don't want to give them
away. And that is a debate we're having every day across our lines across all our
businesses, but in a very segmented way. Does that help?

Q - Robert Glasspiegel

{BIO 1764160 <GO>}

Yep, very much. Switching gears, just on your acquisition target, is there a size of what the
ideal type company and how big you could go on an acquisition?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Bob, it's Chris. I would say just a couple thoughts on M&A in general is that we've been
proactive in the marketplace. We're very disciplined about our approach. It has to make
Page 15 of 20

strategic and financial sense. So we think in terms of bolt-on and/or extensions into
adjacent markets, that would be a little less complex to integrating into The Hartford. But I
would also say we're open to larger opportunities that accelerate our growth in markets,
product lines, geographies that we want to be in. That I would characterize as a target
that has anywhere between $500 million and $1 billion of premium. So I don't know if that
helps size – your size question, but I think that would be something digestible. But again, it
has to make the financial sense and we've been disciplined, given we've been at this over
the last four years, and we've said no to a lot of opportunities. So that's what I would say,
Bob.

Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR Capital Markets. Your
line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

Hey, good morning. Thanks. I think this question is for Doug. I just wanted to jump back
and weave together some of this commentary. So it sounds like in kind of the – I'll call it,
the small commercial or middle market book, your severity trend is maybe in the – loss
trend rather is more in the maybe in the 4% to 5% range, but then drilling in on
commercial auto, I think I heard your comments to say that you were planning on midsingle-digit loss trends. So call it 4% to 5%, but that you're below that now. So I just
wanted to clarify that I'm kind of hearing that right because some of the loss trend data
points we've been getting in this earnings season would indicate that commercial auto is
still kind of higher single digits and really is not stabilizing. So I'm just trying to tie that all
together, that you do see commercial auto trends stabilizing here.

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

The commercial auto results, I'd start by saying, are not acceptable. They're not
acceptable in our book, and we're determined to continue to work at that. In the middle
market over the past four years, we put 37 points of rate into that book of business. So
the good news is that with re-underwriting in rate, it's a much healthier book, but we're
also dealing with the same dynamics in the marketplace relative to driving behavior that
we faced in Personal Lines. So middle has been a pricing story after years of reunderwriting. I feel pretty good about our core book.
In Small Commercial, we faced some pressures over the last three quarters that to me
have also come from the Personal Lines re-underwriting, and that's a book where in our
micro end, we've got many businesses that have one and two and three employees. So I
think there is a lot we can learn from Personal Lines. We're not pleased about our

FINAL

performance in Small Commercial on the auto side. We're addressing it through not only
underwriting and pricing, and we still feel pressure on the bodily injury side of those
trends in both small and middle with auto. So I'm feeling mid single digit pressure on
severity in our commercial auto book, and I don't expect that to change because I think
that's largely what we see out in the external environment and what our view of the
external data is saying to us. And, therefore, we're building our action plans around that.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

Are there particular kind of sub segments of commercial auto, though, that are still kind of
spiking into the high single digits? I'm just trying to reconcile some of the data points
we're hearing out there, because I know you're going to have a bigger look at the market,
and then the fast track data you discuss would, too, but are there still pockets that are
seeing kind of bigger blips, especially in BI severity?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, there certainly is a geography twist to that, so there are zip codes and areas of the
country where we feel more pressure than others. There are class dynamics to it. In Small
Commercial, I've mentioned in the past that we have changed our referral triggers on
several of those classes that used to just hit the glass for quotes and run right through.
Now we'll take those quotes at a technology level and bring them back to an underwriter
for more strict underwriting. So yes, I would say both class and geography are definitely
triggers that we're looking at and impact an aggregate performance that needs more
pricing and more underwriting.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. I had a question first on the auto book. I appreciate the additional
disclosure this quarter. When I look at the underlying loss ratio for the first quarter, we see
the year-over-year improvement, but I'm thinking when I think about going forward, I know
seasonally auto does run stronger margins in the first quarter, but does the fact that
you're going to be earning in more rate over the rest of the three quarters change some
of the seasonality that you expect when you think about the underlying loss ratio, Q2 to
Q4, versus what you printed in the first quarter?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Elyse, this is Doug. Our plan did contemplate that. So largely, our expectations for the
year and our guidance stands as is. So yes, you're absolutely right: the seasonality that
we've seen in the past we expect to continue, and essentially our pricing objectives are

being met, and we continue to work hard to achieve the next three quarters so that we
can have a full year and get this back on track.

FINAL

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, and then last quarter, you guys provided some color around the retention within the
auto book in terms of kind of by loss ratio. The retention did come down in the overall
book a little bit in the quarter, but when you would look by loss ratio band, in a way, did
you see the kind of the same dynamics where you're seeing a greater drop in retention
within some of the more higher loss ratio parts of the book?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

We did, Elyse. We saw very similar patterns, which is actually why we didn't put the exhibit
in. It would have been very similar to what you saw 90 days ago.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, great. And then, Chris, when we last quarter discussed the possibility of you guys
looking into a sale of Talcott, you had mentioned the potential proceeds from a sale that
your preference would be to use that towards managing down leverage as well as M&A.
Subsequent to that, and we've addressed it earlier on this call, there's this bill going
through Connecticut. Does the ability to sell parts of Talcott, and so obviously different
sales could happen at different times, and the level of proceeds would come in at
different periods of time, does that change how you would consider thinking about what
you might do with the proceeds?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah, Elyse, I would say it's gotten very tactical in an area that we're not going to
speculate or comment on. One, I'd remind you the bill's only through one half of the
legislature, so the other half needs to approve it, and the governor needs to sign it. And
as I said, we expect that to happen in June, and then we'll evaluate things from there. But
I think it's way too premature to go down the path that you are going down.

Ian, you should feel good that we are pleased with the early start to progress. I'd remind
you, and you know, this is a multiyear effort, so one quarter does not make the goal we
have in mind, but pleased about the early signals of our initiatives across underwriting and
claims and pricing, et cetera, and again, you can see it because we share transparently,
there's a direct side of this financial dynamic, and then there's the agency piece. And our
top line is a bit more moderated in the agency side (sic) [Direct side] (53:51), so we're not
shrinking nearly as much as we are in total, and that's something that is a clear focus to us.
We've got terrific partners at AARP, and we are intent upon stabilizing this book and
looking for opportunities to grow going forward. That is our goal, and I think we're going
to be at a healthier spot in the second half of the year to achieve that, and as such, we will
direct marketing activities accordingly.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

That's a very fair assessment.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then just a broader question for whoever wants to take it on reserves.
Obviously, each of the last few years, you disclosed in the K the range above the
midpoint, and it's continued to creep up. But that hasn't really shown up yet in reserve
releases, and I'm just wondering philosophically how you guys think about that. Is the goal
sort of to keep growing that range above the midpoint each year and sort of keep the
base reserve releases around zero and strengthen the balance sheet for the future? Or is
it just that most of that move above the midpoint has been in the recent accident years
and they're just not seasoned enough, and over the next, call it, near to midterm, once
they get more seasoned, we'll start to see sort of consistent releases?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Ian, it's Chris. I'll let Beth comment also, but philosophically, there is no target. I mean, we
evaluate reserves every quarter and try to use our best math, our best judgment, both on
what's happening and the potential scenarios, sensitivities going forward. So that really
informs sort of our view of what our carried position is compared to the actuarial
indication. So I would dissuade your mind into thinking in terms of math equation program
releases should start to come because it's really facts and circumstances.
And again, personally, speaking for one member of our team, we're watching inflation
very closely. We see wage pressures. We see litigation pressures in other areas. So the
wage sensitivity we have in our book in comp, in disability is material. So we want to be
very, very prudent, have those accident years seasoned with great deal of certainty
before we deal with them.
