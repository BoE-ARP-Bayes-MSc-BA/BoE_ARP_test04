Bloomberg Transcript

We are pleased to announce today that we have agreed with the boards of Delta Lloyd, a
recommended transaction at €5.40 per share for all the outstanding ordinary shares of
Delta Lloyd. This comes after substantive and extensive discussions between our two
companies in recent weeks, including targeted due diligence. We have agreed a merger
protocol, and the main components of that protocol are contained in the press release
that we issued this morning.
This is a very important event for both NN Group and Delta Lloyd. We are bringing
together two leading ﬁrms in the Benelux insurance and asset management industry. The
combination will be a stronger group, better placed to provide our customers with the
products and services they need. It represents an acceleration of our strategy and brings
additional scale to our Dutch businesses, creates a sustainable Belgium platform, and has
around €60 billion of assets to the asset manager.
We are excited to combine the two companies and welcome Delta Lloyd staﬀ, as we will
work together in building a sustainable, proﬁtable business for the future.
We anticipate that the combined business will be able to materially increase the free cash
available to shareholders, thanks largely to the greater eﬃciency that the combination
brings. We anticipate a double-digit increase in dividends per share for 2018 and
onwards. We, of course, recognize that execution is key, and we have conﬁdence that we
will deliver as these are after all markets and businesses that we know well. We also know
it will not be easy and will require signiﬁcant eﬀort from both NN and Delta Lloyd staﬀ so
as to build a company with a culture and the outlook that we are seeking.
Finally, our balance sheet will remain strong. We estimate that the third quarter 2016
Solvency II ratio of the combination, after capital synergies and actuarial adjustments, is
approximately 185% and the cash capital position of the holding company is in the range
Page 2 of 21

Date: 2016-12-23

between €1 billion to €1.5 billion. Maintaining a robust balance sheet is one of our
priorities and we remain prudent in this transaction as well.

FINAL

So, let's turn to slide number 3. In terms of details of the recommended transaction, it will
be an all-cash oﬀer at a share price of €5.40 per ordinary share for all issued and
outstanding ordinary shares of Delta Lloyd. It represents a signiﬁcant premium on Delta
Lloyd's share price prior to our ﬁrst announcement on the 5th of October of this year.
The transaction secures our leadership position in the Netherlands and accelerates our
investment proposition by adding scale in Belgium, banking and asset management. The
combination will facilitate a drive for further eﬃciency, and as a result we anticipate annual
cost synergies of approximately €150 million pre-tax by 2020.
We do expect there will be some initial capital synergies, but also a meaningful negative
impact of aligning actuarial assumptions. The intention is to fund the transaction by
deployment of €1.4 billion of excess cash and approximately €1.1 billion of debt ﬁnancing.
The transaction is anticipated to generate a return on investment of around 10% and a
material increase in free cash available to shareholders over time. This is expected to
translate into double-digit accretion in dividend per share for 2018 and onwards.
I will now hand over to you, Hans. Hans van der Noordaa, CEO of Delta Lloyd.

{BIO 3144479 <GO>}

Thank you, Lard, for your introduction. We see today's announcement as a new chapter in
Delta Lloyd's more than 200 year history, now as part of NN. It's good that today the
uncertainty around our company's future has come to an end. After extensive analysis of
diﬀerent alternatives, we made a clear decision that this is in the long-term interest of our
stakeholders, oﬀering immediate value to our shareholders.
This announcement follows constructive interaction between the board and the
management teams of both companies, including a period of due diligence. The oﬀer
provides a certain cash premium for our shareholders and also a secure future for our
policy holders.
Delta Lloyd is a highly client-focused organization with excellent market position with
strong brands and multichannel propositions for our 4.2 million customers, which will
contribute strongly to the combined company.
I am proud of how the management and employees of Delta Lloyd have worked together
over the last years to improve the operations and the capital position of the company. We
have been making good progress towards our goals. The boards have also recognized
the risks to achievement of those goals which exist particularly given the ongoing
evolution of Solvency II and the competitive market that's on the verge of consolidation.

We both believe that there is clear logic to bring consolidation to the Dutch market
through a combination of our businesses in a way that provides beneﬁts for both
companies and our stakeholders. The combination of Delta Lloyd and the Dutch and
Belgium activities of NN Group will be a leading player in the Dutch insurance and asset
management market with a strong earnings potential, which will beneﬁt from economies
of scale and signiﬁcant free cash ﬂow and oﬀers a range of attractive products and
services to our customers and leading to shareholder return. The combination of NN
Group and Delta Lloyd will shape the future of pensions, insurance and asset
management in the Netherlands and Belgium.
Back to you, Lard.

Eilard Friese
Thanks, Hans. In terms of next steps, which is on the next slide or slide number ﬁve, we
will ﬁle the draft oﬀer memorandum with the AFM no later than the 28th of December
with the ﬁnal ﬁling probably in January 2017. And we will then work through the standard
tender oﬀer period of 10 weeks.

Bloomberg Transcript

So let me now take you through the strategic merits of the transaction starting at slide
number seven. The transaction with Delta Lloyd brings signiﬁcant strategic beneﬁts to NN
Group and will create a business with more capabilities and a business that is better
positioned to capture market opportunities and will deliver a more sustainable ﬁnancial
return for our shareholders. It also enables us to provide better products and services to
our customers.
We will create a leading provider of pension products within the Dutch market, the
second largest non-life provider and a sustainable Belgium business, which will now be a
large market for the Group. We will bring more scale to asset management and banking,
and we will bring some additional capabilities that we think will be valuable to the Group,
including strong digital capabilities and an additional bank distribution channel.
Let's go to slide number eight. Delta Lloyd brings to NN Group some very strong and
attractive capabilities. The OHRA brand and platform for example, is a leader in
digitalization and direct distribution. The ABN AMRO joint venture will give us access to
valuable and successful bancassurance channel. We anticipate that the continued
distribution of health insurance will supplement our retail strategy in the Netherlands and
will be a potential source of revenue synergies going forward.
Let's turn to slide nine on the Dutch market. Of course, one of the major drivers of the
transaction is to bring additional scale to the Dutch pension and non-life businesses. We
have noticed for some time that the Dutch pension market is moving towards deﬁned
contribution. This brings signiﬁcant opportunity and a need for scale. The combination of
NN Group and Delta Lloyd is well-placed to capitalize on these opportunities.
In addition, both companies have large in-force blocks of business which are increasingly
paid up. Merging our businesses will help to run these books more eﬃciently. In non-life,

FINAL

Delta Lloyd and NN run similarly-sized businesses, and the combination will be highly
complementary. We believe that the added scale, presence, and underwriting capabilities
of the combination will enable us to drive material improvements in the combined ratio.
Let's look now at the Belgium, banking, and asset management businesses on slide
number 10. In Belgium, we will create the number four in the market with an 8% market
share. We will combine a largely bancassurance business from NN Group with a largely
broker business from Delta Lloyd. Belgium will become a material market for NN Group
and a platform for further proﬁtable growth going forward.
Our asset management will further increase its assets under management at marginal cost
in an industry where scale is becoming more important and the combined bank will have
a combined market share of 8.5% in new mortgage production.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's turn to slide 12 on the balance sheet and solvency position. We estimate that the pro
forma third quarter 2016 Solvency II ratio of the combination will be 189%. This is
calculated at the NN Group position plus the Delta Lloyd position, adjusting for the price
paid, the reversal of the €333 million deduction of the share buyback and the removal of
eligibility constraints on the Delta Lloyd side.
From this third quarter ﬁgure, we do anticipate a number of adjustments to be made,
leading to a small decrease in the Solvency II ratio. First of all, we expect some initial SCR
reduction due to diversiﬁcation between NN and Delta Lloyd. And we also believe, on the
basis of our due diligence, that there will be some alignment of actuarial assumptions
with meaningful negative impacts on our own funds. This is on items such as longevity,
best estimate, and unit cost assumptions.
However, in the overall context, we still see the combined Solvency II ratio being
approximately 185%. And this is of course before any operating return, market
movements, dividend payments, reﬁnancing of hybrids and other movements on the
Solvency II ratio until closing.
So let's look at the funding on slide 13. With respect of ﬁnancing of the deal, it is an all
cash oﬀer which will be funded through a combination of existing cash resources and new
debt. Our base case is that we will raise senior debt. Looking forward, we anticipate that
we will need to operate at the top-end of our €0.5 billion to €1.5 billion cash capital target
range during the initial stages of the acquisition. Our ﬁnancial leverage and ﬁxed cost
coverage will remain consistent with our single A ﬁnancial strength rating target, albeit at
the top-end of our internal appetite levels initially.
So, let's turn now to slide 15. We're targeting pre-tax cost synergies of €150 million by
2020. This is over and above standalone cost-saving plans of both NN and Delta Lloyd.
We see multiple areas of overlap that over time should allow for greater eﬃciency. And
we will come back at a later date with more insight into our cost targets, including the
restructuring charge associated with realizing these.

FINAL

I will now turn to slide number 16. The transaction will signiﬁcantly improve our generation
of free cash available to shareholders. We believe that over time if capital is built into legal
entities, we could generate additional free cash ﬂows to our shareholders in the range of
€250 million to €300 million. This is expected to translate into a double-digit increase in
the dividend per share for 2018 and onwards and we believe that the deal will generate a
return of investment for our shareholders of around 10%.
So, let's move now to slide number 18. We believe the transaction is ﬁnancially and
strategically compelling and fully consistent with our investment proposition and, in fact,
will accelerate it. Strategically, this transaction secures our leadership position in the
Netherlands and accelerates our investment proposition by adding scale in Belgium,
banking, and asset management. Our balance sheet will remain robust, and our free cash
available to shareholders will signiﬁcantly increase. Our dividend policy will remain
unchanged, which means that the free cash available to shareholders will continue to be
paid out through ordinary dividends and excess capital returns over time unless other
value-creating opportunities can be found.
So, let me now wrap up on slide number 19. We are pleased that today we announced a
recommended transaction at €5.40 per share, which we believe to be ﬁnancially and
strategically compelling and beneﬁcial as it signiﬁcantly increases our cash ﬂow and
dividend per share and enhances our position in the Benelux.

By next week, Wednesday, the 28th of December, we will ﬁle a draft oﬀer memorandum
with the AFM and we will announce the launch of our oﬀer within six business days after
obtaining AFM approval.
With that, I would like now to open the call for your questions. And can I kindly request
you to limit the number of questions to two per person, so that everybody gets a chance
to speak. Now, of course, feel free to come back with a second round of questions if they
have not yet been dealt with.
So, operator, let's start the Q&A session.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will start the question-and-answer session now.
The ﬁrst question is from Mr. Benoît Pétrarque, Kepler. Go ahead please, sir.

Q - Benoît Pétrarque
Yes. Good morning, everybody. Two questions on my side. I was just thinking about the
Solvency II ratio, so 189%. NN never actually disclosed the, kind of the minimum level you
were looking for. I think Delta Lloyd had a minimum level in mind. But with a combined
entity now, which type of Solvency II ratio level are you aiming for, which level are you

Page 6 of 21



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2016-12-23

thinking? You are kind of overcapitalized and you might actually start to pay excess
capital. That's ﬁrst question.

FINAL

Second question is about the Q4 movement. I think Delta Lloyd sees a negative from
(17:56) also from longevity development, longevity hedge as well. How much impact will
that have on the combined Solvency II ratio?
And then, maybe just ﬁnally on the ABN AMRO joint venture, I mean, there's a change of
control clause, so, I mean will you keep ABN? Did you agree to something with ABN
there? I think it will be useful to get an update on that. Thank you very much.

A - Eilard Friese
Yes. So, Benoît, thank you for your questions. Let's take them one by one. So, the ﬁrst
question will be answered by Delﬁn. The second question will be answered by Cliﬀord.
And then, I'll take the JV on ABN AMRO later, yeah? So, ﬁrst, Delﬁn, over to you.

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank you very much, Benoît. So, your ﬁrst question about the Solvency II target, we
have mentioned in the presentation that we are not changing our capital management
approach nor our dividend policy. So, we're targeting to have cash capital at holding
between €0.5 billion and €1.5 billion, but obviously with integration of Delta Lloyd, we aim
to be in the larger – in the upper bound of that range. So no change there in terms of
capital management approach, nor in terms of dividend policy.
In terms of the impact that Delta Lloyd has ﬂagged, I will take – if Cliﬀord has anything to
add, but I think it is overall expected to be stable.

A - Cliﬀord Abrahams

{BIO 7425676 <GO>}

Yeah. That's correct, Delﬁn. I mean, we've commented – we thought it was helpful to
comment on some of the positive developments during Q4 but also highlight the
negatives, given Delﬁn's ﬁgures are based on the Q3 pro forma. I think you can take
comfort that there's not a material impact from Delta Lloyd on the combined pro forma at
a later date.

A - Eilard Friese
And then, ﬁnally on the JV, we believe that the joint venture between Delta Lloyd and
ABN AMRO is a very strong proposition for customers. It's a business that they have built
over a long time and we look at that as a very attractive part of the overall Delta Lloyd
group.

Q - Benoît Pétrarque
Thank you very much.

The next question is from Mr. William Hawkins, KBW. Go ahead please, sir.

FINAL

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Gentlemen, thank you. Can you just be exactly clear about how you've calculated the 10%
return on investments with regards to what exactly your assessment is of Delta Lloyd? I
mean, are you taking the previous Solvency II capital generation ﬁgure of €200 million to
€250 million or is it something else? Just help me understand what you're actually
deﬁning as the underlying return there.
And then secondly, can you give us any thought about what you are doing with regards to
IFRS earnings? Presumably, Delta Lloyd will be restated on to an NN Group basis. Do you
have any idea of what Delta Lloyd would look like if you were applying NN's approach for
IFRS? I presume that's going to be important for public disclosure at some point. Thanks.

A - Eilard Friese
Yes, William. Good morning. Delﬁn, over to you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, William. So, the ﬁrst question is relatively straightforward. So we are basically looking
it only from our perspective, what is the marginal contribution of the acquisition. So this is
the expected return obviously from the perspective of NN Group. So, we have taken into
account the cost synergies that were mentioned, the €150 million pre-tax, approximately
€110 million as you know, after tax. And we have a look at what is the capital generation of
Delta Lloyd on a standalone basis as well as the additional free cash ﬂow that the
transaction will bring taking this into account to the combined NN Group.
So when you look at it with price paid of €2.5 billion, that's how we come to the
calculation of a 10% return on – in investment. Obviously this transaction has allow us to
put a signiﬁcant amount of excess capital to work, as you have seen, to good returns.
When you look at the IFRS earnings, that is much more complicated, because indeed as
you anticipate, the accounting from both entities are very diﬀerent.
And I think that here, the important element to say is that we indeed expect an increase
on the free cash ﬂow and as a consequence, dividend per share to go up substantially.
But it's too early to estimate a exact impact on Delta Lloyds on NN's IFRS earnings. We will
obviously provide that additional information at the appropriate time.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Okay. I'll come back with some of those later. Thanks, guys. Thank you.

Operator
The next question is from Mr. Arjan van Veen, UBS. Go ahead please, sir.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

FINAL

Capital synergies, other than the – moving Delta Lloyd to partial internal model, can you
give a bit of color around what else may be available over time? And secondly, related to
that, when you combine particularly the two Netherlands live entities together, do you
need to make any changes at Delta Lloyd to bring it in line with how you would run it from
a risk control or assisted side (23:51) that you know caused the matching or change in the
asset side, et cetera? Thank you.

A - Cliﬀord Abrahams

{BIO 7425676 <GO>}

So, thank you very much, Arjan. So in terms of the initial capital synergies, this related to
mainly diversiﬁcation beneﬁts having an impact on the solvency capital requirement.
Later, over time, we'll do a split, and we see potential further capital synergies, for
example, merging legal entities, which again will lead to lower risk margin, and also
capitalizing the eﬀect of lower unit cost assumptions.
So, indeed, you mentioned it yourself, good and important beneﬁt will be the transition of
Delta Lloyd into our partial internal model over time, and at the same time, as has been
indicated by Delta Lloyd in the past, there will be the negative eﬀect of removing the
longevity hedge beneﬁt which will come together with a partial internal model, so one
could compensate the eﬀect of the other.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And then this is for Delﬁn, just to be clear that the current assumptions is all on current
cost run rate, so any improvement from here will come through later?

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yeah. When we talk about the capital synergy that we expect to come later on, we
obviously do anticipate that as the cost savings are going to materialize, this will have an
impact into the capitalization of this lower unit cost and as a consequence, they are not
reﬂected in the, let's say, combined pro forma graph that are shown in page 12, but this is
an important beneﬁt that will come over time.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

And in terms of the risk framework or control, I think is obvious that we'll have an
integrated single risk approach and that's something that we'll seek to reach in the short
term.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

And then can I just follow up on the other – on the second point. Just when you look at
the two entities, is there anything potentially negative that you may need to adjust for,

Page 9 of 21



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2016-12-23

which may have an impact either on earnings or on capital position from bringing them
into your risk control framework?

FINAL

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Well, I think we have mentioned and you have that in slide 12 that there are some positives
or negatives that we do expect at moment one or soon after the acquisition. And there we
have mentioned that in the one hand actions have already been taken by Delta Lloyd in
terms of closing the ALM gap. That's going to be beneﬁcial. Also, the capital synergies
that we have just mentioned a moment ago in relationship to the diversiﬁcation of
beneﬁts, that's something that will come.
But we also have ﬂagged that there will be some negative impact due to the alignment of
actuarial assumptions in order to accommodate to the NN Group ownership. These, as
Lard mentioned in his presentation relate mainly to longevity, best estimate reserving
methodology and also in the unit cost assumptions. But important to highlight that these
adjustments will come to, we estimate, a pro forma level of around 185% pro formas of
3Q. Obviously, there are some uncertainties in order to come to the actual number.

Q - Arjan van Veen

{BIO 5197778 <GO>}

Thank you.

Next question is from Mr. Matthias de Wit, KBC Securities. Go ahead, please.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. I have two questions: First is on the dividend in 2017. I think you only
made a comment for 2018, but just wonder if there's anything you could say on the
dividend you would expect to pay for 2017. And with regard to the dividend policy, I think
you mentioned that you stick to your guidance to pay out a certain percentage of the
operating result, but to me it's not fully clear how Delta Lloyd's operating results would
look – yeah, how it would translate on your framework, so could you say anything in that
respect.
Second question is on the holding company cash position. I get to around €1.5 billion on
a pro forma basis. Is that correct? And maybe also, is there anything you could say on how
we should think about the year-end position. And if you would be ahead of the target, I
guess, deleveraging is one of the priorities that you mentioned that you would be at the
high end of your appetites ratio. Is that also a reasonable assumption? Thank you.

A - Eilard Friese
So, Matthias that's a bunch of questions at the same time. So, let me – let us take them
one by one for you. So, Delﬁn, are you ready for those?

Good. Thank you, Matthias.

A - Eilard Friese
Okay. Here we go.

FINAL

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

So, the ﬁrst on the dividend for 2017, I think it's too early to give a clear guidance on the
dividend of 2017. I think we have given a clarity that from 2018 onwards, we expect a
double-digit increase per share. In 2017, I think we'll have to see how that evolve in the
year.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of the guidance of the free cash ﬂow being on the range of the operating result
after tax, that has been an important constant of our framework. You are right that it is, in
terms of the payment of dividends being between 40% and 50% of the operating result is
through that. We don't know yet precisely how the operating result in the consolidated
entity, IFRS result we'll derive. But here, I'd like to bring your attention basically to the
comments that I made as you know already in terms of the generation of free cash ﬂow
that is expected to be initially in the range of €150 million, but later on by 2020 between
€250 million and €300 million. So that basically gives you a relevant framework, I think.
In terms of the cash capital of holding, I've indicated that we do expect that to be more on
the – we aim to have more on the higher bound of the cash capital of holding. That
depends a bit of how we ﬁnance the transaction and the level of debt that we decide to
have. But there is some ﬂexibility to be on that range, so I would not like to provide a
precise – a target at this point of time. And indeed, once we – one of the considerations
that we would have when we perceive that we have surplus capital is also to consider the
possibility of the leveraging to the extent that that's advisable.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot.

Operator
The next question is from Mr. Steven Haywood, HSBC. Go ahead please, sir.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. I wonder if you could just tell me about the current share
buyback? I know it's suspended at the moment, but is it suspended permanently now?
And then thinking about in the future, you've got, say, just over €1 billion of free cash ﬂow
you are generating from NN. That's rising 10% to 15% in the short-term and then rising
20% to 30% in the long-term. So, from my point of view, when is the sort of next time that
you could announce a new share buyback for the company if you don't use capital for
other value-creating opportunities? Thanks.

FINAL

Company Name: NN Group NV

Date: 2016-12-23

Yes. Thank you, Steven. As I mentioned before, we're planning to maintain our dividend
policy, and as a consequence an important part of our dividend policy is to repay back
surplus capital to shareholders unless there is a value-creating opportunity to deploy that
surplus capital. The opportunity to acquire Delta Lloyd has been, we think, a very
compelling opportunity to use that surplus capital. That's why we stopped the share
buyback. We will have the beneﬁt of €333 million increase in our own funds as a
consequence of stopping the share buyback that will come into eﬀect in the fourth
quarter.
And as soon as we feel appropriate that there is surplus capital and there is no
opportunities to deploy it, we will continue with a philosophy that we have so far and then
we will announce, if that's the case, a share buyback in due course when it is appropriate.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay. Just a quick follow-up on the Solvency II ratio. That €333 million that you say, that
included in the 189% or excluded?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. Correct. So, for the pro forma 189% as of 3Q is basically combining the two entities
together; so, NN and Delta Lloyd, one plus the other. Then is the addition that's a positive
of €333 million of the suspended buyback. Then we have also a positive due to the
removal of the eligibility constraints for Tier 3 capital that Delta Lloyd announced on their
Q3 numbers. Then, of course, the biggest negative impact is the €2.5 billion of cash
which is a consideration for the acquisition. These are the only three adjustments that are
reﬂected in the 189%.

The next question is from Mr. Bart Horsten, Kempen & Co. Go ahead please, sir.

Q - Bart Horsten

{BIO 2390919 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. I have a few questions on free cash ﬂow development.
You indicate initially €100 million to €150 million, rising to €250 million and €300 million. I
suppose the largest part of that is driven by the expected cost synergies. But I was also
wondering whether there are other beneﬁts in that because if I take the net beneﬁt from
cost synergies, comes at around €100 million improvement. So I was wondering what the
other synergies are or the other improvements or drivers of the free cash ﬂow
improvement and would that also include reﬁnancing of existing debts at Delta Lloyd
which has some high interest debt on its books?
And the second question relates to the composition of the transaction. If I read correctly
that if you acquire less than 95% and more than 67% of the shares of Delta Lloyd, you can

also start merging Delta Lloyd entities and remaining shareholders will be given NN's
shares. Can you elaborate a bit on that such, please? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Cliﬀord Abrahams

{BIO 7425676 <GO>}

Yeah. So, Bart, good morning. This – let me take the last one ﬁrst. First, obviously – so we
will go through the ASM proceedings to ﬁle. And when we have approval, we will launch
the oﬀer. Then, our tender period starts. After the tender period, we will see how many
shares are being tendered. If it's 95%, then there is the – let's say, the legal normal fees
(36:19) opportunities for the 5% that are applicable. If it's below that number, there is a
quite customary structure in place that we could pursue to ensure that we get control over
the company and that we can extract the synergies and drive the business forward to the
plans that we have.
Indeed, in that structure, you would then – the remaining shareholders that would then
receive in that merger structure would receive NN shares at that point in time.

Q - Bart Horsten

{BIO 2390919 <GO>}

Okay.

And on your third question on the free cash ﬂow, I mean, it comes, of course, from the
cost synergies but also from the capital synergies that will be obtained over time. And
indeed, well, that there's also an element because this is net of the funding cost. And
indeed, as you know, we're planning to do some reﬁnancing of some of the existing debt
being the most important ones, the ING, the hybrids that are currently owned by ING, that
we have ﬂagged in previous quarters, but also the external hybrid that NN has in the
second quarter of 2017. And then, in the fourth quarter of 2017, there is also senior debt
from Delta Lloyd that we will be aiming to reﬁnance then.

{BIO 19104398 <GO>}

Yes. Hello. Good morning. William Wade here from JPMorgan Credit Research. Just one
question for me at this point. My other questions have been answered. Would you mind
just clarifying the rationale for using senior debt as the base case for the debt part of the
transaction? I believe you might also have some capacity to issue sub-debt. So I just sort
of wanted to understand that rationale and what the drivers of that will be going forward.
Thanks.

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, William. I think it's quite simple. We obviously need to look at what is the level of
solvency, and if we feel comfortable with that. And otherwise, you ﬁnance yourself with
the cheapest fund – the cheapest debt available. So, hybrid would count as part of our
own funds, but the senior debt doesn't, but it's also cheaper. So, we've taken as a base
case in order to look at the transaction issuing senior debt. But we also have the ﬂexibility
open in case we were to require or we see appropriate to raise hybrid.

Q - William Wade

{BIO 19104398 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. That makes sense. And then I guess just a follow-up then. So this
transaction with Delta Lloyd doesn't change, and I think you alluded to this in the answer
to the prior question. But there's no change as per previous announcements or previous
expectations of reﬁnancing certain NN debt. So for example the 63,827 (39:37) ING debt.
There's no sort of change in expectations looking forward?

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

You're right. So no change, let's say that our intention to reﬁnance the hybrids owned by
ING. They are independent of this transaction, and this plan continues to be in our mind.

The next question is from Mr. Darshan Mistry, Citi. Go ahead, please.

Q - Darshan Mistry

{BIO 19807857 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, guys. Just one quick question for me, please. What's driving – sorry,
are there any just kind of macro assumptions that are driving part of the increase in free
cash from the €100 million to €150 million that you expect to be adding now to the – to
your 2020 target? So, are you assuming kind of a widening of base spreads or any kind of
tick up in interest rates? Would you assume that rates and spreads and everything else
stays where it currently is? Thanks.

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, Darshan. So I think that when we have looked and considered the value of this
transaction, we have obviously taken into account the current level of interest rates. And
that is something which is I think beneﬁcial for all insurance companies, including Delta
Lloyd and NN Group. The free cash ﬂow guidance that we had given of €250 million and
€300 million is already you like relatively large range. There are some uncertainties
around it. And obviously, the level of interest rates could be – if they keep increasing, that
would be, as you know, a positive or an upside. But, you know, this, we have seen it from
the recent past, it can goes both directions and either way. We are having a level of
solvency that which is adequate, and of course the free cash ﬂow will be inﬂuenced by the

Page 14 of 21

change of interest rates that we have ﬂagged in every quarter. We now are operating a
return – capital generation.

FINAL

Q - Darshan Mistry

{BIO 19807857 <GO>}

Perfect. So, you're not assuming a mean reversion of interest rates in that €250 million to
€300 million? You're assuming things stay where they are and everything is achieved, I
guess, organically.

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

No. We have assumed, you know, the best estimate that we've got at this point of time.

The next question is from Mr. Robin van den Broek, Mediobanca. Go ahead please, sir.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Robin van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

Yes, good morning, thank you for taking my questions. First one is just thinking back
about the midterm capital generation target of Delta Lloyd on a standalone base of €200
million to €250 million, and how can I tie it up to the €250 million to €300 million you're
mentioning which includes €110 million cost saving by 2020? So, what's the big delta
here, because there seems to be a gap.
And secondly, I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the timing of the
cost savings by 2020, presumably may be the bank and asset manager cost savings can
be achieved more quickly than life. May be some color here, and any color on the size of
restructuring cost will also help. Thank you.

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Robin. So, my understanding is that the €200 million to €250 million
target of capital generation or generation of surplus capital at the level of Delta Lloyd by
2020, of course, is related, but it's not exactly the same with our €250 million and €300
million free cash ﬂow generation; and for us, the deﬁnition of free cash ﬂow generation is
the expectation of the remittance to the holding minus the holding expenses. So,
obviously, some of these beneﬁts are included within that, but it's the deﬁnition is not
precisely the same.
In terms of the cost savings, I think it's early. It is now too premature in order to provide a
very detailed guidance of how the synergies or the restructuring costs are going to come,
and we aim to provide that in due course when we have been able to work more closely
in together with Delta Lloyd and also in order to communicate that with more certainty,
but you're right that some of the savings are coming earlier than others.

{BIO 15194213 <GO>}

Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered. Just a quick follow-up, if I may. If
NN were to own 100% of Delta Lloyd after the closing of the transaction, should we
expect Delta Lloyd NV to be merged into NN Group and to the Delta Lloyd
Levensverzekering operating entity to be merged with one of NN operating entities?
Thank you.

A - Eilard Friese
I think it's too early to say at this point in time how this would exactly – how in time how
this will exactly work, but it is, of course, one of the things that we will consider is to
merge legal entities as Delﬁn has mentioned earlier in due course to extract the synergies
as a result of it.

The next question is from Mr. Cor Kluis, ABN AMRO. Go ahead, please, sir.

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Good morning. And Cor Kluis speaking. I've got a few questions. First of all, in the internal
model of Delta Lloyd, the quarterly partial internal model, what's the speed that you – a
question is already asked on (45:48) internal model running, of course, can I get this
partial internal model, yeah, earning, because the current combination, of course, of the
Solvency II ratios is based on the standard model of Delta Lloyd. So it will be nice to –
more to speak, can you do that within a year? When can you start with that? That's the ﬁrst
question.
And the second question is about the restructuring cost, you indicated it should be
consistent with the earlier transactions. Should we think about €150 million, those kind of
levels? And do you include that in your net operating proﬁt, which is relevant for the
dividend story, of course. Or do you want to put that restructuring cost in special item
below the line?
And maybe one ﬁnal question is about the longevity of the insurance. A part of that will
be refreshed (46:39), of course, but – and for the (46:42) situation in Q4. Are you planning

Page 16 of 21



Company Name: NN Group NV

to apply for vendor longevity reinsurance deal for your total company? And could you
highlight what kind of size we could think about? Those were all of my questions.

FINAL

A - Hans van der Noordaa

{BIO 3144479 <GO>}

So, thank you, Cor. Three questions. In terms of the timing of the internal model, I think
it's early to say. Obviously, it requires, as you know, some time in order to integrate with
our partial internal model, that is a signiﬁcant change. We'll have some conversations with
the regulator as well. So, let me be cautious for the time being and not provide any
speciﬁc guidance on that respect. But obviously, we all see the beneﬁts of doing that as
soon as possible.
Restructuring cost, they will be considered as part of special items. They will be relatively
large due to the nature of the savings that we expected to integrate. But as I said before,
would be helpful to wait until we can provide more guidance on the timing and the
speciﬁcs on the operating cost savings and include that at the same time with a better
calculation of restructuring cost.

Bloomberg Transcript

Longevity, this is something that NN Group has been looking at already for a long period
of time. We have always been assessing when – if there was an opportunity, not only in
terms of capital optimization but also in terms of proper risk transfer. And obviously, with
the combination of Delta Lloyd, the longevity exposure increases and of course the
beneﬁt or the opportunity to think and do a transaction in longevity increases. With that,
we will continue assessing the best timing and the opportunity and the pricing for that in
due course.

The ﬁrst question is from Mr. William Hawkins, KBW. Go ahead please, sir.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you for letting me follow-up. Couple of months ago Delta Lloyd was talking
about €200 million of synergies rather than €150 million. So, what have we learned that is
more negative than that original view? And then secondly, there's no mention of a break
fee. Is there any break fee for this transaction or not? Thank you.

A - Hans van der Noordaa

{BIO 3144479 <GO>}

So, thank you, William. And so, I think, that, as you know, we made in October our
recommended – announced the intention to make an oﬀer for a €5.30 per share. Since

then, we have consider all new information and the result of the targeted due diligence,
and we were very pleased to be able not only to conﬁrm our initial views on the value of
the company, but also to come to increase oﬀer for the shareholders of Delta Lloyd.
And in terms of the cost savings, this is something that we've looked together. We have
ﬁnalized and at the end of the day, it's the assessment that we've had at NN of how these
savings are going to be extracted that by your means this is a eﬀort and combination that
comes from both entities as obviously also NN been larger in size and will also be part of
this cost synergies. And keep in mind that this is on top of the already announced savings
initiatives that both NN and Delta Lloyd have. So, from the combined overall expense
target, when you do the numbers, it comes to a very signiﬁcant cost reduction.
In terms of the break fees, there is clear explanation, I think, also included within the press
release. Maybe, Lard, you want to cover this?

A - Eilard Friese
Yes. So, it's on the press release, Will, as well, so for more details. But it's – for a breach of
the Merger Protocol is €25 million. For non-completion of the Oﬀer, €25 million. For
breaking up as a result of antitrust is €67.5 million. And for no approvals on the DNB side
is €25 million.

second question was on antitrust. Is this going to be at the European Commission level or
is it going to be national antitrust approvals in the Netherlands and Belgium? Thank you.

A - Eilard Friese
Yeah. So, on the ﬁrst point, Allan (52:34), we have focused in the last couple of weeks on
the constructive discussions that we've had with – between the boards on the various
aspects of this transaction in order to arrive today to the launch of a recommended oﬀer.
So that's what we've been focusing on, obviously. Conversations with shareholders in
general since have taken place, but that's been really our focus to get that to the point of
a recommended transaction today.

The next question is from Mr. Benoît Pétrarque, Kepler. Go ahead, please, sir.

Q - Benoît Pétrarque
Yes. Just a follow-up question on the use of the cash. Will you – is that fair to assume you
will ﬁrst spend it to kind of deleverage a bit? And what level of leverage ratio do you have
in mind? Do you want to go back to the initial level or are you happy with the 30%?
Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Thanks, Benoît. Yes. So, the level of leverage around 30% is very comparable within
Europe. I think it's slightly on the upper side of our internal level. It is very comfortable
within the rating agencies level, that's depending which rating agency or how you look
into it, might be between 20% or 40%. So we are very comfortable. But indeed, as linking
to one question before, one of the possibilities in due course is to reduce leverage if
appropriate.

€300 million free cash ﬂow target, could you comment on what level of remittance ratio
this is based? So, what proportion of the capital generation you expect to pay out in that
year?
And then secondly, unlike DT, you mentioned that the review might impact DL's Solvency
II ratio. Is there any risk that NN Group's standalone ratio might also be impacted by that

review? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Thank you, Matthias. So the €250 million to €300 million is basically, they – the target of
incremental remittance minus holding cost that we expect as from 2020. So, that is
obviously taken into account all the beneﬁts of the cost synergies, as well as the capital
synergies that we have talked before.
For the LAC-DT, yes. We had, you know, a methodology that we feel comfortable with it,
but there is always an element on any review and consideration that we'll have to take into
account when more information is there. There was, you know, some indications, I
mentioned for Delta Lloyd, for Q4, for the Q4 number. But I think it's premature to give
any guidance on that.
