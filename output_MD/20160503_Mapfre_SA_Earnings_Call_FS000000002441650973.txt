Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to MAPFRE Results for the First Quarter
of 2016. As usual, I'll give an overview of the results and the main business development.
And later, Mrs. Natalia Núñez will explain the financial review in greater detail. And today,
Mr. (00:20) of the strategy and (00:21) as for the Q&A session. We will answer the
question that have been submitted at the end of the presentation. But if any further
questions arise during the call, please send them to the specified e-mail address. And we
will answer them if time permits.
Let's now turn to slide number three. MAPFRE's non-life business continues growing in
2016 with positive developments in the EMEA, Iberia, (00:56) and North America, while
life premiums has still been affected by the depreciation of the Brazilian Real and the low
interest rate environment. The non-life combined ratio has fallen by 2% points to 96.8% in
light with MAPFRE's profitable growth strategy.
The improvements in technical management in Iberia and North America has contributed
to this reduction, as well as a lower level of (01:29) claims in Massachusetts compared to
2015. Total income has fallen by 3.4% due to a decline in financial income mainly as a
result of the depreciation of the Venezuelan Bolivar and Brazilian Real. You remember
during the first quarter of 2015, we have had the official Venezuela Bolivar exchange rate
up to VEF 12 for $1. Now, the situation is totally different according to the depreciation we
have made within the year with this currency.
(02:23) income and improvement in technical management has allowed MAPFRE Re to
achieve an attributable result of – to MAPFRE to achieve an attributable result of nearly
€192 million despite the more normalized level for financial income.
Net savings have increased by 4% year-to-date reflecting the strong performance of fixed
income markers during the quarter in the state of the MAPFRE's agent channel.
Lastly, MAPFRE (03:04) are strong solvency position. Preliminary Solvency II figures as at
December 31 of 2015 confirming MAPFRE's financial strength with the ratio at 190%, which

is supported by a high-quality capital rates with 92% in TIER 1 capital.

FINAL

Please turn to the next slide. Here, as you can see, the recovery of the Spanish market
has been relevant to the results, both life and non-life premiums are benefiting from
these tailwinds. As well – and we're seeing it in MAPFRE's commercial network.
The technical financial result in Iberia has increased by over 14% (04:01) improvements in
technical management which is not worth it given (04:04) the complicated market
conditions and low interest rate environment.
Excluding the profits from CatalunyaCaixa in 2015 the net result would have grown 22% in
this region (04:22) MAPFRE USA is also boasting results. (04:29) introduced last year as
well as lower weather related claims have brought the business back to profitability. While
at the same time we are seeing robust local currency growth due to the consolidation of
the expansion plan in already strong position in Massachusetts.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you already know, our portfolio situation in Brazil remains challenging. The depreciation
of the Brazilian Real throughout 2015 is impacting results, although, it is worth mentioning
that the real fast recover over 6% during 2016 with respect year-end 2015. The economic
cash flow volume is affecting business volumes, mainly in Life due to a reduction in lending
and especially in margins. More Life premiums continue growing in the local currency,
thanks to the recovery of the agri business.
It is also worth noting the strong performance of financial income in Brazil in local currency,
due to the fact our interest rate environment.
On slide five, we will take a look at our Solvency II figures in more detail. MAPFRE's 190%
Solvency II ratio is based on a high-quality capital structure of over €8 billion in eligible own
funds of which, 92% fees and respective TIER I capital and the remaining 8% is
grandfathered subordinated debt. Excluding the use of transitional measures for technical
provisions and matching adjustment, MAPFRE would have still have an excellent solvency
position of 171% and 189% respectively.
On the next slide, we will take a look at the breakdown of our Solvency II eligible own
funds. Taking into consideration the Solvency II standard formula perimeter, IFRS equity will
be €8,849 million. In order to attain eligible own funds, several valuation adjustments are
applied mainly including €2,658 million in that same of intangible assets as well as the
revaluation of taxes and liabilities. These adjustments bring eligible own funds to €8,078
million.
In the next slide, we will take a look at the breakdown of risk category. In line with the
nature of our business underwriting and market risk are MAFPRE'S main risks. As you can
see the benefits of the diversification of our business in balance sheet are significant.
The total Solvency Capital Requirement is €4,253 million, which reflects (08:04), including
the capital requirement for the third party acquiring countries, U.S.A., Brazil, and Mexico.

FINAL

Let's take a look at the sensitivity analysis for the market Solvency II ratio on slide number
eight. As you can see, the limited sensitivities do a change in the alternate forward rate
and moves in interest rates within equity markets. Our results of MAPFRE's prudent
business mix, asset allocation, and ALM strategy.
Going to slide number nine, as you know the AGM approved our final dividend of €0.07
per share against the 2015 results. This dividend will be repaid on 24th of June. So, the
total amount of dividends paid against 2015 amounts to €400.3 million. This dividend
implies a dividend yield of current market basis, well above 5.5%.
On slide 10, we will take a look at the breakdown of premiums and results by region. As
you can see, MAPFRE results are very well-balanced geographic-based. Since then, 2015,
the most relevant variations in premium distribution are as follows: A 6.5 percentage
points increase in Iberia due to the recovery in Spain and a 3.1 percentage points increase
in EMEA, thanks to the integration of (10:04) businesses in Germany and Italy. We have
seen 5.9 percentage points fall in Brazil mainly explained by the depreciation of the real.

Bloomberg Transcript

With regards to activity and results, the most notable changes include the return to
profitability in North America, a strong performance in Iberia and, as we mentioned
before, has had a 22% increase in the net result, which (10:38) the profits from
CatalunyaCaixa.
LatAm North has also had a good quarter with 11.8% increase in net results. And finally,
profit of MAPFRE Re has increased by over 5%, reaching 23% of the group's profits. We
have had disturbing losses (11:07) in EMEA due to negative run-offs in ASISTENCIA as well
as several large corporate claims and global risks due to too big losses in Germany and
UK.
And finally, in part, results have been affected by the Taiwan earthquake.
Now, Mrs. Nuñez will explain these figures in greater detail.

Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you, Esteban, and good morning, everyone. Please let's move on to slide 12 to take
a look at the Non-Life account. On a yearly basis, Non-Life premiums have grown at a
healthy 2% and we are seeing the following trends. Growth in EMEA, thanks to the
successful consolidation of the Direct business in Italy and Germany as well as tariff and
volume increases in Turkey.
In EMEA, we have seen increase in production in most lines of business led by 7.7% growth
rate in health insurance, a 10.5% increase in Multi-Peril lines and the recovery motor.
Premiums have increased also at MAPFRE mainly explained by tiny differences in issuance
for several large contracts. And Global Risks is contributing positively to premiums in
Iberia, EMEA, and Brazil. These positive trends offset the declines in LatAm South Brazil
and LatAm North. As we mentioned before, premiums in LatAm South have been heavily

Page 3 of 18



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2016-05-03

affected by the application of an implicit exchange rate in Venezuela that has impacted all
lines of business including MAPFRE ASISTENCIA and Global Risks.

FINAL

In Brazil, Non-Life Premiums are growing by 7% in local currency, driven mainly by other
insurance, which has subsided the decrease in Motor. However, the depreciation of the
Brazilian Real is still leading to a contraction in euros.
Finally, issuance has fallen in Mexico especially in Health, Industrial Risk, and Motor
segments. The combined ratio improved from 98.8% to 96.8% for reasons we will now
discuss on slide 15.
The loss ratio improved 1.1 percentage point versus the previous year in last part due to
the absence of extraordinary weather-related claims on the East Coast of the U.S.A. The
measures introduced last year including tariff increases are an improvement in
underwriting are also boosting results.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Iberia, the focus on technical management including portfolio claims and among other
measures have also supported this reduction. These improvements have helped to offset
the deterioration in Brazil which is linked to the economic environment and the effects of
heavy rains in the first quarter of the year as well as losses in EMEA.
These losses stem from the several large industrial claims at Global Risks and negative
runoffs at ASISTENCIA. Nevertheless, the insurance unit in Turkey has performed very well
in comparison to the first quarter of 2015. It's also worth mentioning the impact from the
Taiwan earthquake on the results at Global Risks in APAC.
Please let's move now to the slide – the next one to discuss the expense ratio. The
expense ratio has fallen by 0.9 percentage point thanks to higher commissions from
ceded reinsurance in the U.S.A., reductions in the Motor and Industrial Risks segments in
Brazil, improvement in the already high efficiency levels in Iberia, decreases in Mexico in
Motor, Industrial Risks, and Health segments. These improvements offset the
deterioration in Motor and Health lines in Colombia and the uptick at MAPFRE due to the
change in the portfolio mix.
Please, let's turn to slide 17, to take a look at financial income. Net financial income and
other non-technical income fell by close to €85 million year-on-year. The largest drivers of
this fall include the application of an implicit exchange rate in Venezuela, lower realization
gains in Iberia in comparison with the first quarter of 2015, and the amortization of
investments in IT applications.
Financial income in Brazil has proven (16:31), thanks to the high interest rate environment.
On the following slide, we will look at the figures for the Life business. In terms of
business volumes, premiums are still contracting in the Life business, although, there's
lower rate than those seen in 2015. We are seeing a return to growth in Iberia where
premiums have increased by 3.6%, thanks to the pickup in sales in the Agents' network.

The Life business in Malta also continues to perform very well.

FINAL

In Brazil, premiums have fallen 11% in local currency due to lower sales of risk products
linked to loans, and have been additionally impacted by the depreciation of the real.
Regarding results, there is a fall of 18% mainly due to the claims in Brazil and Malta. In
Brazil, lower volumes and negative evolution of claims in the Life Protection segment, and
the depreciation of the real have put pressure on results. Whereas in Malta, net financial
income has declined due to the poor performance in financial markets during the first
quarter of 2016 compared to the previous year. This fall has been partially offset by the
improvement of the underwriting result in this country.
Please let's turn to slide 21 to see the result of all the business activities.

Bloomberg Transcript

Just as a reminder the result of all the business activities includes the activities of the
following companies of MAPFRE S.A., MAPFRE AMÉRICA and MAPFRE INTERNACIONAL. As
well as, the group's non-insurance activities undertaken by subsidiaries. The €7.7 million
decline in the result is explained by a fault in net operating revenues and expenses due to
lower activity in the quarter. The impact of negative runoffs from unprofitable contact in
EMEA at MAPFRE ASISTENCIA and the impairment of a real estate investment.
On slide 23, we will look at the main drivers of the consolidated result. The year-on-year
contraction in retrofit has been due to two main process. One, the reduction in the NonLife financial result, which has been affected by the application of an implicit exchange
rate in Venezuela, as well as lower realization gains in Iberia. And two, the decline in the
result of the Life business in Brazil and Malta as explained earlier in the presentation.
These impacts were mitigated by the strong improvement in the Non-Life underwriting
result.
There has also been a growth in the effective tax rate due to the increase in the
corporate taxes in Brazil and (19:51) in the tax regime in Colombia last year. The result
attributable to minorities has fallen significantly driven by the depreciation of the real.
As we have mentioned earlier, this year's result still would include those from
discontinued operations which were €21.3 million in 2015, mainly from CatalunyaCaixa.
Excluding this impact, net profit would have increased by 6%.
On slide 25, on the next one, we will take a look at the main variations in equity on the
balance sheet year-to-date. The good performance of global financial markets during the
quarter, especially fixed income, have led to an increase in the value of the financial
investment portfolio. These movements were partially offset by shadow accounting. Also,
the 4.4% depreciation of the U.S. dollar was partially offset by the 6.2% appreciation of the
Brazilian real during the quarter.
For the time being, this is all from my side. I will now hand back the call to Mr. Tejera to
start with the Q&A session.

Thank you, Natalia. Now, we will answer the questions the most of you have sent us
through at the moment. If any other issues arise during the Q&A session, please send us
an email, we will be happy to respond if time permits.

Q&A
A - Esteban Tejera Montalvo

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you, Mr. Tejera. The first set of questions is with regards to the evolution of the
business investment (21:42). Silvia Rigol of BBVA, Niccolo Dalla Palma of Exane BNP,
Menuet and Sylvia of Bank of America Merrill Lynch asked about the worsening of the
combined ratio. Is it due to the macro environment or is it related to weather? Is it
recurring?

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

The worsening of combined ratio affects mainly to Motor business, and to Mass Market
Multi-Peril line. In the Motor segment, claim ratio has deteriorated in the first quarter of
2016 due to (22:16) of frequency in theft as a consequence of the economic crisis in the
country which has led to an increase of delinquency and fraud. In Mass Market Multi-Peril
line, claims ratio was affected by heavy rains in the first quarter on the year together with
an increasing frequency.

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you, Mrs. Núñez. Sylvia Rigol (22:42) also asked about evolution of premiums on
pricing in Life. Is it (22:47) currency also recurring? What do you expect for financial (22:53)
in 2016?

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

In the sale Non-Life premium (22:58) 18.1% in Europe with a growth of 7% in local currency.
The lower level of growth compared to previous quarter is due to a decreasing (23:10)
Motor. In this way, Motor insurance is affected by a contraction in number of new car sales
and western competition. For us, it's important to say in that sense that MAPFRE in this
environment of price war is not playing this war. We are focused as we have said before in
profitable growth. Perhaps, this is one of their reasons of this decrease in the motor
segment.

A - Esteban Tejera Montalvo

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you. Andrea Sinclair (23:45) and Paz Ojeda sent the following questions about the
Life business in Brazil. Firstly, bank premiums seem to drop materially in local terms. What
was the local currency move in (23:55) premiums? How much of the drop in premiums
was moved to a (23:59) full in borrowing in Brazil? What can you say about the outlook for
Brazilian Life? What's the reason for the decrease in the underwriting and financial result?

FINAL

Okay. Late premiums from Mapfre Brazil have decreased 32.3% in euros, 11% in local
currency. This is due to the difficult economic environment in the country. In this way, Life
premiums distributed by Bank of Brussels suffered a contraction stemming from lower
amount of loans granted to bank with the (24:35) customers.
However, Life premiums distributed by Mapfre's network have a growth of 15% in local
currency. The Life underwriting result decreased as a consequence of the contraction of
premiums issuance and the negative evolution of the claims in the quarter, also, because
of the macroeconomic environment.

A - Esteban Tejera Montalvo

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

The only piece I would like to underline that this referred to this first product is due mainly
to a decline in the lending activity in Mapfre Brazil and due to the current turmoil that is
suffering now in the Brazilian economy.
In any case, in terms of the results, there is also a compare with the figures of the first
quarter of 2015 in the evolution (25:41) of their financial market is important to (25:46) due
to the fact that part of the Hawaii (25:48) financial investment there have an impact in the
profit and loss accounting due to the accounting there in their of the (26:03) portfolio.

Thank you, Mr. Tejera. Concerning market in U.S.A., Niccolo Dalla Palma from Exane BNP
Paribas asks the following questions on the U.S.A. 102% combined ratio in the quarter, that
was like natural catastrophes looks like, at least a point in (26:23) the underlying
profitability, any one-off factors this time?
No. No. (26:34) These figures are more in the line that it would be. The most important
thing here is that the situation is totally different in Massachusetts, outside of
Massachusetts. The improvement in the loans ratio is due to lower losses mainly
Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and Florida. The combined ratio of our business in
Massachusetts is below 100%. It means that the core business with MAPFRE in the USA is
consistently performing very well.
Outside from the Massachusetts, the combined ratio is verified due to growth. We are
growing in several states and growing means not cost free. There is a new (27:27) in
business penalty that has strong impact on the ratios but we'll meet that in key states
such as California, Thailand, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut we have already achieved
as we said (27:45) scale to turn them into a profit-generating center very soon.
Thank you. Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America Merrill Lynch asked the following
questions. Massachusetts had a revenue whether (28:02), yet the U.S. business still the
leader (28:05) technical result. Under what circumstances would this business deliver a
positive technical result?
As I mentioned before, Massachusetts has a combined ratio that is below 100%, which is
performing well. The combined ratio of the U.S.A. (28:27) expansion plan. In
Massachusetts, the reality is that after raising tariffs changing in the underwriting

FINAL

conditions. We are now in the same condition with the other businesses (28:48), is
profitable and the combined ratio is, as I mentioned indirect (28:55) in a normal part.
Related to the expansion, clearly, this expansion has to be funded in this phase with
internally generated capital. Our provisions in Massachusetts is managing the operation
investment grade. We're entering any new market (29:19) there is a pickup in the cost
base. But over time, as the operations mature, there should be an improvement in
profitability. We are paying annual business penalty that is halting our (29:32).
But the most important thing is that now we have changed the structure in – of the
management in the U.S.A. We have now four regional management teams that are
monitoring especially – specifically each region, and we can monitor growth and
profitability. And we are going to manage how we want to roll according to their results in
each of these regions. And we can assist, as I said to you before, monitor this growth in
terms smooth profitability for the future.
Thank you, Mr. Tejera. Would you consider this to have been a normal winter or better
than normal winter for Massachusetts?
When we compare this winter with the previous one, it's a very good one, but is a more
normal winter. It's in the balance with the normality. Last year was very, very warm, but –
yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

What year-on-year price increase have been put through Massachusetts?

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

In Personal Auto, we've been almost flat. In Homeowner, as we said last year, we
increased close to 9%. We haven't seen this year some competitive environment in
Personal Autos in the State of Massachusetts. There is not a price war set (31:21), but
players' pressure (31:23) rates by maintaining or reducing tariffs on the last quarter of the
year, but our position there is comfortable. In terms of portfolio mix in Massachusetts, 75%
of our portfolio is Auto, and 16% Homeowner. In Auto, we have market share of 25% and
13% in Homeowner.

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you, Mrs. Nuñez. With regards to the ASISTENCIA business, (31:58) at Exane BNP
Paribas had the following question. What caused again the bad performance of
ASISTENCIA? You said at full-year results that you had fixed the issue.
Well, we have seen that we are taking runoffs for North ASISTENCIA. North ASISTENCIA is
mainly influenced. As we mentioned in the fourth quarter last year, we have been
canceling non-profitable products. Canceling this type of products requires reduction
structure. It takes time to even – especially in countries where the (32:37) is more difficult
to remove them in other countries. This portfolio (32:44) purchase was well under way at
the end of 2015. And largest economic impact was felt in the fourth quarter of 2015 and
the first quarter of this year.
Page 8 of 18

What is important to keep in mind is that premiums have been resilient. It would return to
profitability as shown in ASISTENCIA service funds of the measures taken. We're having
also negative effects from exchange rate depreciation loss not only in Venezuela, but also
in Brazil and Colombia.

FINAL

(33:27) RGB Capital Markets had the following question. Will you expect results at MAPFRE
ASISTENCIA to improve?
Well, even if this year will be a difficult one for MAPFRE ASISTENCIA, the worst is past, and
I think that we will see during the year – a year that will be nothing profits. But there is
room for profitable growth in the coming years.
Thank you. Concerning the business in Spain, Niccolo Dalla Palma from Exane BNP Paribas
asks the following questions. Regarding margins in Spain, the loss ratio (34:18) 2
percentage points, while that of your peers Linea Directa and Catalana (34:25)
deteriorated close to 2 percentage points. How can you explain the difference? Did you
release any provisions in the first quarter? And what can you say about the (34:34) income
so far?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

The tariff, I can say that we have applied some measures in Spain. These measures as we
said – what we have said is the reduction in fleets. Also we have adequate the tariffs. Right
now there is sufficiency of tariff in Spain in 2015 and so far this year. This year, as I've said
before, placing of the portfolio specifically in fleets, combined with the benign weather,
better underwriting and claims handling have improved the profitability of this business.
I can tell you there's no release of any provision during the first quarter. MAPFRE is actively
managing its portfolio of business and is focusing on profitability. For that in the Baremo,
we haven't seen any impact, almost any impact during the deal in the first quarter, what
we have seen is slight increase in frequency, but the severity coming from the Baremo.
We haven't seen that in this first quarter yet.

A - Esteban Tejera Montalvo

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you. Regarding prices in Spain, your average premium in Motor is up 2.3%, can you
pull this up further in the second or third quarters, or will you increase prices by this
amount for the next two or three years?

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

As I've said before, MAPFRE is focusing on profitability, better underwriting result. We
have mentioned in the past that this year, we would be raising targets in order to offset
the impact impact on Baremo. Therefore, we should expect this effect to continue during
the rest of the year. I think that with respect to the next two or three years, it's too early to
indicate.

Thank you. Silvia Rigol of BBVA asks the following questions: Regarding Motor in Spain, is
the improvement in the combined ratio recurring? Are you witnessing greater frequency?
How market churn are you willing to lose in order to maintain the combined ratio?

FINAL

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

We would certainly hope this ratio to be recurring. I have said before, MAPFRE is focusing
on the fidelity and better on the writing results. The creating of the portfolios specifically
in flips and the benign weather better on writing and claims handling. Having for that
profitability of this business. This is the most remarkable feature of the command ratio in
this first quarter in Spain. This is for the part that MAPFRE has to do with in terms of the
external factors, frequency continues to rise and this is backed up by the information
coming from (38:07). And from the year-end, it has increased about 2.1%. And regarding
market share losses, we don't want to target a specific market share, only profitability, as
we have said before.
However, what intended to happen in the past is that when the market competitors focus
on grabbing market share as through aggressive pricing, MAPFRE tends to lose market
share only to win it back when the competition abates on pricing becomes more rational.
Also, there is a different trend in the first quarter. The fleets have, for some competitors,
have a big impact in their accounts. So we will – there is kind of a (39:04) during the first
quarter. We will have to wait until the half of the year to see if – this demand continues.

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you, Mrs. Nuñez. With respect to the live (39:16) in Spain, first (39:18) continue to
fall, what measures are you going to adopt?
Well, the decline in the banking channel is due to lower production in the single and
regular premiums due to the focus on protection products without a higher margin. In this
environment with a very low interest rate, working to launch products – saving products in
the banking channel. And we are (39:46) according to that.
And as you can see on page 47 of our presentation, there is an increase in the BANKIA
channel in Life protection of 7.7% and in accidents, premiums, you have an increase of
22.7%. In any case, we are designing new products to be launched even in the saving
banks in the coming months, in the BANKIA channel.
Thank you, Mr. Tejera. Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America Merrill Lynch asked the

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Spain, the (42:38) ratio of around 95%, is this sustainable or either a one-off (42:44) on
this? Would you give an outlook for the coming quarters? Expected increases in average
price for the year was around 6%. Do you see room to raise this?
Right. (42:59) from before. (43:00) is focusing on – in profitability in (43:02). We have
been cleansing the portfolio specifically in fleet, combined with – this combined with very
good to go down and better underwriting in place and in fact improving the profitability of
our business. These levels are more in the normal level that we have and we will have in
the future. Even with time spent during the next quarter – next two quarters more impact
coming from the Baremo. But as you always mention before, the establishment of the
(43:59) and the new structure of Baremo improves the losses in the accidents that are
not big accidents but accidents that were a source of growth in the past. So, we can wait
in the long term an improvement. Even in the short term, we can see some (44:45) of the
loss ratio in moderation. According to that, we will (44:52) with that.
Thank you. The next set of question is regarding Solvency II. Niccolo Dalla Palma at Exane
BNP Paribas asked, would you like to know the following. Can you explain the drivers of
the move from Solvency II ratio of 170% to 190%. And can you remind us which countries
are not included on an equivalence basis?

A - Antonio Huertas Mejías
This is (45:26). Thank you for your questions. There are different combinations of factors
claiming this increase. First is the changing methodology in previous year without a full
consolidation of operations and in 2015 and basically due to the equivalent rating is a full

consolidation for operations in the European Union and those relevant in LatAm and
(45:55).

FINAL

For the remainder, we applied the equivalent regime. That means Brazil, the U.S.A and
Mexico. And the second factor to remark as well is a new interpretation, a new policy that
was published by the Spanish supervisor in order to give instructions to apply transitional
on technical provisions. And the new ones will give us an additional credit.

A - Esteban Tejera Montalvo

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you, Mr. Huertas. Andrew Sinclair at Bank of America Merrill Lynch has a few
questions regarding Solvency II. Firstly, the 190% ratio is materially above the round 170%
the staged financial year 2015. Is this difference due to transitional now being included?
Or is it something else? And secondly, where is transitional relief being taken?
Transitionals seem greater than what have been expected.

A - Antonio Huertas Mejías
We said there are several reasons. Firstly say the equivalent regime and second is
transitionals. I forgot as well another one which is detention the group because previous in
previous year, we had CatalunyaCaixa which was a joint venture 50/50 operating in Life in
Spain. And in 2015, we had the new direct line operations in Germany and Italy and they're
operating in Non-Life.

Bloomberg Transcript

Transitional growth, in general, the applied on technical resource in Life portfolio in Spain.
And the change in the ratio is mainly due to the increase in other (47:41) as I mentioned.

A - Esteban Tejera Montalvo

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you. Is there another mode of optimization that you can do?

A - Antonio Huertas Mejías
Yes. We mentioned several times that MAPFRE is working in internal knowledge for the
last 10 years, and the numbers and the metrics are being used only for (48:02) purposes.
We're working as well in unit-linked U.S. (48:08) parameters as well in the (48:13) for
internal knowledge. We're willing to understand the results for the internal knowledge and
the different (48:20) was in place. (48:25) standard for Non-Life.

A - Esteban Tejera Montalvo

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

And how much of this dealer certification benefit is international diversification versus
within country (48:40) diversification?
More of the effect is coming from international diversification. But also, the diversification
between different businesses is important. Duration for (49:10) is that in Spain, our
business is focused in other countries in personal lines with very good track of results and
very low volatility, but diversification obviously is important.

Thank you very much. (49:43) had the following questions. What are the transitional
measures applied by MAPFRE in terms of the technical provisions? Is this the deduction
approach?

FINAL

A - Antonio Huertas Mejías
Yes. It is the decision on technical provision for business in Spain, but only for (50:03) too
much (50:02).

A - Esteban Tejera Montalvo

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you, Mr. Huertas. And does MAPFRE applying transitional measures in terms of
capital charges for equities?

A - Antonio Huertas Mejías
Yes, but results were not relevant.

A - Esteban Tejera Montalvo

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

And what about transitional measures around reporting deadlines?

A - Antonio Huertas Mejías

Bloomberg Transcript

I will report those transitional measures according to the deadlines included in the
legislation.

A - Esteban Tejera Montalvo

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Is there a specific part of the business, which requires the matching adjustment or is it
gladly use across the group?

A - Antonio Huertas Mejías
Well, the matching adjustment only applies in certain portfolios in Spain and for the
remainder of Life portfolios with (50:43) volatility adjustment and Non-Life is not relevant.

A - Esteban Tejera Montalvo

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you. And finally, does MAPFRE plan a volatility adjustment as well?

A - Antonio Huertas Mejías
(50:53) on Life business portfolios, but those matching adjustment in (50:59) and NonLife is not relevant as I mentioned.

A - Esteban Tejera Montalvo

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you, Mr. Huertas.The new set of question is concerning the business in Spain. Carlos
Peixoto from BPI (51:10) asks the following questions. MAPFRE ESPAÑA divisions were
reclassified. Companies, home insurance, and others disappeared into Multi-Peril and
other personal lines and commercial insurance. Why do you decide to make this change?

Date: 2016-05-03

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. Well, this change was due mainly to the merger of MAPFRE FAMILIAR and MAPFRE
EMPRESAS to trade MAPFRE ESPAÑA. These two companies have been fully integrated,
therefore, it's not possible to replicate the exact same information we previously
published. That's why we have given you the figures for 2015 to MAPFRE like-for-like
numbers.
The main difference between the new disclosure and the previous one is mainly property
insurance which is not – is now included in Multi-Peril and other personal lines. Last year, it
included mainly condominium insurance. This year Multi-Peril includes Home,
Condominium, and Commercial Property insurance. This is the main difference. But
anyway, you need any further assistance, we can give you more color on that if you call us
through the Investor Relation team.

A - Esteban Tejera Montalvo

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you, Mrs. Nuñez. What is behind the reinstatement of the Motor Insurance division
data in the first quarter of 2015? What changes have been made in the consolidation
(52:50)?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

I think it's that this year we are presenting the information for the entire business
management MAPFRE ESPAÑA which includes Spain and Portugal. Last year, we presented
only the information for Motor in Spain but as you can imagine, the main bulk of the
business come from Spain. It's mainly Spain. There are slight differences. That's why we
have given you the figure for 2015 in order for you to compare.

A - Esteban Tejera Montalvo

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you. I noticed a 1% growth in the number of insured vehicles in Spain. Is this related
with pricing discipline? What further improvement in the combined ratio?

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

This is really mainly through the cleansing of the portfolio, principally inflates as we have
mentioned, which at the same time, have had the effect of improving the profitability of
the business.

A - Esteban Tejera Montalvo

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you, Mrs. Nuñez. What are your expectations on the evolution of Motor premiums in
Spain on the combined ratio?
Well, I think that premiums will continue to perform well, given that the tariff increases, we
are (54:16). In addition, the cleansing of the portfolio specifically inflates combined with
the underwriting claim, and this should continue to improve in the profitability of the
business.

As I mentioned in the first method (54:35) in respect of Barrimoere (54:38) so far, this has
(54:46) impact on the result thus far but in the near future we must wait to see for the
(54:58) quarters.

FINAL

Thank you, Mr. Tejera. Paz Ojeda (55:06) at JB Capital sends the following questions
about Mexico. What's the reason for the falling premiums in local currency? Do you see
risk of a worsening environment for the business?
Well, in Life, the reduced premium more than that and the first quarter of 2015 included
life protection corporate policy arranged a multi-year contract that has (55:32) in 2016. In
Non-Life, in the – in this quarter, premiums decreased in (55:41) industries in motor
segment due specifically to actions of that thinking especially in quality policies in Motor in
February (55:55) in order to keep the profitability.
Thank you, Mr. Tejera. (56:04) at BPI (56:05) sends the following question on Brazil. What
are your expectations in evolution of the agricultural insurance business in Brazil?
Well, the evolution of the agricultural business in Brazil is very tight to the evolution of the
(56:20) of the government for the farmers in order to widen premiums. As we notice in
the last year, at that time, there was no these payment subsidies in this year. And these
payment subsidies were replaced in the second half of the 2015. So, this figure are
according to that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Due to the fact that this (56:59) we will play a role of the leaders in this market in Brazil.
Next question is from (57:11) of Credit Suisse. Will then MAPFRE apply (57:12) its
embedded value report for 2015?
We provide the materials for everybody in the last few quarter presentation (57:21).
Thank you. Michael Huttner (57:27) from JPMorgan has asked. Would management's
planned holiday incentive plan has changed? And how (57:35) it matches in your 2018
strategic plan targets?
As always, once the three-year plan – strategic plan was approved, all the incentives within
the company had been arranged with this in new plan. And has been calculated to all the
levels of the organization.
Thank you, Mr. Tejera. Mike Ofera (58:12) from JB Capital (58:13) asked the following
question regarding the business in Germany. Could you explain the poor performance of
Germany year-on-year, pre-tax profit that stands at minus 10.2% – sorry, minus €10.2
million? What has happened?

This is a good question because the presentation can give you a different idea about the
consolidation of the direct business in Germany. The consolidation of the direct business
in Germany is contributing to the improvement in the result of Germany. But the problems
is that there has been some negative deviations in the country during the quarter arising
from Global Risks. P2 premiums in the recently consolidated insurance unit are performing
very well. With a better combined ratio than expected. However, we are going through an
integration process. We can suffer from integration cost that might lag the overall
performance of the company throughout the year. But until now it's performing very well.

A - Esteban Tejera Montalvo

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

(59:32) and the negative figure is coming from a big loss in industrial power plant in
Global Risk.
Thank you. The next question is from Carlos Peixoto at BPI (59:47). Should we expect
financial income to remain under pressure over the coming quarters?

Bloomberg Transcript

Financial income is in the first quarter is a more normalized level due to a lower level of
the realized gains. In any case, last year, we had a lot of realized gains in Spain. You can
see in the details at the end of the presentation on page 69, you can see the net
realization gains breakdown by different kind of business. Last year in the first quarter, we
had €72.9 million. And this year, we are having €34.4 million. In this we can reflect what
happened last year.
In any case – although, we are seeing lower investment deals in the Spanish portfolio,
deals in (01:01:08) is still at a high level due to the interest rate environment. In the strong
decrease in the financial result is driven mainly by currency movements, mainly the
depreciation of the Venezuelan Bolivar as well as the Brazilian Real, which is affecting the
year-on-year comparison. And also, in Malta, last year, we've had an (01:01:31) event that is
not including Brazil.
Thank you, Mr. Tejera. Carlos Peixoto at BPI (01:01:39) asks the following questions: Do we
expect that the €14 sales dividend per share to come as reference for 2016 and its
payout?
We are not giving this kind of (01:01:56). That is very (01:01:59) in the year and in many
cases, we are not giving (01:02:05) this kind. What we had said is that our policy is having
a payout higher than 50%.
Thank you. And what is your outlook for MAPFRE USA?
Well, I mentioned before that our policy in Massachusetts is solid and mature. We are
confident that it delivers on (01:02:26) profitability will level off across all state after
achieving our growth objectives outside Massachusetts. In the sales, we have launched a
battery of (01:02:38) of profitability measures outside Massachusetts. We will definitely
have a positive impact in mid-term. New measures have been implemented for angles of

Page 16 of 18

the business, rate increases and overall prices we put in actions. It is a management under
rating controls in new product features.

FINAL

According to our plan, we are not considering our new state empty until late 2017. And
then we will be in a better position to determine if an additional (01:03:15) makes sense
even if we have to reduce our presence in one of the space we have presence already.
Thank you. Regarding Brazil, (01:03:31) further question. Taking into account reiterated
weakened (01:03:35) economic environment. Could it be a risk for further deterioration in
the combined ratio? What kind of measure is MAPFRE taking to protect the profitability of
the business?
Well, first of all I would like to send a message of (01:03:54) because what is happening
now in Brazil is not – there is a – environment with a lot of uncertainty. There are people
that are not asking new money for upgrading new cars or new houses. And this has some
immediate impact. The message from MAPFRE is that we would continue as always in
keeping our business under control in terms of profitability even if we have to witness a
period of low increase in premium income – only one decrease. But I think that the
operation is very solid. We are now entering in price wars and I think that the deterioration
of the loss ratio are huge. The weather conditions especially for this range in parts of the
country will be offset in the – during the year. In – well, thank you, (01:05:28).

adjustment benefit only 1%? Wasn't this a very important feature for the Spanish Life
market?

A - Antonio Huertas Mejías
Well, the 1% benefit is over the volatility adjustment. We felt that it was important to
disclose the margin adjustment because it's nothing (01:06:26) similar, particular for the

Thank you. Carlos Peixoto at BPI (01:06:31) has another question regarding MAPFRE
ASISTENCIA. Will you please elaborate on the €54.5 million provision at MAPFRE
ASISTENCIA? What was behind it?
Carlos (01:06:45), I understand that you refer to the figures that we publish at the end of
the year. And these losses were reported in the full-year 2015 figures and other losses
related to the identification of known profitable contents. We have already discussed a
large part of these losses were located in France. But there was also some pressure on
results coming from Brazil, North America, and LatAm South. But this – we have been
discussing in the full-year results.
Thank you very much. There are no more questions.
