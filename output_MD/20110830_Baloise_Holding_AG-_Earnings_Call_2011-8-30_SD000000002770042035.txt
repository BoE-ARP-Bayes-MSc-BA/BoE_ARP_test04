Presentation
Operator
Good morning. I'm Dino, the Chorus Call operator for this conference. Welcome to the
Baloise Group half-year results 2011 presentation. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I
would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Martin Strobel, Group CEO. Please go
ahead, sir.

Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you, very much. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure to welcome you to
our analyst meeting. German Egloﬀ and I will present our semi-annual results to you. Both
of us and Martin Wenk, our Chief Investment Oﬃcer, will be available for your questions in
the question-and-answer round.
We intend to concentrate solely on the essential facts in our presentation. This will give us
more time for a detailed question-and-answer session. After the short introduction, I
would now like to go to slide number 3.
First of all I would like to present to you the highlights of the half-year results 2011. After
that, German Egloﬀ will take you through the key ﬁnancial ﬁgures. Building on that, I
would like to illustrate the course of the business from a market and customer

perspective. To ﬁnish oﬀ, I would then like to present to you where we stand in terms of
our strategic program, Baloise 2012. And end with our ﬁnancial outlook.

FINAL

Let us start with the most important performance indicators relating to our semi-annual
results. They are illustrated on slide number 5.
Ladies and gentlemen. Baloise has realized a solid result in the ﬁrst half of 2011. This result
is based on our eﬀorts to improve the operational excellence. Our proﬁts were stable,
despite a continuing low interest rate and an all-time low euro.
Our strategic program, Baloise 2012, is fully on track. It delivers a signiﬁcant contribution
to our proﬁtability, as well as to our growth.
Our strong growth in premiums shows that we are successfully putting the opportunities
oﬀered by the market to good use. And we are able to build on our market positioning.
Our Sound Safety World brand positioning creates higher customer demand in our target
segments.

Bloomberg Transcript

Once again our Nonlife business proved to be a strong pillar of Baloise. The combined
ratio stands at a very good 93%. This high margin of our Nonlife operation grants reliable
and high cash ﬂows.
Our Life earnings recovered strongly. Here the stable, albeit low, interest rate level
helped, as well as the eﬀects from Baloise 2012. The positive development of our Life
business can also be clearly seen in our strongly improved new business margin.
In a challenging ﬁnancial environment we can build on a resilient investment income,
demonstrating the strength and the quality of our asset management.
At the end of June, Solvency amounted to a strong 227%, one of the highest ﬁgures in the
industry.
We are proud of our remarkable footprint in Belgium. The integration of Avero was
completed and we expect the closing of the acquisition of Nateus in the near future.
After this brief outline, I would now like to hand over to German Egloﬀ who will take you
through the main ﬁnancial points of the semi-annual report.

German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Thank you, Martin. Good morning, from my side as well. I am pleased to walk you through
the results of the ﬁrst half of 2011.
I can present a half year with solid ﬁgures. Once again, we were able to rely on our good
operating performance and achieved sound results. Headwinds came up through
Page 2 of 27

FINAL

external factors, in particular the euro development versus Swiss franc. The depreciation
of the euro compared to the Swiss franc impacted both the balance sheet as well as the
income statement.
The closing date exchange rate, which is decisive for the balance sheet and the
impairments, closed over 2% down compared to the beginning of the year. The average
exchange rate relevant for the proﬁt contributions of the foreign units fell by a further 8%
compared to the beginning of the year. The loss is nearly 12% compared to the ﬁrst half of
2010. As we have seen, this negative development has, unfortunately, continued since
June 30.
Premium growth of 3.2% was very pleasing. Here, I refer to the ﬁgures in local currencies
relevant for the evaluation. We were able to achieve above average growth in many
markets. Growth drivers were the Nonlife segment and the Group Life business in
Switzerland. Business volume was lower, as expected.
The previous year still proﬁted signiﬁcantly from the Italian tax amnesty and the expected
EU directive, which brought Lichtenstein and Luxembourg an extra volume of unit-linked
business.

Bloomberg Transcript

I would now like to explain the main aspects of the results, starting with the Nonlife
business on slide 8.
The Nonlife business recorded very good growth of 7.5% in local currency. This increase in
volume was positively impacted by the consolidation of the Avero in Belgium.
Building on the measures to strengthen our operational excellence and the strategic
program, Baloise 2012, we could again achieve an excellent operating result with a gross
combined ratio of 90.3%.
Proﬁt before interest and taxes declined, due to the lower ﬁnancial result. Nevertheless,
on the whole, the Nonlife business proved itself to be a sustainable and reliable earnings
power[ph] and contributed the largest share to the Group results.
Let me now explain the development of the combined ratio in detail on slide 9.
The biggest impact on the development of the combined ratio is stemming from the
slightly higher claims burden and the lower impact of prior-year loss development. The
underlying loss ratio was about on the same level as last year.
Large claims above CHF4 million have a negative impact of 1.5 points on the combined
ratio. Again, we recorded some large claims between CHF3 million and CHF4 million,
adding a further 0.9percentage points.

Page 3 of 27

The unwinding of the German units. And the integration eﬀect in Luxembourg and
Belgium, weigh on the combined ratio. The positive eﬀects from the eﬃciency
enhancement measures of Baloise 2012 couldn't fully compensate this eﬀect.

FINAL

Slide 10 illustrates how the combined ratio developed in the individual countries. With the
exception of Croatia, we were again able to achieve high margins in our major markets,
guaranteeing stable cash ﬂows. An excellent value of 84.3% was achieved in Switzerland.
Please note that the impact on the combined ratio due to the July storms will be reﬂected
in the second half year. According to what we know at present, we expect these storms to
impact the Group net combined ratio by towards 2percentage points, taken over the year
as a whole.
We observed a strong improvement of the combined ratio in Germany. This is mainly due
to a lower claims burden of major claims, in particular.
Due to the ﬁrst time consolidation of Avero. And positive one-oﬀ eﬀects in the previous
year, therefore the development of the combined ratio in Belgium should not be
compared to the previous year. Nevertheless it's at a very pleasing level.

Bloomberg Transcript

Luxembourg, which again proved very proﬁtable, delivered an encouraging result.
The combined ratio in Austria is the best the unit has ever achieved. Even if the result
beneﬁts from the absence of large claims, it still shows that the growth in target customer
strategy, now in place for a number of years, is making a positive diﬀerence.
In Croatia, the above market growth, which was nominal, still weak given the recessive[ph]
in economic climates, resulted in a combined ratio of above 100%, despite great eﬀorts to
cut costs.
All in all, based on the country results represented here, the gross combined ratio for the
Group equates to an excellent 90.3%.
I'd now like to address the Life business on slide 11. Last year the business volume. And
here, especially, the single premium investment type business, was strongly inﬂuenced by
the Italian tax amnesty and the expected EU directives, as I mentioned earlier.
Gross premiums in local currency remain stable, despite the extremely diﬃcult interest
rate environment.
Proﬁt improved signiﬁcantly. The measures of Baloise 2012 are taking eﬀect, which is also
reﬂected in the lower costs. Additionally, the previous year was negatively inﬂuenced by
falling interest rates, whereas these remain stable in the ﬁrst half of 2011. The value of new
business developed very encouragingly.

FINAL

The increase of over 50% mainly stems from Switzerland, which beneﬁted from the
interest rate development within the last 12 months and the operational improvement,
such as cost reductions or the changed business mix. This is also reﬂected in the new
business margin that has improved by over 10percentage points.
I would now like to move on to the investment side on slide 12. Our asset management
achieved a pleasing result in the face of the development of the markets. However, the
high volatility remained challenging. In particular, our full attention is demanded by the
development of the euro that has been going still downhill since June 30. And was,
meanwhile, almost on par with the Swiss franc. Although we see a diﬀerent trend in the
last few days, we are still below the level of the half-year closing.
But also the negative development of the dollar, interest rates and the stock markets,
which have all lost a lot of ground compared to their status at the end of June, are placing
a strain on our business.
The most recent developments have caused us to increase the foreign currency hedge on
the Swiss unit bonds further. And also reduce the share quota compared to the balance
sheet (inaudible) through the derivatives. As you can see on slide 13, this was still 6.7% on
June 30.

Bloomberg Transcript

In these volatile market conditions it's good to be able to rely on a high quality investment
portfolio. Our broadly diversiﬁed portfolio generates stable recurring earnings on a broad
base. Our investment property, which has delivered consistently high revenue, stands out
as a very reliable component.
The quality of the bond portfolio, which makes up for about 50% of the asset allocation, is
presently often these costs[ph]. The quality of our bond portfolio, which was excellent
already in the past, has even improved compared to the end of the year. Approximately
60% of the bond portfolio has a rating of AAA. And over 93% are rated above A. It was
not necessary to perform any impairments on the total bond portfolio.
You will ﬁnd a detailed list of the Government bonds of the so-called GIIPS countries that
have come under scrutiny on slide 14. We have a total GIIPS exposure of about 4% of the
bond portfolio, respectively 2% of the total insurance assets. We actively monitor the
situation of these countries and will react on possible changes. As already mentioned,
there are no impairments on these bonds. Furthermore, based on current information and
understanding, we have no intention to participate in the EU ﬁnancing program for
Greece.
Let me now move on to the components of the investment yield on slide 15. The recurring
income is robust, despite negative eﬀects of the euro and the interest rates. The negative
currency eﬀect is, again, visible on the ﬁxed income securities. This eﬀect is partly
compensated by the currency hedges under the balance sheet item Others. This equates
to a net currency loss of CHF44 million.

Page 5 of 27



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG
Company Ticker: BALN SW Equity
Date: 2011-08-30

The lower investment income is due to reduced realizations. This results in a nonannualized investment yield for the ﬁrst half year of 1.3% in Nonlife and 1.7% in Life.

FINAL

Finally I'd like to explain the change in equity on slide 16. Equity remains stable at around
CHF4 billion and the negative development of the currencies is also reﬂected in the
change in equity under the position annualized gains and losses. This eﬀect is, however,
over compensated by the half-year proﬁt.
The available funds are resulting in a solid Solvency I ratio of 227%. Standard & Poor's
recently positively acknowledged this strong capitalization in their rating report; you can
ﬁnd this information on our home page.
I'd like to thank you for your attention and hand back to Martin.

Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you, German. I would like to elaborate on our business from a market and
customer perspective. Let's start with a look at growth, which is illustrated on slide 18.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the ﬁrst half of 2011, the accelerated growth in our major markets, Switzerland, Germany
and Belgium, successfully increased their growth and gained market share in most
segments. Their growth is based on a sound positioning with our Safety World and
innovative solutions that met the demands of our target customers. The growth in
Belgium is also supported by the integration of Avero.
Our operations in Luxembourg and Liechtenstein -- you'll ﬁnd Liechtenstein under other
units on the left table -- are both confronted with a decline of business volume. We
expected this decline since the previous half year was supported by the extraordinary
eﬀects in freedom of services business, the Scudo Fiscale in Italy and the eﬀects of the
then expected introduction of the European savings directive. Take out this baseline
eﬀect. And you see a stable premium development in Luxembourg and a further
acceleration of the growth of our innovative variable annuities business in Liechtenstein.
It feels good to see the growth we achieved in a large number of countries and segments
in the ﬁrst half of 2011. I would like to especially highlight our growth of 7.5% in the Nonlife
segment. This growth is clearly above market and shows that we systematically develop
this core business of Baloise.
Having taken a look at growth, I would now like to provide you with some explanatory
notes on the income side. These are illustrated on slide 19.
Looking at the EBIT of Baloise, we are proud of the development in Switzerland. Although
being confronted with a continuing very low interest environment and an all time low euro
in the ﬁrst half of 2011, the EBIT increased by 68%. This remarkable increase is due to a
solid Nonlife result, a strongly improved Life result and a further improved Banking result.

FINAL

Our non-domestic operations are all aﬀected by the currency translation; the weak euro
takes its toll. On top of that, Germany now invests in the unwinding and the integration
eﬀorts. These investments. And the missing positive unwinding eﬀects from the ﬁrst half of
2010, explain the development of the EBIT.
In Belgium, integration eﬀects of Avero, as well as acquisition eﬀorts of Nateus, mirror
themselves on EBIT level. Furthermore, we see a more normal Nonlife result without
extraordinary prior-year loss experiences this year.
From the divisional perspective it is clear that our Nonlife business remains the most
important earnings pillar of Baloise. The strong operational performance was aﬀected by
currency eﬀects in the investment result in Switzerland, as well as on the Nonlife earnings
from our non-domestic business.
Our Life earnings recovered strongly. A more stable ﬁnancial environment and the
positive eﬀects of Baloise 2012 are the main reasons for this positive development.
Our Banking division was able to improve earning power; not a given in such eventful
times.

Bloomberg Transcript

And now to our Swiss operations, which are illustrated on slide 20. Once again, our Swiss
business demonstrates its excellent operational proﬁtability.
Nonlife, our management of target customers, combined with our Safety World
positioning, leads to an above-market growth of 2%. Our Swiss operations achieved an
outstanding operational performance with a combined ratio of 84.3%. Our investment in
eﬀective processes is paying oﬀ. The EBIT in the Nonlife business was aﬀected by
negative currency eﬀects on the investment results.
In the Life business, gross premiums remained stable. In Group Life we grew strongly with
annual premiums up by 7.7%. As an established full service insurer we enjoy our
customers' trust and are able to grow with them.
With the aid of our innovative life insurance products, we were able to add new pension
insurance business to a substantial degree. Our innovative variable annuities, as well as
our newly launched unit linked structured insurance product, were well accepted by our
target customers. These successes supported the strong increase in investment-type
premiums. They increased by 66%.
The Life earnings recovered strongly. The more stable interest rate environment in the ﬁrst
half of 2011 and the positive eﬀects of Baloise 2012 are the main reasons for the strong
increase of the EBIT.
The eﬀects of Baloise 2012 can also be clearly seen at Baloise Bank SoBa. Due to the
growth and lower costs the operating result, as well as the net income, increased. The
cost income ratio declined by 3.6percentage points.

FINAL

Baloise Bank SoBa grew substantially. As a bank with regional roots we beneﬁted from
our trust-based positioning. At the same time, our Switzerland-wide business model,
together with the insurance agent, gathered pace. You can ﬁnd more information on
Baloise Bank SoBa on the Internet, or in the appendix to this presentation.
On slide 21 I would like to give you a brief summary of our international operations. In
Germany, the realignment is progressing well. The development of the premium income
and the claims developments are favorable.
Our Belgian business is characterized by strong growth at a growth rate of almost 38% in
Nonlife and almost 33% in Life business volume; we gained substantial market share. This
strong growth is due to the acquisition of Avero. But also, without the acquisition of
Avero, our Belgian business grew strongly with 6.2% % in Nonlife, demonstrating the
good positioning of our Company. Our acquisition of Nateus is not yet included in the
ﬁgures. We expect the closing in the near future.
In Luxemburg, our local operation made substantial progress. The integration of Fortis
IARD is successfully completed.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Austria we are continuing to expand our insurance sales force and are now substantially
outperforming the market in terms of growth. In Nonlife, premiums grew by more than
10% and in Life, almost 6%.
In Croatia, optimization measures are making an impact. Nonlife premiums and costs
overall are improving, even in a declining market environment.
Baloise Life in Liechtenstein, as already pointed out, we see a decline in the freedom of
services business. Our variable annuities business gathered pace. In Switzerland, for
instance, VA premiums grew by 20%. In addition to Switzerland, we now sell this product
in Germany and Austria, thus further broadening the growth base for our innovative Life
business.
I would now like to work you through the actual status of our strategy. Let's start with slide
23.
Our goal is to become one of Europe's most proﬁtable and fastest growing insurers by
2012. In actual and quantiﬁable terms, this objective is aimed at increasing Baloise's
sustainable earning power by CHF200 million per annum up until 2012.
In order to reach this target we have initiated the Baloise 2012 program in 2009. We are
right in the middle of implementation and are fully on target.
Where do we stand in terms of implementation? Meanwhile many optimization initiatives
are well advanced or completed. We further improved claims management in
Switzerland, for instance. The eﬃciency programs in Belgium, Switzerland and Croatia

Page 8 of 27



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG
Company Ticker: BALN SW Equity
Date: 2011-08-30

yielded substantial cost-reduction eﬀect in the ﬁrst half of 2011. Also measures on Group
level are having an impact; for instance, our newly established Group procurement.

FINAL

Growth initiatives are making good progress. Detailed here are the expansion of the
insurance sales forces in Austria and Croatia as well as the pricing initiatives in Switzerland
and the development of the Life business in Belgium. Our good growth ﬁgures can also
be attributed to the success of these initiatives.
The development of new growth segments is also making good progress. We have
already spoken about the development of our investment type Life insurance.
In terms of implementing Baloise 2012, we are right on target. In 2011 we anticipate this
program to generate a positive eﬀect of between CHF100 million and CHF120 million. In
2012 we will feel the full beneﬁt of this program. Baloise's sustainable earning power will
increase by CHF200 million per annum up to that point.
Following this overview, I would now like to take a more detailed look at three initiatives
on slide 24.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the optimize category, the bundling of forces in German initiative of Deutscher Ring
and Basler Germany has successfully passed critical milestones. Nearly all employees
have been assigned to their future work place. Two-thirds of the departments are already
organizationally separated. The workers' councils support these process constructively.
Our business case to realize annual synergies of EUR20 million to EUR25 million net after
tax and policyholder is fully on track. At this point, our German operations are in the
investment phase to reap the full beneﬁts in the coming years. We're happy to see that
our newly integrated German operations gained traction in the marketplace. We see a
stable premium development in Germany in line with the market development.
The second example, a growth example, is provided by Belgium. We systematically
advance our Life business. In three years, from half year '08 to half year '11, the Life
business grew by an astonishing 64% in Belgium. There are many factors supporting this
extraordinary growth. Let me mention just two of them.
First of all, we developed innovative products for private and corporate customers that
were very well received. Second, we systematically invested in the development of sales
channels. We strengthened the cooperation with brokers and ﬁnancial advisors. These
sales ﬁgures are very promising. With the integration of Avero, Mercator now serves the
entire Belgium market, including Wallonia and Brussels. These new regions oﬀer
substantial new growth opportunities for our operation in Belgium.
The ﬁnal example is taken from Baloise Switzerland. Here Safety World, our unique
positioning to make our customers safer, has an impact on growth and proﬁtability. Our
household product in Switzerland comes with a safety package oﬀering unique safety
services to our target customers. One example, after a theft at your house or apartment,
Page 9 of 27

Date: 2011-08-30

FINAL

we not only cover the claim but oﬀer psychological assistance for you and your family to
help coping with the side eﬀects of this unpleasant event.
The eﬀect of this innovation is impressive. 25% of the customers that buy or renew the
household product buy this additional safety package. The customers are impressed with
these new prevention services and like our added-value approach. And we generate
value for Baloise. The increased cross-selling ratio at our target customers helps to further
deepen the relationship. At the same time, the products sold within the safety package
oﬀer attractive margins for Baloise.
These were three examples out of 100 initiatives in our Baloise 2012 program. I hope I
could demonstrate that Baloise 2012 is a very dynamic and successful program.
To conclude, I would like to take you through out outlook on the future on slide 25. Our
ambitions remain unchanged. Over the cycle we are aiming for 15% return on equity. We
are looking to steadily increase earnings per share and maintain our combined ratio well
below 100%.

Bloomberg Transcript

I would like to summarize the most important key issues once more. First, we achieved a
solid proﬁt backed by operational excellent. With the continuing implementation of
Baloise 2012 we will further strengthen the growth and proﬁtability of Baloise. Second,
based on our proven operation excellence we generate a cash ﬂow, which leads to a high
level of stability. Third, our solvency is strong.
Thank you for being so attentive. After this reporting section I would like to give you
further insight into two more general topics -- Baloise positioning to make our customers
safer and an update on the political agenda. Let's start at slide 26.
You are all familiar with our Safety World positioning. Our promise is, making you safer. To
this end we oﬀer intelligent prevention products and services to our customers, like, for
instance, the safety services in our household product as described earlier, our safetyorientated HR services and our Group health programs.
But we are doing more. As a responsible corporate citizen we, as Baloise, have
established our safety day. Each Friday 13, which normally is associated with bad luck, is
turned into a safety day by the employees of Baloise. To be more speciﬁc, on the last
Friday 13, which was May 13, we made young children safer by oﬀering customized bicycle
training. I attended this training session in Austria myself and was impressed to see how
eager these 14-year-old youths[ph] were to learn about the safe handling of their bikes.
Or take Switzerland. In cooperation with a large corporation partner of ours we made car
drivers in Switzerland safer. Our employees took care of the right pressure in tires at ﬁlling
stations and cleaned the windshield glass with a special protection, based on
nanotechnology.

FINAL

More than 500 employees in our seven European countries were active as brand
ambassadors to make the world a little safer. The success of these safety days strengthens
our commitment to further develop Baloise positioning Safety World. It is great fun and, at
the same time, we can do some good.
Also Swiss politics should do some good to improve the market framework of the
insurance industry, especially in the current economic environment. We asked the
Government to improve; the regulations reached today are not satisfactory. You will ﬁnd
details on the next slide.
Each year in autumn the Swiss Bundesrat, the Swiss Federal Council, decides on the
minimum interest rate guarantee for the compulsory part of the Swiss Group Life
business. From our point of view, it is crucial to take the current development of key
ﬁnancial parameters into account. We were confronted with extraordinary developments
in the recent weeks and months. The 10-year Swiss Government Bond stands around 1%
right now, for example. Short interest rates are even negative in Switzerland.

Bloomberg Transcript

Taking these developments into account, the minimum insurance rate guarantee has to
be lowered substantially from its current level of 2% to 1% for the coming year. Only with
an adequate management of the guarantee level, the long-term stability of the second
pillar in Switzerland can be sustained.
Also the pension conversion rate in the mandatory part of the Group Life business has to
be adapted to the demographic reality. Right now, the conversion rate stands at 6.9% and
will be lowered to 6.8% by 2014. These parameters are too high, which means that the
active working generation subsidizes the entire population substantially. The adequate
conversion rate has to stand below 6%. We ask the political bodies to adapt their
parameters accordingly. This all to ensure the long-term stability of the second pillar in
Switzerland.
The third. And last, political topic I would like to comment is the unisex decision taken by
the European Court. Basically, the decision says that, although it is absolutely clear that
life expectancy between man and woman is diﬀerent, this fact of life is not allowed to be
taken into account when calculating risk-adjusted premiums in life insurance.
We believe that this is a wrong decision based on too populist understanding of being
equal. It is crucial for the insurance industry to take objective risk criteria into account
when determining risk prices. This adequate pricing leads to an overall increase of
eﬃciency, thus lower insurance premiums and the right signals to improve risk exposure.
We therefore are very content that in Switzerland correct pricing is in line with the
regulation and that it will remain so in the future.
And now we would be pleased to answer your questions. Thank you, very much.

FINAL

Q - Fabrizio Croce

{BIO 15005585 <GO>}

Now in terms of -- I have only a couple of questions. The ﬁrst one is in terms of large
claims. What was impressive to me was not the large claim above CHF4 million. But rather
the one above CHF3 million. It's really -- that is a huge amount. So here I suppose that
there is -- so frequency went up pretty sharply and I was looking to have some more ﬂavor
on what kind of claims were actually occurring and even if we have to expect this to
materialize going forward or these are really more some sort of one-oﬀ eﬀects due to
some particular methodological, even -- simply to have a little bit more ﬂavor about if it is
a recurring item or a ﬁxed one?
And the second one is about acquisition. You seem still to have a very nice buﬀer in terms
of excess capital and the euro fall totally apart. So now I know that you just acquire in
Belgium. So potentially you are -- you seem to be down for the time. But still the chance
seems to good just to do further more acquisitions. And the question is if you are already
also targeting some market or geographies?

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Mr. Croce for your two questions. I will answer them directly and maybe
afterwards German Egloﬀ can support.
First of all, combined ratio development. Actually we are very pleased with the very good
combined ratio. To our understanding this is a very good combined ratio and net
performance of 93%, given that we didn't have any extraordinary prior-loss development
and given the weight that is coming from the integration eﬀorts in Germany, as well as the
acquisition eﬀorts in Belgium.
We regard this combined ratio, in this sense, of a very high quality since in the last half
year we have seen a major diﬀerence between the ﬁrst half year and second half year.
And I think we can expect a more stable development now for this year.
Talking about frequency overall, frequency in most segments is actually going down.
Actually we are very happy with that showing. But this is the quality of our business. So
this is overall a very good development. There are exceptions to the rule. One, for
instance, is Group health business in Switzerland, where we see an increase of frequency
due to the economic development in Switzerland. Overall, frequencies are more or less
stable or even going down in some segments.
I think also the claims in this CHF3 million to CHF4 million bracket don't hint at a higher
frequency in this area. This is a very selected number of diﬀerent claims from diﬀerent
countries; so no pattern behind this. And, again, overall, 93%, I think, is a very good
combined ratio performance.

Coming back on this one. But this means that this 2.4percentage points are recurring

Well, I think the special thing is that they are purely accidental. So there is no speciﬁc
portfolio behind it. I think the special thing is just that in a previous year, within that layer,
CHF3 million to CHF4 million we had almost nothing, which is accidental as well.
So I would say, yes, in terms of large claims the year was -- this year, you know I have
normally the expectation of CHF45 million for the whole year and I always say we will
never meet that; either we are below it or we are above it. This year we will certainly be
above it, just because of the hailstones in the second half.
But in the ﬁrst half we were pretty within expectations. So I think it's fair to say that you
have to consider a certain amount of large claims and they were pretty normal coming out
of the current year. Just in relation to the previous year, it was diﬀerent.

And now, Mr. Croce, coming back to your second question, excess capital and
acquisition. First of all, it's very important to understand for Baloise that we focus on an
organic strategy. Our main eﬀorts and focus is on the organic development, in terms of
Baloise 2012, in terms of growth, eﬃciency improvement and coming up with innovations
of Safety World to really increase market share in this.
So we only do M&A if a really good opportunity arise. And we have seen very interesting
opportunities in Luxemburg and in Belgium recently; you have quoted them. Each M&A
case has to fulﬁll three criteria -- it has to ﬁt the strategy, it has to ﬁt the culture of the
Company, it has to have an accretive business case. All these three criteria have been
fulﬁlled by these three acquisitions. We regard them as being bolt on.
And going forward. And that was your question, you can expect the same from Baloise.
First, you can expect focus on the organic development of the Group. Second, if there are
bolt-on acquisitions in our existing core markets that fulﬁll these three criteria, we will
have a close look on them. So no change in M&A policy going forward.

Q - Fabrizio Croce

{BIO 15005585 <GO>}

Now that we are speaking, another one pops just in mind in terms of questions. Very -- in
terms of the 2percentage points additional claim that you said comes out of the hail, if I
analyze, actually this. So if I look only to the second half, this means that the combined
ratio in the second half should go up some 4percentage points. And so my question is,
how -- did the reinsurance coverage not grip[ph] or was the claim really such gigantic?

Well, it's a bit early to be too speciﬁc there. But I can tell you the total amount was about
CHF50 million. And since it comes out of diﬀerent lines of business. And part of it goes to
the Swiss elementary pool. But since we expect that we were pretty within our market
share, all this comes back on a net basis as well.
So that's the current -- it's early to be more speciﬁc there, that might change. But our
current estimate is about CHF50 million net, which is on diﬀerent lines of business and
that's the reason that the reinsurance recovery is relatively small.

Q - Fabrizio Croce

{BIO 15005585 <GO>}

Which means that the 2percentage point -- the guidance is actually --

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

2% -- I mean CHF50 million, CHF2.5 billion premiums, or CHF3 billion premiums. So
that's just a rough calculation.

Q - Fabrizio Croce

{BIO 15005585 <GO>}

It's a fairly conservative estimate.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

It might be a bit less. But up to.

Q - Fabrizio Croce

{BIO 15005585 <GO>}

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Just one remark about the acquisitions, I wouldn't add to the acquisitions. But in your
question, you just said it seems that you have a lot of excess capital. I would be very, very
careful with the excess capital at the moment, because since markets are so volatile at the
moment and since you know that we have market consistent solvency models, I'm really
careful about how to handle the capital. So we are very careful there, just to add this.

Q - Fabrizio Croce

{BIO 15005585 <GO>}

Yes, okay. Wonderful. Thank you.

I have two questions, if I may. Firstly, on your FX exposure and your hedges, you
mentioned that you increased the hedging of the euro exposure of the Swiss portfolio.

Company Name: Baloise Holding AG
Company Ticker: BALN SW Equity
Date: 2011-08-30

FINAL

Could you maybe give us some indication in terms of the net notional exposure that you
currently have?
Also, considering that you have lost close to CHF200 million from the FX exposure that
you have unhedged, are you taking any further consequences, apart from the hedging? In
other words, it seems like shareholders have been losing money for quite some time. It's
quite signiﬁcant. So maybe it might be a good idea to take some other consequences as
well.
Secondly, on duration, I seem to remember that your duration gap had been around two
to three years. Now that interest rates seem set to remain low for some time, also in
connection, obviously, with where the Swiss franc is trading with these other currencies,
are you looking to reduce this gap further or are you happy with the current gap? And
maybe if you could just provide us an update where the actual gap is currently.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

I will hand you over to Martin Wenk who will answer.

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, I can give you precise information regarding the hedge ratio. We increased that
from 85% to 95%. The reason is that we have a sound hedging practice in place that we
follow. And we followed that in the ﬁrst half and we followed that in the second half. And
due to the high volatility we had in July and August, we increased that to this 95%.
But the fact is that the hedge ratio, basically, is determined by the risk capacity of every
single unit we have. So if I give you that average, that means that it can be very diﬀerent
from one unit to another. But, as I said, the risk capacity is really the determining factor of
the hedge ratio.
Then you can say that --

Q - Michael Klien

{BIO 4262408 <GO>}

Let me come back on that. So currently you have got a hedge that is still not complete. So
you're, in essence, allocating risk capital to FX moves. And I guess underlying, since you
have not completely hedged it, this means you expect the Swiss franc to weaken versus
the euro. Is that right?

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

I certainly will not take the lowest levels to determine the ForEx strategy we have. We are
going for a long-term view and, in this view, it will have to come back, to a certain extent,
from the all-time lows in July. That's one thing.
On the other hand, don't forget what we are talking about now is purely this FX exposure
of the Swiss companies regarding the investments. We do have FX exposure also from

Page 15 of 27

FINAL

translation eﬀects, from commissions that are lower and so on. And there a hedge is
almost impossible because you just pay for it with the interest rate diﬀerential.
So we have those two legs[ph]. And for the Swiss investments in foreign currency bonds,
we do have this ﬁxed hedge program in place. While as for the coupon payments and for
the dividend payments from our subsidiaries, we do not have a hedge in place because,
on the long term, that takes you much more from your strengths if you always have to pay
the interest rate diﬀerential.
And regarding the ﬁgures, the gross impact on our result in the ﬁrst half was CHF60
million. That's for total --

Q - Michael Klien

{BIO 4262408 <GO>}

(multiple speakers) the comprehensive income that you have a further, I think, CHF140
million and the P&L impact was CHF60 million. So total of roughly about CHF200 million,
which I thought is quite costly to have this mismatch.

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. On the other hand, I don't think it's really fair to add the two together because if you
take the translation eﬀects of, let's say, the income we have out of foreign currency bonds
that are dedicated to our foreign exposure. So if you have a German Life insurance, you
have the exposure in euro, you have investments in euro and just by the translation at a
certain point in time, namely June 30, this is less; but we still have the liabilities against
that that you don't see in that ﬁgure. So you have to think about that as well.
Regarding the duration, we are still continuing our eﬀorts to close that gap. We have done
that to a certain extent in the ﬁrst half of this year by 0.2 years. But we don't do that at any
cost and certainly at those levels we are seeing now, I don't deem it really a good time to
continue that. And we have the strength and the risk capacity to wait for better times. And
we will do that and we will proﬁt if interest rates will come back to a normal level, which is
low, which will remain low.
That's our view. I don't say they go up fast. But I mean the 90 basis points in Switzerland
have been driven by really extraordinary facts and, to a certain extent, we see now coming
back and probably we will see some more.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Just wanted to run through the one oﬀs in the ﬁrst half, because I just want to make sure
that I don't repeat them in the second half. Could you maybe explain the level of EBIT?
What was in there for integration costs maybe as a ﬁgure? Also, how much was the FX
impact in terms of EBIT? I know there's a gross amount of CHF60 million. But I'm never
quite sure how much belongs to policyholders. And then anything else which came in. So
I can have a rough idea of what I can roll forward.
And then the second thing, on Solvency. And I suppose that's asking Fabrizio Croce's
question maybe another way round, can you give us a feel for what's happening on the
Swiss Solvency test front? You alluded to it, saying MCEV-based models are not brilliant
when interest rates are falling. But I've -- I didn't look it up. So I've forgotten your
sensitivity to this stuﬀ. But maybe you can give us a little bit of a feel. That would be really
helpful.
And then the ﬁnal point is, if you were to impair Greece. And I know haven't and you've
got good reasons. So that's ﬁne. But if you were, I estimate a number of CHF14 million at
the EBIT level. Is that about right? Thanks a lot.

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you, Mr. Huttner for your three questions. I will hand you over to German Egloﬀ.

FINAL

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

For the integration cost, that is not quite easy to diﬀerentiate all that. I would say you
could consider it's about 1 combined ratio point in Nonlife; that's about the ﬁgure. But
part of it is really in costs. And part of it might be -- or integration eﬀect, part of it might be
in claims as well, because you have claims handling reserves in a ﬁrst consolidation. And
they come in the claims' loads.
So it's quite -- because we did the ﬁrst consolidation and the merger of the two
companies at the same time, it's not quite easy to diﬀerentiate that. But that would -- I
would say about 1 combined ratio point is a fair assumption.
Now for the sensitivity of the SST, the situation there is that we have sent in our model at
the end of April. And we are in close contact with the regulator in Switzerland. There are
questions and answers and further requests and further answers. We think we will have a
feedback at the end of September; so therefore, it's probably too early to say something
there.

Bloomberg Transcript

You're right, it is MCEV based, the internal model. But, of course, there is a Nonlife model
as well, for the whole Group model. So therefore -- and that's probably -- wouldn't be fair
to give sensitivities on that as long as we don't really know what will be accepted and
what not.
Now, for the Greece impairment, you see there in the -- if you valuate the whole
Company, most of it is really already in the balance sheet. It's just the diﬀerence between
the available-for-sale bonds and the hold-to-maturity bonds that is not reﬂected yet. And
that are about CHF4 million. And if you then again look at the ﬁnance report, you see on
page 30 that we have about roughly CHF75 million unrealized losses on AFS bonds.
So the question is just really whether we bring them from the balance sheet through P&L.
So it's not changing the value of the Company. You -- your -- I'm not quite sure whether I
understood you right, your calculation ended up with CHF14 million, was that right?

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Yes, after taking policyholders.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well, that's probably a bit too optimistic because, again, on page 31, you see that 41% is in
Nonlife and 59% is in Life. And from the 59%, it's about -- 20% is legal quote[ph]
business. And the rest is non-legal quote business. So if you start with CHF75 million,
you're certainly ending up with a higher ﬁgure than CHF14 million.

there you have to make a fair assumption.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Right. But that -- I don't see CHF60 million on this slide, I see CHF21 million plus CHF78
million, which is CHF99 million.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

No, you see the CHF44 million. You see the CHF44 million. And the additional diﬀerence
comes from impairments on shares, which were created by euro movements and from
translation eﬀects. So I would say the diﬀerence between CHF44 million and the CHF60
million is probably net -- you can assume to have them net before taxes and after
policyholders.

Then secondly, following on your comments on duration, I think, re Huttner's question on

questions.

Here we see quite a stable development. We don't market an extraordinary
aggressiveness. And this has changed. This was diﬀerent three or four years ago when
certainly the big groups tried to lower price to gain market share. That has stopped, since
especially the big groups now follow very strict the policy proﬁt before growth. And that
helps the Swiss market a lot.
And you can see the combined ratio performance of our business and of our competitors.
You see that you have a very healthy environment, combined ratio fund-wise, in
Switzerland. And I expected this, from a pricing perspective, to remain stable, either -- or
to add -- there might be a chance to further improve, since what happens now is that in
some areas, we see an increase of frequency.
This is all the businesses that are related to the economic development of the country. For
instance, the Group Health products are related to the development of the economy. And
here we see -- as expected, we see an increase on frequency. And that oﬀers. And already
has oﬀered, the opportunity to increase prices in this business.
So pricing environment, put all this together, remains stable at a very good level in
Switzerland.
Maybe now the SST question, German?

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well, it was actually an MCEV question. The best I can oﬀer is really since the end of the
year because we're not -- we have not done a full-ﬂedged MCEV. At least, we don't
disclose it for half year. So, therefore, there is no new sensitivity; it's just new business
calculated for the half year. So therefore, that's the best I can oﬀer.

Q - Jochen Schmitt

{BIO 4227302 <GO>}

I have two questions, if I may. Firstly, on your real estate portfolio, net rental yield looks
relatively high to me. So how does your portfolio valuation compare to recent transactionbased multiples? Or, to ask the question a slightly diﬀerent way, can we assume that you
carry hidden reserves on your real estate holdings, compared to recent transactions?
And secondly, very quickly, it might be a bit early at this stage. But could you provide an
update for your dividend policy for ﬁscal 2011? Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Schmitt. I will hand you over for the ﬁrst question to Martin Wenk and the
second I will answer.

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Our real estate valuation is based on a discounted cash ﬂow model that we apply that is
commonly used in the industry. And that one is checked on a regular basis by external
estimations of our portfolio.
We do that on a rolling basis. So that after four years, basically, all the holdings are
estimated by an outside ﬁrm and we do have to submit that also to the authorities. And
those comparisons show since a long time that there is no big diﬀerence between our
DCF model and the valuations from the outside ﬁrms.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Okay, now on the dividend policy. Mr. Schmitt, in the past you have seen that Baloise has
paid very attractive dividends and we regard this as being at the core of our business
model. We want to be regarded as a company that really has an attractive dividend yield
for our investors; have done so in the past and will do so in the future.
This is -- our ability to really have attractive dividends and have high payout ratios is very
much linked to two facts. First of all, the operational strength of our Company. And you
might have seen some key performance indicators; for instance, the very good combined
ratio development. You have seen the strength of the Life business, you have seen the
strength of the Banking business. So this all supports strong cash ﬂow that's available for
dividend payment.
At the same time, we have a very strong balance sheet; you have seen the Solvency I
ﬁgure of about 227%. Based on this SST model we handed in. And it's not really accepted

Page 21 of 27



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG

by FINMA for the time being. But if you just take this model that we use as an internal
model, we are in the green, looking at the SST level.

FINAL

So, going forward, we will oﬀer an attractive dividend yield for our customers. The exact
amount, that will be determined when the year has closed. And will then be determined
by the supervisory board. So it's too early to give concrete ﬁgures. But the attractiveness
will remain.

One question on the combined ratio; it's a bit detailed. It relates to the large losses. And
it's just a question of clariﬁcation. If I look at the just reported numbers on slide 9. And
they are the numbers relating to the ﬁrst half 2010, you say that large claims above CHF4
million represented 2% of net premiums earned. In other words, 2percentage points on
the combined ratio. And if I look at the same disclosure last year, i.e., as made in 1H '10,
there you report on slide nine that large claims over CHF4 million represented 3.5%.
Now, this may appear like a question of detail. And clearly it is. But it aﬀects the
underlying loss ratio and I was just wondering whether we are comparing like with like, or
whether there was some restatement made in this set of results.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

There was a mistake last year in the chart. And it was quite simple. There were large losses
from previous periods and we had a double count in it, in large losses and in premium
prior-year loss development. So that was the reason. And we have taken that out now.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

So, in other words, what we ﬁnd here, in 1H '10 --

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Is the proper statement.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

That's correct. Cool. But it only aﬀected really large claims and the underlying loss ratio. It
didn't aﬀect --

Page 22 of 27



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG

Exactly. So that's why we didn't really say it's a restatement because the ﬁgures, at the end
of the day, were the same. But in the chart, it was a double count.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay, that's brilliant. That's perfect. That explains that.
And then also, if I look at slide 35, this question now relates to the new business value.
And actually I need to ﬁnd it ﬁrst before I ask my question. Slide 35, I see the value for
new business in Switzerland, in particular, increased very materially indeed. Would you
just be able to give us some color what was driving that particular increase?
I see that you initiated the sale of new products in Switzerland. And you mention a new
suite of products with guarantees. Perhaps you would be able to explain how much that
new product initiative contributed to that material increase. But also how much of that
increase is due to macro factors.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well that was all important. But the most important thing was since this is a 12-month
comparison, the most important thing is the interest rate movement, really. That makes a
lot of diﬀerence. And then, of course, eﬃciency gains as well. But I would say 50% of it is
the macros and the rest is product mix, eﬃciency and so on.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

So you would -- if you were to report this number now, about 50% of that improvement
would be eroded by the macro development which we have seen since the reporting
date. Or well we don't need to quantify this. But --

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

I know what you mean. Yes, 50% is probably too high. We will see at the end of the year.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

It would go down if we were to report it now. And then, of course, who knows when
interest rates are going to go up.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

That's right.

FINAL

So my ﬁrst question is on integration costs. You reported on slide nine that you have some
integration measures in Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium. Now my question is,
following the acquisition of Nateus, can we expect further integration costs in H2 or then
in 2012?
And my next question is on slide 20. It's the Group Life business, Switzerland. And we
have seen from most of your competitors quite a healthy growth in single premiums. Now,
I can see that your premium income in Switzerland, it's more or less stable. So I was
wondering what was the development of single premium income in Group Life business,
Switzerland?
And then just a last question on insurance accounting. If I go to the half-year report 2011
on page 24, in the Life business on the expense, one line says result from ﬁnancial
contracts. And there we have a huge swing there from minus CHF16 million in 2010 to
plus CHF141 million in 2011. I was just wondering if you can explain that to me in more

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Mr. Locher. I will answer the ﬁrst two questions. And then the question on the
ﬁnancial ﬁgures will be answered by German Egloﬀ.
First of all, integration costs. On slide 9, we disclosed that around, in the Nonlife part,
1percentage point of the combined ratio is associated to either the unwinding or the
integration eﬀorts, be it in Germany or in Belgium.
Going forward, we expect the closing of Nateus in the near future. And, obviously, there
will be integration eﬀorts on the costs side by Nateus. It takes some eﬀort to integrate an
acquired company into your platform. And you will see this, I think, in the second half of
'11 and the ﬁrst half of '12, as we see it now for Avero and the situation in Germany.
Now, second question was single premiums in Group Life. We have a decline here of
about 5%, half year, half year. And the reason is we re-focused a strategy arbit[ph], a
strategy a bit in Group Life business where we say, okay, to increase the value of new
business, we are more selective taking new business on board. And you see that we have
grown strongly in the annual premiums; 7.7%, this is very high. And this is actually what we
are aiming for, since we have very, very decent margins here in the annual business that
also includes a risk component in the Group Life business.
And for the single premiums, we didn't really go for big growth here, given the margins
right now. We could have grown much stronger; you've seen market development, we
have seen extraordinary ﬁgures. Actually we are quite happy with the level we have right
now. It might improve a bit in the second half, since there are many customers of ours
who want to increase their technical reserves. But we don't really try to -- we don't try to
attract it proactively, given the high level we have here already, the CHF15 million of the
single premiums.

And this translates itself. This is one component of the improvement of the new business
margin to have a much more selective approach in the Group Life business. This is also
true for the kind of companies we win as new customers. So we really increase value of
new business in the Group Life arena.

Now I'll hand you over to German --

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

Mr. Strobel, can I just -- a follow-up question, please. Just on this 1% you see, or your 4%
the mandatory part of the Group Life business. So in the non-mandatory part you're at
1.25%. Are you thinking about lowering the guaranteed rate or the rate in the nonmandatory part.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Right now we feel very comfortable with the 1.25%. We expect that the market will move in
this direction, given the interest environment. And I don't think that we -- that might not
change substantially going forwards.

I would say that depends on the mandatory part as well, because you certainly have to
compensate that and the decision there is not yet taken. If the mandatory part goes to the
level we actually think it should be, there is certainly no urge to punish the extra
mandatory part.

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

Thanks.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

And now, German, on the --

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

That's a technical one. The reason is actually the unit-linked business, because the whole
unit-linked business goes through the income statement and leaves the income statement
again.
So you have to -- those -- your line items, the result from ﬁnancial contracts, the minus
CHF15 million to CHF141 million is related actually to the realized capital gains and losses
on investments. And there you have the compensation.
You can, as well, refer to page 27. And there you see the realized gains and losses on
investments at own risk and at the risk of the insurance policyholders. And that makes the
swing, actually, because that runs through the income statement. So it has to be
compensated for it. That's the reason.

Michael Huttner, JPMorgan.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Just a quick question. You referred to one slide and said -- and I understood, probably
wrongly, that I would ﬁnd the ﬁgure of CHF44 million there. And I've looked for 20
minutes at this slide and I just wondered if you can help me. It's slide 15. And it's the FX
question. Where exactly do I see the ﬁgure of CHF44 million there?

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

CHF44 million. You can actually -- you see the ﬁxed income securities and other on the
Nonlife side and then of which FX impact is. And now if you take the diﬀerence between,
on the Nonlife part, minus CHF21 million and plus CHF5 million, you are on minus CHF16
million. And you do the same on the Life side and you add it and you end up with CHF44
million.
