Good day and welcome to Gjensidige Q1 2019 Results Presentation. Today's conference is
being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mitra Hagen
Negard, Head of IR. Please go ahead, ma'am.

Mitra Hagen Negard

{BIO 3974076 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the ﬁrst quarter presentation of
Gjensidige. My name is Mitra Negard, and I'm Head of Investor Relations. As always, we
will start with our CEO, Helge Leiro Baastad, who will go through the highlights of the
quarter, followed by our CFO, Jostein Amdal, who will go through the numbers in more
detail. And we have plenty of time for Q&A after the session. Helge, please.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Mitra. Good morning and welcome everyone. The ﬁrst quarter in 2019 was
characterized by more favorable weather conditions in Norway compared to the ﬁrst
quarter 2018, as well as the strong ﬁnancial markets driving a signiﬁcant improvement in
results.
Starting with a few comments on our ﬁrst quarter results on Page 2. We generated a proﬁt
before tax of just above NOK3 billion. This is including the gain of the sale of Gjensidige
Bank of NOK1.6 billion. The Group's underwriting result for the quarter amounted to

Date: 2019-04-25

NOK798 million corresponding to a combined ratio of 86.6%, signiﬁcantly better than the
same quarter last year.

FINAL

The improvements was mainly due to more favorable weather conditions in Norway
compared with the harsh ﬁrst quarter last year. Our operations outside Norway saw the
mixed picture with progress in underlying results in Denmark and Sweden while the
Baltics were impacted by demanding weather conditions in the ﬁrst quarter.
And our cost, strong cost discipline resulting in a decline in the cost ratio. The strong
development in the capital markets during the quarter drove returns of NOK682 million
on our investment portfolio. Annualized return on equity at 49.6% was signiﬁcantly
impacted by the gain on the sale of the bank. Adjusted for the transaction, the return was
21.6%. Jostein will afterwards revert with more detailed comments on the results.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then turning to Page 3, I would like to elaborate on the operational status in a few key
areas. I will start with our motor insurance line in Norway. We have increased prices to
counter increased claims inﬂation as discussed earlier. And we believe the other players
face similar claims inﬂation and will continue to act accordingly. Our disciplined and
focused eﬀorts have proven eﬀective. With yet another promising quarter behind us, we
now see that we have reached the turning point for proﬁtability and we expect to see
lower underlying loss ratio for this insurance line from the second quarter.
We aim at gradually improving further from what's already a good proﬁtability level,
although we don't expect to return to historical peak levels. We are not surprised to see
lower new sales coupled with slightly higher churn. This is a natural consequence of our
signiﬁcant price increases and the expected initial impact from the announced
termination of the NITO partner agreement eﬀective from the 1st of January.
We had been prepared for this as we have had a clear priority to improve proﬁtability.
Most of the customers we lose are the least attractive ones, meaning the overall portfolio
quality is gradually improving. Our retention numbers for the private segment, although
slightly down from the last quarter are still at very high levels. The upcoming payment or
customer dividend from the Gjensidige foundation will continue to serve as a strong
retention tool and we are convinced that our attractive product oﬀering will continue to
secure our strong position in the Norwegian market. We have a superior brand with the
highest brand recognition among the insurance companies in Norway.
Thanks to eﬀective adjustments of terms, including the bonus program, we see a
somewhat lower increase in risk premium currently expected at 45% going forward.
Competition is ﬁerce and we need to take that into account in our action, ensuring an
optimal balance between proﬁtability improvements and volume. We will continue with
diﬀerentiated and analytical price increases beyond expected claims inﬂation.
We are very encouraged by the development for our commercial lines in Norway too,
where we have put through signiﬁcant price increases and seen solid renewals proving
our strong position. We have a high quality portfolio with the majority consisting of SME
customers, where the reactions -- relations are driven through direct channels.

FINAL

Our operations outside Norway are progressing according to plan and we are conﬁdent
in our ambition of an underwriting result of NOK750 million, ex run-oﬀ from these
operations in 2022. We will continue implementing proﬁt enhancing measures, improving
our cost structure and increasing eﬃciency. We need to strengthen our position in these
markets and increase customer loyalty. And we are getting ready to take part in the
market growth, both organically and through acquisitions, given the right targets at the
right price.
Then, turning to Page 4. We have now completed the sale of Gjensidige Bank to Nordea
laying the ground for enhanced focus on our core operations and with proceeds of
NOK5.6 billion providing us with increased ﬁnancial ﬂexibility. We have kicked oﬀ
collaboration with Nordea targeting a broad customer base in Norway. With limited
customer overlap, we see a signiﬁcant sales potential for both parties.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are very encouraged by the strong start to this partnership based on two strong
brands and compatible cultures. Together, we will strengthen our presence in key
customer processes and approach our customers with relevant, broad and attractive
product oﬀerings. Both Nordea and we have strong digital ambitions and we will work
towards providing seamless integrated digital solutions for our customers. Our
organizations have prepared well for this journey. The mandates are clear, ensuring
eﬀective execution. We have clear referral procedures and we are also in the process of
implementing co-locations at selected sites.
Then turning to Page 5, a few words on our operational targets, which we announced late
last year. Customer satisfaction is core to our business and we are very pleased to be at
such a high level. This is also reﬂected in our strong retention ﬁgures in Norway and
several measures shall lift our retention numbers outside Norway overtime.
We are also focusing on enhancing sales eﬀectiveness. Much of this is related to
increasing digital interaction with our customers. It is all about simpliﬁcation. As an
example, we have recently launched a digital sale solution for pension plans for
commercial customers enabling both oﬀering and signing on our digital platform.
Automation of tariﬀs is an important catalyst for improved eﬃciency and proﬁtability. Our
aim is full automation of all relevant tariﬀs by 2022. Initially, we have focused on high
frequency products such as health insurance and we are now working on motor.
We stand at around 3% currently, and we'll continue to include more product lines going
forward. We strive to continuously improve our tools and introduce features, which will
motivate our customers to use the digital solutions for claims reporting as well. So far,
64% of claims in Norway are reported online. We have recently broadened our solutions
to includes children's insurance, accident and disability, completing the range of personal
line insurances.
Our ambitions don't stop at the reporting process, but rather extend into straight-through
claims processing. So far we have reached almost 14% of all claims in Norway. Eﬀorts are
underway to increase automation further. We are working to reduce claims cost, in short

Page 3 of 16

through use of technology in combination with analytical insight. We will be reporting on
this on an annual basis.

FINAL

And we have an ambition to reduce our own and claims related carbon intensity. We are
in the process of ﬁnalizing the method for establishing zero point for CO2 emissions and
we'll report status on an annual basis. And we are very encouraged by once again ranking
number one in the ﬁnancial sector in Norway in the sustainable brand index study.
So with that, I will leave the words to Jostein to present the ﬁrst quarter results in more
detail.

Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Thank you, Helge. And good morning everybody. I will start on Page 7. We delivered a
proﬁt before tax of NOK3 billion in the ﬁrst quarter. This result includes the gain on the
sale of Gjensidige Bank of NOK1.6 billion. But even adjusted for this, our results are
considerably higher than in Q1 last year, driven by both our underwriting business and
investment activities.

Bloomberg Transcript

The underwriting result improved due to a decline in underlying frequency loss ratio and
lower large losses, and more favorable weather conditions in Norway being the main
driver for this. I'm particularly satisﬁed with the development in the commercial segment,
proving our strong position and pricing power in Norway. Results from the investment
activities reﬂected the rebound in the capital markets. Our pension business saw yet
another strong quarter with a signiﬁcant increase in earnings compared with Q1 '18.
Turning to Page 8. Earned premiums were up 1.2% or 1.3% if you adjust for currency
eﬀects. We continued putting through signiﬁcant price increases in Norway, in particular
for motor and property and larger accounts in the commercial segment. The latter is
evident in the 8.6% premium increase for the commercial segment while increase from
the private insurance portfolio was, as Helge mentioned, somewhat dampened by lower
new sales and higher churn.
We have signiﬁcant ambitions for operations outside of Norway. The development in
premiums for Denmark, Sweden and the Baltics reﬂect the considerable pricing measures
we are putting through in these markets to improve the portfolio quality. In addition, in
Sweden, one large and proﬁtable account was terminated, and still [ph] for 2.4
percentage points of the fall in premium volume. Our eﬀorts are proving eﬀective
enabling a gradual shift in our focus towards growth in particular for the Baltics.
Now turning over to Page 9. The loss ratio decreased by 6 percentage points to 71.7,
primarily due to the improvement in the underlying frequency loss ratio and lower large
losses. The harsh weather conditions in Norway in Q1 last year drove up losses for motor
and property. With more favorable weather this year, we saw losses coming down.
Underlying proﬁtability for motor in Norway, adjusted for weather eﬀects, was lower yearon-year, reﬂecting the deteriorating trend seen throughout 2018.

FINAL

As Helge mentioned, we reached a turning point for the 12-month rolling underlying loss
ratio in Q1. Having reached this point, we expect proﬁtability for this insurance line to
gradually improve from the second quarter.
Underlying proﬁtability for private property in Norway, adjusted for weather eﬀects in
2018, was also lower year-on-year. We also recorded lower frequency loss ratios in
Denmark and Sweden. Less favorable weather conditions drove underlying frequency
loss ratio up in the Baltics.
Now, let's turn to Page 10. We recorded NOK882 million in operating expenses in the
quarter, corresponding to cost ratio of 14.9% and 14.1%, excluding the Baltics. Both were
down 0.4 percentage points from Q1 last year. The improvement is a result of continued
cost discipline across the whole group and our focus on simpliﬁcation of processes,
automation of internal operations and further digitization.

Bloomberg Transcript

We started the process of developing and conﬁguring the new core IT system this quarter,
starting with Denmark. As mentioned earlier, the investment is expected to be handled
within the current cost ratio rate target and will be made step-by-step, starting with
Denmark, then Sweden and ﬁnally Norway.
A few comments on our pension operation on Slide 11. The strong momentum for our
pension business continued into the ﬁrst quarter. The pretax proﬁt came in -- came to
NOK53 million and annualized return on equity rose to 20.6%. The rise in proﬁt from Q1
last year reﬂects growth in our customer base, strong operational performance and an
increase in assets under management. Results are positively impacted by gains from
divestments of loan receivables. Assets under management amounted to NOK34 billion
at the end of the quarter. Prior [ph] and last year as much as 70% of the customers in our
pension business were general insurance customers as well.
Moving on to the investment portfolio on Page 12. The investment portfolio yielded a
return of 1.2% in the quarter, reﬂecting the signiﬁcant rebound in the capital markets. The
total investment portfolio amounted to NOK60 billion at the end of the quarter, including
proceeds from the sale of Gjensidige Bank, which were added to the free portfolio during
the quarter. The Match portfolio yielded a positive return of 0.7% on a portfolio of
NOK33.8 billion. A large part of the Match portfolio consists of bonds at amortized cost,
which yielded a return of 0.9%. The running yield in this portfolio was 3.7% at the end of
the quarter and the average reinvestment rate for the quarter was close to 3.6%.
Unrealized excess value amounted to approximately NOK0.9 billion.
The free portfolio, which amounts to NOK26 billion yielded a return of 2.1% in the quarter.
The strong development in the equity markets and lower interest rates and credit spreads
were the main drivers of the positive returns. The proceeds from the sale of Gjensidige
Bank is in our free portfolio. As a reminder, please note the payment of dividends in April
and taxes during the current quarter, all else equal, reducing the size of the investment
portfolio by approximately NOK4.5 billion.

Looking at our capital position on Page 13. Our capital position is very strong. The
approved internal model gives a solvency margin of 248%, up from 169% last quarter,
while our own partial internal model gives a solvency margin of 295%. The increase in the
solvency margins are mainly the result of the sale of Gjensidige Bank. Retained earnings
also contributed positively. Market risk is up from the last quarter following the investment
of proceeds from the sale of the bank. Capital requirement for life insurance is also
slightly up as a result of growth in the unit-linked portfolio. There have been only minor
changes in the capital requirement from the life and health underwriting risk.
The solvency margins are all well above our target range of 135% to 200%. As announced
earlier, we will give ourselves some time to explore diﬀerent M&A opportunities. Hence,
we do not plan for any -- paying out any special dividends during 2019. We are ﬁrmly
committed to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders.
I'll then hand over back to Helge.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Jostein. Then to sum up on Page 14. The ﬁrst quarter of 2019 was characterized
by more favorable weather conditions in Norway and strong ﬁnancial markets, resulting in
a signiﬁcant improvements in our results. The sale of Gjensidige Bank generated
signiﬁcant proceeds as well as gain of NOK1.6 billion booked in the quarter. We
continued to put through signiﬁcant price increases across all segments, which, together
with reunderwriting and eﬃciency measures are intended to improve underlying
proﬁtability. We are particularly pleased with the development in the commercial
segment, reﬂecting a signiﬁcantly harder market.
We are very pleased to see that proﬁtability adjusted for weather eﬀects of the motor
insurance line in Norway reached a turning point during the quarter, paving the way for a
lower underwriting loss ratio for this insurance line from the second quarter. Our
collaboration with Nordea is oﬀ to a strong start and we look forward to continue this
partner to secure strong customer retention and drive further growth. We are strongly
committed to increase proﬁts from our operations outside Norway expecting the results
to become increasingly evident towards 2022 as we implement measures targeting both
the top lines and operational eﬃciency.
And ﬁnally, with the proceeds from the bank on our books, we are well-positioned to act
upon potential attractive growth opportunities.
I will then open up for the Q&A session. Thank you.

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We'll now take our ﬁrst question from Jonny Urwin of
UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me, please. So ﬁrstly,
should we interpret that the ongoing portfolio actions in Sweden and Denmark in
particular are to set you on track for the underwriting proﬁt target of NOK750 million ex
Norway? Or will M&A be needed? I guess, just optically, it's quite a signiﬁcant premium
reduction in Sweden on what is already a small business. So I'm just wondering, how
you're thinking about the NOK750 million, and how you get there organically?
And secondly, at the Investor Day, I think automated tariﬀs were presented as one of the
main mechanisms to price more dynamically and to ensure that you stay ahead of claims
inﬂation with pricing. Now the disclosure today shows 2.7% of tariﬀs are automated. But I
guess it's a bit lower than we had expected to see. So I just wonder what's the timeline
from here. And so you've got those automated tariﬀs, are you conﬁdent you can stay
ahead of claims inﬂation trends with prices? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Thank you, Jonny. On the NOK750 million, what we are seeing the eﬀects of in Sweden
especially, but also to a certain degree in Denmark, are re-pricing that we are doing to
improve the portfolio quality. That means, we do see some churn, and as I speciﬁcally
mentioned, there is one contract in Sweden, which was terminated by us. We need to get
the proﬁtability level up and then catch up with the market growth and the NOK750
million in 2022 should be reached without any M&A activities.
Secondly, on the automated tariﬀs, we are working with a much larger base of tariﬀs than
the 2.7 that is -- that's what's already, kind of, ﬁnished. So this will -- the amount of tariﬀs
that are being through this full automated process will increase quite fast as we go
through. What's the main purpose or the main beneﬁt of having automated tariﬀs is that
you are able to react quicker and that you are freeing up analyst time to work on their
qualitative side, so we kind of reduce the time spent on later payment [ph] and so on. We
are able to capture inﬂation dynamics in the -- on the claim side already. It's just that we
kind of get more eﬃcient when we have these automated tariﬀs in place.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

A - Jostein Amdal

We will now take our next question from Blair Stewart of Bank of America. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions from me. You talked
earlier, I think, Helge, about not expecting to return to peak underwriting proﬁt levels in
Norway. Could you just expand on that? My impression was that you were getting price
increases above the rate of inﬂation. So just wonder what you meant by that comment.
Secondly, why is it that you're seeing churn in the private segment, but not in
commercial? Is that just a reﬂection of being a hard market in commercial and somewhat
less harder or maybe even a softer market in private? And then just coming back to the
Nordic region. You're talking about improving proﬁtability, improving customer retention
and growing the top line. These things are seldom done in conjunction with each other,
you tend to get one or the other. So I just wonder again, how you're going to expand and
how you expect to achieve all of that in the Nordic region?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Thank you, Blair. Jostein will give some further comments on the Nordic situation.
As you know, we presented the target of year end 2022 just before Christmas and we will
come back with more detail regarding the journey towards 2022. What we said in
connection with the new targets, it will be back-end-loaded. So -- but Jostein will
comment that, and also the situation in commercial versus private.
When it comes to my comments during my presentation regarding not reaching the peak
levels, we have to remind ourselves that we have had very benign winters. So what we
expect, when we're talking about not coming back to that type of peak levels is more
normalized situation regarding weather going forward. If we have winters like '14, '15 it
could be diﬀerent. But when I commented that it's more on taking into consideration that
we will have more normal winter conditions going forward.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Yeah, that's clear. Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

On the second one, the churn in private versus commercial or the diﬀerence in churn.
Starting on the positive side, and for ones on the commercial side. I think you're right, it's
a hardening market there. We have seen competitors struggling more with proﬁtability
than we have done in the commercial market for some time, including the one that's
already reported and this proﬁtability issues paved the way for rate increases. We've been
extremely disciplined in the 1/1 [ph] renewal, which is extremely important in the
commercial market, something like 40% of the portfolio actually renews January 1st and
have been able to book [ph] just announced price increases, but also get them through
into our earned premiums and that really started with the contracts that renewed in the
fourth quarter of last year. So it's this eﬀect -- its a hard market and we have been
extremely disciplined in putting that through and the market has allowed us to do that
Page 8 of 16

Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2019-04-25

FINAL

without any increase in churn, actually without any, in fact, a better churn situation than
last year.
On the private side, as you see, the situation is slightly diﬀerent for us and we have lost
both number of cars and houses at the insurance. And this is, as we've been clear on for a
long time, has been a clear priority for us. We are prioritizing proﬁts ahead of volume.
And -- but added to that a couple of comments on the large partner organization of NITO
(inaudible) organization, which we lost in 2018 with eﬀect from January 1st this year. There
was one part of that portfolio, which we have previously announced, which were a
qualitative agreement, which kind of went in one bank at January 1st. And then, of course,
Tryg, which won the contract have started setting as hard as they can on the lowest
hanging fruits of that membership list. And they have been somewhat successful there,
but not anything more than we had expected from beginning. So I think that's the main
reason behind the development within the -- for the private churn.
On the third question, top line versus proﬁtability in Nordics. No it's hard -- it's hard to
grow top line and improve on the proﬁtability measures at the same time. And we are
now raising prices, moving towards a more lean cost side, and doing that ﬁrst before we
do the growth side, that's what you see in the ﬁgures. And going back to the previous
question from UBS, it's -- we are going to deliver NOK750 million in 2022 without any
M&A activities and such. We have done number of measures in place to improve
proﬁtability outside of Norway, and then Sweden and Denmark speciﬁcally, including a
new core system, which we have talked about earlier.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
We'll now take our next question from Johan Strom of Carnegie. Please go ahead.

Q - Johan Strom

{BIO 17541253 <GO>}

Yes. Two questions from me as well. Just, I'd like to follow-up on the comments on the
private segment. Can you quantify the eﬀects from the loss of the NITO contract? For
example, the volume last year, you had a few comments there. But some more further
detail will be interesting. And then also, how do you expect the growth in this segment to
develop during the rest of the year if you balance out the eﬀects of price increases in
churn? That was my ﬁrst question.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Okay. I will quantify. But the one qualitative agreement that we are talking about is
NOK120 million. And the rest is Tryg now being the insurance partner of NITO going -and with the access to their kind of membership list [ph] [00:29:44] being able to sell to
each and every member and these are all customers that have typically been with
Gjensidige for a long time and are on average extremely satisﬁed with their relationship
with Gjensidige. So they need to do the hard work and sell to each and every customer. I
Page 9 of 16



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2019-04-25

won't really predict on what's going to happen during the year, but this -- the one-time
eﬀect of NOK120 million is kind of behind us. And then it's the gradual selling from Tryg
on these members.

FINAL

And can you please, repeat the second part of the question, Johan?

Q - Johan Strom

{BIO 17541253 <GO>}

Yeah, for the rest of the year, can you guide us a little bit on your expectations on the
premiums growth for the private segment, when you balance out the eﬀects of price
increases there and the expected churn? I mean, the 1% is signiﬁcantly lower than what we
saw in Q4 and we had the NITO eﬀects, but for the full year, what can we expect from the
private segment?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I don't think I'll want to be precise on that, but I will say that price measures that we have
in place, include pricing on average above the claims expectations, both for private cars
and property.

Q - Johan Strom

{BIO 17541253 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, thank you. And then ﬁnally on the year-over-year improvement of the underwriting
result in motor and property, where are we now in terms of repricing? How far away are
you from say, getting close to the full eﬀect of the portfolio repricing? And when can we
expect that to happen? Is it two years from the beginning of 2018? And are we 50%
through? Or have you done more now?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I don't think I will give you a precise percentage. But as you say, it's -- correctly, it's -- we
started the kind of repricing according to what was (inaudible) [00:31:41] claims
expectation of 5% to 6% in the beginning of 2018. In 2017, we had a slightly lower claims
inﬂation expectation or risk premium increase expectation and we now reduced that
somewhat again to 4% to 5%. And it takes kind of 24 months from the ﬁrst price increase
is announced to everything is repriced in the accounts. And we're now 15 months into that
period, so we're lot more than halfway. If that was fair enough.

Q - Johan Strom

Okay. Thank you.

FINAL

Many thanks. It's Kevin Ryan of Bloomberg Intelligence. I just have one quick question. It
strikes me that you have some historically very good returns at Group level. And I was just
curious as to how this colors your view, when you're on the acquisition trail, which you
now are. It seems to me that anything you buy, you're going to have to work pretty hard to
be accretive. So a little more background on your thoughts on your targets would be very
gratefully received. Just to understand a little bit more about your approach. Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Okay. We are looking for new business within our deﬁned markets, Scandinavian, Baltic
non-life insurance, primarily within private and SME commercial lines of business. As you
were seeing, almost all our acquisitions so far, we're looking at kind of a cost of equity at
7.5% after tax. That's kind of as an after total and then we need to create value above that
cost of equity hurdle. In addition, we are trying to integrate new business over a certain
time period to get to kind of into the Gjensidige way of doing things into our brand
preferably, if we can. And yeah, so it's -- and bear in mind also it's kind of ﬂip [ph] back all
our positions outside of Norway is actually a result of acquisition, so we wouldn't have
anything if it weren't for these previous acquisitions done.

Q - Kevin Ryan

{BIO 1814771 <GO>}

Great. Thank you. So you're looking at a hurdle of at least 7.5% for any deal, is that right?

A - Jostein Amdal

We will now take our next question from Jan Erik of ABG. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Jan Erik Gjerland from ABG. I have a couple of questions. The ﬁrst one is on the A, B, C, D
clients. Could you elaborate on how many of those A, B, C and D clients is sort of losing
both private and commercial might look like you have a very strong hurdle rate in the
commercial side. So I just wonder how you're looking at the diﬀerent kind of A, B, C, D
clients in both private and commercial? And how it -- your client loss and gain has been at
least so far?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

This is mainly a topic for the private side this -- the one we show on the page -- I don't
quite remember, three, in the presentation. And this -- these customer scores are based
on the perceived proﬁtability and size of these customers and where customers having a

lower score receive potentially a higher price increase, because they're kind of hurt less of
losing and that's where you'll also see that we managed to keep those which are rated
higher by us. And this works. Churn is much higher among the ones we perceive as less
proﬁtable. Not [ph] quite know-how speciﬁc I can be in your question Jan Erik more than
that.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. On the commercial side then, if you saw that you have been able to reprice both
the best clients and the weak clients equally high or is it so that you have taken the weaker
clients even higher? Or could you just give a ﬂavor on the commercial side as well,
please?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yes. On the commercial side, as Jostein said, we have increased prices for all kind of
customers. We had better churn situation this ﬁrst quarter compared to last year, and I
haven't been in a situation like this for, I would say, more than 10 years. So it's a
completely diﬀerent situation compared to the last few years. I think it's a combination of
very benign winters also aﬀecting the commercial businesses. It has been softer market
for some years. And now we are in a complete diﬀerent situation actually. So we are really
satisﬁed.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay, very good. On the proﬁtability terms, when it comes to year-on-year growth on the
underlying side on motor and housing, you write in your report that it still was down yearon-year. Is it so that we should then -- is your comment on turning point being in the
second quarter is also about we should then expect the year-on-year to be higher or is it
just that we have ﬂattened out in Q2? Just to get a ﬂavor on what you're seeing.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

And ﬁrst, of course, as we write in the report, when we say, it's low risk because we take
out the weather eﬀects from last year without doing adjustments to this year's numbers,
we think that's the kind of the fair basis to measure a turning point. In absolute numbers,
it's of course, better than last year anyhow. That said, when we internally and I internally
look at what's the turning point, we take up seasonal eﬀects or look at 12-month rolling
ﬁgures, and say that during Q1 that turned 12-month rolling underlying loss ratios,
excluding weather eﬀects, and that turned down in Q1. That's kind of the basis for calling
it a turning point. And then, of course, these are slow-moving methods, so you won't see
a dramatic downshift in the underlying 12-month rolling loss ratio from one quarter to the
next, but the trend is now downwards from here. Not necessarily fast or much by quarterby-quarter, but it would be downwards.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay, perfect. And then on the weather, as you touched upon, is it possible to sort of,
isolate the underlying weather versus what you saw in your total underlying combined
ratio or claims ratio here, how much did weather -- was it much better, whether it's benign
this year than last year so to speak in your calculation.

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

FINAL

Measuring the weather eﬀect, it's as we talked about in the ﬁrst and second quarter last
year, isn't in precise size, it's not. It's based on estimates, it's not like a one single large
claim or one single natural perils [ph] event, which you kind of have a very deﬁned event
and you can see the loss. But based on our estimates, we called NOK250 million to
NOK300 million last -- ﬁrst quarter of last year in extraordinary weather eﬀects.
Q1 '19 is, I'd regard a fairly normal winter, average type. Actually the precipitation, the
amount of downpour were actually higher in ﬁrst quarter of 2019 and ﬁrst quarter of 2018,
somewhat 30% higher, but it came more as rain than a snow, so didn't get this snow
damage, the snow -- the rate of snow taking down roofs and so on. So it's in a way, a more
benign type of precipitation this year than last year. So on an average, it's kind of, zero
weather eﬀects this year because it's fairly normal. I don't have an estimate. Last year we
talked about NOK250 million to NOK300 million above a normal winter. And I'd add, I
think we gave a range because these are imprecise estimates.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Just ﬁnally then on the Nordea, you were -- yeah, sorry.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Just to comment on Jostein said, the rainfall and snow 30% higher this year compared to
last year, we have also seen that the Northern part of Norway, Western part of Norway
have been hitted harder this year compared to last year, and as you know, our strong part
historically is Eastern and Central part of Norway. So it's some geographical diﬀerences
from one year to another also Jan Erik.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Perfect. Last one on the Nordea. Is it so that we should expect you to sort of have start to
sell to your -- the Nordea clients? Or you already have some kind of premiums inside your
Q1 numbers? Or is it so that you just started the promises, so we should expect it to come
from the second quarter?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

We started in ﬁrst quarter and -- when in ﬁrst quarter?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

March 1st -- sorry -- March 3rd, really, oh my god.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah. 3rd of March. So it's, yeah, one third of the quarter.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

We don't see much earned premium, that's yet [ph].

We will now take our next question from Youdish Chicooree of Autonomous Research.
Please go ahead, your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. I've got three questions, please. The ﬁrst one is really on your
motor proﬁtability. I think you sound very conﬁdent of a turnaround starting next quarter.
So I was wondering whether that -- I mean, we should expect an improvement in the
underlying loss ratio for the entire Group as well, adjusting for the exceptional weather
from last year.
And secondly, on your solvency, I think your coverage is very strong under your own
partial internal model at 295. I was wondering whether you're still in discussion with the
regulator and when do you expect to resubmit that model for approval. And ﬁnally, just
more like a clariﬁcation, I think in your opening comments, you mentioned that we should
not expect special dividends for the year 2019. Is that correct?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Regarding dividend, we have just the same communication as we had last quarter. So as
you -- you can see our comments very precisely in the report. The two ﬁrst questions,
Jostein, turning point was in Q1 and proﬁtability or -- for the Group. And then this process
with FSA.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yeah, the turning point and what we talked about is motor -- private motor in Norway just
to be speciﬁc. We didn't talk about the motor book across all the geographies. It's
Norway and private. And we saw the turning point in Q1. So you should expect an
improvement as -- and as I answered on the previous question, it won't be dramatic, it
won't be extremely fast, but it will be in the right direction.

FINAL

On the second part, we are, maybe not say, continuous, but regular -- this talks with FSA
and as we talked about earlier, we got the model approved the ﬁrst time. We disagree on
certain important points in the calibration of the model and we will over time seek to
engage with FSA further on getting more parts of our own view through with them, but
that's also a fairly slow moving process.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. Just to clarify, I mean those important points, are they down to basically
ﬁrstly on underwriting as you used your own data, which there are certain aspects they're
are not happy with. And then also probably on the market risk side of things, is that down
to just the correlation factors, you're using or is there anything else we should be aware
of?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

There are a number of factors, the two most importants are correlation between the
market risk and underwriting risk, and the allowance of the use of storm [ph] models,
which we use commercial -- commercially available external storm models for estimating
the kind of the catastrophic capital requirement. That's the two most important points.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Understood. Sorry to go back on the second question, because I didn't quite catch
what you said in terms of the overall development for the Group, what your expectation
was for this year on the underlying loss ratio. I mean, if you could clarify that, that will be
very helpful.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

To be precise, I talked about the motor and all the turning point we talked about is
actually related to the motor portfolio in Norway. So it's not the -- it doesn't include
Sweden and Denmark. And I didn't give any -- I didn't say anything about the underlying
loss ratio expectations for the Group as a whole. That was intentional.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay, all right. That's it. Okay. All right. Thank you.
