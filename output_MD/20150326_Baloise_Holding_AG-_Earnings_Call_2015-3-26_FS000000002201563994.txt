Ladies and gentlemen, good morning or good afternoon depending where you're
attending from. Welcome to the Bâloise Group Annual Results 2014 Analysts Conference
Call. I'm Celina, the Chorus Call operator. I would like to remind you that all participants will
be in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation,
there will be a Q&A session. The conference must not be recorded for publication or
broadcast.
At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Mr. Martin Strobel, Group CEO. Please go
ahead, sir.

Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the analyst call of Bâloise annual
results 2014. We have changed the format of this presentation to better suit your needs.
This morning, we put on the Internet the video presentation of the 2014 results. In this
session now, I'd like to summarize the highlights of the annual results 2014 and,
afterwards, German Egloff, our CFO, Martin Wenk, our Chief Investment Officer, and I will
be ready to answer your questions.
Let's start with the key results for the year as shown on slide number five of our
presentation. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm delighted to report that Bâloise has posted an
excellent set of results for 2014. We earned the best profit in our history apart from the

record year of 2007. Our profit went up by around 57% to reach CHF 711 million. This
increase is attributable to significant operational improvements. Our strategy is paying off.
But the encouraging rise in profit is also the result of extraordinary items. For example, we
sold our company in Austria and disposed of the shareholdings in Nationale Suisse and
Helvetia as part of our consolidation strategy.
The impact of the operational improvements is particularly obvious in the life insurance
business whose profit contribution rose substantially. We optimized the product mix and
increased efficiency. What's more, we can bid on the strong level of gains on investments.
However, it must be noted that the gains on disposals were primarily reflected in our life
insurance segment.
The non-life sector once again proved to be a pillar of Bâloise's success. Thanks to our
strategy of continually improving our portfolio, we achieved an outstanding combined
ratio of 93.6%. This high margin in our non-life business ensures reliable substantial cash
flows. In challenging financial markets, we've achieved an investment yield of 4.1%. We
took advantage of our strong balance sheet to further increase our exposure to equities.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our growth in the target segments was stronger than before. The volume of business
rose by 5.3%. These key figures are a sign of Bâloise's sustained operational strength.
And so that our shareholders can benefit from this pleasing performance, the Board of
Directors will be asking the next Annual General Meeting to increase the dividend to CHF
5.
As part of our effort to actively manage our capital, we are starting a share buyback
program, under which we will purchase up to 2% of the share capital, in other words, up to
1 million shares. To further enhance Bâloise's operational strength, we are focusing on
generating growth in attractive business segments.
Our strategy of target capital management, coupled with our safety Safety World (04:03)
and further efficiency gains will enable us to boost our long-term profitability even more.
This will enable us to shrug off the headwinds that our sector and Bâloise, as a company,
currently face as a result of the strong Swiss franc and record low interest rates. We are
confident about our future level of income and will therefore be able to continue to
pursue a consistent and attractive dividend policy going forward.
That was a brief overview. Thank you for listening. And now is the chance for you to ask
questions.

Q&A
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Mr.
Peter Eliot from Berenberg. Please go ahead.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much and good morning. I had three questions, please. The first one was
on the buyback, which is very welcome. I think you put the – I guess the number was
slightly less than the disposal gains that you got. It may be that it's in line with the net
shareholder proceeds. I'm not too sure, but I was wondering perhaps if you could
comment on that and also on why you decided to spread it over two years? And perhaps
just to help clarify the timing there; I was wondering if you could talk about how much you
expect to do in each calendar year.
Second question was on life earnings. And I was wondering if you could give us an update
on the underlying earnings power of the division as you see it. And perhaps how that
depends on interest rate moves. I guess things have been complicated by the swaptions
in the past that you have in place. And I think before you said that you had good
protection down to sort of end 2012 level from the interest rate front, but obviously we're
a long way below that now. So, I guess an update would be very helpful.
And then perhaps just a third quick one, Belgium non-life, your combined ratio seems to
have been more 100% in both halves of the year. I know Ela was the reason in H1 and
some seasonality (06:23). I was wondering if you could perhaps give us a little bit more
detail on the H2, what happened there? Thank you very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Mr. Eliot for the question. I will hand you over for the first question to German
about the buyback. German?

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Yes. The buyback, well, actually to the terms and conditions, so the amount on the one
side and the period on the other side is just to give us as much flexibility as possible to
use market movements. It might, so there is no actual plan at the moment how much to
buy back in each year, but it might well be that we are done faster or it really depends on
the kind of margin movement.
That was a bit influenced as well by the movements we have seen as a consequence of
the decision of the Swiss national – central bank. And so, there you've seen a lot of
volatility in the market. And so, I think we should take our time to use market opportunities
there. That's mainly the reason.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Now, the life earnings, Mr. Eliot, you asked about what could you expect as the EBIT run
rate as – this is how I understood your question.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Yes. That's right.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

We gave the guidance, it's 200 plus, 200,000 plus, let's say between 200 and 250
(08:02). I think we can stick to this as the run rate, because on the one hand, as you might
also see from our improved disclosure here and this is thanks to Marc Kaiser. You see
there's a very sound risk result and we are working on improving this further. We have a
very stable savings result with a constant margin between recurring income and
guarantees of 70 basis points, and we expect this margin to remain constant also in the
future. And then you got the cost result, that's now, let's say, has just broken even more
just close to zero (08:40), so very positive efficiency improvement sales in the life
business.
So we continue now to further improve our life business, so we switch further to modern
life products and walk away from the traditional life products. We will continue with cost
efficiency measures, we will continue to improve our asset liability management, all these
measures, so these are the important factors.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the other side, we see – let's say lower interest rate environment, so putting this all
together, the run rate should remain let's say in the arena of CHF 200 million to CHF 250
million. And this does not mean that – I mean, we disclosed this morning that for this year
due to a low interest environment, we expect some headwind here. We gave it in
numbers that it's okay to say to be a two-digit million net effect, and this might especially
affect, let's say, the life business, so we have to strengthen the reserves. So we have to
distinguish, let's say, between a run rate here and some reserve strengthening effects
and translation effects. And maybe, German, you can give some more – shed some more
light on this. German?

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Just about Belgium, I mean.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Oh, sorry. Yes. Belgium, yeah, German.

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well, it is really the hailstorm in both halves. In fact, we had a situation that the hailstorm
was just shortly before the half-year closing and there was a first estimate in the half year,
which was big already. And in the second half, we had e a lot of additional claims
reportings. And so, in fact, it impacted both years – both half years. That's in fact true.
On a gross basis, what we had in the first – or in a gross/net basis, what we had in the first
half was gross equals net more or less. And in the second half, because it still increased
on a net basis, it came down, but on a gross basis it increased. And the other thing is, of
course, that the reinstatement premiums for reinsurance was in the second half. So, that
was the reason that we had an impact in both half years.

You're welcome.

The next question is from Mr. Michael Huttner from JPMorgan.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Fantastic. Thank you so much. From a – you gave the guidance or you reminded us the
guidance of life EBIT, and I just wondered whether you could also remind me of the
guidance of the non-life EBIT. And then on non-life, also, given that you didn't seem to
have much reserve releases net-net in 2014 and you still got to 93.6%, is below 93%
achievable or are you sticking to the 93%, 96% target range?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then another two, one is, I had the impression may be wrong but you were a little bit
conservative in the way you calculated your extra reserves in life for low interest rates and
other stuff, and I just wondered whether you can talk a bit about your conservatism, how
we can think about it. And then the final bit, the duration mismatch, can you say how you
calculated what you assumed for group life, whether you assumed the one-year contract
or seven-year duration or 20 years or – just to give us an idea so we can compare with
your peers. Thank you.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you, Mr. Huttner, for the questions. The third and the fourth questions, so this is the
how conservative are the life reserves and the duration mismatch, I will hand you over to
German Egloff, and the first two, I will answer.
We don't give, I think, an explicit guidance for the non-life EBIT. What we do is, give you
some parameters that might help you to come up with the EBIT in your models. One is
the target of the combined ratio is, as you well know, 93% to 96%. And, yes, actually
there's quite a likelihood that this combined ratio that we will demonstrate in the future
might not even be below the 93% to 96%.
So if we get there, then we will talk with you particularly (13:26) about updating the target.
For the time being, we stick to 93% to 96%, but there's lot of stuff in the pipeline to
further improve the combined ratio.
As you well know, there has been Ela in Belgium, so Belgium will come down again. We
had quite many large losses in Germany, but 70% out of those large losses have been
from contracts that have already been canceled before the losses appeared, so this is
IBNR. So this will fade off in the future. So these are two substantial factors that will help to
further improve the combined ratio. Also, if I look at the pricing environment in our market,
there's no reason to see why the combined ratios would be harmed.

FINAL

And one element that we also give guidance is the prior year loss development. Yes, it
was a bit lower in the last year, but this was a negative effect from – especially Germany
large claims that have negatively affected the prior loss development. I would more see
this as a non-recurring event. And so I think there's no reason to not to stick to our
guidance that the prior loss development should be about 2% or even a bit higher going
forward. So no changes in the quality of the non-life book, actually we have a very high
quality book.
I hope that it helps you to get a...

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Very much so. Yes.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

...feeling on the EBIT for non-life and the reserve releases of the prior year loss
development. Now, I would like to hand you over to German to talk about the life
reserves.

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well, I guess, Michael, you're referring to the interest rate effect on slight levels, where
you see the CHF 136 million interest rate effects.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

That's right. Yeah.

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

And in fact – well, two answers I would say, the first one is in the current interest rate
environment, the current interest rate trends, you can hardly be too conservative in doing
the reserving. That's the first one and the second one, which is probably more important,
is that of course there are countermeasures to that as well, which is not only derivatives
but as well capital gains. And those are in the savings process.
So if I look at it on a net basis, the effect will probably be lower, because, of course, we
are realizing as well fixed interest securities, which are gaining – which have increased
gains to a certain extent. So it's not only interest rate derivatives that are helping to
counterbalance that. So this is probably the important answer here. And then we had –
what's the other one? Duration?

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Duration gap.

A - German Egloff

So the group-wise duration calculation, that is a hell of a complicated thing. It's certainly
not one year, because you could claim that you can cancel the contract, so it takes just
one year, and that makes it shorter. But this is certainly not adequate because in reality,
that wouldn't work. Apart from that, you have an annuity portfolio, which is running and
which can't be canceled. So I couldn't give you just a number, but I know it's quite a
complicated calculation, which is as well moving from year to year because that has to do
with the contract structure that we have in place currently. The duration gap as such is
between 1.5 and two years, I would say.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Between 1.5 and two years?

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. Okay. And then...

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

It could be that our duration assumption for the liabilities is a bit longer than from other
companies.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Yeah. And the 1.5 to two years – sorry, I was into something. Is it just for the life or that's
for group?

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

That's for the life.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

That's for the life. Okay. So overall for the group, it would translate between one and 1.5
years?

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

In non-life, you normally have a sort of camelback-shaped pattern, because you have the
short-term business which is property mainly, and then you have the extremely long-term
business. So in between, let's say, between three and seven, eight years there is almost
nothing. But on the other hand, on the liability – on the asset side, we have, of course, our
equity exposure is mainly in non-life. And if you're assuming that no duration, the gap is
certainly smaller, I would say. Annuities in non-life is, I think, fully matched. It's probably – in
non-life, it's probably nil or even a bit negative.

The next question comes from Mr. Stefan Schürmann from Bank Vontobel. Please go
ahead.

Q - Stef an Schürmann
Yes. Hello. I have two questions. A follow-up question on the life insurance reserve
increase, if you could just give maybe a bit more color basically on how much of the
reserve increases were based on interest rates, if you had any biometric-based reserve
adjustments? And maybe how much of that (19:40) was in Germany and how much also
relates to Belgium and Switzerland?

Bloomberg Transcript

Then second question on the Swiss Solvency Test. I think not much of the insight, could
you give us a little bit more color where we stand now compared to a year ago? And then
maybe the last question on FX sensitivity, I've seen in the Annual Report that the 1 basis
point change would have an impact of CHF 5 million now against like CHF 4 million a year
ago. Is this something – has anything changed here in terms of hedging or exposure or
why is it a bit higher now?

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you, Stefan Schürmann. I hand you over for the life reserving and the SST to
German and then for the FX sensitivity to Martin Wenk.

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

For the life reserves, there is – they are mainly interest rates driven. On the biometrics
side, it has even movements in the other direction, if I'm right. And I would say, from the
whole of the reserves, about two-thirds is from Switzerland and about one-third is from
Belgium. So, no Germany impact here.
And for the SST, it's actually not comparable to last year because certain parameters and
perhaps changed as well in between. But in principle, it's quite clear, if Solvency I goes up
in this situation, then interest rates are going down, SST is going down as well. So just
from the economic environment it suffered.

Q - Stef an Schürmann
Yeah, that's clear. But you couldn't basically give a hint how much it's going down?

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

No.

And now, Martin, on the FX effects.

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

Yes. Well, it certainly had nothing to do with a change in hedging strategy. We have
maintained that in 2014. We have even increased a little bit beginning of this year. So we
are now completely hedged in euro and, to a large extent, in the U.S. dollar. So, if you see
there a different figure, it's purely (22:03).

The next question comes from Mrs. Archeeta Pujari from Goldman Sachs. Please go

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Archeeta Pujari

{BIO 18878126 <GO>}

Hi there. Hello, everyone. Three questions from my side. First of all, a follow-up question
on the life underlying EBIT question, which was asked previously. The guidance of CHF
200 million to CHF 250 million, can I just clarify, is that including the sort of macro and FX
and interest rate effects going forward or is that sort of underlying mesh of these things?
Secondly, on the property and casualty claims ratio, excluding sort of prior-year
movements and large losses, the underlying claims ratio is very, very favorable. Is that
going to be sustainable going forward or should we expect some deterioration in
underlying claims ratio?
And the third question is can you give an update on German restructuring, how much
restructuring costs were inside 2014 results? Will there be any more restructuring costs
going forward and when can we expect cost savings to play through? Thank you.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you very much. I will answer the three questions. Your first question was on the EBIT
guidance of CHF 200 million to CHF 250 million, and what I'd like to distinguish is on the
one side, let's say, the run rate of the EBIT – of the life EBIT if we have, let's say, a stable
interest rate environment as it is today. And then we see on one side improvements, on
the other side, we see low interest rates. Putting all this together, I would expect the EBIT
to be in the arena of CHF 200 million to CHF 250 million.

FINAL

And as you well know, our balance sheet is a very conservative one. And regarding life
reserves, we have a very mark-to-market reserving policy. So this means if as it happens in
January this year, interest rates fall, we take all the bad news that comes from this fall into
account immediately to strengthen reserves accordingly for the future of Bâloise to be,
let's say, well-reserved under this new circumstances. And this leads to, let's say, a quite
substantial one-time effect as you already see in this process of profit analysis in our
disclosure in the presentation.
So, we will see – given – assuming for just a minute that things would stay for the entire
year to 2015 as they are today. I mean nobody knows if this is true, but let's say, assume
this for a second, we will have a negative impact in the size and sales of midsize CHF 2
million figure. And this will – especially, let's say, expected in life business, but let's say,
that the run rate then should come back to something in the bracket of CHF 200 million
to CHF 250 million because we have other measures that we put into place to improve
the life business further and so on and so on.

Q - Archeeta Pujari

{BIO 18878126 <GO>}

Can I just follow up on that one quickly?

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Archeeta Pujari

{BIO 18878126 <GO>}

This negative double-digit million figure, is that supposed to be a one-off impact rather
than an ongoing impact for however long low interest rate persists?

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

It is a mixture. It is a mixture; mixture meaning that we have many effects right now. We
see low interest rate level and it's not only the levels also, let's say, the structure of the
interest rate curve, the changes on an hourly basis, so to say, is really how to say what the
impact is. But then also we have translation effects. And translation effects, they are, let's
say, constant. The earnings from Germany, the earnings from Belgium, the earnings from
Luxembourg are lower right now due to the FX effect.
So this means the reserve strengthening part, this is one of the elements of the CHF 50
million. This is more a one-time character. The translation is more, I would say, a two to
three-year thing that we have to work against this measure so they (26:21) improve
measures and so on and so on. So what we give you as a guidance is the net effect,
taking all this into account how will the result of Bâloise effected into 2015 assuming that
everything stays as it is today.

Q - Archeeta Pujari

{BIO 18878126 <GO>}

Okay. Got it.

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Then prior-year loss developments, yes, I share the same view. The claims ratio
development is positive and I'm very happy about this actually because we did a lot to get
there. Our target customer management that we now pursue for more than a decade, I
think we can call ourselves (27:02) really the owners of one of the best insurance
portfolios in non-life in Europe. We are quite proud about this. And we're working hard to
further improve the quality of our non-life book. So, yeah, let's look forward to what the
future brings, but we're quite positive about the developments of the claims ratio going
forward.
And now, your third question was Germany. We had – there have been quite a substantial
block of restructuring cost into 2014. It was net after policyholder, after tax in, let's say,
about CHF 14 million, CHF 15 million, so substantial. Actually, it was a bit higher than we
planned because we have been faster in implementing our restructuring measures.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll just give you figure why one can see that we are faster, we said in – when we started
this optimization program in Germany that we would reduce the FTE figure by 400 FTE till
end of 2017. And out of these 400, the 1st of January this year, already 280 have been
gone. So they're not longer on the payroll of Bâloise Germany. So we are quite ahead of
schedule. It goes much faster than we expected, let's say, half a year ago or something.
So this means, on the one hand, we have quite a high cost load last year because this
piece – people that left the company, there is quite an impact on social plan cost. We're
talking about Germany. So this means going forward we will see a lower portion. And if
you ask me what was the net cost effect of the optimization program this year, so this is
either a high-single digit or very low two-digit figure.
So the costs are going down. We now have more, let's say, the IT cost portion of the
restructuring. The FTE cost, let's say, are more or less gone now. It's more that we have to
invest in IT systems to further improve the processes at Bâloise Germany. And this has a
minor effect, let's say, on the cost basis of Germany. So, yes, we should see, going
forward, an improvement in the German result.

Q - René Locher
Okay. Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Just to follow up on Germany, please, because I
can still see there's a huge gap between EBIT Germany of CHF 63 million and EBIT
Belgium of CHF 142 million. And I remember that you always mention that Germany
should achieve more or less the same EBIT as Belgium. Now, if I got it right, you
mentioned quite a block of reserves of 40 million to 50 million (30:44), right? And I was
wondering how much of the cost savings or, how can I say, of the positive synergies of this
€40 million per annum is reflected in 2014 already. So that's the first question.

Bloomberg Transcript

And the second one, just for clarification, you're buying back the shares and I expect – or I
guess you're canceling the shares afterwards. And then last, on the investment income, if
I'm right, the current investment income is down by 4% year-over-year. So, well I
understand that reflects little bit the low interest rate environment, but perhaps Martin
Wenk could give us a little bit of guidance going forward? Yeah. Go ahead, go ahead.
Thank you.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you, René for the questions, I will answer the first about Germany and the
cancellation of the first and then I'll hand you over to Martin to talk about the investment.
So Germany, we're talking about the EBIT and there's quite a gap. You're absolutely right,
but the targets remain unchanged. Let's say, Germany, it should move up to the
magnitude, let's say, of Belgium. If that (32:19) – please take into account one thing that
you might underestimate looking at these figures.
Belgium had a very large claim, Ela, and a high payback through the – from the reinsurance
part. And this is a positive for EBIT in Belgium. And Germany had the many, many smaller
claims, and here the reinsurance company did not back that much, so the structure of the
large claims is a huge explanation factor for this difference.
And the other element, of course, we ask, okay, do we stick to the €40 million cost cutting
base? Till end of 2015, we stick to this, so we're very – have to be fully on track to reach
this. But given that we have still investments in the restructuring program, I would say that
that's hard. I'd say more or less half of this can be seen in the result 2014 and the big
chunk and together, let's say, a more decent structure of the large claims hopefully should
lead to a much smaller gap, let's say, between Belgium and Germany. Then cancelation of
shares. Yes, the purpose of the share buyback is to cancel the shares.

And now, Martin, on the investment income.

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

Okay. You're right about the recurring investment income that it came back. As you see it
on slide 15, by the way, you also have the direct yield on page 42. I would assume that –
for that year, we would have a further drop between 5 basis points and 10 basis points. So
don't forget that the drop in interest rate last year was much more pronounced than this
year, even though in Switzerland, we are under the impression of this central bank
interventions and so on. But overall, in the world, the coming back of the interest rates
were much, much more visible last year than this year so far.

Q - René Locher

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Can I get really two follow-ups? First all for Martin Wenk, I'm always surprised to see
this direct yield for investment properties, it's 4.4%. I'm wondering is this gross or net
yield. Yeah, perhaps you can quickly comment a little bit on the Swiss real estate market
because, well, most of the insurance companies are generating quite healthy returns in
this asset class.
And then for Martin Strobel, I have heard a lot of negative comments or cautious
comments from management of these insurers mainly for the globalized business,
Switzerland, right? And I fully understand with the quite high guarantee. And just
wondering perhaps you can explain a little bit what has to change or what do you expect, I
mean, just a big picture from politicians from regulation and that you, again, would, yeah,
be more than happy to write a little bit more through that business segment. Thank you.

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. I'll start with the easy question. Okay. So the 4.4% is net. Don't forget the net
yield of real estate portfolio basically is driven by the valuation. So if you have a high net
yield that means that you are conservative in valuation compared maybe to some
competitors.
What you have to look at is the yields on the new investments and there, of course, you
see a certain drop in achievable yields where, if I commented on the market as such, I
have to say it's more on the smaller objects that you see that because up to, let's say,
CHF 10 million to CHF 15 million, you have a lot of competition also from private investors
now that see those yields very favorable against the zero yield you have in Switzerland.
If you go through larger projects and you develop them yourself, there is still, let's say, a
healthy market, and you can achieve something between 3.5% and 4% net for new
investments while the 4.4%, as I said, is the bulk.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Now, coming back to the group life business, actually there are, let's say, at least two
angles to the business. One angle is, for me, and this is actually the most important part
from my point of view is what can we do to further improve the business. And we pull all
the levers to improve the – let's say the earnings power of the group life business and
you might find details in the sources of profit. And then this is, let's say, disclosed so that
you'll see a very high quality risk result actually hitting at benchmarks. I have the
impression that we have – let's say, I have among the highest margin here in the group life
in Switzerland. This is due to the fact that we focus more on, let's say, younger customer
structures for the companies we have designed for underwriting.

Bloomberg Transcript

Costs are going down, so we're improving in the cost process. That is very helpful in this
environment and the savings process is quite stable. This is not least to what Martin does
with real estate and all this, so we're very – this high quality recurring income that it's
good.
Now, what we do further is we came up with a two, let's say, two new product offerings.
One is that we focus much more on the risk part of the group life business, so where we
are risk reinsurer. And here, I have very good news actually. The premium of this business
grew by 7% last year in the Swiss business whereas the market has been flat. So the
market was zero and we grew by 7%. Meaning that we are getting now substantial market
share in this highly, highly, highly profitable, let's say more non-life character group life
business. So the mix further improves via now entering this market we did not really touch
before.
The other element that is now up and running is we have now a semi-autonomous
foundation. We call this Perspectiva. And here again the asset risk is not on the balance
sheet of Bâloise, but it's a semi-autonomous foundation. So only the cost process and the
risk process are on the balance sheet of Bâloise. And again, here, we had a very good
start; more than 100 companies already in this foundation. And going forward, we expect
to see in this good business now a mixture not only full coverage group life business, but
also pure risk business and this Perspectiva foundation business. So follow the same
strategy as we have done in the individual life. Walk away, let's say, from the traditional
business towards the more modern products that have a less – that have a lower capital
consumption.
Then you asked about the political environment. My impression is that especially the low
interest rate put a big, big pressure on the two-thirds of the market in Switzerland that is
dominated by the autonomous or semi-autonomous foundation. And you can open up
any newspaper you like and there you will find a person – people from the (40:33) being
the union – not union, but pension association of this subpart of the market. We then say,
okay, we have to adopt the minimum guarantee. We have to adopt the conversion rates.
And so, I feel, also talking to politicians in Bern, I feel a big, big pressure to really adopt
the political parameters. This is now further strengthened by the first pillar in Switzerland
Page 14 of 19

FINAL

where today there was a news on the front paper – front page of (41:07) the first pillar has
turned to the rest, so they're making structure losses now and here again calling for
structural changes.
So I think it's a very good environment right now that the politicians in Bern will act
accordingly. And, let's say, from the one hand, further accelerate the so-called (41:30)
2020 program, so maybe accelerate this, meaning lowering the conversion rate. And I am
really – I hope for and I'm convinced that the (41:43) of the Swiss government will have –
will take a decent decision on the minimum interest rate guaranteed.
Their decision is due in autumn this year. And given all the public pressure, I'm sure they'll
lower it. I don't know to what level but, as you know, the insurance industry asks for 1% or
0.75%. You see in other international markets, for instance, in Belgium and Luxembourg
right now that the group life guarantees come down exactly in this arena.
So given the pressure, given the European development, I'm quite confident that now the
parameters are either changed more quickly than expected or in the case of the interest
rate guarantee, that will be a wise decision, let's say, in autumn this year. But you never
know what happens in politics, so this is just my personal impression.

Bloomberg Transcript

So putting all this together, we are quite happy to (42:36). We see strong growth with
technology innovations in the risk process business. We have the innovation with
Perspectiva. Both have quite a very good, actually very good market traction, so we move
to the modern part of the business, at the same time, quite a pressure to change the
parameters in the right direction. So, actually I think it's not so bad (43:02).

Q - René Locher
Okay. Thank you.

The last question comes from Mr. Ralph Hebgen from KBW.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Yes. Hello. Good morning. Ralph Hebgen from KBW. Just two things. I'd like to understand
the dynamics of your life EBIT result a bit better in 2014. To some extent, you've already
basically answered the question on a longer-term basis by clarifying what the long-term
guidance is. If I look at the EBIT and I'm looking at slide 12 here, the savings result is very
importantly up at CHF 581 million.
Now, obviously, that will have been supported by some of the one-offs. But without taking
you through the details of my calculation, I'm getting to something like CHF 400 million
even if I exclude the most obvious one-offs. And that would still leave an increase of 44%
– 40% year-on-year. So, my question is what – could you comment on what drove these
very strong dynamics also in the context of the policy holder share, which I believe is down

Page 15 of 19

quite materially. And clearly, also in the context of realized capital gains, which are shown
to be equally strong on slide 15? Thank you very much.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you very much, Ralph. I'll hand you over to German.

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Yes. It is indeed that realized capital gains went up CHF 270 million more or less versus
previous year. And as we heard some – on the life side, some, I don't know, CHF 150
million or something is from this special effect. So there is still a substantial increase of
capital gains on the life book. And that's where I answered some questions before to the
– that the impact on interest rate is not only hedged by derivatives on – so, interest rate
derivatives, but also by capital gains to a certain extent and that's exactly what happened
this year. The other thing is, of course, that in the savings result, you have the increase of
the valuation in real estate is included there as well and this is, of course, not recurring.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

And Can I just follow-up? The increase in valuation of property you said?

A - German Egloff

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Martin Wenk, yeah?

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

Yes. That's right.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Sounds like an unrealized capital gain. Sorry, I'm just confused.

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

No. Under IFRS, it is actually – it goes directly into P&L. So it's the same as a realized capital
gain. And we consider it kind of a natural hedge to the interest rate situation, because it
goes both ways, of course, but it's always – it has a negative correlation to the interest
rate effect on the liabilities. So in this regard, it really has a positive effect because it is a
natural hedge.
And as I explained before, we do that in a very conscious way. We are not really overdoing
that. And you see that basically in the yield of – the net yield of 4.4%, if you would have
increased the valuation too much you would see a drop in net yield, of course. So in there
you have some correlation and some hint how that works.

Yeah.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Forgive me to have on this (47:26), but that still leaves CHF 260 million just in the other
segments the swing of CHF 360 million year-on-year.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Right. Okay. And the share element of CHF 217 million, that includes CHF 150 million I think
you said from the sale of assets.

FINAL

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

In total, it was CHF 160 million, but part of it went to non-life. Of our share – part of all
share went to non-life. CHF 130 million.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

CHF 130 million. Yeah.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay. Fair enough. So, in other words if we normalize for these items, then we get back to
the run rate which you identified previously of CHF 200 million to CHF 250 million.

That should be the case. Yeah, that's legit.
