Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the
Topdanmark Annual Report 2016 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a
listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question-and-answer session.
I must advise you that this conference is being recorded today on Thursday, the 23rd of
February 2017.
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Christian Sagild.
Please go ahead.

Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody, and good morning to the USA, and
thank you for joining us in this conference call. With me, our CFO, Lars Thykier; and
Steﬀen Heegaard, who is Head of Investor Relations and Group Communications. We're
holding this conference because earlier today we published our annual results 2016. And
we are now ready to answer your questions. Please ask them one at a time.
Operator, could we have the ﬁrst question, please?

Thank you very much. And the ﬁrst question comes from the line of Asbjørn Mørk from
the Danske Bank. Please ask your question.

FINAL

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Yes, good afternoon. This is Asbjørn from Danske here. A couple of questions. First, on
your operations, if you look at the underlying claims ratio for Q4, it's rather high and
you're also talking about claims inﬂation. Still if I adjust for the IT investments or the digital
investments you make, you're guiding unchanged combined ratio for 2017 of 90% to 91%,
that is underlying. Why is that, what is that that you're seeing that should improve this
trend in 2017? And if I can add a question on that on motor insurance where we've seen
claims inﬂation. Do you expect re-pricing on the back of this more than just what
indexation brings to the table? Thanks.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

We do not expect the expense ratio to increase in spite of the initiatives we are making,
that is due to the fact that we already have made savings and due to the fact that external
expenses will be capitalized. And then – okay.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk

Bloomberg Transcript

What I just mean that you're saying that the combined ratio now is guided for 2017 of 91%
to 92%, right...

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
...which if I re-correct this because of the investments that you're making.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

That is changes because of the investments we make and the extra expenses we'll have in
this context, but it will probably rather the claims handling expenses than the expense
ratio.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Okay. But my question was more related to the actual combined ratio level relative to the
underwriting that we've seen in Q4 on the claims inﬂation and the general weaker
underwriting. So, are you seeing trends in 2017 that make you believe that underwriting
hasn't been impacted? I guess that all things equal, Q4 has been softer than you would
have expected on the underlying part.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Page 2 of 13

But, Asbjørn, the Q4 underlying technical results is not a very good guideline for the full
year 2017. We still have to regard a full year with, of course, everything we normally do
with a normalized weather and everything. And in that context, we still look at 90% to 91%
underlying, but because of these extra investments (03:50).

FINAL

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Okay. Fair enough. Then, considering the claims inﬂation, you previously said that you
didn't want to raise prices within motor because you didn't want to lose market shares, is
that still the case?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Well, yes, we don't have any general price increases in the draw and we have – we see the
automatic indexation and without this being rocket science, we think that claims inﬂation
will be more or less in line with the price indexation.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Fair enough. Then, on your investments that you're making now, the beneﬁt, you're
saying that's going to be more or less neutral in 2018 and 2019, I just have two questions
on that. First of all, does that include all the costs, including the external costs that you will
capitalize or is that – does that come on chop, meaning that this will be an hidden sort of
negative eﬀect? And looking further ahead, do you expect that the beneﬁt that you get,
that you will be able to retain that or should we expect competition to sort of erode that
going forward?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

We expect to be able to absorb the extra expenses at least in 2019. Whether this will
disappear in competition or not, we can't really tell now.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

At some point in time in the future, it's diﬃcult to say what was part of your proﬁtability
stems from which investments and you're just looking at the market conditions and set
prices according to that. It's extremely diﬃcult to say anything very stable forth going
about how much of these beneﬁts will actually materialize for the shareholders and how
much will be competed away in the competition that we don't know anything about.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Okay. But, is it fair to say that the investments that you make now are quite similar to what
your peers are making these days?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Probably.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Company Name: Topdanmark AS

Yeah, most probably.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk

FINAL

Okay. Then a ﬁnal question on online sales, as far as I understand, that's part of your – the
investments that you want to expand within online sales has that never really been
successful in the Danish market. Why do you think that will change going forward?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

At some point in time, if nothing else, then generations will change that pattern because
younger people tend to use online selling. So we think that with some unknown pace, we
will see a transition towards much more online selling. But our investment is as much if
not more in self-servicing, that means that our customers that we already have on the
book can service themselves over the Internet, hence save the back-oﬃce a lot of
resources.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Okay. Thanks a lot. That's all from my side.

Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Per Grønborg from SEB. Please
ask your question.

Q - Per Grønborg
Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions from my side. First of all, on your prognosis for 2017
on the investment side, the DKK 180 million to DKK 230 million. I assume that you have
delivered materially more than your normalized run rate, the ﬁrst 1.5 month. Can you
break it down to how much is what you have earned the 1.5 month and how much is the
expected investment return that maintained the half month? That was my ﬁrst question.
The second one relates to Asbjørn's question, you said that you will take some cost
charges for the IT projects on the claims handling if I understood it correctly in 2017, then
you will activate some costs that will come back and hit the cost ratio from 2019 going
forward. Was that correctly understood? And if that is the case, how last – why should we
expect to see in the intangibles during 2017?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Lars, there are questions for you.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

First 45 day or 40 days of the 2017 on the investment side, but I don't want to speak on
these exact numbers.

Page 4 of 13



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2017-02-23

Q - Per Grønborg
We have previously discussed the run rate on your investment income.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah.

Q - Per Grønborg
Have that changed? As far as I remember, we were somewhere between 100 to 150
normal run rate without – with your base assumption.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

It has increased somewhat. I think we discussed this in Q4 and that was on the basis of the
very low interest rates we had at the beginning of Q4 and we're seeing such rates a little
higher now, but not substantially higher. If that was an answer to your question.

Q - Per Grønborg
So can you give us a number what is – as far as I remember, that time we discussed 100 to
150, so now we are more at the 150 level. Is that...?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That's true.

Q - Per Grønborg
That's true. Okay. Perfect.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

And then, it was the investments we're going to make. If we make investments that are
Inter Systems (09:29) that were worked in the claims handling, then the depreciation of
these expenses will be on claims as well.

Q - Per Grønborg
Yeah. Of course.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

And that means that this will not hit the expense ratio if it is this kind of an investment. But
on the other hand of course, we're going to make some investments on the sales side as
well and that part of the investments will hit the expense ratio in a couple of years. And
again, when this is going away because we will continue to do more investments and we'll
continue to (10:08) more beneﬁts.

Q - Per Grønborg
Page 5 of 13



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2017-02-23

But 1% to 1.5% (10:13) in digitalization investment you will take in 2017 – actually we'll take
similar amount in 2018, is that only what is the P&L or is there another amount that will be
activated and if it's intangibles there?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes.

Q - Per Grønborg
Can you give you any indications about the amount of the excepted total investment in
2017?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

No, but the increasing intangibles in 2017 were deﬁnitely bigger than in 2016.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

I could give you a guesstimate, but we really don't know which pace we are able to make
this in.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Grønborg
Fair enough, fair enough. When I look at the rise in 2016, I of course have an impression of
where we're. Thank you.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Yes, we are working on this. It is not that thing is going to start in 2017.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay, perfect.

Operator
Thank you very much. And the next question comes from the line of Janet Demir from
Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question.

Q - Janet Demir

{BIO 19462264 <GO>}

Hi, I have a couple of questions, please. I was just wondering, ﬁrst of all, and I'm curious
on this proposed changes to the board, I'm wondering from a regulatory point of view
whether there is any concern over possibly having the management of one of your
competitors as Chairman of the board, if you could comment on that?

Page 6 of 13



Company Name: Topdanmark AS

Date: 2017-02-23

FINAL

And then secondly and the motor insurance, I'm just wondering why you have said that
you've seen a decline in volumes as well as rates, is that perhaps due to increased
competition or is there lower volume of cars in general on the road in Denmark? And
sorry this my last one is just on the run-oﬀ for the year. I noticed that it's more elevated
than in the past. I'm wondering whether you're giving any guidance on that going forward
when we can expect it to fall near to the long-term average?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Regarding the management board, already when (12:18) it was appointed to the board.
This has been dealt with through the legislation and also through the conﬁdentiality
agreement that has been made between the board members and between the board
members in Topdanmark, and therefore, the fact that Sampo moves from one to three
participants, all members of the board does not change the legislative foundation of their
presence on the board. There has been no change and this is not an issue with the Danish
supervisory authorities.

Q - Janet Demir

{BIO 19462264 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Then, we had the question whether there are fewer cars in Denmark. No, that's not the
case. The fact of the matter is that we are losing market share in motor in 2016.

Q - Janet Demir

{BIO 19462264 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Regarding the run-oﬀ, it has in 2016 and also in 2015 been higher than you should
normally expect. We don't guide for run-oﬀ going forward, but just sort of our experience
tells us through the conservatism in our provisioning that you could probably expect
somewhere between 1.5 percentage point and 2 percentage point on the combined
ratios, but we're not guiding for that. It could be more, it could probably also be less.

Q - Janet Demir

{BIO 19462264 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

I would just add to that, in our opinion, we are more or less as conservatively reserved
now as we expected to be a year though.

Q - Janet Demir

{BIO 19462264 <GO>}

Okay.

Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Anna Hui from RBC. Please ask
your question.

FINAL

Q - Anna Hui

{BIO 19762795 <GO>}

Hello. Thanks for taking my question. It's just one on the earnings distribution. Would you
be able to give any guidance indication on the mix between share buyback and dividend
if the Sampo's proposal was rejected at AGM?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

I would say that the odds for this proposal not being approved by the AGM is very small.
Therefore I think it's probably theoretical to discuss that, that would also be something
that the board would have to decide at that point in time.

Q - Anna Hui

{BIO 19762795 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

The next question comes from the line of Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca. Please ask
your question.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hi, thank you. Good afternoon. Some of my questions have been addressed, but if I can
seek clariﬁcation, just on the run-oﬀ being elevated in this last year and last quarter in
particular, is it just driven by body injury if you could just comment? And then secondly,
just on the investment side, obviously the discounting is confusing us a bit, but if you
could clarify the very large negative print in the government and mortgage bond, which is
probably oﬀset by the technical rate, but it's quite a large number and if you could
comment on that. And also related to that the CDOs continue to do very well. What do
you think we should think about the CDOs going forward? What are the factors which
suggest the mortgage market in Denmark or the economy? How would you think of that
base? Thank you.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

In the ﬁrst place, the one-oﬀs are on partly entry (16:14), yes. A very steep decrease in
expectations for this wider (16:23) liability for physical things hasn't changed very much.
Then when we're talking about the loss on the government bonds, you asked the
question correctly, that this is due to the match between the liabilities and the assets. The
gains on liabilities are almost the same or they're somewhat smaller than the – somewhat
(16:52) bigger than the losses on the asset side.
CDOs that is mainly CLOs that means, that it is an investment in leveraged loans. It has
nothing to do with the Danish mortgages, it is the loans that are typically issued in relation
Page 8 of 13



Company Name: Topdanmark AS

Date: 2017-02-23

to takeovers.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay.

FINAL

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

And looking forward, it is my expectation that we've seen the best part of the return on
the CDOs now. It has been many very good years and we see a somewhat lower run rate
going forward, probably below two digits.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

All right. Thank you very much.

The next question comes from the line of In-Yong Hwang from Goldman Sachs. Please ask
your question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you very much. I've got two. Just the ﬁrst one, when you commissioned your
bridges to the 2016 combined ratio to what you're expecting for 2017 on your
presentation, just got a kind of 1% expected on the line improvement. Is that just part and
parcel of your reselection in portfolio management or is there any kind of speciﬁc areas
you're targeting there for their improvement?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Let us – the major part of this is the increased eﬃciency, we have gained already.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. And the second one is on the – in the report you mentioned the higher
workers' comp rates and from the labor market insurance body that's kind of impacting
your claims ratio for the quarter. Did you expect any kind of changes to the competition
or the market dynamics on there or your back book or any kind of FX other than what we
saw in the quarter?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

The increase in this workers' comp is relating to the price that we had to pay for this
government body to handle these claims. It is a market condition and therefore, it's
competition competitive-neutral. Whether it will aﬀect prices, we'll have to see. But, at the
same time, we're actually working on maybe having some of these tasks being dealt by
the insurance companies rather than this government body. But, as of now, we have seen
this increase in the price from the government body of 80% just to cover their expenses
to do this, and they're doing quite a poor job because the number of decisions that

Page 9 of 13



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2017-02-23

comes out of this government body is very, very few. So, we hope that we can change
that, but as I said, this is competitive neutral as we see right now.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
The next question comes from the line of Kim Bergøe from Nordea. Please ask your
question.

Q - Kim Bergøe
Hi. Actually, my questions have been asked – answered, but if I can just maybe add one,
and as you mentioned losing market share in motor. But also when I look at your
guidance for next year for premiums in non-life, I mean you're losing some now. So
actually just to keep it ﬂat, it's indicating some sort of growth, could you just walk us
through maybe sort of the bigger areas, where are you losing? But are there also areas
where you're gaining market share, and just sort of maybe quickly touch on the dynamics
in some of the bigger items?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

The guidance that – in the presentation in that we say that the motor insurance would
probably have a negative impact of 1 percentage point on the top-line 2017. That is just
prolonging the eﬀects that we've seen in 2016, where we've experienced a drop in the
average motor premium of 2.9%.
If we see the similar development in 2017, we should expect this 1% eﬀect on the top-lines
stemming from that. And if you mean by other business lines in terms of the price
pressure, what we see is the development, I mean, we are losing some of these large
industrial clients and we lost some at the end of 2016 and that will have an impact on the
growth in 2017 of – negative impact of 0.7%.
So underlying looking at the markets where we are actually growing or where we are
focusing, we're experiencing a growth with the price index, and also underlying a growth
in private lines and in the agricultural sector. So we are still seeing growth potential, but
have to oﬀset these eﬀects, which is also in my opinion competitive neutral because the
fact that average premiums in motor is coming down, is the market condition basically
because the risk is coming down, but also because people tend to drive small and safer
cars.

Q - Kim Bergøe
Okay, thank you.

The next question comes from the line of Per Grønborg from SEB. Please ask your
question.

FINAL

Q - Per Grønborg
Yeah, Sagild, I have a single follow-up question. When I look at your solvency
requirement, can you – I know it's diﬃcult to give a number, but can you give us any
indication of how much of that is coming from life and where would group have been
without the life company, I assume it's a pretty small part that is coming from life?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Basically, the life portion share of the solvency requirement, it changes pretty much from
quarter-to-quarter. And in some quarters, it will be close to half, which was after Q3 and
sometimes it will be closer to a third, which is what it was at the beginning of the year.

Q - Per Grønborg
You are saying, at sometimes it will be half of the total solvency requirements and
sometimes it will be one-third of the total solvency requirement?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Grønborg
Is that rightly understood? Okay. Thank you.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

And that means that – this is due to the total capital requirement changing with the
demand from life.

Q - Per Grønborg
Yeah. Of course, of course. Thank you.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

But, if I can add just one thing here, Per, that is that, this requirement is, of course, subject
to management actions because you can change – it is to some extent, at chosen level
because if you can – if you have guaranteed products in the life company that deals quite
nicely with the – on the bottom line, you are willing to carry some extra capital
requirements in order to maintain that proﬁt.
But on the other hand, you could chose as other pension providers are, you could chose
to sort of invite pension savers to switch from guaranteed products to more unit-linked
market interest products and which carry less capital requirements, but which also
probably carries a little less yielding. So we feel that, we don't mind having this capital
requirements relating to life because the portfolio is yielding quite nicely.

The next call comes from the line of Asbjørn Mørk from Danske Bank. Please ask your
question.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Yes, I just had actually two follow-up questions. One on motor, if I understood you
correctly, you said that indexation would be in your view enough to oﬀset claims inﬂation
in 2017, so I guess all things equal 1.8% or something like that should be enough to oﬀset
claims inﬂation, was that what you meant?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

That is what we intended to mean or intended to say, it is diﬀerent from product to
product, of course, and we have discussed this before that on the motor comparison
(26:05) that we do see some claims inﬂation. On the other hand, we see risk falling on the
third-party liability.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Okay. And then on a completely diﬀerent topic, the investments that you make now on
the digitalization, does that – will that have an impact going forward in an M&A scenario
where you also merged with some Nordic – say non-life insurance company that owns a
big part of you?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

In which way?

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Well, that – I guess the newer systems saw that things even could maybe have an
advantage in terms of combining and combining that in the future?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

That is beyond our knowledge, we don't know, everything we do, we do just to optimize
the operation for Topdanmark and Topdanmark alone with disregarding any shareholder
individual interests.
