{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Thank you, Julien. Good morning to everyone. Welcome to the presentation of the AXA
Group for the first half 2019. 2018 had been a year where we saw a lot of action, a
decisive year in our transformation process.
As you can see on Slide five, the first half of 2019 increased a very positive trend, in which
we found ourselves the figures for 2019, and of this first half do confirm that the
implementation is going quite well. We are performing and this strategy is paying off. In
the first half, the growth of -- the organic growth was confirmed. We are increasing our
revenues by 4% at EUR58 billion, driven by our targeted segments. This growth was
extremely profitable. Our underlying earnings 7% strong growth at EUR3.6 billion.

FINAL

Underlying earnings per share, which is a key indicator for our Ambition for 2020 is up by
10% at EUR1.46. These results were obtained, thanks to our targeted segments and
geographies, but also thanks to the very good first half of AXA XL, as you will be seeing
later on.
Our balance sheet remains solid. Solvency ratio amounts to 190%, within our range, which
is a targeted range. All in all, these good figures show that we are implementing in a strict
manner, relevant strategy, which is bearing fruits and we are focusing on our priorities with
a lot of reserve.
On Slide six, you can see that the growth momentum that was triggered last year
continued in the first half. Our revenues are up by 4% to EUR58 billion. It was driven by the
momentum of the targeted segments, which we chose to develop as part of our
strategic plan. Plus 6% in P&C Commercial lines, this segment represents today 42% of
the Group's revenues. You can see here, to what extent the acquisition of AXA XL has
allowed us to speed up the transformation of our business mix. Health sees a growth of
5%, continuing its organic growth, which is dynamic. And Protection is up by 3%.

Bloomberg Transcript

For AXA, as you can see on Slide seven, this transformation is taking place to -- for the
benefit of profitability, the combined ratio is at good levels. These good figures show that
we have made good progress in our transformation, since the presentation of our
strategic plan in June 2016. It shows also the ability of AXA to focus on its priorities and
what is even more important to deliver.
This is what we have achieved again at the start of this year. As you can see it on Slide
eight. In February, I had told you that the integration of AXA XL was a priority. At AXA XL,
the commercial momentum turned out to be very favorable. Higher revenues stood at
plus 9% in the half year. The rising trend of prices has been shored up in most of our lines.
This growth momentum turned out to be profitable. The contribution of AXA XL to
underlying results of AXA is at EUR502 million during this half year. The complementarity
between the expertise of AXA XL and the distribution power of AXA is a real asset.
We already see the synergies of revenues. Together, we are gaining business and we are
better at knowing our customers. To continue the AXA integration -- I mean, of AXA XL, it
was one of our priorities that was announced. As you can see, we did make good
progress. We made progress as well when it comes to our other priorities.
As you can see on Slide nine, we continue to cut down on our stake in AXA Equitable
Holdings after the divestitures in March and June. We will reduce further our economic
stake down to 30% against 59% at the end of 2018. We also, as scheduled, continued
with the deleveraging of the Group and our gearing ratio will be going down to 30% at
the end of the summer. We still intend to bring it down between 28% to -- 25% to 28% for
the end of 2020.
Lastly, we extended our payer to partner strategy, as you can see on Slide 10.

FINAL

In regard to Health, now, we created in emerging countries an innovative ecosystem,
which combines health centers with health insurance solutions. Our ambition is clearly to
contribute to each and every one access to health. Our strength is to be able to adjust
everywhere to the specific needs of our customers.
In P&C Commercial lines, we have developed offers where we provide advise. Risks are
becoming increasingly large and complex. Our customers -- our Commercial lines
customers want effective cover and this is why our size and our expertise allow us to
provide them that. However, they also want advise in order to better prepare themselves
for the risks every day. This is the meaning of our player to partner strategy, supporting
our customers and better meet the requirements. These unique expertise is, which we
are developing, we are also making them available to society as large, as you can see on
Slide 11, a large cooperation.

Bloomberg Transcript

First of all, has a key role to play in society. The best means to do so is to make sure to be
efficient and share these expertise. This is why we are highly committed in fighting against
climate change. Risk, which we know extremely well. For years, we have taken strong
measures in favor of the climate and we will continue to do so. This year, we extended
our action in order to protect biodiversity, since this is a component of protection of the
climate, which is significant.
We have also been involved very much in the health sector, which will see an
unprecedented transformation and the effect of the technological revolution, and of the
aging of the population. We must think about how we can use these technologies in order
to better protect the vulnerable populations by promoting social inclusion. This is the
meaning behind what we have carried out by helping public authorities in fighting against
medical desserts [ph] as we call them, as you will see this on slide 12.
AXA proves again its ability to transform itself. By excluding AXA Equitable Holdings, we
see that 82% of our pre-tax, underlying earnings come from P&C, Health and Protection. It
was 66% just two years ago at the same time. We have strong positions in order to
continue our development. We are on track to deliver our transformation process.
We are also on track towards the goals of our strategic Ambition 2020, as you can see on
slide 13. You know, extremely well now these financial objectives of our plan, I would like
to note that the very good performance of our underlying earnings per share, which is
increasing by 10%.
I will now turn it over to Gerald Harlin.

Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Thomas. Thank you, Thomas, and good morning to you all. May I suggest we begin with
Slide 15, in France. France is experiencing excellent performance with revenues up by 3%,
supported in particular by Health plus 6% and Protection by 3%. Also, you can note the
excellent profitability of the operations in P&C, with a combined ratio of 90.8%, down by

Page 3 of 14



Company N ame: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity

FINAL

2.9 points. Also, you can note a reduction of the Health combined ratio. And this has made
it possible to have underlining earnings up 7%, reaching EUR873 million.
If we move now on to Europe, Page 16. AXA in Europe has also had an excellent first half,
underlying earnings up 4% and this -- revenues up by 2%, driven by P&C Commercial lines
at 4% and also, by Health at plus 3%. And this commercial dynamic accompanied by
improving the profitability of our P&C activity, you see that the combined ratio is down by
1.1 points and the same in Health, where the combined ratio is down by 0.8 points. All this
allows Europe, despite the decline of the investments -- rise of underlying earnings by 4%
to EUR1.3 billion.
If we move on now to Asia on Slide 17. Revenues up by 5%, driven by all the segments and
supported also by technical improvements. And the underlying earnings in Asia, up by 8%
to EUR620 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the international region, this is Slide 18. The revenues are up 6%, supported by the
growth of countries, such as Mexico, plus 12%; Turkey, plus 22%; Colombia, plus 10%. And
you will note too strong robust growth in our profitable -- technical profitability with a
combined ratio of 98.4%. And the growth of the revenues and an excellent improvement
of our technical ratios explains the excellent performance of the international region with
underlying earnings, which as you can see on the left-hand side of the page, up 16% to
EUR240 million.
AXA IM now, this is Slide 19. The Group's net inflows have been EUR4 billion, thanks to the
integration of AXA XL and asset under management is at EUR123 billion and gross
revenues down by 8% because the transaction commissions and the reduction of costs
compensate also the reduction of the commissions and underlying earnings are down by
12% to EUR123 million.
If we move now to Slide 20, AXA XL. AXA XL had an excellent first half. Revenues up 9%,
supported in particular by the P&C, plus 15% and specialties at 6% and P&C Reinsurance
at 2%. You note also that there has been renewing in affirming pricing circle for Insurance
at plus 5% and Reinsurance plus 2.4% and the trend is continuing in most of our
geographies. And this general rise of revenues, and the growth of volumes,
materialization of the first synergies made it possible for AXA XL to have underlying
earnings of EUR502 million.
If we move now to Page 21 for the United States. Here in the US, as you know, we have
continued to reduce our stake in AXA Equitable Holdings and we've gone from 60% to
31% and with a reduction of the business in March and June of this year with a higher IPO
introduction rate. And this is now under the equity method, the decline of the underlying
earnings from EUR465 million to EUR283 million, as you can see on the left-hand side of
the slide, show really the reduced ownership and the underlying earnings of AXA
Equitable Holdings has increased by 1%.
If we move now to the summary of our earnings and the indicators for our financial
strength, and I suggest we move now to Slide 23. In the first half, AXA has had excellent
Page 4 of 14

FINAL

underlying performance. The underlying earnings are up by 7% to EUR3.6 billion, driven in
all our geographies. And note too, the excellent performance of AXA XL, which has
contributed to the Group's results by EUR502 million.
On Slide 24, we have the adjusted earnings. And the adjusted earnings is the benchmark
for calculating the dividend, has increased by 8% and stands now at EUR4 billion, thanks to
the rise of 7% of our underlying earnings and the net added value of the first of capital
gains of EUR386 million.
Next Slide now 25, with the net income and shareholders' equity. Net income is down by
19% to EUR2.3 billion, in particular driven by two technical factors. The first is the
unfavorable verge [ph] of the derivatives. So you see minus EUR767 million, and the
impact of the deconsolidation of AXA Equitable at EUR705 million. And these means the
application of bookkeeping rules and the -- take into account the market impact. This has
absolutely no impact on the cash. You will note too on the right-hand side of the same
slide that shareholders' equity that reflects the value of the Company is up by 4.3% at
EUR66.7 billion. And our position in the market is recorded in the net situation, hence the
plus EUR2.4 million [ph] and does not include the technical margins.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we move now to the next slide, Page 26, I would like to underscore the robustness of
our Solvency II ratio. You see on the left-hand side, it is at 193%, and is really heightened
our target between 170% and 220%. On the right-hand side, you will see that the three
rating agencies, Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch give us excellent financial robust
ratings, and all the ratings have gone back to the same level as before the acquisition of
XL, which is a very positive indication of our financial robustness.
And to conclude, Slide 27, give you the general account invested assets. Note on this slide
that our assets reached EUR547 billion, are chiefly invested in govies, which represent on
the left-hand side, which represent 43% of our assets and have an average rating of AA,
whereas the corporate bonds, which represent in blue 31% of our assets have an average
rating of simple A. In the first half, we invested EUR28 billion in bonds at an average rate
of 2%.
And I would like to underscore the importance for the Group of having with AXA IM, the
alternative privilege access to privileged favors with the ABS, in particular with EUR123
billion in alternatives. AXA IM is a European leader in alternative management.
And I will now hand back to Thomas for conclusion.

Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Thank you, Gerald. As you have seen, the first half of 2019 has proven the relevance of
AXA strategy and its strict implementation, dynamic growth of all the targeted segments
and of the geographies, very good operational performance, very good AXA XL half year,
which contribute significantly to the Group's results. In other words, we are on track in our
transformation towards the targets of the 2020 Ambition plan.

Questions And Answers

Operator
(Foreign Language) (Operator Instructions) Question from Catrin Shi from Insurance
Insider. Madam, please go ahead.

Q - Catrin Shi
Hi, there. It's Catrin Shi here from The Insurance Insider. I wonder if you could give any
further detail on the non-cat large losses, which you've disclosed in the AXA XL results
and what impacts that had on the combined ratio. And whether you saw any loss creep in
the half as that the carriers have done from JV and other cat events?

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Catrin, for your question. I suggest that Gerald will answer them on
the non-cat large losses and the impacts of JV.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Yes. We had -- I'll start first with this impact of JV because the impact of JV is after the first
consideration of AXA XL. I remind you that we first consolidated XL in Q4. And in 2019, in
the first half, we had some impacts -- negative impact, I would say, with a high-level of
large losses, but which was offset by some release in term of reserves coming from the
cat events, Michael -- hurricane Michael that took place in Q4 2018 and as well on the
wildfires in California. So these two elements more or less offset, which means that in the
end it would be more or less neutral.

Q - Catrin Shi
Okay. Thank you.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

And take also into consideration the fact that we start benefiting and -- but it's also for the
future, but we start benefiting from the strong rate increase across the board on all the
lines, including Insurance and Reinsurance of AXA XL.

Q - Muriel Breiman
Thank you. I have a first question regarding AXA XL. Can you hear me? I would like to
know, since the second half 2018 had been extremely intense in terms of natural disasters
and had weighed down on AXA XL. Could we have an idea about the first half of 2019?
Was it tame compared to the average?

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Thank you for your question. I suggest that Alban de Mailly Nesle answer your question.

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

As regards AXA XL, the first half was in line with the average we can see in the past few
years. So not very difficult nor easy for that matter.

Q - Muriel Breiman
I had another question regarding AXA IM. Could we get an explanation on the lower fees
and revenues that was mentioned earlier on by Mr. Harlin?

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Gerald Harlin will give you further details.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Well, listen, this translates into the average fees and revenues. As you know, all asset
management companies suffered, especially in the first half due to the fact that there is a
product mix, which is less favorable than before. There are fewer shares, more bonds and
as you know, fees are lower in that case. So, therefore, we experienced a drop in fees.
Average fees represent just more than -- a little bit than 17 basis points, here we are just
below 17, so that slight decrease accounts for these lower results of EUR16 million, mainly,
I would say. However, don't forget that with AXA IM, and this is why I indicated the
strength of AXA IM is also alternatives. And in terms of alternatives, we have positive cash
flows and with alternatives, margins are much higher. And to end, remember, it's precisely
in periods where rates are extremely low that there is strong demand for alternative
instruments.

Operator

FINAL

(Foreign Language) Thank you. Next question from Julien Marion from Dow Jones [ph].

Q - Julien Marion
Yes, good morning. I'd just like a detail, what's the combined ratio for P&C for last year in
order to have an element of comparison for this first half ?
And also, I would like to know what's your outlook for the second half ? Are you expecting
gentler second half ? As much of the first half was -- last year the second half was very
demanding.

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Look, if we consider last year, the combined ratio last year -- of course, you have to
compare like-for-like. I mean, the first half was without XL. Now, if we take the whole
Group scope, with excluding AXA XL, our combined ratio last year was 94.5% and now it
goes to 93.3%. So it is a very significant improvement of 1.2 points. Hence, the excellent
results that we're posting for this first half.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Julien Marion
Okay. And what about your outlook for the second half ?

A - Gerald Harlin

{BIO 7424807 <GO>}

Well, look, what I could possibly add is, of course, it all depends on the nat cat, with -which we can't anticipate. Alban was mentioning earlier that in the first half XL was
absolutely on track with previous years. And so, this general trend can be expected to
continue because we have been working hard in all the entities on these ratios. But,
obviously, it's going to depend on the level of natural catastrophes and yet, we are very
confident about our capacity to continue this general trend of our combined ratio,
especially for 2019.

Good morning to you all. I have a question concerning France. I'd like to know how you
explain that P&C is stagnating despite an improvement of the combined ratio? And also,
I'd like to know, what explains your excellent results in Health, is it more on individuals or is
it corporate?

FINAL

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Thank you for your question, and Jacques de Peretti will answer.

A - Jacques de Peretti

{BIO 18970697 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. You have noted that our combined ratios improved by 2 points, which is
excellent and that our revenues have grown this year. Revenues haven't grown because in
the personal market individuals, you know that we didn't want to get into the price war
that is taking place currently between the mutual insurance companies and this has,
therefore, led to 0% improvement. For us, even though we do ambition to come back on
the market in the coming months and semesters, but our period for -- is going from this
minus 4.4 in the half last year to minus 4 this year. So it's an improvement.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Health, we're doing 6%, but here you have to consider two activities. One is the
corporate activities, specifically speaking, in particular P&C to -- damages to property and
cars and so on. And there we are growing by 3%. But there is another scope that we call a
credit life and protection, where we are continuing to restore the portfolio and there we
are down by about 15%. So all in all, it's not 0%.
So to summarize, a stagnation of our revenues and an improvement of our combined
ratio, which is particularly related to three factors, one being the cat nat. The others, the
attrition -- natural attrition, improvement of our technical additional results and lastly,
better performance than in the past on the reserves.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Thank you.

A - Julien Parot
Thank you, Jacques. And next question.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) We have a question from the Les Echos newspaper.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Yes, good morning. For AXA XL, you're referring to a rise in the serious losses. Are these
human losses, human damages or is it related to the crash of Ethiopian Airlines and the
crisis around the Boeing 737 MAX?

Now, I have another question about France. Were you expecting a phenomenon of
substance [ph] in the coming months because of the drought?

FINAL

And another question, what is the impact on AXA France of all the claims for other
disasters?

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Now, I'll answer the first question concerning claims and Jacques de Peretti will answer
about drought and the yellow vests.
Yes, good morning. What I can say is, we are not used to comment on specific claims. But
as the number one world insurance in commercial lines P&C, it's obvious that we are
exposed, and we are working on the diversification. We put very strict limits to manage
this diversification. And it is our business to be there for all our clients and -- when they
have a claim. What I can say is that, I said that we -- these are man-made claims and we
have a level that is somewhat higher than usual, but it's not something that is of particular
concern to us. And you'll see that our earnings in the first half for AXA XL are perfectly
good. And let me remind you too that we have an ultimate objective of having a
contribution to earnings of EUR1.4 billion in 2020, and we confirm that objective.

A - Julien Parot

Bloomberg Transcript

Jacques now for the French questions.

A - Jacques de Peretti

{BIO 18970697 <GO>}

Yes. Concerning drought and resilience, it's a bit early to really be able to appreciate this,
because the drought phenomenon is happening a little later than expected. Just bear in
mind that, in terms of Nat cats, we've had a good first half, because we are at EUR96
million for natural catastrophes in France for AXA compared to EUR154 million for last year.
And so, we have good margin there to be able to cope with the problems relating to the
drought.
Concerning the gilets jaunes the so-called yellow vests. You know that the impact is
spread over two financial periods, one part in 2018, part in 2019. And we can say, overall,
the impact will be less than EUR20 million. We haven't had the exact figures yet because
some claims are still developing, in particular the -- simply operating earnings for certain
businesses that haven't been able to start up again.

A - Julien Parot
Thank you. And let's move to the next question.

FINAL

Q - Unidentified Participant
To pick up on the Health market in France. What about the context of the meeting with
the French President at the end of 2018? This -- is this -- to what extent, is this growth
related to pre -- to higher premiums or to the number of contracts, et cetera?

A - Julien Parot
Jacques de Peretti will answer this question.

A - Jacques de Peretti

{BIO 18970697 <GO>}

Thank you for noting this rise of 6% in the Health sector, which follows the 12% rise last
year. Well, last year the rise was chiefly driven through the international arena by about
40% and this year, what is very interesting to note is that, this rise individually and
collectively was 6% in each case, it was balanced and internationally and domestically it
was 6% in each case. So four engines are operating well and they are the result of a
team, which is quite an expert in terms of pricing sophistication, but also in terms of
innovation. It is clear that having been a leader in tele medicine as from 2015, contributes
differentiating factor so that we can expand our portfolio now and our contracts in the socalled collective or individual world.

Yes, you can speak.

Q - Catrin Shi
Hi, thank you. I had a follow-up question on your ILS platform New Ocean. In November,
you said you are planning to grow this platform. I wondered how that was progressing and
what the current level of funds on the management is? And as a secondary part to that
question, I wondered how the ILS operations of AXA IM might tie in with New Ocean?

Thank you very much for your question. Alban de Mailly Nesle will answer.

FINAL

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

So, absolutely, we said that we would develop the amount of risk transfer to investors
through ILS in New Ocean. This is in progress today, the amount is still stable compared to
what you saw at the end of last year, because I think that we implement rather in the
framework of our reinsurance strategy. Nevertheless, we have significant discussions with
a number of investors that are interested in the exposure to that asset class of insurance
risks. So the discussions are well in progress.

Q - Catrin Shi
And how might AXA IM tie in with this?

A - Thomas Buberl

{BIO 16182457 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So AXA IM is fully part of it, because you have two pieces, one is the origination piece that
is very much New Ocean, where you can go and really package and structure the risk and
the other part of it is the distribution part of it and that is the role of AXA IM, amongst
others where we leverage the contact, and the good relationships that we have to
existing investors and Gerald has spoken earlier about our very strong performance on
the alternative assets, those are typically the same investors that are also interested in
the alternative capital.

This was not about the yellow vest, it's a question regarding the airline industry. This is
about AXA XL. Well, certainly we saw these tragic events, but you should understand that

Yes, thank you very much for this question. The performance in Italy is continuing very well.
We have growth in all the business lines that we're focused on in the Group. And in
addition, something very positive is the partnership that we have with our bank, which is
also continuing very well. Despite the fact that the market is rather declining, we have
strong growth in unit-linked and very strong growth in all our business sectors, which
means we are very satisfied with the business in Italy. And if you take this into account and
take into account the economic environment, we don't see any slowdown of the growth in
the next months.
