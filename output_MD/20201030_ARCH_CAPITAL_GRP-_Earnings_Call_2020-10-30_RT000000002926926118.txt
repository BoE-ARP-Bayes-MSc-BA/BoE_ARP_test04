{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Good morning Liz. And welcome to our third quarter earnings call on Halloween Eve.
You're in for a treat. In our results, you can see tangible evidence of the advantages of
the Arch model. By protecting our capital during the soft market years, we are well
positioned as each of our segments leans into improving market conditions. Our
underwriters are making the most of the hardening property and casualty market, while
our mortgage insurance segment is benefiting from record mortgage origination activity
this quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

This, year for the first time in nearly a decade, we've been able to grow significantly and
deploy more capital in our P&C businesses that provides acceptable expected returns.
And due to our strong financial position, we had accomplished this while maintaining a
strong presence in MI, which continues to deliver meaningful returns.
Our ability to continually rebalance capital amongst our diverse businesses enhances our
total underwriting returns. It also should decrease earnings volatility over time. Since our
inception, we have believed in cycle management, and this strategy brings an added
margin safety to our collective underwriting activity. Allow me to elaborate on our third
quarter results by touching on three key themes: one, growth; two, margin improvement;
and three, capital allocation.
First, let's talk about growth. In this quarter, net written premiums in our P&C units grew
25% in total, 17% in insurance and 38% in reinsurance over the same period a year ago.
This growth was driven by rate improvements, but also reflects our ability to increase our
participations where clients needed additional capacity. In the insurance segment, we
continue to obtain strong rate increases in areas like property, D&O and casualty. Groupwide our rate increase for the third quarter averaged over 11%, and we believe this trend
of increasing rates should continue through 2021.
At Arch, we have always followed a simple rule, our participation in the business should
follow the direction of premium rates. As rates improve, we write more business. When
rates decrease, as they did over the past several years, we write less. This strategy takes
courage. It will often appear an outlier to the market, but being intellectually honest,
disciplined and applying our cycle management techniques is what we're all about at Arch.
Obviously, the P&C market is broad and all opportunities are not created equal. There are
areas such as workers' comp where premium rates or conditions are not improving to the
levels we believe are needed for an adequate return and in those instances, we manage

FINAL

our appetite accordingly. Despite headwinds from the pandemic, our growth in insurance
lines like E&S property, casualty, and professional lines are a great example of our
platform's ability to flex into improved underwriting conditions.
Our reinsurance unit has been able to lean into this hardening market both earlier, and
with more vigor than our primary operations. There are two main reasons for this. First,
when a market transitions, needed rate increases compound up the insurance supply
chain. Reinsurance is often a leading indicator of what's to come more broadly. Second,
reinsurance can provide capacity quicker and in larger amounts, since it can put capital to
work through clients' platforms. Of course, share growth is only one part of the equation
of growing returns. Let's turn now to margin improvement.
We all know that mathematically rate increases in excess of loss trends lead to margin
improvement. The marketplace seems to be supporting the momentum of continued
rate increases. We are in the early stages of seeing the benefit of rate on rate increases
in our operating results. Simply stated, adding the two parts, growth and margin will lead
to better returns.

Bloomberg Transcript

Many factors are driving today's P&C markets. These include, elevated natural CAT loss
activity in each of the past four years, weakened reserve positions from soft market
years, lower investment yield and a rising claim inflation. Add in a global pandemic that is
still ongoing and it's not surprising that market conditions are changing.
Now pivoting to MI. Our $33 billion of NIW in the U.S. in the quarter was a record for Arch.
Low interest rates are producing huge refinance activity and unsurprisingly some churn in
our in-force business. However, MI premium rates remain above pre-COVID levels and
the continued high credit quality of borrowers is generally better than it was prepandemic. We continue to face uncertainties such as the economy's health and how the
pandemic may ultimately affect individual borrowers. However, we are optimistic that
among other positive factors, recent trends in the U.S. housing market will mitigate the
effects of the pandemic.
Finally, Arch's ability and willingness to allocate and manage capital remains a key
competitive advantage. We always think about balancing our capital deployment over five
pillars; into the insurance, reinsurance, MI, into our investment portfolio and lastly into our
stock repurchase. Our job is to optimize risk-adjusted returns through capital allocation
across these pillars. We see managing the five pillars, being similar to coaching a
basketball team. We're constantly looking at how we can distribute the ball i.e., our capital
to the right players.
For the past several years, we've been able to feed the big seven-foot seven MI guy
down low and rely on him to get easy dunks. Now as a playing field i.e. the market
changes, we've adjusted our tactics slightly and are increasingly relying on our two hot
shooters, reinsurance and insurance. MI will still score its fair share of points but the P&C
players are getting more open three point looks and lay ups. In short, our game is
becoming more complete and diversified. Our ability to adapt to the new conditions is
what makes us stronger as a team.

FINAL

The market dynamics take me back in time. We have talked about Paul Ingrey's
underwriting clock that helps track and measure the phases of the insurance cycle. It's
been central to our management philosophy since the beginning and is a helpful
reference to understand the underwriting lifecycle and assist us in gauging our risk
appetite.
I recently asked our underwriting teams where we were on the Ingrey clock and the most
common response was around 8:00. If you take a look at the clock in our most recent
annual report, you'll see that it's a very nice time to be at Arch. There's a buzz among our
underwriters because we've become the first call for so many of our clients. They know
that we have the capacity, the expertise and the desire to serve them.
Now I'll turn the coach's whistle over to Franois, as he goes into more detail on our
quarterly results. And I look forward to responding to your questions afterwards. Francois?

Thank you, Marc and good morning to all. We at Arch hope that you are in good health.
Onto the third quarter results. As a reminder and consistent with prior practice, the
following comments are on a core basis which corresponds to Arch's financial results,
excluding the other segment i.e. the operations of Watford Holdings Limited. In our filings
the term consolidated includes Watford.
After-tax operating income for the quarter was $120.3 million, which translates to an
annualized 4.2% operating return on average common equity and $0.29 per share. Book
value per share increased to $28.75 at September 30, up 4.1% from last quarter and 12.2%
from one year ago. The increase in the quarter was fueled by the continued strong
performance of our investment portfolio and good underwriting results, taking into
consideration the elevated catastrophe activity in the quarter, and the uncertainty
surrounding the current pandemic.
Our property casualty teams continued on their path of solid growth and improved
performance as we continue to see strong positive pricing momentum in their markets.
Losses from 2020 catastrophic events in the quarter including COVID-19, net of
reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums stood at $203.3 million or 12.5
combined ratio points compared to 5.2 combined ratio points in the third quarter of 2019.
The losses impacted both our insurance and reinsurance segments and include $191.4
million from a series of natural catastrophes in the quarter including hurricanes Isaias,
Laura and Sally, the Midwestern derecho, California wildfires and other smaller events as
well as $11.9 million for losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The COVID-19 losses we recorded in the quarter were small, reflecting additional
information that became available during the quarter and represent our current
assessment and best estimate of the ultimate losses for occurrences through September
30, based on policy terms and conditions including limits, sub-limits and deductibles. As of
September 30, the vast majority of our COVID-19 claims are yet to be settled or paid with

FINAL

close to 80% of the inception to date incurred loss amount recorded as incurred but not
reported i.e. IBNR reserves or as additional case reserves within our insurance and
reinsurance segments.
As regards the potential impact of COVID-19 on our mortgage segment, we note that the
delinquency rate at the end of the quarter was 4.69%, down from 5.14% at June 30. Our
current expectation is that the delinquency rate should be in the 5% to 5.5% range at year
end 2020. While we have seen many positive signs over the last few months that point us
to a more favorable view of the ultimate performance of the U.S. MI book, many of the
uncertainties we identified on our last call remain.
In particular, the potential impact from a second wave of infections, potential lockdowns,
and the lack of an additional fiscal stimulus package are risk factors that we continue to
monitor and evaluate on an ongoing basis. For these reasons and consistent with our
corporate reserving philosophy, we believe it is prudent to take a cautious approach in
setting loss reserves across our MI book.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the insurance segment, net written premium grew 17.1% over the same quarter one year
ago, a strong result demonstrating our ability to achieve profitable growth in this
environment. Adjusting for the net written premium decrease observed in our travel,
accident and health unit, the year-over-year growth in net written premium would have
been 26.5%.
The insurance segment's accident quarter combined ratio excluding CATs was 94.1%,
lower by 620 basis points from the same period one year-ago. Approximately 300 basis
points of the difference is due to a lower expense ratio primarily from the growth in the
premium base from one year ago and reduced levels of travel and entertainment
expenses this quarter.
The lower ex-CAT accident quarter loss ratio reflects mix change and the benefits of rate
increases achieved over the last 12 months. Prior period net loss reserve development,
net of related adjustments was favorable at $1.1 million generally consistent with the level
recorded in the third quarter of 2019.
As for our reinsurance operations, we had strong growth of 38.4% in net written
premiums on a year-over-year basis which was observed across most of our lines and
includes a combination of new business opportunities, rate increases, and the integration
of the Barbican reinsurance business. The segment's accident quarter combined ratio,
excluding CATs stood at 83.1% compared to 92.8% on the same basis one year ago.
The year-over-year movement is primarily driven by a more normal level of large
attritional losses compared to a year-ago and rate change activity over the last 12 months.
Most of the remaining difference is explained by operating expense ratio improvements,
primarily resulting from the growth in earned premium.
Favorable prior period net loss reserve development, net of related adjustments was
$40.8 million or 7.4 combined ratio points compared to 4.0 combined ratio points in the

FINAL

third quarter of 2019. The development was mostly in short tail lines.
The mortgage industry had a record-breaking quarter in terms of NIW and we certainly
followed suit with this quarter's NIW of 38 -- $32.8 billion, a full 30 % higher than our prior
high watermark. Offsetting this record level of production was the high level of refinancing
activity across our portfolio with the net result being a slight reduction in our insurance in
force. The combined ratio was 64.2%, reflecting the lower delinquency rate observed
during the quarter.
The trends we saw this quarter were favorable relative to last quarter, but the game is far
from over. The expense ratio was slightly lower over the same quarter one year ago and
prior period net loss reserve development was favorable at $4.5 million this quarter.
Total investment return for the quarter was positive 230 basis points on a U.S. dollar basis
as the strong recovery in the capital markets produced healthy returns across our entire
portfolio. Returns in our equity and alternative investments contributed approximately
40% of the total return for the quarter. The duration of our investment portfolio remained
basically unchanged from the prior quarter at 3.21 years.

Bloomberg Transcript

The effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 4.8% in the quarter, reflecting a
change in the full year estimated tax rate, the geographic mix of our pre-tax income and a
10 basis point benefit from discrete tax items in the quarter. As always, the effective tax
rate could vary depending on the level and location of income or loss and varying tax
rates in each jurisdiction. We currently estimate the full year tax rate to be in the 8% to
10% range for 2020.
Turning briefly to risk management. Our natural CAT PML on a net basis increased to $918
million as of October 1 which at approximately 8.4% of tangible common equity remains
well below our internal limits at the single event one in 250-year return level. The growth
in the PML this quarter is attributable to our E&S property unit within the insurance
segment which increased its writings in an improving marketplace.
On the capital front, the increase in interest expense this quarter was mainly the result of
the issuance of the $1 billion senior notes we issued in June 2020. So far, we have been
able to fund our recent growth with our existing capital base. And our balance sheet
remains strong with a debt plus preferred leverage ratio of 23.1% that remains well within
a reasonable range.
As for our U.S. MI operations, the mortgage insurance linked notes market has recovered
to a great extent from the lows we saw at the onset of the pandemic. Earlier this week we
priced our third Bellemeade transaction of the year at terms that are getting closer to
what we saw in 2019, both in structure and price. Our latest transaction will provide 6.5%
of coverage in excess of a 2.5% attachment point, both expressed as a percentage of the
risk in force.
Including this transaction, the Bellemeade structures currently provide approximately $3.9
billion of aggregate reinsurance coverage. The fact that this market has recovered as

extensively as it has in just over seven months with investors more and more comfortable
with the exposure they are assuming is quite telling and provide support to our current
assessment of the health of the using -- of the U.S. housing market.

Hi. Thank you. Good morning.

Good morning.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

My first question is on the capital allocation. So Marc, you laid out five pillars. I just want to
confirm I guess based off of how you were talking, it sounds like share repurchase is left
kind of on the chain right now. And I guess, because it seems like you have such good
growth opportunities that you could put your capital to use to basically to incrementally
add to your insurance and reinsurance writings? Am I understanding that correct?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

So yes. I didn't mean to put them in ranking order. I think that they are probably all very
equally, attractive at this point in time. I think that we're investigating as you know on a
quarterly basis as to what the opportunities are in various signs of business. I didn't mean
to name stock repurchase as the last one, as a rank ordering mechanism. I think that is
also part and parcel of the discussion.
I think that for the first time in a while I would argue that the five players actually are
actively making the point for receiving ball, the ball and play and be part of the game. So I
would definitely say that. And we're evaluating but certainly our game number one, our
focus number one is to allocate capital to the underwriting units if the returns are there.
And that certainly is a relatively easier place to deploy and easier what you see it at this
point in time. But everything is up, everything is -- every guy -- everybody is playing on the
field, on the court.

Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question, your insurance, underlying margin
94% in the quarter. Arch had targeted to get to kind of a mid-90s. Yet you guys are kind
of there but there's more -- you mentioned a lot of rate. I think 11% that you're getting in
your book of business which means you haven't even earned that in yet. So as we think
about the earning in of the rate you're getting today, plus what seems like incremental
rate you could get into 2021, do you have a new target for that business? Or is there a
way that we can think about the margin profile there, especially since you've kind of hit
that target that you laid out for the street?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes. So let me go back to the 95% combined which I mentioned, I think three years ago
now I think it was meant to be there as an aspirational target and to shoot for at that point
in time based on the mix of business and the opportunities that we had in the
marketplace. I think this has changed, right? I think that now that we're obviously going in
that direction and very nicely, and the market is certainly, helping us, I think we still look
very heavily into line by line and ROE by line of business.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I would argue, Elyse, that some lines of business would be less than a 95% combined
and some might be still okay at above 95. But certainly, what I would tell you is that
combined ratio was aspirational. We have to keep in mind that there's still COVID-19 is still
ongoing. And secondly, interest rates have also been decreased -- have decreased
significantly since 3 years ago. So rate increase might be needed beyond the combined
ratio just to make the returns equivalent to what they should be or would have been at
the 95% historically.
So it's really an ongoing process of reflecting current investment yield. So there are no
targets on the combined ratio, but certainly target on a return basis . And I would agree
with the 140 to 150 bps decrease in interest rate that the combined ratio would
presumably mathematically need to go down to make an equivalent return.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. And then last question, you mentioned taking a cautious approach to
reserving within your mortgage book. And then I think you also laid out that default rate to
get to 5% to 5.5% by the end of the year. And so I'm just trying to understand like as the
default rate I guess, your expectations is it will go up a little bit from where it sits today.
And I'm assuming that you'll continue with the same conservative approach that we saw in
the third quarter. So how should we think about kind of the combined ratio? You've been
giving some metrics for how that business could trend. And you've obviously come in
better than expected in the second and the third quarter. Do you have an expectation for
how that could ultimately trend into Q4? And I'm not sure if you want to provide initial
color on 2021.

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Yes. I'll take that Elyse. I mean just to be pretty clear, I think I've -- as you guys all know I'll
take the blame. I did a pretty poor job of forecasting combined ratios or delinquency

Page 8 of 24

FINAL

rates over the last two calls. So I think we're trying to minimize those kind of bad
forecasts.
But listen, there's -- as we know there's a lot of uncertainty out there. Yes, we're
extremely pleased that the delinquency rates have come down, right? We had talked
about even just last quarter, we had said like somewhere around 8% by the end of the
year. It doesn't look like we're going to -- it's going to be as bad as that based on what
we know today. Still a few months to go but definitely saw some encouraging signs this
quarter.
So that's all well and good. Does it translate to -- what kind of combined ratio does it
translate to? I mean it's hard to know because again what we're facing is really we just
don't know how long this pandemic is going to last. And the fact that the forbearance
programs are at this point scheduled to end, but who knows if they get extended or not?
And how do people convert from forbearance to a regular delinquency? There's a lot of
unknowns at this point that we feel are extremely hard to predict and estimate.
So listen, we're taking it one quarter at a time. We're happy with where things are at right
now. Again, it's reassuring but we're not -- as I said, we're -- the game's far from over.
And who knows maybe hopefully even my 5% to 5.5% forecast or expectation for
delinquency ends up being a bit high. But we'll find out in a few months and we'll reassess
at that point.

Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. First, I just had a question on how you're thinking about pricing
reinsurance pricing as a buyer of reinsurance? And how should we think about your sort of
overall exposure, especially to cats as you're entering 2021? Are you, given better pricing,
you can hold more exposure? Or maybe should we assume that you'll keep your
retention sort of a similar and be a buyer of record regardless of prices?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Short answer is we don't know yet, right? I think we'll have to see what the one-one brings
to our reinsurance folks on the inward side and certainly on our E&S property. We'll have
to evaluate and assess what kind of exposure and what kind of margins we're getting
there and then look back and say, okay now what is the -- because buying reinsurance as

FINAL

you know is like, raising, it's like using capital. It's like we have to pay for that. So we're
going to go through a very straightforward analysis of capital usage and what we pay for
it.
And we take a very, very first economic view of the whole world, and specifically, as it
relates to the insurance exposure, we take on a property CAT exposure specifically. But
having said all this, we also have -- balancing it or adding to that information process is
that we also are careful and not over stretching the capital. So we'll always be buying
reinsurance to some extent. The question is what level and how much and at what price.
But clearly we are -- we like stability and we're always trading stability for sometimes
lesser margin, and that's going to be part of the mix.
But clearly, both markets where we can be on the advantage, we can gain both sides, but
we can actually get rate increases on the insurance side, find a way to buy reinsurance in a
good way. And on the assumed basis, we actually are benefiting from the improvement in
the market there as well. So it's really a holistic view of the CAT exposure. Too early to tell
what exactly is going to transpire, but everything is always up for discussion.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Okay. And then on Watford you raised the price. There's pressure on yield to raise it
again. And at what point does the deal become sort of uneconomic? And/or are you
already there? Or any comments on how you're thinking about that situation?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Well, I mean we didn't raise the price -- we did not raise the price, right? We have an
agreement, we have a signed agreement with Watford that we're starting the process to
get regulatory approvals et cetera. But yes, I mean there's another party that has come in
that Watford feels they have to look into their potential offer and what it all means to
them. But at this point what's been announced is what is still valid. Depending on what
they end up deciding, we may choose to do something different . But at this point we
can't really say much more than that

Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Focusing on the Reinsurance segment robust growth. Thanks
for the commentary, bullish commentary. If we look at the underlying accident the year

loss ratio I mean actually expense ratio too, so just a lot of improvement. Anything we
should be thinking about? Anything you want to call out? Or is a lot of this just market
conditions and operating leverage that you're benefiting from?

FINAL

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes. So the reinsurance group has grown tremendously. So the expense ratio going down
or what it did certainly is explained by that in large part. I think in terms of the loss ratio
what I would like and we said it on prior calls as well is we tend to look at reinsurance
performance on a 12- to 18-month basis. There's a lot more volatility in that segment, that
sector. There's also a lot of shift in the mix over time.
Our reinsurance folks do not tend to have a -- they have stable relationships obviously but
there is a lot of things moving on in terms of taking, seizing the opportunities in the
marketplace. So what I would look at the loss ratio is more like this is -- some quarters is
much better than others. And it's really due to the volatility in the reinsurance results. I
would say.

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. Got it. So the expense ratio, some of that's going to...

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Grow.

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. A follow up on the mortgage side. I think I heard you say earlier that ILN pricing kind
of had improved a lot. I guess I'm looking at -- we're trying to -- we've been trying to track
overall ILN pricing. And maybe you kind of you still see this double what it was prepandemic, but maybe I'm just looking. Maybe Arch's pricing is better, or maybe I'm just
incorrect.

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Yes. I mean, there's two parts there, right, is the structure, meaning in particular
attachment points and then the pricing. So right, so this is our third one, our first one of
the year,. Really we were the first ones out of the gate after the pandemic. The reality at
that point is appetite from the investors was not as good as it was in the past when our
attachment point was much higher. Second one attachment point came down with slightly
better pricing. And with this new latest one, we're effectively back to the same -- the 2.5%
attachment point that we had seen pre-COVID. So that's certainly a very good sign.
Pricing, if you risk adjust for everything, it's still up, no question. It's not at the same level
that it was pre-COVID, but it's not double for sure. So it's much better than that much
lower than that. And quality of the book is better so how does that get factored in? And
so there's a couple of other things that it's hard to make it perfectly apples-to-apples. But
directionally and on an absolute basis as well, we're very happy with where things are
going.

Okay. Got it. That's helpful because I think that you're describing it to me better than what
we've thought. Okay. And lastly, sticking on mortgage, hopefully -- you said you -- the
delinquency rate doesn't tick up as much as you thought. But are you -- it's almost
November now, are you -- have you seen over the last few weeks, the delinquency rate
tick up?

A - Francois Morin

So last few weeks, it's been actually keeping in the same general direction that we saw in

Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 21718992 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. Two questions, one just to understand accounting, and the other one is
about Watford. On the accounting you had a decline in delinquencies due to cures of
6,000 approximately but you took up reserves, I know you can't really reserve for loss
that hasn't happened yet, but it looks like you're reserving for these new claims at about
$12,000, $13,000 per claim compared to a historical average of $4,000 to $5,000 per
claim. Am I doing the math correctly? And can you explain sort of how you think about that
in the books? I think in the first quarter you also took up reserves more than typical
because you can only take them up when you have claims. But can you walk through that a
little bit?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Yes. No question that we bumped up reserves this quarter on effectively the
delinquencies that we saw in the second quarter. So your math is correct. I mean that's -- I
mean the reserves per delinquency, you did the math right. But what you need to adjust
for I would say is call it a reserve strengthening exercise that we went through just to
reassess where we were, took a hard -- every quarter, we take a hard look. And our view
is that might as well not -- be cautious knowing what we know and knowing what we don't
know.
So think of about a $45 million adjustment on reserves in the third quarter for effectively
Q2 delinquencies. So once you adjust for that, I think you get back to claim levels or

Page 12 of 24

severities that you would be -- would be more in line with what maybe you would have
expected.

FINAL

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 21718992 <GO>}

So along those lines is there a reason to believe that the severity of the losses are going
to be different than historical severities? I can understand because there's (a lot of )
frequencies and you can't really take frequencies until you get a claim. But is there a
reason to be more cautious surrounding severity in this pandemic?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

We don't see it. With the -- the only adjustment obviously that what we're reporting in our
supplement in terms of paid severities is lower than what we're seeing from the new
delinquencies, right? New delinquencies, we mentioned it last quarter at about a $65,000
or so per NOD. This quarter it's right around $60,000. So I mean it's certainly higher
because it's more recent loans that were -- that are going delinquent versus what the
loans we paid on in the quarter.
So that's the only adjustment. But in terms of percentage of the insured value or the
insurance in force, or the risk in force we don't, at this point don't have a reason to think
that it's going to be materially different than what it's been in the past.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 21718992 <GO>}

Okay. And then on Watford, we don't know how it's going to turn out. But your own stock
trades around book value. The offers for Watford around 0.8x book. I'm not sure and
maybe you've done some thoughts on whether Watford a better investment at 0.8x book
than Arch's that 1x book. But if you don't buy in Watford, it would suggest that you have a
chunk of excess capital that you were already allocating towards financial uses. Can we
expect that your interest in buying business you already know is attractive even given the
market opportunities here?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I think, we made the point clear by putting our offer up there and that's pretty much what
we will leave it as, Josh, I think we are -- we think still -- we still think that Watford is a good
platform, valuable platform. And we'll see how things shake out.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 21718992 <GO>}

But clearly Arch is a more valuable platform than Watford. If you're willing to buy in
Watford stock, shouldn't you be willing to buy in Arch stock as well?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I think the answer is always yes. We're always looking at the possibility of buying our stock.
And certainly like I said before, five players on the court I think that the share repurchase is
really -- is attractive, as you would expect me to say as the CEO of the company.

Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I do want to start by thanking you for
giving a basketball analogy, so I can actually understand what's going on. I was worried
you'd give a hockey analogy. My first question goes to the slight increase in COVID losses
in the quarter. Can you maybe talk about what drove that, specifically? I guess specifically,
what I want to get at is does it have anything to do with the FCA court case over in the
UK? And how you're thinking about your overseas business interruption exposures?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. I mean it's really in two parts I think in the -- on the insurance side it's very much it's all
basically related to our travel book in the U.S. So no connection to the FCA ruling. And the
little bit we added in the reinsurance side is around property exposures, mostly out of
Europe. So it's a little bit of a BI angle to it, but that's pretty much it.
So I mean it's -- I mean I call it a bit of, just new information coming in, nothing -- no,
nothing kind of no material new information that came through that would have caused us
to revisit our picks. And the FCA, as we said we didn't change it. And the ruling where it
stands it's we're still very much -- we had fully reserved for it. And there's -- again, the
ruling doesn't change our position on that.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

The rest of the portfolio, Yaron, for what it's worth and we mentioned that on prior calls is
that we have the vast majority, almost the totality of our parties have the exclusions that
would protect us somewhat from a deviation. So this is nothing in there to really think
about.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Okay. That's very helpful. And then my second question, when you talked about the
improvement in the accident loss ratio for insurance, you didn't talk about favorable
frequency. So is it because you didn't see that? Or is it because you didn't book that?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

It's a little bit of both actually. We saw some of it -- some improvement on the frequency
of claims possibly in the second quarter. That was definitely a difference. But if you
Page 14 of 24

FINAL

neutralize for the obvious lines of business where claims would actually naturally go down
such as travel for instance where there was a lot less exposure or go up. Then if you
neutralize all of this, we didn't see a discernible change through the nine months of this
year. It's hard to see what the natural rate would be, but we don't see a discernible
change in the frequency to speak of. And really, we put our reserve pick and our loss pick
based on long-term trend -- long-term averages.
We're not looking at specifically one quarter at a time and one even accident year at a
time. We do get in the mix of multiple years and project out, much more on a longer term
expected. So it will take a little while before we would recognize any significant
improvement in frequency of claims, if at all.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Got it. And then maybe one final very quick one on Watford. If the deal does go through. I

rate headwinds. If -- let's say you guys have almost 30% of your assets and essentially

FINAL

government bonds. Looks like your portfolio yield is sub two. We just heard another
Bermuda competitor today say that their new money yield is 2%. It would seem to me
given how you're allocated and given your current portfolio yield that there actually
wouldn't be that much incremental yield headwind moving forward actually. Arguably if
you're going to move out some of the govies and take some credit risk will actually seem
that maybe you could expand your portfolio yield? It doesn't sound like that's right, given
your commentary. But I'm just kind of trying to understand like why does Arch continue to
be incrementally exposed to this low rate environment given the fact that you guys have
already really take it on the trend in terms of where your, yields at now.

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Yes. I mean we've -- no question we've been defensive on credit. So yes, we have a bit
more on the treasury side that you are right I mean unless rates keep going down but
they seem to have stabilized I guess for the time being. Our play in the last few quarters
has been trying to as many others I am sure have done the same is try to find other
opportunities that are more in the alternative space that provide us still some level of
investment income without taking on too much risk.
So something we keep looking at but it's a bit of a challenge. There's not a ton of
opportunities out there. We're not -- we're worried a little bit. We're defensive on credit
still and that's something that we look at carefully. We don't want to over-source ourselves
there either.

Q - Geoffrey Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

First question, and I appreciate the added color around the MI reserving. If we make the
adjustment, is the math correct that you changed your incidence assumption up to of
about 9%?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Close enough. 8% to 9%, yes. Yes. And our view on that is that we feel like that the more
recent NODs are may be prone to a bit more stress. So the fact that these people took a
bit longer to go into delinquency may tell us that there may be again, subject to more
stress, but again time will tell.

Q - Geoffrey Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

And is that 9%, is that a -- just an overall number? Or is it a blend of just as an example 6%
on forbearance and 13% on non-forbearance notices? Do you delineate between the
two? Or is it just more of a holistic approach?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

It's more of an aggregate approach that we take. Yes. We don't separate the two as
cleanly as you're suggesting, yes. We do like at all -- listen, Geoff, I want to make...

Geoff, I want to make sure you understand that we also do look at prior events prior CAT

Right. With the new ILN, a little confusing in the documentation. It looks like it applies for

Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks. Marc, I'm a little confused by something that you said. You're talking about the
five capital deployment opportunities and you cited the investment portfolio. And I guess I
would have thought that if you're going to be writing more P&C or mortgage insurance,
then the supporting capital will be in the investment portfolio anyway.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes. So you're saying that we should -- just repeat the question, Meyer, please.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

So I'm trying to figure out what -- how capital deployment in the investment portfolio is
distinct from capital deployment in either P&C mortgage.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Okay. Now I see what you mean. So the way we look at the underwriting returns is we
attribute to the units the treasury return or the risk free return. And we try and separate
church and state, what we call it internally. We actually credit the float on the insurance on
the underwriting pieces at the treasury rate level. And then we allocate the capital for the
excess over that to the investment portfolio. So this is how we separate the capital usage
between those -- between the underwriting unit and the investment unit.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. That makes sense. Got it. I'm trying to get a general sense of how you see either
profitability and property catastrophe in retro. Or your view as to whether the vendor
catastrophe models are conservative enough based on recent years' CAT activity and the
underlying trends.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, it's a good question, Meyer. I think that our position on this we have weather
scientists upstairs and we have a lot of lengthy experience and information to look at.
Listen, actually augment and modify the vendor models as we see fit. So the vendor
model represents to us a solid starting point. From where we can, there's definitely had a
lot of science into this one. So we have been historically using them as a starting point and
augmenting it and modifying it with our own view of the world.
But I would caution everyone by saying that yes, we do have a view of various perils and
various exposure around the world. And we also try to factor in shorter-term versus
longer-term possibly modification of what could happen out there. But it's hard to predict
those things. So what we tend to do is to hold ourselves to a higher return for those risks
that are inherent in the way we underwrite the business. That also helps explain why
where we've taken possibly somewhat of a more conservative approach to property CAT
exposure over the last 4, 5 years as you've seen in our numbers.
So I think -- and it's a year-on-year analysis, so we would look at it. And we'll evaluate I
think, in some of our discussion we had El Nio, La Nia and all these various discussions
happening all the time. And we're not the largest rider of property CAT, but we do have a
very the team looking into this. But I think we make it up -- try to make it up with holding
ourselves up to a higher level of returns.

Our next question comes from Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank.

Q - Phil Stef ano

{BIO 18965951 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Just one -- most have been asked and answered. One follow-up on
the MI piece and thinking about the increase in the default rate, I guess in my mind there
are three mechanisms to get there. It's either new defaults are increasing, cures are
slowing down or the denominator policies in force is shrinking. I'm just curious how you're
contemplating which of those levers is contributing to the increase in the default rate. I
think it helps us think about does this come through as losses or premiums or maybe
development if the cures are right.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Okay. So Phil, let me try and take this. There's as a lot of -- it's a big question, a lot of
parts. So first and foremost, the denominator is not changing a whole lot, right? It's about
a ($1 billion, $1.250 million) that's what it is in terms of policy. The DQ rate has decreased
Page 19 of 24



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2020-10-30

FINAL

this quarter right? It went from 5.1% to about 4.7% this quarter. So this is like what's the
number of policies at the numerator that are in default and you divide by a similar number.
So it did go down.
I think what we're saying in terms of reserving, you reserve for the new notices that you
received in the quarter, right? We received 58,000 in the second quarter. We received
20,000 this quarter. And what we're telling you is we take that, the book of these 20,000
new notices. The cures are the cure. They go away from the overall balance if you will that
we just mentioned which is the 4.7%. But the new notices we reserve for those in the
quarter. So we have to reserve in the quarter on those that were newly notified.
This is what typically you would do on a reserving. What we did in addition to this is we
modified our view of what we should have booked for the second quarter for the new
notices in that quarter. So I'm not sure -- I'm trying to sort of help give you a picture a
whole -- a bigger picture hopefully that helps you understand how we (reserve on al this).
Sure.

Q - Phil Stef ano

{BIO 18965951 <GO>}

No, I -- that makes sense from the reserving side. But the default rate is loans in default
that population over policies in force.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right.

Q - Phil Stef ano

{BIO 18965951 <GO>}

And if the policies in force isn't changing and the default rate is going up, then
presumably there's an expectation that new default is going to increase this quarter. And I
guess I just wanted to make sure that I was thinking about it correctly, because I -- to get
to 4.7% to 5% 5.5%, there must be an acceleration in new default or cures is slowing
down. I don't know. That's kind of the question.

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

I mean that's -- listen, it's a big -- I mean kind of top down view. It's hard to know. We don't
have -- we can't predict. We don't have the crystal ball on whether cures are going to
accelerate or not or slowdown and same thing with new notices. Again, we're trying to I
think just provide a bit of color that we think the -- obviously or knock on wood we're not
going to be at 8% delinquency rate by the end of the year. We're certainly well below 5%.
Does it go back to above 5% by the end of the year? That what we think could happen
but again we don't know. So I think if everything stays the same, the odds are probably
that it won't be at 5%. But we -- that's...

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

But Phil, you're right. You're right on your assessment that if we go from 4.7%, and we tell
you it's going to be 5.5% at the end that we will have to have an increase in NODs or
lesser cure. I'm not sure, we have made enough assessment as to which is which. I would
Page 20 of 24

FINAL

argue that we have tended to -- since May, we have tended to -- at least the last two
quarters, we have overstated the amount, the number of new NODs that we received.
And that probably is what would drive the potential. We just still don't know Francois has
said that we haven't been as good as we would have liked to be predicting. So I think the
new NODs would be more the place to look at.
Having said this, Phil, you also know that we had two things going on, less new NODs and
higher cure rate. So they both actually helped to manage the amount. And they helped
accelerate and actually go -- no help explain why we had a projection of about over 10%
earlier in the year to much less right now. They're two moving parts.

Q - Phil Stef ano

{BIO 18965951 <GO>}

by that mix shift versus just better loss picks?

Well, then -- boy, I don't think we parse out this way. It's still early in the game to see what
it's going to look like. I would say that it's probably more mixed at this point in time

play in that sector right now. It's more and more mix. I would say, Brian.

Q - Brian Meredith

it?

answer is, yes, we would most likely increase our participation but not to 100% and be
much less than that.
So increase little bit but recognize that we -- it's a different model that we -- others would
want to participate on with us as well.

Government and regulators take a little while longer than otherwise. But yes, it's on track.
And they produced, as you know, their results I believe earlier this week or early or late
last week. So it's also looking much better for them, which is good for us.

Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

I just wanted to clarify your comment on not losing the fee income on Watford. Is that just
because of the five years remaining on the contract, and so there's sort of a finite life to
it? Or was there something else that was behind that comment?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Well, I mean a question was asked if we buy the vehicle do we still retain the fees? The
answer is yes. I mean I...

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Yes, that it's an internal allocation then. But in case it goes to somebody else then that fee
arrangement stays intack through the lens of the existing contract.

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Yes, correct.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

So it's five years. Okay. And then does your approach to underwriting overall and how
much sort of capacity you have and take on in a given change if you own more of Watford
versus maybe if it does end up being bought by a third-party at a higher offer?

I think in a third-party environment Jim I think it's pretty clear that we need to take care of
our of our brethren as well as we could take of ourselves. So our view is always to do the
similar underwriting. Watford had a different investment profile which allowed us to do
slightly different things. But at a high level the underwriting is very, very similar. And I would
remind everyone that whatever we do on Watford we take 15% of it on a quota share
basis in the back. We also are participating on the capital. We had like we're up about 13%,
I believe, in our shareholding. So we collectively own something like 20% of the
underwriting. So we do eat our own cooking there as well, and it's really important to us.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Okay.
