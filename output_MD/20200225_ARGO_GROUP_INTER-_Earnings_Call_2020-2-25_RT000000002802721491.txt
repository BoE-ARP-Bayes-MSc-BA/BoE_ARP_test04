Good morning and thank you for the introduction Brett. Welcome to everyone on the call.
On today's call, I will review some operating highlights from the quarter, including our
views on the current environment. Then Jay will take you through the numbers of the
quarter and I will close by sharing some takeaways from my first quarter as CEO, and our
plans for the future, before we open it up for Q&A.
The pricing environment continues to strengthen, core product volumes are strong and
many business units have made a very positive turn into 2020. But at the same time, we
had substantial reserve strengthening in the quarter and full year, most notably for some
of our International businesses. We've recognize a group of specific claims and more
diligently to capture any movement in loss trends. Jay will share additional perspective in
his remarks. Overall investment results were good for the quarter and full-year and our
capital position remains strong.

Bloomberg Transcript

Since being appointed interim CEO, I've been fully engaged with my teammates in
reviewing operations and setting our game plan for 2020 and beyond. It's a work in
progress and it's a positive story. I'm thankful to the Argo team and to our producers and
insurance clients for their collective support.
The central message is that we have some excellent assets and a valuable competitive
position in the specialty commercial insurance and reinsurance arenas. We're going to
leverage our platforms to deliver on our financial objectives for our shareholders. So let's
first cover some key points for the recent period. After we talked through the closing
period of 2019, I want to come back and share some observations on the tooth -- on the
Argo Enterprise and our priorities.
Quarter four continued many of the results, we saw earlier in 2019, both positive and
negative. In the U.S. segment, we achieved the highest fourth quarter gross written
premium in Argo's history and the third highest quarter over all, ever.
Premiums were up 9% in the quarter, and 10% for the full year, and we continue to see
good growth opportunities in the market for most of our businesses. While our U.S
underwriting results for the quarter were disappointing for the full-year our U.S operations
had a combined ratio below 95, including the actions taken in the fourth quarter. We
believe the current environment and our capabilities provide us the opportunity to
continue to grow profitably. To be clear, we're an underwriting company first and we will
apply increased discipline and accountability across our organization to drive profitability,
so this is not just the top line story.
Back on the recent period most of our major business units in the U.S. experienced
accelerating rate increase during the fourth quarter and on average rates were up in the
mid-to high single digits across the U.S. segment. I would highlight professional and
property lines as both approaching 20%. Submission growth is also a positive story. In the
Page 2 of 14

FINAL

fourth quarter submissions were up nearly 20% from the prior year in our core growth
businesses and this momentum has continued into 2020, but that growth rate holding
steady through January.
Turning to the International segment. While we are clearly disappointed with the
continuing impact of prior-year development on the bottom line, we do see encouraging
signs in a number of business lines. We're applying the same fundamental strategy and
process that has worked so well in the U.S. to the operations across our International
business.
Gross written premiums in international, declined in the fourth quarter and were roughly
flat for the full year. This result reflects the remedial actions, we've been taking in several
business units, as well as in refining our risk appetite. Balancing that out our very strong
rate increases in several business lines, including property. liability and marine.
Overall rate increases across International continued to accelerate an averaged in the mid
teens for the quarter. While we are disappointed with our results for the quarter and the
full-year 2019, I'm optimistic about our future and our ability to capitalize on opportunities
in the market. I will now turn the call over to Jay to discuss our results for the quarter in
more detail. Then I will be back to share some thoughts on my first quarter as CEO and
plans for the future before we open it up for Q&A.

Bloomberg Transcript

Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Thanks, Kevin. As most of you already know two weeks ago, we preannounced certain
items related to our fourth quarter earnings. As a result, I'll focus my comments today on
providing more detail on the reserve actions taken and other key items impacting our
financial results for the quarter.
In the fourth quarter U.S. gross premiums were up 9%. Our growth was driven by positive
rate trends and strategic growth initiatives with strength and professional liability and
specially lines. However, our net written and net earned premium growth during the
quarter in the U.S. was muted. This was largely a result of additional reinsurance purchases
and a one-time ceded premium adjustment that negatively impacted net premiums.
The adjustment relates to updates to the amount due to certain third-party reinsurers,
along with estimated loss recoveries and commissions due from reinsurers related to
initial premium estimates a portion of which relates to 2018 balances, notwithstanding the
quarterly adjustment which modestly reduced the net retention ratio. Going forward we
expect net to gross written and earn premium ratios in the 60% range. Excluding the
adjustment earned premiums in our U.S. operations would have been up 8%. On the
International side our gross premiums were down 10% in the quarter and roughly flat for
the year. This was largely a reflection of planned reductions in certain lines of business.
As Kevin mentioned in his remarks, we are getting significant rate in certain business lies
within International and despite the movement in top-line we expect a smaller but more
profitable book going forward.

FINAL

Fourth quarter underwriting reserve -- results included reserve strengthening of $76.5
million or 17.9 points on the loss ratio with development coming from International, U.S and
Run-off segments. We like many in the industry have experienced changes in the loss
environment. We believe the reserve actions we've taken during 2019 have captured the
changes in the environment that we've seen today.
We conduct reserve reviews of all ongoing businesses each quarter. Our reserving
process has not changed and includes a feedback loop between reserving, underwriting,
claims and reinsurance operations that enhances our ability to react quickly to the findings
of the reserve reviews.
We book our reserves to best estimates, and we believe that we have reflected the
negative trends that have impacted our book over the last several quarters. Much of the
recent reserve development has been a result of the new information received relating to
claims trends across various lines of business, as well as rising claims severity, that has
been noted by several companies in the industry.

Bloomberg Transcript

We also continue to review our International business currently in Run-off, which has
resulted in additional strengthening. In International reserve increases, were related to our
Syndicate 1200, Bermuda Insurance and European business units. At Syndicate 1200,
reserve increases were primarily in library-- liability in Marine Lines and totaled $21.4 million.
Included in that number our certain large losses and increased attritional losses on a
program that was cancelled earlier last year.
Bermuda Insurance development was the other large contributor at $19.4 million and was
primarily due to new information on a few casualty claims and recent court settlements
that have in our opinion resulted in a need to adjust reserve for these claims. In addition, a
smaller portion of the movement was the result of adjustments in the professional book
on accident year 2014 and 2017. Reserve development in our European business units was
related to a few specific professional lines claims and incurred liability losses coming in
higher than expected.
In the U.S. reserve strengthening was primarily related to liability, property and
professional lines liability development resulted from actual losses coming in greater than
expected on accident years 2013 through 2017.
This liability business was related to the model line casualty cover we write in our contract
binding business unit and led to development of $24.3 million. Two things to note: Much
of the claims activity which drove for the need for this action that is in certain contractors
business we no longer write and during the quarter, we brought back in-house to claims
management on this business, which we believe, led to an increase in the level of paid
and incurred activity.
That said, we will continue to monitor this business closely. Property development was
due to an increase on prior year catastrophe losses from 2017 and 2018 events.
Professional lines had modest development related to movements on individual claims.

Page 4 of 14

Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity

Offsetting these, were smaller favorable movements in other liability business and in our
Surety business.

FINAL

Prior year losses also include the conclusion of Argo's annual review of runoff reserves
which resulted in a $10 million reserve increased primarily related to asbestos and
environmental exposures. We have commented on the process around the solution for
the Run-off business on prior calls. This continues to be a work in process.
In addition, during the fourth quarter, we reported higher current accident year losses
excluding catastrophes of approximately $30 million. The higher current accident year loss
ratio impacted both the U.S. and International segments.
In the U.S. the adjustment related to small movements in a number of units including
public entity, professional liability and property and in some cases was specific to certain
large losses. The increase in the current accident year in the International operations was
driven by increases to large and attritional losses across most of division's visions and
Syndicate 1200. And the increases in Bermuda casualty in Europe due to a reassessment
of the current loss ratio given experience on prior years. All in our current accident year
ex-CAT loss ratio was up 2.8 points from the prior year during 2019.

Bloomberg Transcript

We believe that the combination of current rate increases and remedial underwriting
actions taken will lead us to stronger underwriting margins going forward. In other words,
we believe, a portion of the 2.8 point increase, has been moderated.
Our reported expense ratio in the quarter was 42.3%. This reflected a number of items
that impacted both expenses and premiums, which drove the ratio higher. As I mentioned
previously, earned premiums were impacted by ceded premium adjustments of $22
million for the quarter. On the expense side, we had additional costs associated with a
reduction in workforce, an allowance for doubtful accounts related to our European
business unit and adjustments to underwriting expenses based on certain costs previously
allocated to investment functions and trade capital providers.
Together these expenses represented over $10 million of non-recurring items in the
quarter. The combination of the previously mentioned premium adjustment and expense
items negatively impacted our consolidated expense ratio by approximately 400 basis
points during the quarter and 100 basis points for the full-year.
Turning to investments, our portfolio continues to perform well with net investment
income up 16% during the fourth quarter and 13.5% for the year. In the quarter the
portfolio returned to positive 1.1% and year-to-date total was 6.9%.
This compares favorably the 2018 when we were down negative 0.6% for the year. During
the fourth quarter and into the new year we have moderately reduced our exposure to
risk assets. This change in strategy reflects our desire to simplify our investment portfolio
and allows us to deploy more of our capital to the underwriting business at a time when
we think that the opportunity is as good as it has been in years. This shift in approach

Page 5 of 14

could be a slight headwind to overall investment income and returns going forward
depending on conditions in the investment markets.

FINAL

I will now turn the call back to Kevin to share some thoughts on our business going
forward.

Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Thanks, Jay. Over the past few months I've taken time to assess Argo as a whole. And
with the executive team and our Board have been conducting a broad review of all of our
operations with a sharp focus on overall profitability and positioning Argo for the future.
The last few months have included a great deal of activity at Argo and I want to recognize
and thank everyone in the organization for the energy and speed with which they have
adapted to the change in leadership.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our employees have been resilient through the transition, while maintaining and
expanding key relationships with our customers and producers. As a specialty underwriter,
we provide solutions to customers that value our underwriting claims and risk
management expertise.
Generally, these coverages are not afforded by middle market and small commercial
carriers. This provides an opportunity for better returns for specialty insurers and for Argo.
We have built a solid foundation as a U.S. centric specialty insurer with deep expertise and
a reputation for both service and value. We are and will continue to focus on U.S. domicile
risks, this represents 80% of our premium today regardless of it being underwritten in the
U.S. or international markets. And it's where we expect to find most of our opportunities
going forward.
We know this market, that is our strength and it will continue to be our focus. Our current
businesses still have plenty of runway for growth. There are also many segments of the
market that we don't yet serve. Both of those factors represent untapped growth
potential for the future. We're studying and will consider entering certain markets, such as
Healthcare, Ocean Marine and Technology to name a few. However, we will approach the
new markets and the products with discipline and a focus purely on returns.
We must attract the right talent and have conviction that we can generate an adequate
return in a three to five-year time period. This is the same urgency and results-oriented
focus that has led to the success of our U.S. segment. In the U.S., we have constantly been
evaluating returns and opportunity in all business units. Since 2012, our U.S. operations
have exited or rationalized approximately $650 million in premium while nearly doubling in
size and keeping overall staffing levels flat during the same period.
This focused approach has allowed our strongest U.S. business units to receive additional
resources for growth, which has resulted in 11% compound growth rate since 2013 and
helped us to achieve a 91 combined ratio over the same period.

FINAL

Those are very compelling numbers and I'm optimistic we can apply the same principles
across the organization. A primary objective is to offer competitive products and services
for our customers and earn them adequate return on capital for shareholders.
We're not there today, and it will take some time to achieve that goal but I believe that we
have the foundation in place and a plan to improve our returns across the Group over
time. I'll have more to say about this throughout the year, understanding we need to
deliver near and long-term improvement.
For 2020 we anticipate a combined ratio of between 96% and 98%. Our enterprise today
is especially focused reinsurer and insurer. Underwriting and claims excellence are the
core of our DNA and will continue to be what sets us apart as an organization. That
foundation will not change under my leadership. As I mentioned, we have many attractive
businesses today that have been achieving returns in excess of our target. Unfortunately,
we also have businesses that have not performed at an acceptable level. There's far too
much capital and too many resources tied up in these underperforming businesses and
we will execute with timely decision making to repair or reduce the size of
underperforming or non-core business, some of this is already underway.

Bloomberg Transcript

Going forward, I expect the organization to be more focused and efficient, every decision
larger or small that we make will have our financial objectives in view. To achieve it we will
apply a theme of simplified reduce and eliminate across all operations.
We have already taken swift action in a short period of time to adopt these principles. And
over the last few months, we have exited underwriting operations in Asia and most of the
whole business, within Syndicate 1200. We've discontinued the regional underwriting
operations in Latin America. We've sold corporate aircraft and put certain corporate real
estate up for sale and canceled marketing and sponsorship contracts.
We also announced an agreement to sell Trident Public Risk Solutions. Trident is a good
business for us, but it's a better business for our partner and together provides better
growth opportunities for both of us.
We estimate that these actions as well as other expense related decisions in the last few
months will reduce our non underwriting related expenses by approximately 10% or $20
million to clarify it is not underwriting claims or the operations supporting both of them
that we're addressing there.
And this is just the first step in the journey to achieve better returns. It will help simplify
organization, reduce non-core businesses that were detracting from our overall
performance and eliminate some expenses from our organization.
We've also begun to -- a plan to deploy our capital more effectively. As Jay mentioned
during the quarter we reduced our exposure to equities and high-yield securities in our
investment portfolio. We'll will shift our strategy to simplify our investment portfolio mix,
which will reduce investment expenses and resources.

FINAL

It will also allow us to deploy incremental capital to our underwriting activities, where we
see the best returns and an opportunity to grow. We have more actions to report on in
future calls as we continue our review of our operations, but this is in no way means that
we are not focused on growth.
I believe Argo as a growth company and has significant opportunity to pursue growth
primarily in U.S. markets. We operate in a competitive environment. And as I know, you
appreciate we will continue to report to you on what we have accomplished and what our
data is telling us, rather than broadcast our strategies.
Some of the identified savings will be invested back into the business to enable our
growth and make us more efficient organization. That's the best way we can drive growth
and deliver an appropriate return on equity for our shareholders over the long-term.
Operator, we can now open the line for questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)
The first question is from Greg Peters from Raymond James. Please go ahead.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Good morning. A lot of comments to unpack. I'm going to focus on 3 areas, your top line,
your combined ratio guidance, and investment income. Lots of moving pieces around your
top line you specifically called out businesses that are being discontinued or are
discontinued and then at the same time, we're hearing of growth opportunities. Can you
give us an idea of what you expect the top line to look at -- look like for the full year '20, in
the context of how it looked for the full year 2019?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yeah. So, let me just address the first part of that question. First, which is that, we did get
out of some businesses. They tend -- the ones we've exited so far have been smaller.
Trident as I spoken to some people about earlier has been -- is a business that while we
have a strong franchise there, we have growth opportunities when it's operating as an
MGA that we didn't have, and we have a new partner that has new opportunities for us so
that the overall growth for the top-line is.

A - Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Yeah. Look I think, Greg, when you factor in the large business units in the U.S. like
professional liability, surety, construction I think we expect the top line will continue to
show positive growth.
Page 8 of 14



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2020-02-25

FINAL

My comment about the international business is smaller but more profitable business.
That's not a dramatic reduction in that business. A lot of the actions that you've seen, that
we've taken to right-size that business are already flowing through the top-line in 2019. So
I would expect further growth in the U.S. and I would expect kind of a flat outcome
internationally.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Thanks for that perspective. It's excellent. And then on the second segment of question
so a question would be around the combined ratio. So you said about a 100 basis points
of the nonrecurring charges accounted for about 100 basis points in your consolidated
expense ratio for the full year 2019. So should I infer from those comments that your
expense ratio on a consolidated basis improved by approximately 30 basis points or
when you reported 38.5% and so, then takeaway the 100 basis points at 37.5% versus
37.8%, last year. And how should I think about that in the context of all these moving
nonrecurring charges for 2020?

A - Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

That would be the math and that would be the outcome of that math. And I think it's not
an unusual. Sorry, I don't think it's not an unreasonable extrapolation to where we expect
that particular ratio to be in 2020. If I saw I'm trying to answer your question directly, but I
am not sure I did.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Yeah, I guess it's 37%, you're saying the 37.5%, but I would -- is it -- all right I'll leave it at
that. Is there a in your 96 to 98, is there a CAT load assumption that you're building in
there?

A - Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

There is, it's not that dramatically different than it's been in the last couple of years.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Okay. So just using the average of the last 3 or 4 years?

A - Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, yes. Last year was I think some of the actions that we took post '17 and '18
showed up and '19. Of course, it was lower CAT activity industry-wide. But I think if you
look back at the average of some of those years, certainly not '17, I wouldn't extrapolate
from that. But probably the average of '18 and '19 would be a reasonable place.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

All right, great. And now the final piece on the investment income so you're moving out of
some of the areas and sort of repositioning the portfolio, some of the areas that you're
pulling out of had positive returns on investment income. So I guess what I'm looking for is
some perspective on what you think investment income is going to look like for the full
Page 9 of 14



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2020-02-25

year '20, because if you're pulling out of some areas that had a positive effect on 2019
that might suggest a lower investment income result for 2020.

FINAL

A - Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

It might, that was a really hard one to predict. I think yesterday, as I was watching the
markets move and saw that the 10 year back down, I think it was a step back down below
130 or something yesterday, it was 140 million, but silly me. It makes it very difficult to
predict, but bear in mind that some of the shift might actually have a -- all things being
equal and all things aren't equal, some of the shift where we reduced some risk assets
sold some equities that would be reinvested in income producing. Those equities would
have been showing up as through the realized gains and losses. That said overall the rate
environment is still extremely anemic. So I don't see a lot of growth and investment
income in 2020.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

I have a number of other questions, but I'm going to re-queue. Thank you.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) The next question is from Jeff Schmidt from William Blair
Company. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jeff Schmidt

{BIO 15098244 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Question on the international book, obviously a ton of change going on
there. But I guess just broadly, do you feel the issues there really more related to limit
than price. And can you maybe just kind broadly discuss your limit profile there and if
there's changes that you're making to that?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. Thanks. It's Kevin. We have really 7 or 8 different segments
within international, and the only place that the limit profiles were large were in the
Bermuda insurance book and in some of the property businesses and all of those have
been like many in the market. We've been reducing our exposures on the property on
PML basis on a -- on the excess casualty and on the professional lines on a straight-up
limit basis.
We've reduced the offering size as well as what the in force totals are as well as getting
rate. So there's a lot of re-underwriting going on. Where the claims have come out as of
the excess casualty market those were large limits. But a lot of the stuff that came out of
Europe were 1,200 were smaller accounts that were just the volume situation, and reunderwriting address those so it's a bit of everything across the board.

Q - Jeff Schmidt

{BIO 15098244 <GO>}

Okay. And then a follow-up on expenses and it seems like the one-time items, the
downsizing and such were related to the international, I guess I was surprised to see the
Page 10 of 14



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2020-02-25

U.S. expense ratio flat after it dropped so much in '18, a lot of the discussion of the
changes that you're going to make. If they've been put on a hold or should we expect to
see that to continue declining on 2020?

FINAL

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yeah. So I had a discussion with the board over the summer about what we were doing on
the U.S. expense ratio, while I was still running the U.S. And I was happy where it was,
because the returns we had were good, and I wanted to keep investing in the technology
platforms for the business and in terms of the resources that were available to hiring for
some of our growth businesses and some leadership positions.
So I'm fine with that where it is. It's the areas that were not performing well in that, we
want to make sure we really address and areas where we have duplication. Some of
those still do exist in the U.S. or a mosaic of acquisitions and sometimes, they haven't
been completely integrated. It's more acute, outside of the U.S., than it is inside, but we
can take some of the opportunities to use those learnings across the organization.

A - Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. The other -- the only other thing I would add is as you think about the U.S. business
a couple of things that have been influencing that in the last 18 to 24 months, strong
growth in the surety unit. Perhaps a surprise from where we were a couple of years ago,
pretty good growth in Rockwood and those 2 business units have just by nature of their
design a higher expense ratio. So all things being equal that you get more margin but you
have a little bit higher expense ratio.

Q - Jeff Schmidt

{BIO 15098244 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Next question is a follow-up question from Greg Peters from Raymond James. Please go
ahead.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Great. So, let's circle back on the reserve charges and on your commentary about some
of the run-off. Can you give us an idea of what the outstanding claim inventory looks like
on -- in the areas where you've discontinued businesses, especially on the international
side, just to give us a sense that we're making progress, and there is positive light at the
end of the tunnel?

A - Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Yeah, Greg. I don't have that claim inventory on those businesses at my fingertips, but
we've been out of those businesses long enough. And when we saw the increased
information, increased reported claims, really started in the second half of -- well in the
fourth quarter of '18 and into '19, which led us during '18 and early '19 to cancel many of
Page 11 of 14



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2020-02-25

those programs. So I don't think -- I don't have the claim count handy, but I think things
have leveled off and I'm not expecting that. I'm not expecting a large increase in claims
there.

FINAL

Q - Greg Peters

I guess what I'm -- let's come at it a different way. So and I appreciate the fact that you're
not going to have some of the detail in front of you. You said the reserve process really
hasn't changed. And so in the 3, the last 3 quarters, you've taken reserve charges for and
some current business and also from some business, it's been discontinued. At what
point do you look at the fact that you're not staying in front of the reserve development?
And say we've got to change the process so we get to that point where we no longer
have this adverse prior development or prior current year development.

When I say that the process hasn't changed, I mean it's sort of fundamentally, the
structure of the reviews that we do, and who's involved and so on and so forth as well as
the actuarial methods that we use. That said, a lot of a lot -- some of what you see in the
fourth quarter is an extrapolation of that data is that we might have brought in the second
quarter was not a permanent change in pattern.
And so for example in Syndicate 1200 that number is larger in part, because we've now
extrapolated and assumed that the tail if you will on certain of those businesses is in fact
longer than we thought it was going to be. Good news here is some of that -- that's
mostly business that we've underwritten, some time ago, but what that gets reflected
into the number which then increases the size of the number.
So I don't want to suggest that we're not changing the approach, we're just not changing
the processes and the methodologies. The other thing I would say and perhaps I'm as
frustrated as anybody and that is we really have been getting additional information each
quarter that has surprised us Syndicate 1200 is perhaps the best example of that when
we looked at the data in the first quarter of this year, we were sort of spot on where we
thought we would be and that's gotten incrementally worse. That's not unusual -- perhaps
unusual, but it's not inconsistent with what other people in the market in London have
been experiencing. I can't really explain it in great detail as to why it would be happening
that way, but that is what we've seen, and so we're reacting live as the information comes
in.
And on certain circumstances, for example, where we took action in the U.S. we think that
part of that is I'm going to use the term self-inflicted but meaning it was our own, now
we've got our hands on the claims in that contract book deciding that we needed to put
up reserves perhaps a bit more robustly and perhaps pay some claims so that payable is
increased as well, that led us to react in that particular business line. So we're -- I think
we're reacting in a timely fashion to the information as we receive it.

Two other questions one is going to be the U.S. operations and then I'll just close out with
question on the products and that ongoing review. First on U.S. operations, as we look
through the press release and the announcement and some of your shareholders and it
talked with some of your shareholders. There was some concern with the higher accident
year combined ratio on a year-over-year basis, going from 90% to 95.4%. When I think
about sudden jumps like that, I have a tendency to revert back to just see full-year
number, which is only 90 basis points higher. How should we be thinking about that, that
calendar that the current accident year combined ratio, especially in light of what
happened in the fourth quarter?

A - Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Well, I think we already addressed that, I hope we did I'm happy to talk about it again. But I
think we addressed the expense side of the equation. So if I go back to the current
accident year non-CAT loss ratio and as I said in my remarks, it was up 2.8 points over -for the year, and I think that's really the way to look at it because there's enough moving
parts in any given quarter that it's hard to extrapolate that quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

But we think that, and then I would refer back to Kevin's comments, almost 20% in some
really big businesses for us, in terms of rate increase. And then, a lot of underwriting
action, that's been ongoing, not just in the last 90 days, but for the last 18 months. So we
think, a portion of that 2.8%, will have been recovered if you will, or would have been
moderated by rating, and by underwriting.
So put those 2 together kind of are back to and I think answering your question of where
the current accident year combined ratio should be. I don't think you should take Q4, nor
do I think you should take 2019 as the starting point for 2020 on the current accident year
non-CAT loss ratio.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Got it. Final question for you would be the ongoing review of NEO perks compensation et
cetera. I believe the SEC is involved I think obviously, you're not going to announce
something today. But maybe you can give us a sense of how that process is evolving are
we closer to the finish or any comments on that would be appreciate d?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yeah. So the investigation is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating. And that's all I can say
at this point. I mean we're closer than we were 6 months ago but the timeframe is not
ours to decide.

A - Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

We will have regulatory filing. Sorry. I was just going to say Greg, we will we will be filing
our proxy in the next couple of weeks. And I think you'll be able to gather some additional
information, I would think from that.
